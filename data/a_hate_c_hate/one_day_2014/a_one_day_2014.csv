Mar 28 2024,positive,this was such a beautiful love story anne and jim were perfectly cast and their chemistry and dynamic were spot on i absolutely loved them as the leads i did not read the book but this movie will have me read it i dont understand the tepid response but often the book to screen translation can leave readers feeling shorted i personally love a nontraditional romance this one feels very real in how it developed in my opinion this movie is one of my favorites as a simple beautiful reminder of the preciousness of time but also how timing is often more powerful and incontrollable even with soulmates
Mar 10 2024,negative,i loved the series especially the short half hour episodes but it was too sad for me i wanted a happy ending for them a baby etc  left me feeling really dowwn after finishing it
Mar 1 2024,negative,i actually liked it up until the very end just doesnt make sense
Feb 11 2024,negative,its not bad but very rushed its one of those books that doesnt work as a movie but as a series
Jul 25 2023,positive,really good movie with a great story one of my all time favorites right mix of love emotion and comedy
May 16 2023,positive,the movie is entertaining but as the years go by you see that the reason they put them without being together until the last few years but it hurts more in the final part for both protagonists her in his absence and for him suffering for everything that it happened to her but remembering the best years with her but she leaves us a lesson for life that maybe they will put us like this
Feb 27 2023,positive,in my case this is one of the movies where the imdb and rotten tomatoes had the lowest rating but after watching it it was one of the best romantic movies till date i have watched
Dec 9 2022,positive,traumatic film but you will connect with this more if you are in the mood to watch a conversational drama it will feel like true pain and true love at the same time
Dec 1 2022,negative,for me one day lasted all week until there was finally some genuine conflict towards the end hathaway has a terrible accent throughout and sturgess is just kinda a whiny brat the whole time instead of growing up their friendship turned romance isnt convincing
Jul 22 2022,negative,i love watching anne hathaway but this is one of the worst romantic movies i have ever seen predictable storyline from start to finish and all the drama could easily have been avoided if one of the main characters had made a logical decision at any point in time the only reason i didnt give it one star is that anne hathaway still managed to give me a hard on
Apr 18 2022,negative,for a romantic film there was near no romance it played out more like a very mediocre drama
Apr 11 2022,positive,annual snapshots of two parallel lives how things turn out that could have turned out differently a realistic movie
Jan 4 2022,positive,i love this movie  it is one i like to rewatch
Oct 10 2021,negative,love anne hathaway but she couldnt carry this stinker
Jul 7 2021,positive,episodic and choppy but full of little surprises and a surprising real connection between the two leads anne hathaway is excellent and jim sturgess a good faux hugh grant the ending is not so credible so perhaps this should really be 35 stars but nevertheless this is definitely worth watching when you need a little escape
Jul 3 2021,positive,only just watched this film and am currently still crying  was definitely a journey and a half but the tone of the story and the depth of life which happens in between a romantic relationship was depicted so accurately and raw   a rollercoaster of emotion of life poured out into the writing and bravo a real life love story heartbreak healing time anger aging regret the reality of our foolishness exposed stereotypically in black and white but not  i love this thankyou and  bravo david nicholls
May 13 2021,positive,despite its horrible tomato score i absolutely love this film i think ive watched it a billion times and i always feel like its my first time
Jan 26 2021,positive,it can tug at the heart strings as you empathise and relate to it its not trying to be clever and is pretty straight forward and i like that the way it is delivered is something i relate to as it wonders through life and takes me to moments in my life i am not usually a big fan of romantic films but this one did get me for me it is an under appreciated film
Dec 5 2020,positive,having never seen this movie before or read the book i decided to give this movie a go and was not disappointed i loved this movie you get to see one day each year of emma and dexters life as their bond evolves with clear feelings for each other that show they want to be more than friends it has in a good way frustrating moments life seems to take them in directions where they seem to miss the availablity of the other in a romantic sense but they always gravitate back to each other this said it does lead to a statisfying point where they do finally come together then the story takes a turn for the worst in a tear jerking moment considering the behaviour of dexter is earlier parts of the story this leaves you really feeling for him the story turns to dexters tale of trying to get his life back on track as he falls into his old ways i feel this is a believable story of how life has its ups and downs this is a great what if story
Nov 8 2020,positive,its not a perfect movie far from it but whenever i watch one day i feel all the feelings the film shows us
Nov 7 2020,positive,i mean yes the movie is super good it made it even rememberable because of the tragedy but viewer giving that shock wont really give it a good rating
Sep 9 2020,positive,i hated it at the beginning but got more into it as the story was folding not a masterpiece by far but it actually packs some emotion and by the end i couldnt help but feeling sorry for the tragic ending
Aug 3 2020,positive,i loved this movie sure its not the most original story or a movie that will change the world but the way its made the decomposed story and the actors just blend together perfectly in a moving romantic film
Jun 16 2020,negative,overly melodramatic and deeply unsatisfying only hathaways performance keeps it above water
Apr 15 2020,positive,love this movie so muchhhh
Apr 10 2020,positive,this romance film following the complex and everchanging relationship between the two main characters emma  dexter was a sweet tragedy that had me laughing and by the end sobbing overall i enjoyed the film and its take on the complexity of relationships anne hataways accent was at some parts unbearable but overall i would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good romantic movie or needs a good cry sesh
Apr 8 2020,positive,one day is the story of two friends ann hathaway and jim sturgess who meet in college and we see them on the same day for over eighteen years it is an emotional journey and the two leads are great some people found problems with hathaways english accent but its not too bad and does not distract or take the viewer away from the film at all
Mar 20 2020,positive,broke my heart will break again
Jan 27 2020,positive,great movie and music i like it more than the book if you are not a native english speaker more reasons to watch it in the latin version
Dec 15 2019,positive,loved this movie anne hathaway and jim sturgess are a pleasure to watch great onscreen chemistry funny in places especially emmas comments and refusal to be dexters doormat and dexters machinations and selfdestruction as he slowly grows to understand that emma is one of the best things in his life yes it is also very sad but the way the movie ends is lovely the movie score by rachel portman is also wonderful because i enjoyed this movie i bought the book to read
Nov 21 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie loved the book i think they did a good job condencing the story line for screen
Oct 27 2019,positive,puzzled by the negative reviews  but this movie offers a funny romantic story that doesnt follow the formulaic standard that we are used to  there girl isnt awkward and clumsy she doesnt fall   when shes trying to be sexy there isnt an obligatory gay sidekick that offers comic relief its genuine funny brutal and charming all at once and leaves you pondering on it for days afterwards  love it 
Sep 13 2019,negative,what seemed to last forever finally took its landing with an unexpected emotional turn that left me wishing even more i had never taken the chance 
Sep 1 2019,negative,would have given zero stars if allowed do not watch it will rip your heart out and empty out your tear ducts almost walked out but would have been a driving hazard due to my eyes no longer working only watch if you want to forever be suspicious of anne hathaway movies 
Aug 9 2019,positive,one day is the movie that makes me feel more emotional than any other one it is clearly underrated and obviously misunderstood the movie has so many messages to tell and people only focus on it 90s fashion both the protagonists look great in their roles and the movie is as touching as it should be
May 6 2019,negative,pretty horrible datenight movie i get the existential point it was trying to make  but honestly didnt care for it
Mar 25 2019,negative,this movie is awful please dont waste nearly 2 hours of your life on it like i did listen jim sturgess didnt do as bad as i was expecting but anne having to endure her attempt at a british accent for the 86 minutes until she gets slammed by a garbage truck is worse torture then having to sit in jail for the next 20 years i was so upset after watching this that i made this account just so i could write this single review other then this i may never use this account again i have never thought someone getting slammed by a garbage truck was funny in my life until this movie which somehow made it almost comic if you want a good laugh watch this i guess otherwise please dont
Feb 1 2019,positive,good for the brokenhearted 
Jan 12 2019,negative,dumbest fucking movie about the crazy beautiful smart and wonderful emma anne hathaway falling for the stupid rich complete fuck up and spending her entire life waiting for him while he fucks around and is a miserable human this is the kinda movie that makes good people think that shitty assholes will eventually come around and somehow the writerdirectorproducer act like this is romantic absolutely terribly movie that is bad for humanity
Dec 23 2018,negative,hold on this was awful who directed this honestly i have to say this is worse then the videos middle schoolers make for health class teaching nutrition or some shit ill give this one thing i liked the scenery it was pretty that is it the acting was shit the story was shit this was just was just fucking aids to watch damn this movie made me sign up just to write a negative review on this there was no chemistry it was not romance way to quick and fake and unrealistic damn whoever directed this should just quit work at kmart or winco lord have mercy on the entire waisted time i spent watching this the director was probably going through some tough shit to create this movie hope your doing well just dont watch this movie thanks happy holidays
Dec 19 2018,negative,boring predictable horrible british accent from anne hattaway
Nov 13 2018,neutral,although it was fairly romantic and thematically peculiar enough to hold ones attention it was also at times emotional whiplash and cringeworthy still the key characters have noteworthy chemistry here and they are just too cute to entirely pass up i must say the scenes where jim sturgess hair is worn long make me shutter hes not one who looks very becoming in that hairstyle i mean he just looks like a bum off the streets    c  55
Oct 29 2018,positive,apart from the sad endingthis movie was exceptional it embarks a journey of two young kids who behold life in front of them with their ups and downs to showcase how beautiful yet malicious  ones life can be
Oct 21 2018,positive,a very pretty and charming movie of its own kind however it fails miserably to capture the essence of the novel by nicholas sparks the ending makes me wipe away tears everytime still i recommend at least seeing it but reading the novel first
Sep 24 2018,positive,might see it again one day
Aug 22 2018,negative,anne hathaway is a great actress but this movie wasnt a good choice for her imo it was uneventful and drug on
Aug 17 2018,positive,not as bad as the scores suggest good chemistry between the two and a bit sad in places worth a watch
Jul 19 2018,neutral,strange film not entirely sure it was an even a good idea for for story anne hathaway is great but the male lead is just a little irksome
Jul 15 2018,positive,even though it is a slow narrative it captures the essence of real love and the struggles of it
Jul 4 2018,positive,i have no idea why some people are leaving negative comments about this film the best romantic movie i have ever seen
Feb 23 2018,positive,this movie made me cry harder than any other movie even the notebook it is slow in some parts but if you watch until the end you wont regret it
Feb 14 2018,positive,20180215 in viet nam ill see this firm again
Aug 13 2017,positive,its one of few movies which make me cry so hard
Jul 14 2017,positive,20170714 dex is a jerk for most of the movie but overall it was ok
Jun 2 2017,positive,when what we see early in our relationship with some people we see that we invested way more of our time and energy of somethings that never saw us as much as we do when we see we can tolerate so much live separate lives free to bask in life but still intersect and mingle like friends when we only seek each others company for different reasons when we see that we enjoy each others company in happier times sad times and for sexuality purposes but never for love when we see that we dont see eachother in that institutional way as one enjoys the trends and freedoms while others wanted a family norm early to see what life brings to us in the future when we see our pasts are behind us but others are unhappy with what they see to separate when we see we know who are better half is when we always go there when we are broken and alone when we see we can carry our past life with us wherever we go and always see what we always could see who sees right through us and is our better half when someone sees us for who we are that no one else can see but us we see we are meant for each other when we see lifes twists and turns take us to different life stages in our live to lose something and then get back again to not see something to see it once again to appreciate it even more when we see we are in happier times to lose it all and dwell into our older happier times and realize how lucky we are to have a second chance but really blind and stupid to realize it too late when we see we let so many people down when we suppose to be there but choose to be some where else to care when we see we wasted so much time on someone whom waited for us to see us the way we do to see how much we had it good to have someone see us that way in which we never been seen like that before when we see we have a second chance at other loves to see how we do when we pass down what we see in love to the next generation when we see someone truly adore us in that way to be so honored that they express the love we feel for someone we long to express when we are both lucky to have each and experience eachother the way we did to see we really found our better half
May 27 2017,positive,havent got a bad word to say about this jim sturgess and anne hathaway are both excellent the concept and way its put together along with the filming are all outstanding its a very believable romantic drama with a hint of virtuoso comedy
Apr 17 2017,negative,the viewers are surely lost halfway the lead roles take you nowhere flat with zero emotion two people screw up their lives and life screws them back when they finally get along
Mar 26 2017,positive,a must see movie i really enjoyed it
Mar 5 2017,positive,one of my favorite movies
Mar 1 2017,positive,reminded me of the film love rosie but with a new twist and confusing by the endingfriendslove meet othersget together355
Dec 8 2016,negative,a slow romance that fails to captivate an audience anne hathaway is one of the best actresses of our time but her and sturgess just feel flat in one day there was just a lack of flow from year to year and the poorly place flashbacks didnt help while it is a slow buildup there are a few bright spots  especially the latter portion of the film
Nov 18 2016,positive,it has an indie film but high quality to it good plot but pay attention itll be easy to lose track
Aug 5 2016,positive,the colors the atmosphere the story never mind the bad reviews its a movie that is simply lovely
Jun 14 2016,positive,such a beautiful story
Jun 4 2016,neutral,promising idea which just wasnt utilized well the biggest drawback here is the screenplay
May 23 2016,positive,its infuriating but its also lovely in its own romantic oddball way perhaps dysfunctional but i still felt emotional invested and couldnt help but root for the characters
Apr 6 2016,positive,the story of 2 people who met in university and came best friends the film shows just one day july 15th over the years and how their lives change mistakes are made and they still remain friends was a good story and even got my eyes leaking at the end
Nov 29 2015,positive,one day told a story about friendship and love after the graduation ceremony dex wanted to find a girl to play with him but he met emma a girl who wore a big glasses and seemed like very boring thats maybe what we called destinyemma and dex met but just became friends they talked about everything literature daily life common friends sports foods family and so on except love they companied with each other for 10 years during this time emma changed the job  fighting for the life and experienced a failed relationship  while at the same time dex experienced the mothers death a job which is meaning less and a failed marriage they also argued and said never meet again finally  they found the person they really love is each other      this story sounds like silly a fool boy played with many girls and finally found that the ture love is his best friend emma however this silly point touched my heart is there really a pure friendship between a woman and a man whether the dex still went to find emma if he had had a happy marriage and a pretty good life dose the soulmates really exit but love always combine by many coincidence you will finally choose a person who you could find safety and warmlove is always a eternal topic no matter in the books or moviesa good movie in my eyes is that not only tells a good story but also leaves something we could think and talk one day tell a successful love story not romantic but reality
Nov 3 2015,positive,my sister wanted to watch this film which i didnt care about watching it and just watched it for review reasons and i actually enjoyed it anne hathaway is really great and so is jim burgress their chemistry is terrific and is one of the best parts of the movie the plot is really not bad and the script is really good its very interesting but it gets sappy at times the movie does needed more depth in it which wouldve make the film more effective it has some shocking moments in it which my sister found predictable which was a bit funny to me one day is a really good movie that is trying to have some meaning to it even if it didnt live up to the full experience
Sep 27 2015,positive,loved this movie anne hathaway was my main reason for watching and she did an outstanding job
Sep 6 2015,negative,wowwowwowso so so so so badman this is such an awful messy messy movie 2 watch it is so so so so dreadful it is such an awful movie 2 watch it is so so so awful movie 2 watch it is so so so dreadful it is so so so dreadful it is such an awful movie 2 watch it is such an awful messy movie 2 watchwarning this movie contains strobe lightning effects throughout this movieman this is such an awful movie 2 watch it is such an awful messy movie 2 watch it is such an awful movie 2 watch it is such a bad movie 2 watch just avoid this movie at all it is such a bad movie 2 watch just avoid this movie at all costs it is that badjust do not watch this movie it is so awfulits got a good soundtrack throughout this moviebut man this movie is so so so awful 2 watch
Jul 24 2015,positive,dont believe the critics  this is a beautiful and timely paced movie with mixtures of romance humour and sadness  anne hathaway plays the witty spectacled english rose geek to perfection and dexter played by jim sturgess plays the selfish wealthy charmer who believes that the world is his there is a deep beauty about this film that not many will get but i did
Jul 5 2015,positive,this movie is just beautiful it evokes my emotion i didnt understand why the girl was so in love with this playboy but i was happy to see his change and them finally getting together but the accident came i all of sudden started to think that maybe people are not supposed to be together with their most loved ones that is dangerous one can become so emotional so careless for oneself and so obsessed anyway this movie is very interesting and most of it pleasing
Jul 1 2015,neutral,it definitely has its moments and has a wonderful premise but its mostly dull and forgettable
Jun 22 2015,positive,not as bad as people are saying yeah it had its moments of bad acting but at the end it was good anne hathaway is one of the good actresses out there it was a good idea of how they told the story of every year a good film to just watch once as that being said this movie deliver some memorable parts that happen in real lifeand also the performances from the leading roles especially from anne hathaway was were great so for that i give one day a c
Jun 13 2015,positive,predictable and superficial
Jun 2 2015,positive,reminiscent of the french film love me if you dare sans the game and the alternate ending great to watch if you are looking for a tragic love story jim sturgess does a great job developing his character throughout the movie and at the end you cant help but feel a mixture of anger and sorrow for him for wasting his life away instead of accepting what he had known all along
May 31 2015,negative,one day is an emotional ride that seems to just stay on one solid straight track the entire length of the film which is disappointing given the talents of the cast nice cinematography and a beautiful score as with many hitormiss romanctic dramas one day fails to offer us depth or connectable characters
May 29 2015,neutral,having read and loved the book i knew i would be disappointed by the movie it was okay it just didnt have the same emotional impact as the book
May 5 2015,positive,the book its so much better it didnt  do justice 
Apr 22 2015,positive,this was not just another romcom it was far more than that this film was about friendship failure love and loss it was about growing up and growing and changing together it was also surprisingly melancholy and devastatingly sad but so worth seeing
Apr 15 2015,negative,depressing and sad but also shows the underlying message that true love is meant to be but also that its not perfect
Apr 15 2015,positive,a sweet story of companionship and the strange directions lives take it seems to be undervalued by critics the characters are interesting and the plot takes a number of surprising turns
Mar 29 2015,positive,this ones definitely a crier 
Mar 20 2015,neutral,wow what a slow moving movie with some of the most unlikable characters
Mar 6 2015,positive,painfully truthful look at how our silly heart leads us without any logic as well as an accurate pic of the pain of living a  rudderless life and the fallout from it    i loved the hope this is given for the hearts to win out and peace found from finding ones self in the middle of so much pain   personally one of my favorite films in a some time
Jan 20 2015,positive,the movie started well then became boring and the end was simply confusing and disappointing
Jan 2 2015,positive,poignant and truthful
Dec 31 2014,positive,i love this movie the viewer grows a connection with the and follows them through their emotions and growth its a beautiful piece of art and relatable to the viewer
Dec 6 2014,positive,this movie is incredible its one of the most realistic movies ive ever seen and there is a great underlying message even apart from the beautiful love story the directing is magnificent i cant even begin to explain how passionate i am about this movie
Nov 27 2014,negative,this movie was almost sweet it took me so long into the film to care about anything going on and then spoiler alert she dies that is such an overdone plot twist that it makes me hate it more than i should probably i also had a rough time with the concept of them meeting one day every year but really it more of a yearly glimpse into their ongoing lives which is also much less compelling anne hathaway i expect better on a side note your make up artist should either be fired or given a raise for making ou a classic beauty almost i recognizable homely
Nov 21 2014,negative,ugh wouldve been bearable if it werent for the awful horrible ending boo
Nov 20 2014,negative,avoid this film like the plague  it is in my list of the 10 worst movies of all time  this alleged romantic comedy is neither romantic nor comic  consider the premise the two main characters finally start talking to each other the day before they graduate from college at the last minute the already adoring ann hathaway gives him her phone numbers and although they have said to each other after a brief roll in the hay that is an after thought they are only meant to be friends i knew youd know the entire world would know that they will fall in love before the movie ends but waitit takes from 1988 until sometime after 2000 for this to happen oh these snappy little empty folks meet up once every few years or so to tease and needle each other about their endless difficulties at finding love or meaningful employment at one time he is a tv celebrity for a horrid kitchy show while she is a waitress at an awful mexican restaurant  then as things happen in such movies years later he is without work while she is a successful teacher  he marries a blonde bimbo left over from his tv show while she lives with a boring slacker who also worked at the mexican dive but dreamsfor over 10 yearsof making it big as a standup comic  this is all pathetic  of course there are endless moments when the two almost kiss when they both reveal their feelings for each other but then the movie would end too soon as clearly the screenwriters had no idea for a story other than these two sappy cuties just cant get their emotional act together  the actors are all maudlin their acting is maudlin the dialogue makes you believe you are watching a spoof on the genre wrong this movie tries hard to be sincere  we are supposed to fall in love with each of them root for them dislike the bimbo and the lousy comic because they are the main stumbling blocks to the love that should of course finally bloom  when it does about 34 of the way through you choke on your tongue roll your eyes and issue of sigh of relief the bimbo by now is an adoring and classy exwife i neglected to mention she and the perfect man had a kid together thus the shotgun marriage which only lasted a few years whereas anne has finally giving the heaveho to mr comic slacker  the stars align  well i have to admit the next part  took me by surprise  just when the happy couple have married and start to talk about having a baby anne goes and gets herself run over by some vehicle and dies harumpf poor  hubby  we get one scene of the pathetic puppy lying on the marriage bed looking forlon and lost and i didnt feel the slightest bit of empathy for him  well he goes on to makeup with his bimbo ex to become a model father for his perfect little daughter and even gives a heartfelt hug to the dumb comic  and then we flashbacks of how cute the main characters were together in earlier times gag  this film is akin to being waterboarded with gallon after gallon after gallon of honey im trying to get the sticky feel off of my mind
Nov 18 2014,neutral,2755  a span of 15 years or so of two characters who are friendsmaybe loversand the whole twist of that between a man nf a woman as they mature interesting enough realistic and just emotional enough anne hathaway and jim sturgess both do a great job
Nov 10 2014,negative,this was a shitty movie and i liked it
Nov 2 2014,positive,a touching story with a beautiful score impeccable makeup and captivating characters that really grow on us as we catch up with them once in a year for such a long period of time  although it is just a pity that in the end it reuses a typical melodramatic cliché of romances
Nov 1 2014,negative,review in a nutshell    lone scherfigs one day attempts to bring a fresh take on the romance genre but her execution ultimately ends up being similar to rob reiners when harry met sally my statement may seem off as when harry met sally is a romantic comedy while one day takes its story and its romance quite seriously but the way the film progresses and the emotional chemistry that scherfig draws out from her leading cast the resemblance is quite on point though i doubt anybody else would agree with me on this i have stated many times in my reviews that it is not hard for me to get sucked into a romantic film and there were a number of moments in this film where i actually cared for and felt the emotional connection of its characters but the film fails to bring anything important to its delicious coating and there were certain passages of the film where it attempts to add texture to its characters but instead they came off as forced and out of place what reiner and writer nora ephron did right for when harry met sally was the spotlight on the difficulties of the opposite sex remaining friends which i felt is a genuine predicament in our society and on top of that the film pokes fun of it which balanced out its strong romantic vibe the films musical score was actually a delight to listen to and it fits in with the variety of emotions that the film goes through which is genius props go to the films composer rachel portman for achieving this one day had the potential to sweep me off my feet with its strong performances and excellent romantic and friendly chemistry but due to issues in scherfigs direction and lack of purpose it was difficult for me to completely be drawn into the films precious romantic relationship
Oct 26 2014,negative,review in a nutshell    lone scherfigs one day attempts to bring a fresh take on the romance genre but her execution ultimately ends up being similar to rob reiners when harry met sally my statement may seem off as when harry met sally is a romantic comedy while one day takes its story and its romance quite seriously but the way the film progresses and the emotional chemistry that scherfig draws out from her leading cast the resemblance is quite on point though i doubt anybody else would agree with me on this i have stated many times in my reviews that it is not hard for me to get sucked into a romantic film and there were a number of moments in this film where i actually cared for and felt the emotional connection of its characters but the film fails to bring anything important to its delicious coating and there were certain passages of the film where it attempts to add texture to its characters but instead they came off as forced and out of place what reiner and writer nora ephron did right for when harry met sally was the spotlight on the difficulties of the opposite sex remaining friends which i felt is a genuine predicament in our society and on top of that the film pokes fun of it which balanced out its strong romantic vibe the films musical score was actually a delight to listen to and it fits in with the variety of emotions that the film goes through which is genius props go to the films composer rachel portman for achieving this one day had the potential to sweep me off my feet with its strong performances and excellent romantic and friendly chemistry but due to issues in scherfigs direction and lack of purpose it was difficult for me to completely be drawn into the films precious romantic relationship
Oct 23 2014,positive,even its got a lot of poor ratings i cried a lot in a long timei really liked how dexter learnt a life as getting older and emmas persistent strength and sweetness  
Oct 19 2014,positive,some problems early on but a satisfying conclusion
Oct 18 2014,positive,this movie was much better than i expected especially from the ratings it received i think it is under appreciated magnificent story
Oct 12 2014,negative,pretty much a british version of the ubiquitous nicholas sparks movie complete with the horrible ending that makes no sense  it was slow moving and the relationship leaves you totally incredulous  we needed something to put on during our sunday afternoon nap  this sleeper filled the bill nicely
Sep 28 2014,negative,i couldnt get passed the first 15 min what with anne hataways cringe worthy accent and feeble acting
Sep 24 2014,positive,well that was unexpected
Sep 13 2014,positive,this is a great movie now keep in mind i did not read the book and so had no preconceived notions going in  and frankly hadnt heard of it at all     without expectation i found it realistic fun and especially moving the story of these two is one youll want to follow and though it perhaps is tipped early as to the destiny of these two you still want to see their twist and turn route     i think what it does most of all is serve as metaphor for anyone watching causing you to reflect on your life and the small choice that have led to your current circumstances     that and it implores you to be grateful     watch
Aug 21 2014,neutral,not as good as the book
Aug 17 2014,positive,at first i thought this was going to be pretty bland with jokes here and there and the usual story for the most part it was but 23 of the way through it gets pretty emotional which is usually what were looking for when watching these types of movies a connection between two people
Aug 12 2014,negative,omg i am so in love with what she wears the rest is just painfully dragging
Aug 11 2014,positive,a touching romance that succeeds largely due to the likable chemistry between sturgess and hathaway the story structure is very engrossing and you await each new july 15 to see if these two will end up together much like when harry met sally hathaways accent is not very consistent as a brit but she does okay and jim sturgess is always pleasant to watch the problems really lie with the central characters who arent given much depth and you dont really understand their motivations to be nasty peopleheadoverheels in love there is a very sad although expected moment near the end that was handled extremely well and put a lump in my throat but its fairly common in these types of films overall i did enjoy it and i can always get behind a romance if theres more at stake than finding the perfect guy but once its over you wish the characters had been written stronger and the film was tighter
Jul 24 2014,negative,hd to stop watching after 20 minutes the sun tan lotion scene i ran out of buckets to throw up in  and i wasnt buying this platonic relationship
Jul 22 2014,neutral,im not at all sure whats not quite right about this or indeed why it so very nearly works    jim sturgess and anne hathaway give their full commitment to their characters however sterotypical or unlikeable him or soppy and cliched her they can be     it seems to try and survive on a series of classic tunes that signpost us to the passing of time and while some scenes work beautifully its also way too long  quite an achievement given that its already under 2 hours    its infuriating no posh boy from england refers to his boxer shorts as underpants melodramatic and manipulative yet also at times very funny touching lovely and moving
Jul 17 2014,negative,its painfully dull to watch two romantic leads with no chemistry
Jul 6 2014,neutral,the book is excellent you really care about the characters this somehow doesnt transfer to the screen version its fine but you dont really get to know them and and on screen dexter is a hard character to like i did feel very aware of the acting which is never a good thing
Jun 29 2014,positive,this has to be my all time favorite movie soon as you get over the ok accent by hathaway this journey that we share with emma and dexter is simply joyous and romantic do not think you know what is going to happen until the rolling credits and be prepared to be taken away
Jun 19 2014,positive,i never read the book but this movie was a great movie overall
Jun 1 2014,neutral,emma anne hathaway your wedding invitations are scented   dexter jim sturgess lavender   emma anne hathaway no dex money they smell of money    this film was actually okay despite anne hathaway and her attempt at a british accent which i dare say wasnt all that bad but her role could have been played by a more deserving and talented british actress like say felicity jones the real reason i watched this was because of jim sturgess who always delivers a great performance sadly although he was good in this film it wasnt his greatest performance i liked the story though it reminded me of a similar film same time next year with the ubber talented and charismatic alan alda probably a better film too nonetheless the story was interesting and the conclusion was very satisfying overall it really wasnt a bad film to check out once but once is all i can take because i cant stand watching anne hathaway
May 30 2014,positive,pretty good movie a little dry but also a beautiful love story good acting good story very sad
May 24 2014,positive,not a perfect movie but loved it so much
Apr 23 2014,positive,this movie made me bawl the first half was slow and i thought dexter was a dink and she could do far better but then when they finally got together and made it work she dies how sad is that after all that time i couldnt help but cry like a child 
Apr 18 2014,neutral,do i have to wait almost 90 minutes so they finally get together not really i guese
Apr 17 2014,positive,an amazing movie with a great musical score ignore all naysayers because it is a mustwatch
Apr 10 2014,positive,it was okay anne hathaways accent is terrible its not something ill be coming back to again and again or recommending to my girlfriends
Apr 4 2014,negative,never going to be as good as the book but pretty poor really
Apr 2 2014,positive,aw it made me kinda sad in the end
Mar 22 2014,neutral,better than many  but the end seems to rather let it down moving unnecessarily into the telegraphed territory of melodrama where none was required it could have been more without the sign post big finish  until then it totters along not comedic or notably dramatic and perhaps then quite small in nature but not in a bad way while the span of years is central to the story i would concur with other comments seen that the disconnected isolated time spots which make up the film seem an unnecessary gimmick more likely to detract from engagement with the story and its characters
Mar 18 2014,positive,i only watched the movie because anne hathaway  the story is touching but you finish with the feeling that something is missing
Mar 17 2014,negative,failed to built the moment bad choice with the ending because thats just make the good point is fade away
Mar 16 2014,negative,follows the lives of dexter and em only one day out of each year the date the two ended up sleeping together after college graduation this movie was painful to sit throw because the movie has nothing to enjoy at all
Mar 15 2014,neutral,nice enough for the cinema but in reality there is way too big a timeframe covered in very little screen time with only snapshots of their relationship in between  the relationship reality is farfetched but it works and only works as a film
Mar 13 2014,negative,possibly the worst adaptation of a book i have ever seen committed to film it jumps from point to point far too quickly and possibly due the idea behind the book which i think is excellent too many very important aspects are missed jim sturgess is bad and hathaways accent is yet to be determined as it changes so much lesson no1 to filmmakers not all books can be adapted to screen
Mar 9 2014,positive,this movie is beautiful could have more content from the novel but really what movie couldnt   i love the story and whew jim sturgess yum 
Mar 5 2014,positive,one day is a sweet and moving romance movie that i liked for the most part i thought the movie presents an interesting concept about revisiting two characters on the same day every year for twenty years this method of telling the story is effective because it kept my interest in some of the middle sections the movie starts to become a slight drag and the pacing takes a hit however i liked the characters all the way through and i thought anne hathaway and jim sturgess did a solid job playing them the storylines felt realistic and the characters are flawed its a movie that touched my heart and kept me invested even when the story occasionally lost my interest
Mar 2 2014,negative,the movie reduced important events in the book and became a plain conventional romantic drama
Feb 19 2014,negative,if one more chick flick comes out like this i am going to be sick
Feb 16 2014,neutral,starts very good but decays slowly later
Feb 5 2014,positive,spoilers included    i dont understand the bad reviews the critics on rt have really high standards one day is a beautiful and highly emotional film which even got me on the verge of blubbing and i dont cry much i really enjoyed the book and the film is just as good i liked how the film stays faithful to the book one day is based on the novel of the same name by david  nicholls the story is about emma morley played by anne hathaway and dexter mayhew jim sturgess who meet on the night of their graduation on july 15th 1988 dexter and emma couldnt be more different emma is a smart hard working working class girl whilst dexter is a womanising posh boy who has everything given to him nevertheless emma and dexter strike up a platonic friendship that spans over many years each year the films documents where they are in their lives on july 15th as emma and dexters friendship blossoms is there simply more to their friendship is what they want most right in front of them    the film is so well acted with good performances from its leads even though anne hathaways yorkshire accent is a bit off at times youve got to give the girl points for trying i find anne hathaway always gives an honest emotional and refreshing performance jim sturgess was really good as well and really good looking   but on a serious note he portrayed dexter really well and showed a lot of emotion there were also brilliant performances from patricia clarkson and rafe spall patricia clarkson has to be one of my favourite actresses shes just so likeable and gives such warm and honest performances i also love rafe spall i found him really goofy and funny he reminds me a bit of david walliams actually     i thought the whole story was really touching and poignant the whole way through the music was really beautiful too and really matched the tone of the film this is a really good romantic film and there arent many romantic films out there that i actually like with the exception of titanic and breakfast at tiffanys the only frustrating thing for me as an audience member was that it takes so long for dexter to realise the emma is the one its long come on mate what took you so long you and emma are perfect together however its refreshing to see that romance does develop out of friendship i personally think that being friends first is better rather than jumping straight into dating as you get to know one another so much better emma and dexter are there for one another through thick and thin and stay in contact so faithfully i think that sometimes love grows out of maturity as well dexter for a long time is very immature and doesnt know whats good for him emma and dexter remind me of the friendship between kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio everyone knows theyre in love with one another and that they should get together already    all right enough rambling for now this is a truly sweet and moving film with strong chemistry between the leads and an original story this isnt a romcom so dont expect the film to be all cheesy and happy this film is actually quite sad just to warn you and a bit depressing its still a lovely film but watch it when you feel like seeing something more serious ignore the bad reviews this film got on rt the critics on rt are probably too macho to show their softer side and want to impress by liking overrated and crappy film this might not be for everyone but dont overlook it because of its reviews is all im saying    grade a
Feb 3 2014,negative,not even watching catwoman in her underwear could save this boring damp be drizzled rag of silliness and sleaze from the dustbin of tedium
Feb 2 2014,positive,romantic and yet tragic talk about timing in life its worth watching just once
Jan 18 2014,neutral,you feel a little bit lost right now about what to do with your life a bit rudderless and oarless and aimless but thats okay thats alright because were all meant to be like that at twentyfour
Jan 16 2014,positive,i need to speak with someone not just someone you
Jan 2 2014,positive,i love emma as much as i hate dexter aha a beautiful sad love story and i havent read the book but i expect the book will be so much better and one more time anne hathaway is amazing 
Dec 26 2013,positive,not horrible but a bit pathetic anne hathaways character is a bit too desperate and forgiving dexter is a major loser true love at what cost the movie gets exciting and dreadfully predictable at the very end dexter reverts to his old ways without any redeeming lessons learned
Dec 22 2013,positive,thats right i liked it
Dec 21 2013,neutral,the end kills the movie
Dec 20 2013,neutral,watchable romantic film
Nov 29 2013,positive,a moviein which mah brother starred as an extra with 5 secs of screen time
Nov 27 2013,positive,beautiful romantic but tragic
Nov 24 2013,positive,pretty interesting concept following the relationship between two people by dropping in on them on the same date each year for as long as they know each other i thought they did it well and although there were some low points each time the year changed the story could move in different direction that was more interesting the ending comes out of nowhere but all in all this one is pretty satisfying
Nov 17 2013,negative,completely and utterly fucking ruined an amazing witty clever book
Nov 8 2013,negative,a movie that makes me lose faith in anne hathaways choice for scripts all i learned from the movie is one should be very careful when riding a bike in the lanes
Nov 8 2013,positive,one of my favorites story well said transitions made good color correction great specially the color feeling in the 80s decade by decade the colors change many people critic the dates typed in the movie but its an importance to tell the date to know what day is and being july 15 theyre important date
Nov 7 2013,positive,plotsummaryafter one day together  july 15th 1988 their college graduation  emma morley anne hathaway and dexter mayhew jim sturgess begin a friendship that will last a lifetime she is a workingclass girl of principle and ambition who dreams of making the world a better place he is a wealthy charmer who dreams that the world will be his playground for the next two decades key moments of their relationship are experienced over several july 15ths in their lives together and apart we see dex and em through their friendship and fights hopes and missed opportunities laughter and tears somewhere along their journey these two people realize that what they are searching and hoping for has been there for them all along as the true meaning of that one day back in 1988 is revealed they come to terms with the nature of love and life itself  my review  alright so let me get this straighttwo best friends sleep with each other in college and every on this one day they met each other and eventually i dont know get married or something cause they sure didnt get married in the film one day is a good film with one annoying problem to me and that would be anne hathaways accent other then that the story is quite nice brings something a little new in love stories but still doesnt hold on interest to me
Nov 5 2013,positive,it was okay funny in places and a good realistic storyline
Oct 12 2013,neutral,simple but not original story hathaways performance is good but the movie leaves a deja vu feeling from other stories fall and redemption stories
Oct 8 2013,positive,so sad like city of angels
Oct 6 2013,positive,a very romantic movie
Sep 29 2013,negative,i felt no connection with this movie couldnt even sit til the end
Sep 24 2013,positive,very well acted by both main characters that you can truly feel the romantic bond between the two im impressed that anne hathaway can still play an undergrad and actually looked like one although just a drama it does make you think about the story for days after that
Sep 21 2013,negative,i really liked the book this was based on but this movie lacked emotion and chemistry blech
Sep 20 2013,positive,i enjoyed the plot until it got to dex getting married   it was all a downhill cliche with a sad ending i object to such endings
Sep 11 2013,negative,a promising script was ruined by haste lack of chemistry and ann hathaways awefully fake british accent
Aug 31 2013,positive,okaythis looks familiar 
Aug 27 2013,positive,not bad for a romantic film i can see how the book is probably better havent read it though as books usually manage to portray people using more than 1 dimensions oh well good enough of an effort i suppose
Aug 19 2013,positive,i love this movie
Aug 10 2013,negative,an education is much much better scherfig another european sell out to hollywood this movie  is  argh hathaways accent sent shivers down my spine oh please please please
Aug 8 2013,positive,maybe it was just me but i thought this movie was great
Aug 1 2013,negative,this movie was downright boring and uninteresting very disappointing since this movie was cast well
Jul 15 2013,positive,3 stars       didnt expect this film to be sad  the bit where he is crying in bed gets me kinda boring movie though
Jul 9 2013,positive,really loved this movie i have a huge crush on anne hathaway now i didnt really like the ending though
Jul 5 2013,positive,great except when it comes to ending
Jul 3 2013,negative,a twohour infomercial for the necessity of safe bicycling techniques
Jun 17 2013,negative,this is a story chronicling the lives of two friends em and dex on the same day over the course of 18 years   a long term connection between two friends is a romantic notion but it isnt very well executed in this film  by trying to jam in 18 years worth of storytelling in less than 2 hours the scene shifts are abrupt  characters arent well developed and key life incidents are simply glossed over  hathaway is likeable and quirky and she really helps lift an otherwise awkwardly developed love story
Jun 13 2013,positive,i love the idea of the story really touches your heart and it surely deliver certain emotions unfortunately it seems not so real in life the story is just so tragic and not so in to peoples life the length of this film is just also a problem but for the pictures it should be given a credit
Jun 11 2013,positive,such a tops movie i just wish the ending wasnt so sad
Jun 7 2013,positive,sturgess and hathaway are stunning in this film their performances definitely contribute to pass to the audience the complex intense and love relationship between the main characters one day has an appropriate soundtrack and lone scherfigs direction is very beautiful this movie is full of drama and quite sad too so prepare your tissues
Jun 1 2013,negative,found this film really boring
May 14 2013,negative,problem here is theres just nobody to root for all the characters are annoying and by the time they turn that tide it is far too late pity
May 11 2013,positive,really nice movie a great love story nothing surprisinguntil the end a good moment
Apr 28 2013,positive,the story is about emma and dexter played by anne hathaway and jim sturgess who meet on the 15th july 1988 which is their graduation day they develop a close bond that lasts forever and since then their relationship is experienced on the same day over the next two decades in their lives as the years go by they slowly separate and head for different directions due to their life and career paths but the true meaning of that one day back in 1988 is then revealed when  they come to terms with the nature of love and life itself this movie is an incredibly original storyline it feels like an adaptation or a historical feature without being one considering thats how realistic it was i was expecting something new from this story but i was never expecting something this amazingly sweet if you want to watch this movie remember to keep your eyes glued to the screen and your ears plugged to the soundbox or else youll be missing a lot one day gets a 9510
Apr 24 2013,positive,very very good little bit weird movie full of not funny and lame british humor which makes one laugh just from how antifun it is nice story the way emma gets hit by car stays in head like a stamp that was just shocking liked it
Apr 24 2013,positive,i recently sat down with my husband to watch a romantic film something we rarely have time for these days as were always trying to empty our sky box of the weekly tv series that collect there little did i know how awful id feel by the end    the premise is a clever one we follow the lives of emma and dexter by checking in with them on the same day every year beginning with their college graduation in 1988    its a classic boy meets girl girl desperately wants boy more than she lets on years of frienship follow until that one faithful moment    my husband and i were enjoying the movie the character development was well done you began to really feel for emma and dexter    well nobody told me it was one of those sad tragic films the last twenty minutes or so came as quite a shock not that im completely opposed to sad movies or anything i guess i just didnt feel it was a necessary plot development for this story i agonized over what the writer and director were trying to tell me what lesson was i supposed to take away  love is fleeting live in the moment dont let your life pass you by    usually a moment of profound sadness in a film can be justified for the sake of the story i just didnt see that as the case this time around why not have a noncomedy feel good romance for a change do people feel that all dramas must inflict some sort of anguish upon the viewer    it was a good movie for the most part i just wish i could rewrite the last part i wouldnt turn it into something tidy and cheesy but id allow the audience to just feel good
Apr 20 2013,positive,love story set on the same day in successive years of a couples friendshiprelationship based on a popular book its nothing special and the script fails to sparkle its fine but no more than that
Apr 18 2013,positive,decent thanks to the believable chemistry between the leads
Apr 15 2013,negative,left me feeling empty and unfulfilled sorry for all of the characters etc etc
Apr 14 2013,positive,the ending can be better lil bit
Apr 13 2013,positive,drags on for quite a bit but you can tolerate it
Apr 13 2013,neutral,juss lack the romance btwn the leading pair 
Apr 5 2013,positive,i absolutely loved this movie i have become a fan of anne hathaway  she was astonishing i have to admit i have become obsessed and watched the movie about 10 times in the last week extremely well cast and just a great story over all brought up a lot of emotions my favorite movie now  i dont think anything else could top it i felt for the characters and how you care and love for someone but there is something missing the timing was just wrong or it was right but the characters werent developed yet into who they needed to be just perfect i give it 10 stars everyone should watch this
Apr 5 2013,positive,i must be the rare few who really liked this film i have not read the book but when compared to the directors other work italian for beginners i think this film is immensely superior and a marked improvement to get a film rolling with two characters and other side characters that come and go i personally was extremely impressed by the whole film i enjoyed it and was mezmerized by it
Apr 3 2013,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen truly
Apr 3 2013,neutral,pretty slow interesting in partsfriends who actually love each other go through different phases of lifethis romance was missing clearlythe similar kind of story was shown amazingly in the before sunrise seriesokay kind of movie
Apr 3 2013,positive,it made me cry so bad
Mar 29 2013,negative,after being let down by the book i was hoping anne hathaway would restore my faith  although the performances are fine the film itself skims far too much out of the text to make it remotely fulfilling
Mar 28 2013,positive,heartbreaking end one of the best love story anyone could ever produceimagine to live
Mar 25 2013,positive,i havent read the book yet but most likely i will when i have the time so my review will most likely be base on the movie only and nothing from the book itself warning spoilers ahead maybe     the movie itself was very nice in my opinion and the main cast chosen for it seems nicely chosen even though some may say anne hathaways accent was bad but in my opinion her accent was ok it wasnt that terrible nor was it that good and through out the movie there are some parts were i would be all loving it and there are some parts where i just wanted to stop watching but i managed to watch until the end and i wouldnt be surprised if ill watch this movie again in the future but this movie did somewhat reminded me of the notebook but with the main roles switched and some added personalities here and there so this movie is more for those who love romantic movies with a touch of tragedy and comedy ive been sorta writing about the good parts of this movie now im going to start talking about the things that this movie somewhat lacked i somehow thought that this movie was somewhat predictable i mean from the start i kinda knew that they will either not end up together and both of them will live at the end or that they will eventually end up together and one of them dies and i was right the eventually did end up together and one of them died i was shocked got kinda teary but didnt spilled any tears then another thing i didnt really think was a good quality from the movie is how it seemed somehow rushed i mean its like a bunch of episodes squeezed to become a movie that less than two hours i know they had to do that but i dont know i didnt really like it done that way it kinda ruined the moments that was suppose to be there     not sure what else to write so im ending it there sorry if this review sucked its my first review and hope its useful for you and if it isnt then sorry again anyway thanks for reading 
Mar 23 2013,positive,i was quite bored middle way but just couldnt say no to the finishing touch of the authors seat for me thats the best moment of this movie you have to cherish every good moment you have right now
Mar 21 2013,negative,like the book banality beyond belief abounds throughout still there are elements to enjoy  anne hathaways accent is a comedy fiesta and that denouement wow splat worth a few rewinds
Mar 21 2013,positive,a tragic love story that is a little light on love but heavy on the tragic p
Mar 19 2013,positive,whatever happens tomorrow weve had today
Mar 18 2013,positive,i didnt hate it as much as most critics but its not one of my favourite films ill try reading the book one day
Mar 14 2013,negative,there was nothing to see but anne anne hathaways disguises
Mar 9 2013,negative,the book was better than the movie but thats not saying much
Mar 4 2013,positive,most reviews seem unfair this is a sweet movie that is worth the watch especially if you are a fan of either if the actors good mix of sweet and sad with a mostly truthful eye for life and romance nothing profound or amazing but not bad on the whole
Feb 28 2013,negative,that was one of the dumbest dam movies i have watched so far in 2013 and since 2013 hasnt been going for that long ill say for 2012 as well wow 1 hr and 42 minutes of boring stupid shit i found myself saying please skip more years
Feb 25 2013,negative,great concept bad outcome
Feb 24 2013,neutral,only okayrather lackluster and i hated the ending the whole point of romance is the happy ending
Feb 22 2013,negative,i couldnt sit through it from start to finnish i think the film could have improved but it didnt gaze my attention enough a very slow moving film indeed
Feb 16 2013,positive,i wasnt anticipating much but was very surprised at good it was very well done
Feb 10 2013,positive,first of all why not cast british actors for british characters especially if they cant fake a decent accent to save their life im talking to you ms hathaway    on the other hand the only thing that saves one day from a subpar rating is the likability of their two leads jim sturgess may not be the best actor in the world and anne hathaway just cant sport a decent british accent but theyre at least two young actors you kinda enjoy watching  its also a pretty diverting film time goes by pretty fast and im by far no one who can resist a good romcom but after all one day is just mediocre fun    beside the totally improbable story theres so much sparkling itd be impossible that they dont come together for such a long time one day suffers from its one narrative gimmick the fact that it only shows one day of the year in the lives of the protagonists it ends disjointed  the characters are not very innovative either shes bourgeois and prude and he is by 1993 the narration starts in 1988 when they graduate college as pale as one of these guy from twilight which means sex drugs and rocknroll it doesnt let out any other romcom cliché either    but then there comes this one scene at the end that actually caught me by surprise and made me pay attention again i guarantee you this little film doesnt end as youd expect it  with some good will this saves the film from a negative rating and ill reward the brave narrative twists and the way lone scherfig who has made way way better movies approached the bestselling novel which i of course havent read this is not a recommendation though dont waste your time on it unless youre a sucker for cheesy romcom fare
Feb 6 2013,positive,a movie i hate but love of course
Feb 3 2013,negative,brilliant movie poster makes you think that youre about to watch an amazing romantic drama but id honestly say dont bother i only enjoyed a solid 20 minutes thats all and probably that was the last 20
Feb 2 2013,positive,i actually really like this film and shocked to see the reviews on this one jim sturgess and anne hathaway are both stunning in it and the chemistry between them is amazing apart from all the things they and they alone carried the movie sturgess especially surprised me because he is able to portray dexters character that ranges from a carefree playboy to a sad sad man and to a loving father and husband the movie shows that sometimesthrough all of the whirlwindlife love and friendship endures even through death
Jan 24 2013,negative,hated it  watched it because i love most things anne hathaway has been in  but this story was terrible  then to kill her off that was the worst  how could a slimy guy like him deserve such a great woman as her character portrayed  dont waste the money to rent this one
Jan 23 2013,positive,excellent performances all round a totally unexpected triumph highly recommended
Jan 21 2013,positive,the chemistry between anne hathaway and anne hathaway is amazing but the story sfuffer for not give a little bit more of  the key moments in the other way the movie is touching and so interesting the final scene have an unexpected twist but the story is so mature to deal with this situation and give the audience a satisfied taste at the end
Jan 20 2013,neutral,one day is just an average movie it has its ups and downs but everyone can be able to enjoy something about this movie what id like to say is that at first they started with love and other drugs then no strings attached now one day and friends with benefits i mean it looks like these four movies are trying to create a new genre or should i say a subgenre of romantic comedies we always know at some point that love is going to get there sometime but well even though one day had that sort of concept im still able to say that this movie had a clever plot and it was also a good movie do i recommend it yeah but well its nothing but a forgettable romanctic comedy but its really just average theres lot of things in this movie that you can like about but theres also much other things that you wont like about like the fact that its predictable sometimes its boring sometimes it has some clichés in it but whatever one day was an average movie but i can still say that i liked it girls will defenitely like it but me and probably other people well just stand in the middle sow watch one day if you want its not a total waste of time but still not the best way to waste your time i only thing some of the only good things from this movie were the acting the plot the sondtrack and not much else i just liked it average movie    lone scherfig did just a good job she showed us a diferent kind of directing and i can say that she did an okay job anne hathaway takes the lead role she was good i enjoyed her acting she was able to play all kinds of things and she was able to show again that she has talent anne is known from rachel getting married get smart rio love and other drugs and some other movies jim sturgess was good here he showed that he deserves to be more often on the screen cause he sure has talent jim is known from 21 across the universe the way back and some other movies patriciaa clarckson was just okay here thats all patricia is known from shutter island the green mile friends with benefits vicky cristina barcelona and some other movies sow as you can see this movie has a good cast and the two main actors really seemed to give all the talent they got i think anne and jim showed very talent and not just very talent i think they had a nice and visible chemistry what makes me think that they picked the actors very well good cast    emma anne hathaway and dexter jim strugess meet at their college graduation now since there every year during that day they both are sometimes happy sometimes sad sometimes heading to the right direction sometimes not even though emma and dexter just decided to be friends are they soul mates twenty years two peolplewhat i thought about the plot i liked the plot there was little of friends with benefits theme but still i can consider the premise smart and good the plot was good written and it shows that the real book is probably a nice book but they could have did a better job with this interesting story instead they didnt do a that good job but they still did an acceptable movie i just think that they were able to make an amazing movie out of it it was loaded of clichés and predictable things what im saying is that it contains a few great things in it and they could make a better movie with this plot what im saying is that the movie worked worse better than expected good plot    soundtrack well the soundtrack was really enjoyable they composed many themes but there was just this one that was very well composed and it was one of this movies few great things    besides all that i am now going to tell you what i really thought about this movie first of all i only think you should watch it if you really wanted to cause even though it has a 67 on imdb and a small pair of good reviews it doesnt really have to be watched i liked it it has a bit of friends with benefits but still i think i was able to enjoy much things about it that neither love and other drugs no strings attached or friends with benefits had i think tis a smart movie with nice acting and an okay directing its not memorable but its worth of at least one viewing overall one day is not perfect its just average but at least is not so bad as i expected it has a good cast great performances a good plot a great soundtrack but its just not too entertaining sometimes and its also sometimes predictable and we can catch a few clichés during the movie do i recommend it well yeah i think many people are able to like it and many arent im just in the middle i only think it was an average and forgettable romance but still enjoyable i liked it one day 5510 average    average movie half recommended movie grade c
Jan 14 2013,negative,the story had such potential  the passion of two people over the course of many years however the execution ultimately fails in this film my main problem was that it felt just like the novel the makers made little effort to differentiate it from its source material and therefore the story of emma and dexter suffers from the absence of invigoration ultimately the central idea of the novel  that their story would be told on the 15th july of every year  fails to translate to the screen leaving us with a messy film with little of the novels poignancy and absolutely none of its laugh out loud charm
Jan 11 2013,positive,a very touching movie
Jan 7 2013,negative,i cant help but think that this would be 1 star if it wasnt for its likable leads i may also still be in the afterglow of hathaways banner yearnot counting the oscars with catwoman and her eargasm golden pipes in les mis but this movie just didnt hit me like it should i am told the book is amazing so i will give it a read because i really wanted to like this movie good concept a love story you can root for yet it just feels off maybe the whole one day jumping thing doesnt allow us enough time to really care for the characters however in novel form it may be able draw me in better
Jan 6 2013,negative,the story got a very good concept behind but the filming sucks jumping all over the places but yet to build up the intensity between anne and jim btw anne normally gives good performance but she sucks big time here her accent switches from one place to another  totally inconsistent here cant believe she has to fight hard to land this role
Jan 4 2013,positive,while its linear narrative might get monotonous at times one day is ultimately a bittersweet romantic melodrama with charismatic performances and a stirring emotional payoff
Jan 3 2013,positive,one day is an interesting movie but i feel like the movie is trying too hard to fit in the one day concept so it cant really tell a story
Dec 31 2012,negative,first half  perfect examples of hes just not that into you    second half  fairy tail
Dec 30 2012,positive,despite some narrative hiccups towards its end and cosmetic difficulties to make sturgess face look older than 20 this is a decent romantic drama which mainly benefits from a nice chemistry between its leads
Dec 30 2012,positive,a typical romance with a predictable end but still entertaining
Dec 29 2012,positive,a nice and a bit slow movie not pretentious
Dec 25 2012,positive,beautiful and oldfashioned soulful and sad glad to have stayed till the end all the parts i thought dragging are in fact meaningful little details a good love story should have
Dec 22 2012,negative,bait and switch  beware an independent  foreign film starring a likable young american actress that previews as a romantic comedy  this is not a comedy  i walked out depressed disappointed and wondering what anne hathaways dialect coach got paid for the lamest scots accent ive ever heard
Dec 22 2012,positive,loved this movie havent read the book was not expecting the ending to be the way it was so frustrating at times you just want to bash their heads together and say  tell himtell her
Dec 21 2012,positive,a friendship that will last a lifetime
Dec 20 2012,positive,20121221 supposed to be the end of the world
Dec 20 2012,neutral,anne is a sweetheart but its not enough to save this film from the dreary boredom that it emits
Dec 18 2012,positive,so sad but so good whyd it only get 2 stars
Dec 17 2012,positive,id never read the book and so went with the simple understanding that the movie focused on two people on one day over the span of twenty years and so cannot comment on its closeness to the novel i however found this to be an engaging journey     while its true that we miss some important days in emma and dexters relationship i appreciate that it makes sense that the pairs most important moments wouldnt all occur on the 15th of july every year we were simply treated to a snapshot of their relationship at the time and left to fill in the blanks about the time in between ourselves    jim sturgess did a good job playing a sometimes unlikeable sometimes charming leading man anne hathaways accent did occasionally grate but i liked her performance overall
Dec 10 2012,neutral,an interesting idea that falls flat      i know i havent reviewed anything in the last few days  for one thing graham decided that he needed to completely rearrange the bedroom which left my computer disconnected for more than a day  i also had a birthday last week which meant my birthday party was saturday  and yesterday i was just too nauseated to even face writing  you see my good news is that im pregnant  my bad news is that it means i may turn out to be less reliable about my planned daily review for a while  im going to try to get back into it and even try to build up backlog again but if all i can do is lie there and moan that means its probable that i will not be able to face watching anything but old familiar things some days  certainly i will not be able to make myself sit through movies that seem to assume that i will just automatically assume that all friends who are attracted to each other would be better as lovers    in this case it is emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess who have just graduated from the university of edinburgh  it is july 15 1988  we will follow emma and dexter on july 15 for more than twenty years  emma is the poor one first working in a dreadful texmex restaurant in london  eventually she gets together with ian rafe spall a onetime coworker who wants to be a standup comedian  emma doesnt think hes funny  she then becomes a teacher breaks up with ian writes a book  dexter meanwhile has become a tv presenter alienated his father ken stott lost his mother patricia clarkson  he loses his career marries has a child gets divorced  emma grounds him and they sleep together once or twice but hes slept with a lot of women  he makes emma happy when hes there but he isnt reliably there and she doesnt want to base her happiness on him  and the only day we ever see them on is the fifteenth of july    really i thought emma could do better  i mean better than ian obviously because we see so little of her life i couldnt quite figure out why shed ended up with him in the first place  they dont seem to have much in common and i could never be in a relationship with someone if they only time he made me laugh was when he fell down a flight of stairs  however i thought she could do better than dex too  i dont know how he sorts out his substance abuse issues though i assume that must happen in the bits we dont see  and certainly i know that there are plenty of people who sow their wild oatsand mine and yoursand then settle down and are perfectly happy with a single person  however i dont think we ever really see dex change enough to find it believable that he is going to be a good person to be in a relationship with  it may be a failing of the concept we never see anything really followed through  just hints  heck for all we know emma could be a terrible person and were just seeing her on good days    i also had a hard time keeping track of who some of the characters were  i am given to understand that the person sylvie romola garai sleeps with is someone important to dex and given that i can guess who it was  however i would not have known that if i hadnt read a plot summary somewhere else  i think a few characters who appear later in the story were there on the first day the day when emma and dex first get to know one anothercertainly people at the wedding are likely to have been college friends  however no one much except for emma and dex ever really develops enough personality to stick in my mind  ian i suppose though at least part of that is that he ilooksi distinctive  much attention was given in this film to make sure that the costumes and makeup and hair styles and soundtrack were appropriate to the year but i think a bit more effort might have been provided to make the story hang together a bit better    also without giving it away the climax seemed arbitrary to me  i knew that it was coming from a minute or two before it happened  however that was more to do with the style of filming  its as though it was suddenly being filmed in foreshadowvision  it wasnt necessarily going to be as serious as it turned out to be but it was going to be something deeply unpleasant  and then the actual shot itself was frankly laughable  it was almost something out of a warner bros cartoon  i guess maybe its intended to come as a shock and the practical effect is supposed to be that its what finally forces dex to grow all the way up  given hes forty and a father at this point the fact that its taken him that long to even come close is a bit irritating  thats really the reason it seems vexing that he ends up with emma by taking the dreadful job at the dreadful restaurant and then by taking a teaching job instead of trying to make a living at writing she has shown that she is more grown up than dex seems even at the end
Dec 8 2012,positive,so sweet and so sad
Dec 4 2012,positive,honestly i really admire the talented actress anne hathaway all movies that i watch it are perfect and divine this could not be otherwise   i ventured to watch one day this afternoon and i must say that the movie touched me muitonão only the story in question but also the climate the music scene   there i met many actors but i must say that the performance of anne and jim sturgess is impeccable especially in the way they change the course of developing descriptions of the characters in fact the aging makeup was amazing too  i confess i was very surprised and yet very disappointed with what happens to emma anne hathaway and dexter future that follows after all i was scared too because the sound was high when the bus hit her on the bike  but not a bad disappointment and yes  a good and unusual this film is unusual throughout history happens things like a seer could predicts amazing  just did not give five stars because it was not paying much attention at the beginning of the movie then i would be unfair to give five of which only 999 watched the movie it seems only a mediocre detail of one percent but its something to any critic makes less difference
Nov 25 2012,positive,one day was a romantic film with a little bit of comedy that actually ended up being rather good and different  the entire film took place on the same date but in different years  along the way you got to see the rather quirky relationship between two people and how it unfolded over the years  at times you will really wonder where this film is going but like all good movies it comes together in the end and is pretty entertaining  anne hathaway was very very good in this role and it was amazing how they made the characters age about 20 years over the course of the movie  i was a little weary at first but this one ended up being enjoyable and another decent movie based off a nicolas sparks book
Nov 24 2012,negative,i wanted to like this because i like the book and i like the actors but it just wasnt powerful enough to convey a great friendship and a great romance
Nov 18 2012,negative,i couldnt focus on the storyline because of anne hathaways bad british accent  it killed it for me
Nov 13 2012,positive,i hate it when everythings fine and suddenly they hit you with death dont ruin my day
Nov 12 2012,positive,whats 20 yearsits long enough to get and lose someone
Nov 10 2012,negative,one day anne hathaway as you clutch your oscar for les miz this film will be forgiven
Nov 5 2012,neutral,pretty good romantic drama with the always excellent acting from leads jim sturgess and anne hathaway
Nov 4 2012,neutral,one day is fine collection of yearly rendezvous of friends turned lovers but its leads did not live up to the romantic expectation i appreciate sturgess effort but he should have been paired to a better actress than hathaway
Oct 25 2012,positive,an absolute surprising delight  i didnt get more than a 3rd through the book  film was chick flit beautiful
Oct 23 2012,positive,not bad for a chick flick
Oct 20 2012,neutral,you say epic love story i say draggy and cliche love story  guess the movie cover should have tipped me off though
Oct 19 2012,positive,not a nice movie wtf     they kill her horribly dead life sucks
Oct 19 2012,positive,enjoyable but lacking some in the depth department glad that i waited for dvd
Oct 18 2012,positive,yes many people assumed that because it is romance movie and that automatically prevents them from enjoying one day but in fact you are for tremendous surprises whatever happens tomorrow weve had today live life to the fullestazucena
Oct 18 2012,neutral,supported by great actors but one day feel so long and sad
Oct 18 2012,negative,predictable and pretty much a downer since they did not live happily ever after
Oct 17 2012,positive,i like it its clichã c and absolutely predictable and a tear jerker what can i say at least its well acted unlike my other guilty pleasure thatd doom where it lacks drama it makes up for it with its endearing quality probably because of the lead actors its also a good looking movie okay i think ill stop there i like the movie thats it
Oct 17 2012,neutral,too much intertwining that  you would find the good substance  somewhat missing
Oct 14 2012,positive,there were three occasions wherein i thought the movie had its perfect ending and although it appears that it didnt give justice to the book i think it is one of the few tragic movies to hit me in a long while
Oct 14 2012,negative,ugh anne hathaway no
Oct 14 2012,positive,i liked it but i havent read the book its based on tragic end
Oct 13 2012,neutral,nothing groundbreaking here nicely edited with some decent laughs but just a soso story
Oct 13 2012,negative,this movie does a great job at breaking my heart in an extremely gimmicky way
Oct 13 2012,neutral,for all romantics to drool over
Oct 11 2012,positive,it is a nice one but the story uses a cheap strategy at the end to touch viewers could have had a much more original end couldnt it
Oct 9 2012,neutral,i was expecting a lot more
Oct 7 2012,positive,gets the mix of romcom and dram right i loved the way they mark year by year made me think of what i was doing in say jul 15 2005i was newly sober
Oct 3 2012,neutral,the concept works much better as a book    why do british actors have such good american accents and american actors have such bad british ones renee zellweger notwithstanding  anne hathaways isnot good
Oct 1 2012,positive,i wanna read the book
Oct 1 2012,positive,definite chick flicktear jerker   s
Sep 30 2012,neutral,long and a bit pointless
Sep 30 2012,positive,much better than expected expect a few laughs and a few tears
Sep 29 2012,neutral,it had its moments but generally i was rather underwhelmed sturgess and hathaway are likable leads and have some very sweet moments together i wonder tho what the point was of going through all of those years ups  downs and different situations to finally get together only for her to die just seemed somewhat pointless
Sep 25 2012,neutral,a unique take on the romantic comedy focussing on the same day every year in a couples coexistence but it sure would have helped if jim sturgess character wasnt borderline reprehensible the tale seems to enjoy that his character is so hard to sympathize with and it makes anne hathaways characters interest in him all the more curious
Sep 23 2012,positive,sturgess and hathaways performance was so engaging and believable also the chemistry between them was convincing even though the plot lacked the passion and love story feel to it it felt like they were trying hard to cram up the 20 years in a less than 2hour movie which lead to leaving out many details and so feeling unable to connect with the characters i found the aging of the characters well executed the choice of outfits and hairstyles was appropriate for each period and age    the flow of events and ending might have been somehow predictable but its still worth watching how the relationship developed between both characters and what it will lead to in the end i would recommend watching this movie but without getting your hopes high since the love story will not be as memorable as the others that we have seen in previous romantic films
Sep 22 2012,neutral,ok so if you want the wife in tears this is one for you  for me started well but became annoying
Sep 21 2012,positive,its a beautiful story but i love the book more than this movie
Sep 20 2012,neutral,i wasnt expecting much so was plesantly surprised not blown away but a nice romance story with bad accents
Sep 19 2012,positive,not my usual kinda movie but i loved it
Sep 19 2012,negative,poor storyline no good
Sep 19 2012,positive,it was pretty ok felt little bit boring sometimes but it was a good ending not because it was a happy ending but i didnt expect the ending to be like that which made it better after all its nice with unexpecting endings sometimes even though they are not that happy
Sep 16 2012,positive,mixed feelingsi need to watch this again
Sep 12 2012,negative,i enjoyed the trailer more than the film itself
Sep 11 2012,negative,you know what the problem with this move is it pretty much leaves out any real plot where dexter actually falls in love with emma read the book skip the movie
Sep 10 2012,positive,very romantic and great story about 2 friends who turn into more so fun to watch
Sep 6 2012,positive,bit depressing but i still enjoyed it
Sep 5 2012,positive,also read this bookgood book and a decent movie
Sep 3 2012,negative,overall this is extremely disappointing anne hathaway deserves better films than this  this is pointless and it is very hard to care about anyone in this film  would not recommend
Sep 2 2012,positive,  a refreshingly stylish heartwarming and smartlydialogued romantic film
Sep 2 2012,neutral,a tear jerking melodrama that goes with popcorn and hot tea at home the novel is very moving though
Sep 1 2012,negative,this movie bores itself to death
Aug 31 2012,positive,this is a film that requires more than one viewing as i found it more enjoyable  each time i watched it with echoes of when harry met sally this explores the changes and growth that individuals can go throuth while trying to find their place in the world and happiness a sweet story of friendship and love loss and regret that endures over the years however i did find the ending frustrating
Aug 30 2012,negative,veeery loosely based on the book
Aug 26 2012,positive,was not a happy ending boo
Aug 26 2012,negative,i really disliked the dexter character  what an idiot
Aug 25 2012,positive,i really like this movieeeeee thank god i own its dvd d   best story and best acting from both sturgess  hathaway well done
Aug 24 2012,neutral,i know why we didnt see it in the theater but it wasnt all that bad they needed to change the script up so we as viewers could develop more of a relationship with the characters that way we might actually feel something when she gets obliterated by a vehicle yes spoiler alert but this movie is old and im sure none of you who actually read this will want to even see this movie it was very blah for the most part the premise was good though
Aug 15 2012,negative,well acted well directed film but i just didnt care about the characters at all
Aug 15 2012,positive,really good story of love and maturity
Aug 13 2012,neutral,this is confusing love story because somehow the plot is moving unbalance and rather messy the character that will be loved only emma while dexter will receive sympathy only anne is good here despite the strange and shaky british accent this movie is enjoyable but still isnt good movie
Aug 12 2012,positive,what an effin s movie
Aug 12 2012,positive,shocking romantic worthy
Aug 9 2012,positive,i love anne hathaway so much  i wanted to like this film so much  it definitely has its good parts but the film altogether does not take you like it should  the acting is amazing though  worth the friday night rental
Aug 3 2012,negative,ugh so annoyed do not recommend unless you want your night ruined
Aug 3 2012,neutral,not bad  it has some mistakes
Jul 31 2012,negative,a charming romantic comedy except they forgot the charm romance or comedy
Jul 31 2012,positive,i watched it just for anne hathaway she was amazing as expected she pulled off the british accent quite well  jim sturgess was brilliant too    about the movie id have to agree with  stephen whitty from newark starledger who said few films get the strange intertwining bonds of affection quite so effortlessly although the episodic structure keeps the drama from flowing nicely  it was good overall  its been long since ive seen a pleasant romantic drama    after giving us a movie like an education expected a little more from scherfig
Jul 29 2012,positive,very touchy story loved it
Jul 28 2012,negative,gimmicky and pretty weak love story that has good moments but is mostly lacking and a poor mans romantic comedy
Jul 28 2012,neutral,unoriginal romance with enough tragedy to keep it on the best side of saccharine
Jul 24 2012,positive,loved it loved it loved it  great story line with laughter and sadness  i cant wait to read the book
Jul 18 2012,negative,theres nothing at stake
Jul 18 2012,neutral,all of the stars for anne hathaway
Jul 17 2012,negative,rented this as a rc to watch with the missus the movie visited the characters every year from the late 80s to the present would have been a good idea to have some of the late 80s and 90s music representing the decades the movie was set in the characters were shallow although ann hathaway did an okay job on a british accent even if you couldnt tell if she was from up north the south wales liverpool or manchester some humorous moments but some years just flashed by without much happening all a bit predictable flat characters no 80s90s soundtrack and a horrible ending ken stott as the dad deserves special mention in an otherwise  mediocre effort
Jul 16 2012,positive,interesting characters anne was good and looked stunning sad end but its not bad
Jul 15 2012,positive,this is officially the first movie that weve watched together and made her cry lol
Jul 15 2012,positive,a great book movies not that bad either
Jul 14 2012,positive,good movie but spoiler alert so sad
Jul 14 2012,negative,ann hathaway does a really poor english accent was a bit boring only good thing about the leading man was his character name was dexter  but no dexter morgan   even as a chick flick give this one a miss
Jul 13 2012,positive,lovely romance film but wished for a happy ending
Jul 12 2012,positive,watched on the plane liked it but not something that stuck in my head i would not want to watch it again any time soon
Jul 12 2012,negative,no no do not see this movie adorable chick flick material ruined by graphic horrible ending
Jul 12 2012,negative,the course of events brings to mind stories that weve all heard where the fairy tale never quite works out yet theres still a romance between two people to the bitter end the film plays on this familiarity in order to try and draw tears from the audience and make them forget that in many ways the film is a class riddled cliched ripoff of every tradgedy tinged romatic comedy youve ever seen seemingly worsened by the not untalented but ultimately extremely irritating anne hathaway the harder she tries to invoke audrey hepburn or kristin scott thomas or julia roberts the more irritating it gets you kindof end up wishing that you were watching four weddings and a funeral because it has a similar structure and balance between rediculous scenarios and tragic characters its as if the scriptwriter also the book author wants to do realistromanticcomedy for the uppermiddle class like irvine welsh crossed with julian fellows in some wierd genetic experiment that produces a manicdepressive version of richard curtis the director seemed to be very influenced by the way the talented mr ripley was shot but when you remove the mystery and intrigue to be replaced by a slightly banal romance then film britain instead of italy you end up with something that looks like a cross between a tasteful tourist board advert and a 80s bbc biopic about an obscure poet that died at 35 before their work became posthumously favoured by pretentious discussion programs im guessing she was aiming for some sort of halfway house between arthouse crowd and commercialglossywomensmagazine and shes ended up with a film that will appeal to those who cried for a year after princess diana died even though they had only ever seen a picture of her on the front of newspaper prior to mourning for her if you like having your emotions manipulated for no purpose whatsoever watch this
Jul 10 2012,positive,predictable but well implemented
Jul 8 2012,positive,i had never heard of this movie but it has strong performances and a sweet story i really enjoyed it  
Jul 7 2012,positive,she dies at the end there now you dont have to waste 107 minutes only to get pissed off at the ending
Jul 6 2012,neutral,slow moving romance with a bittersweet ending hathaways acting is great her english accent however not so much a film made of the predictable elements of a typical boymeetsgirl love story is intertwined with two  maybe three  unpredictably touching moments
Jul 6 2012,negative,one day i wasted 107 of my precious minutes there is not one snippet of this films plot that gives a reason why two extraordinarily goodlooking individuals should not be together yet the first half of the film forces the viewer to watch emma and dexter dance timidly around each other like two misplaced blunt trauma victims the only redeeming quality of this atrocity masquerading as a movie is anne hathaways chic gamine haircut which fortunately manages to overshadow her horrible british accent for part of the film after her last project an education one of my absolute favorites lone scherfig disappoints with this atrocity masquerading as a movie
Jul 6 2012,positive,predictable and cheesy but its cute an enjoyable chick flick
Jul 6 2012,positive,nice story plot but it didnt hold my attention at all
Jul 5 2012,positive,it was all right  though predictable it still made me appreciate my life and be glad to not be an aimless twenty or thirtysomething
Jul 4 2012,positive,not a bad movie but kind of disappointing
Jul 4 2012,positive,i didnt expect to like this as much as i did but thanks to anne hathaway and jim sturgesss charisma i thought it was a really wellmade version of the book which i read about a year ago there are some really lovely scenes i dont think you could ask for much more people who have not read the book will probably enjoy it even more so
Jul 4 2012,positive,good movie bit of a surprise
Jul 3 2012,positive,nice movie for you and the lady on date night
Jul 3 2012,positive,would have been higher if i wasnt constantly distracted by anne hathaways terrible english accent great movie overall though tragic and soberingly real
Jul 3 2012,negative,jim sturgess character ruins this movie he supposedly changes into an unlikable guy but he was never likable from the start
Jul 3 2012,positive,a confusing relationship butchered or murdered by multiple fragments with almost nexttonone connection still some fragments are really emotionally good with uber level of romance and the irresistible charm of the hathawaysturgess couple not to mention the warm colour beautiful costumes and marvellous setting of each frame alike the previous film of  lone scherfig  an education if only the inconsistent plot had been refined to create a strong link between fragment  a link to solidify the emotion of viewers and their affection for the lovely couple the wardrobe of hathaway for this film is really incredibly elegant for the same idea about an everonoffandonagain relationship this film should learn from the french film jeux denfants love me if you dare
Jul 3 2012,positive,i love when anne hathaway plays english characters she makes the accent sound cool and she has a very natural english feel about her that makes it seem like shes not acting at all hats off  the movie was kind of boring kind of cheesy but i didnt see the end coming all in all not bad
Jul 3 2012,negative,what a disappointing movie
Jul 3 2012,positive,just as good as the book
Jul 2 2012,positive,a wonderful film about love and loss
Jul 1 2012,positive,it was a so sweet story i simply loved it
Jun 30 2012,positive,one day is sentimental and passionately acted by the talented anne hathaway and jim sturgess
Jun 29 2012,positive,its what a nicholas sparks movie would be if it were aimed at grown women rather than teenage girls
Jun 29 2012,negative,they are pretty  thats all
Jun 27 2012,positive,i couldnt stop crying and learned a lot we shouldnt waste the great oppotunity and should be honest and should appriciate our lives we have now 
Jun 26 2012,negative,perfect for hopeless romantics
Jun 26 2012,positive,sweet and sour love story between emma and dexter two college graduates in edinburgh their relationship is explained to us through sketches of their lives taken on the 15th of july of each year from 1988 to 2011 so we can see their original friendship developing over time until they realize they are truly in love we get to see their highs and lows their successes and their failures their other lovers and their weaknesses in chronological order  it is a clever movie based in a book so maybe it is a clever book more than a clever movie in any case it is an honest and unpredictable film told in a simple but interesting way there are passionate moments but they are smartly disguised as ordinary reactions that plainness is perhaps the reason why we get the impression at the end to have watched a very gripping love story the strong and believable performance of the two main leads makes this a very romantic watch
Jun 26 2012,positive,i find the episodic telling of the life and love story of the main characters as new and fresh way to deliver a romantic movie and while the lead actors create a good chemistry and did justice to their characters i still find the whole making of the film mediocre lacks depth and needs more emotion to persuade its watchers maybe girls will find it great because it has a sappy and touching love story but i find it confusing superficial and it could have been better in the end the film teaches us not to miss any chances we had because it might affect the future we really want to happen especially about spending it with someone you really love
Jun 24 2012,neutral,meh  not the worst of the genre by far but not great either  i know this is horrible but i just have trouble stomaching anne hathaway esp as a romantic lead  i find her very unattractive what exactly are guys supposed to be falling in love with   also kind of annoying  i also found it difficult to buy her british accent  not that she did it poorly but maybe because she just doesnt seem british somehow  i couldnt get over the fact that i knew she was faking it  anyway this is a decent love story with an interesting premise one day is july 15th over the course of many years over which these characters develop their relationship but it falls flat  maybe because we dont spend quite enough time with the lead characters in any one particular timeplace we never really get invested in them as individuals or their relationship  its kind of like a love story without the romance characters without any personality  the dialogue is pretty good and so is the acting and the male lead guy is super super cute  so good eye candy if thats enough to keep you watching a movie
Jun 24 2012,positive,what a beautiful ending
Jun 23 2012,negative,jan 2012 i liked the aspects of relationships this brings up  but its pretty bad    dec 2012  i watched it again for some reason i actually enjoy it but its still terrible
Jun 23 2012,positive,incredible the music the acting the storyabsolutely loved it it is a bittersweet story but the truth behind it makes it amazing
Jun 22 2012,positive,anne hathaways accent is horribleruined most part of the movieluckily jim sturgess acting skills helps the movie goinggreat actorwrong actress
Jun 22 2012,negative,what a waste of film why emma fell in love with dexter ill never know and dont get me started on that ending glad its over
Jun 19 2012,positive,i actually thought this film looked pretty good for romantic film and that the showing the same day once a year was a pretty unique strategy i actually thought that they met each year but they dont  but unforunately it didnt really work as i felt cheated as i missed big parts of the story and didnt get to see some important scenes in the characters lives  it was cool that you got to see the characters grow and change as the film spans over 20 years but again they changed so fast since you skipped 364 days every time and sometimes even more than that  the film also takes a turn at the end that i didnt really like   i did like anne hathaway and jim sturgess in their roles  overall not a terrible romance film but the unique plot didnt work as well as i had hoped
Jun 17 2012,positive,surprisingly fresh and authentic despite being somewhat reminiscent of hugh grant and andie mcdowell anne hathaways attempt at a common british accent was bewildering and annoying letting it down a little
Jun 17 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies in a long time  as the movie progresses from 1988 to 2008 the changes in the characters both physically and emotionally are done exceptionally  the direction of this movie is superb  hathaway shines again and sturgess gives his best performance that i have seen to date highly recommend
Jun 17 2012,positive,this is some serious drama i cried so much at the ending of this movie this reminds us that we should take opportunities the minute they come because one day it might be too late
Jun 16 2012,negative,slow dull and and unexciting sadly i knew what was going to happen in the end
Jun 15 2012,negative,one star  for jim who is always so hot and gorgeous
Jun 15 2012,positive,i found this movie nice because of the romance and comedy but it made me feel so sad at one point
Jun 14 2012,positive,i could relate to emma really well since that im a writer myself like her and know how been in love and how does it feel to stuck with someone that you dont really love  anyway i almost give up and about to say this film is boring until she died and everything changes spoiler yep this is not a bad movie and also based on a book romantic ending though i love emma she struggles alot
Jun 9 2012,negative,one day someone will explain to me why this movie was made props to hathaway but no believable chemistry between leads meh
Jun 9 2012,positive,fact is stranger than fiction   what is love
Jun 8 2012,positive,actually it is not bad at all if you read the book before hand
Jun 7 2012,positive,this was a great movie x but also really sad x my mum started crying at the end x overall it was a good emotional movie and really good x i loved it x
Jun 6 2012,negative,the 2 leads have fantastic chemistry here but the narrative is somewhat jumbled the relationship in the film is never fully defined and the end comes out of nowhere its a nice film but one that fails to tie everything together or have a point or message to the proceedings
Jun 4 2012,negative,i so wanted this to be epic but it was barely clichã
Jun 3 2012,neutral,this film is a romance begging to be made  the book was more enjoyable   the film has not quite captured the friends bond between the  emma and dexter and the underlying sizzling romance waiting to explode  at least with the book you could imagine this for yourself   something cannot be captured on film also the chemistry between hathaway and surgess  well there is none
Jun 2 2012,positive,weeping love story  i loved it
Jun 2 2012,negative,this movie was really bad the only good part was when anne hathaway was smashed by a truck that 3 second segment of hathaways demise is probably worth watching the whole movie i rofld
May 31 2012,positive,a romantic but sad story which everyone whos been in love should be moved by it
May 30 2012,positive,miscasting    first off i wanted to use the
May 30 2012,positive,the ending was terrible
May 29 2012,negative,kind of boring anne is so bad in this one ladies will like it maybe
May 29 2012,negative,was hoping for a happy love story but unfortunately this was a tragic love saga with many downers rather than uplifting moments storyline was all over the place lead actors were the only reason i added two stars to my rating
May 29 2012,positive,the speed in which it flies through the years is a bit much   very dodgy accent from the hathaway  some reminiscent moments that take you back worth watching   look outâ well i saw it coming
May 28 2012,positive,this is a good film mainly faithful to the book but could possibly seem very disjointed if you hadnt read the book beforehand i enjoyed it though guy playing dexter had that mix of wanting to hate him and them feel for him towards the end overall good
May 28 2012,positive,the sum of the charisma of the two great protagonists are one day hover well above the average of the latest romantic productions the excellent soundtrack  elegant locations and the tone that always hangs between humor and drama guarantee quality entertainment in  this unusual love story    it is unfortunate that the tragedy highlighted both win in the end
May 26 2012,negative,even looking at anne hathaway for 107 minutes couldnt save this one from going down in a ball of flames
May 26 2012,negative,anne hathaways english accent is so brutal it makes you think everybody elses if fake as well
May 26 2012,positive,on my want to see list for many weeks so glad i now have
May 26 2012,negative,is she the same person in every role the only reason i am giving this 2 stars is because it is a focus film the ending was cool other than that you could know how this movie goes even without seeing it i am sure of that
May 25 2012,neutral,one day is an interesting look at a relationship but its not a very gripping one
May 24 2012,neutral,unique storytelling idea i liked the way it was shot but something was missing in the chemistry
May 23 2012,positive,the movie starts out slow so i wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as i did toward the end a perfect ending though it actually made me cry because of personal things going on in my life right now i havent seen a movie with an ending that didnt make me completely hate the whole movie in a while so this  was very refreshing the makeup was fantastic the way that they made them age over a time span of more about 15 years they made it very realistic  hathaways accent was almost convincing i feel they could have cut a lot out of the movie though to speed up time and not make it drag as it did good  movie if you are sad and looking to kill time as i was i love the last scene of the movie it was very touching
May 22 2012,negative,everytime you start feeling something it gets ruined by it being overdone or underdone
May 22 2012,positive,loved it one of my favorite movies
May 21 2012,positive,i enjoyed this film very much  actors had great chemistry and individually i enjoyed both their performances  i liked this story and i liked this version of the story  not sure why others didnt like it beyond the floating in and out accent by hathaway
May 19 2012,negative,this is one movie that was better than the book for whatever that is worth
May 18 2012,positive,eh wasnt as good as i thought it would be
May 17 2012,positive,antonishing romance movie beautiful and make you think about your life and others people life  whoâs knows about your love can be
May 15 2012,negative,getting hit by the bus was one of the better parts in this movie
May 14 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i do not agree with the bad review
May 14 2012,neutral,the book did a better job explaining how dex turned into such a dink while hathaway finds much more in the character than was ever on the page mostly junky with some sweet moments
May 14 2012,negative,this is basically a two character movie where the characters seemed to be examples  at one point he is sucessful and she isnt and then at another point she is but he isnt  and sometimes they are in love with other people while the other one is single  throw in deaths addictions and awkward moments and that basically sums up this movie  the movie doesnt really deal with anything and mostly dull for the entire run time
May 13 2012,positive,rather somber but effective display of friendship and love  good for the true romantics
May 12 2012,positive,good confusing sad
May 12 2012,positive,i think this was cuter then the notebook i was mad that she died though
May 10 2012,positive,this movie is a touching story that will grab at your heart
May 10 2012,positive,a good movie but i feel utterly drained so very very sad
May 9 2012,positive,a tragic love story
May 8 2012,negative,nauseatingly pseudointellectual version of when harry met sally without the whimsy
May 7 2012,positive,its the best movie y ever seen
May 7 2012,positive,i really liked it
May 7 2012,positive,a really good idea and not badly done at all you want things to work out and i wont give it away but things are not as predictable as you think the mrs said it is very close to the book it is based on
May 6 2012,positive,okay  in short worth watchin  at least when you have nothin else to give a try
May 6 2012,negative,wowmagic make up  dexter looks so different by years btw emma looks so beautiful when she is in paris
May 5 2012,negative,it took a long time for this epic romance to get anywhereif it ever did
May 5 2012,positive,heartbreaking romantic dramedy
May 5 2012,positive,ok not great but ok  wish patricia clarcksons character would had been developed more what a shame
May 2 2012,positive,the story was really tragic i love the fact that the movie was based from the novel which i admire to read it capture the moments in once life on how to live life to the fullest one example in this is with the character of dexter in the first place he shouldnt let emma slip from his life well at least he couldve lived his life with no regrets and waste because emma was the perfect for him in the first place its disappointing to understand that this tragic story could have been exist in real life
May 1 2012,positive, an education    the notebook
Apr 28 2012,negative,wow could this be more boring
Apr 28 2012,positive,its good but soooo sad i would say this is an indie movie little odd but good
Apr 27 2012,negative,the book is much more better than the movie in the movie a lot of things does not appear
Apr 26 2012,neutral,whatever happens tomorrow we had today    one day is danish director lone scherfigs follow up to 2009 film an education a movie i really liked but unfortunately this film isnt as interesting one day is a romantic film with two characters that i had a difficult time believing they were actually best friends or in love with each other my major problem however was with hathaways british accent i have no idea why they didnt just get a british actress to play the role considering there are som many great ones jim sturgess is a decent actor but i just didnt feel the chemistry between him and hathaway the key in a romantic film lies in the chemistry between the two main actors and i just didnt feel it the story is interesting and the premise seemed original considering we only get to see a glimpse of what happens during one day july 15th of every year due to these constraints we do have to fill in a lot of gaps of things that have happened during the time but the film does a good job at telling the story i actually enjoyed the second half of the film but i felt that the first half was just too slow and boring i am glad however that i decided to stick with the film because it does get a lot better in the second half although i still wouldnt recommend this film unless you are a true fan of the genre    the movie opens with a scene that takes place on july 15th of 2006 emma anne hathaway is riding a bicycle in a street in london when all of a sudden we move back about 20 years to the late 80s on july 15th where we see how emma and dexter jim sturgess meet they are celebrating their graduation and end up spending a night together although they never had talked much in school before they become real good friends and we see how their lives develop as every day we jump forward in time one year on that exact date dexter becomes a late night television star while emma despite being intelligent struggles to make it through their friendship continues to grow and dexter is always telling emma how soon she will become a famous writer as the movie progresses we are introduced to new cities and meet some secondary characters as emma and dexter dont see each other every year on that day we are introduced to dexters parents alison patricia clarkson and steven ken stott and to some of dexter and emmas love interests despite being away from each other they continue to be in touch and at times even travel together we experience how these friends grow the challenges they face and the goals they achieve    one day is actually based on the bestselling novel written by david nicholls the great thing about it is that scherfig got him to adapt the screenplay for this movie as well this is one of those stories that probably work best in a novel because several details have to be left out of the film due to time constraints i really wished the movie would have had a more entertaining first half because it does pick up pretty well during the second half i also enjoyed some of the secondary characters like patricia clarkson who is always a great addition to a movie one day is a decent romantic film but i think scherfig did a much better job in an education this is not a memorable movie it lacks better pacing but it does have some decent performances

Apr 23 2012,negative,one day has a twisted intrigue that was hard to extinguish in a film lone scherfig made the story look odd it requires more sophistication emotion and spark anne hathaway and jim sturgess does not have the right amount of sentiment to work things out
Apr 22 2012,positive,this one had so much potential that it didnt live up to hathaway and sturgess are great actors but they couldnt save the predictable story that seemed like it was trying way too hard it was good and emotional from time to time but overall lacked enough to make it great
Apr 19 2012,neutral,a little too drastic and expected to my liking the chronology was nice but the story could have been better
Apr 18 2012,positive,real funny romantic youll fall in love with the movie as they do with each other
Apr 17 2012,positive,not really a good film for most people like it though remind me of a lot like love the movie reflects the other side of love and lives not often mentioned in other films but mostly seen in our real lives  hathaway is another good reason to watch this movie
Apr 14 2012,positive,bittersweet comedy following the pains of growing up more or less successfully and more or less in love
Apr 12 2012,positive,was a sweet movie until the ending that is    wasnt really ready for a sad movie just yet
Apr 11 2012,negative,wasnt what i expected when i sat down to watch this romcom  it mostly left me wanting something more  id give this one a pass
Apr 11 2012,neutral,one day is just an average movie it has its ups and downs but everyone can be able to enjoy something about this movie what id like to say is that at first they started with love and other drugs then no strings attached now one day and friends with benefits i mean it looks like these four movies are trying to create a new genre or should i say a subgenre of romantic comedies we always know at some point that love is going to get there sometime but well even though one day had that sort of concept im still able to say that this movie had a clever plot and it was also a good movie do i recommend it yeah but well its nothing but a forgettable romanctic comedy but its really just average theres lot of things in this movie that you can like about but theres also much other things that you wont like about like the fact that its predictable sometimes its boring sometimes it has some clichés in it but whatever one day was an average movie but i can still say that i liked it girls will defenitely like it but me and probably other people well just stand in the middle sow watch one day if you want its not a total waste of time but still not the best way to waste your time i only thing some of the only good things from this movie were the acting the plot the sondtrack and not much else i just liked it average movie    lone scherfig did just a good job she showed us a diferent kind of directing and i can say that she did an okay job anne hathaway takes the lead role she was good i enjoyed her acting she was able to play all kinds of things and she was able to show again that she has talent anne is known from rachel getting married get smart rio love and other drugs and some other movies jim sturgess was good here he showed that he deserves to be more often on the screen cause he sure has talent jim is known from 21 across the universe the way back and some other movies patriciaa clarckson was just okay here thats all patricia is known from shutter island the green mile friends with benefits vicky cristina barcelona and some other movies sow as you can see this movie has a good cast and the two main actors really seemed to give all the talent they got i think anne and jim showed very talent and not just very talent i think they had a nice and visible chemistry what makes me think that they picked the actors very well good cast    emma anne hathaway and dexter jim strugess meet at their college graduation now since there every year during that day they both are sometimes happy sometimes sad sometimes heading to the right direction sometimes not even though emma and dexter just decided to be friends are they soul mates twenty years two peolplewhat i thought about the plot i liked the plot there was little of friends with benefits theme but still i can consider the premise smart and good the plot was good written and it shows that the real book is probably a nice book but they could have did a better job with this interesting story instead they didnt do a that good job but they still did an acceptable movie i just think that they were able to make an amazing movie out of it it was loaded of clichés and predictable things what im saying is that it contains a few great things in it and they could make a better movie with this plot what im saying is that the movie worked worse better than expected good plot    soundtrack well the soundtrack was really enjoyable they composed many themes but there was just this one that was very well composed and it was one of this movies few great things    besides all that i am now going to tell you what i really thought about this movie first of all i only think you should watch it if you really wanted to cause even though it has a 67 on imdb and a small pair of good reviews it doesnt really have to be watched i liked it it has a bit of friends with benefits but still i think i was able to enjoy much things about it that neither love and other drugs no strings attached or friends with benefits had i think tis a smart movie with nice acting and an okay directing its not memorable but its worth of at least one viewing overall one day is not perfect its just average but at least is not so bad as i expected it has a good cast great performances a good plot a great soundtrack but its just not too entertaining sometimes and its also sometimes predictable and we can catch a few clichés during the movie do i recommend it well yeah i think many people are able to like it and many arent im just in the middle i only think it was an average and forgettable romance but still enjoyable i liked it one day 5510 average    average movie half recommended movie grade c
Apr 10 2012,negative,i liked the idea of this movie just showing one day for about 20 years but the characters and movie were just so boring i really couldnt care less if these two ended up together or not i know it wasnt suppose to be a comedy but there could have been some more laughs put in really just watched it cause i want to like anne hathaway more before dark knight rises comes outthis didnt help
Apr 9 2012,positive,omg i loves this film what a lovely story and if your a romantic you will really enjoy this film but be ready for a emotional roller coaster as you will laugh and cry through
Apr 9 2012,positive,such a sweet film a little predictable in places particularly the ending however this isnt such a terrible thing    the only thing that niggled on me is that anne hathaways accent was a little inconsistent sometimes it was heavily northern and at other times it was most definitely a london accent
Apr 9 2012,neutral,i appreciate the good acting but not the fake accent its messy sorry anne they should have used a real brit for this one
Apr 9 2012,neutral,one of those novels you cant turn into a good movie
Apr 9 2012,negative,i was really disappointed in this movie it all seemed such a waste of time and effort not one of ann hathaways best
Apr 7 2012,positive,thought it followed the book pretty well it was weird for anne hathaway to have a british accent
Apr 7 2012,positive,i never read the book so i cant compare the two but the movie certainly wasnt what i was expecting  i enjoyed it though and would recommend to all those romantics at heart  another good movie with anne hathaway
Apr 5 2012,positive,i had seen this on a date and even better a film critic was sitting right in front of us how did i know he was old alone wtf had all kinda writing stuff with him he was taking notesbut he left a quarter of the film so im guessing he didnt care for it    well basically two people meet one day and continually see eachother that day from 1988 to 2000ish they predictablly end up together but it foreshadows something to happen at the beginning i wont ruin it for you though if you read a few other ratings youll find out  the film does drag on at bits it kinda felt like ugg all these years tt  but all in all its a neat little movie that i enjoyed very much id watch it again    what i really liked though was the realisticness of the characters and the situations they go through you cant help but feel for them    i totally reccomend
Apr 4 2012,positive,one of the best dramas ive ever seen other than the casts who dont seem to really get into the characters the storyline is pretty great the idea of seeing someone just once a year is so hearttouching
Apr 3 2012,negative,the course of events brings to mind stories that weve all heard where the fairy tale never quite works out yet theres still a romance between two people to the bitter end the film plays on this familiarity in order to try and draw tears from the audience and make them forget that in many ways the film is a class riddled cliched ripoff of every tradgedy tinged romatic comedy youve ever seen seemingly worsened by the not untalented but ultimately extremely irritating anne hathaway the harder she tries to invoke audrey hepburn or kristin scott thomas or julia roberts the more irritating it gets you kindof end up wishing that you were watching four weddings and a funeral because it has a similar structure and balance between rediculous scenarios and tragic characters its as if the scriptwriter also the book author wants to do realistromanticcomedy for the uppermiddle class like irvine welsh crossed with julian fellows in some wierd genetic experiment that produces a manicdepressive version of richard curtis the director seemed to be very influenced by the way the talented mr ripley was shot but when you remove the mystery and intrigue to be replaced by a slightly banal romance then film britain instead of italy you end up with something that looks like a cross between a tasteful tourist board advert and a 80s bbc biopic about some terribly clever poet that died at 35 before their work became very popular on radio 4 afternoon discussion programs im guessing she was aiming for some sort of halfway house between arthouse crowd and commercialglossywomensmagazine and shes ended up with a film that will appeal to those who cried for a year after princess diana died even though they had only ever seen a picture of her on the front of newspaper prior to mourning for her if you like having your emotions manipulated for no purpose whatsoever watch this
Apr 2 2012,positive,i regret watching it cause now i cant sleep
Apr 1 2012,positive,plotsummaryafter one day together  july 15th 1988 their college graduation  emma morley anne hathaway and dexter mayhew jim sturgess begin a friendship that will last a lifetime she is a workingclass girl of principle and ambition who dreams of making the world a better place he is a wealthy charmer who dreams that the world will be his playground for the next two decades key moments of their relationship are experienced over several july 15ths in their lives together and apart we see dex and em through their friendship and fights hopes and missed opportunities laughter and tears somewhere along their journey these two people realize that what they are searching and hoping for has been there for them all along as the true meaning of that one day back in 1988 is revealed they come to terms with the nature of love and life itself   my review  alright so let me get this straighttwo best friends sleep with each other in college and every on this one day they met each other and eventually i dont know get married or something cause they sure didnt get married in the film one day is a good film with one annoying problem to me and that would be anne hathaways accent other then that the story is quite nice brings something a little new in love stories but still dosnt hold on intrest to me
Apr 1 2012,positive,if i were to describe this film in 1 word i think the perfect term would be bland anne hathaway  jim sturgess failed to create a lovey dovey chemistry that i think is necessary for romantic movies like this     on a brighter note the film got this soothing vibe that will make you feel at ease or relaxed even if youre not exactly enjoying the story or its probably jim sturgess pretty face     what about anne hathaways british accent her acting would have been really great if only she managed to maintain consistency when speaking using the british accent     you have your opinion and i got mine learn to respect remember âbeauty is in the eye of the beholderâ
Mar 30 2012,neutral,i read the book first and that was immensely enjoyable  the movie didnt develop the characters sufficiently and there were many scenes that lacked the emotional impact they should have   for instance the scene where dex visits his dying mother and he is drunk this should have had real power and insights into the flaws in dexs character but it was altogether too brief and only a light sketch when the strokes should have been deeper   i think it would be a difficult book to translate faithfully into a movie and this director didnt quite get there with it
Mar 30 2012,positive,kinda slow in the beginning but such a good movie
Mar 30 2012,positive,what a lovely romance of jim and anne but lack of the plot
Mar 27 2012,neutral,okay plot but some parts were predictable and boring
Mar 27 2012,positive,this is the kind of film that lets you know from the start where it is all going so you can just sit and enjoy the trip there   the charachters are real and well rounded they all have teir good and bad issues and their likable and unlikable traits the plot is simple but with heart and most of the acting is well above the standard for this kind of dramedy  aside from a few parts that seem to run a bit long thereby losing focus this is a nice date movie with a warm heart
Mar 25 2012,positive,i really like this book and movie very easy to get caught up in characters relationship a tear jerker
Mar 25 2012,positive,a film i really enjoyed i normally hate these sort of films but this was really was great
Mar 23 2012,negative,disappointing i really wanted this movie to be good since two of my favorite actors are in it
Mar 22 2012,negative,predictable and done before so many times anne hathaways accent is prettyprettyprettybad
Mar 20 2012,positive,the book is so much better     however it does follow the book quite closely it wasnt too bad to watch
Mar 20 2012,negative,an egregious chickflick confirming my opinion of anne hathaway as being incapable of substance a thinlydrawn manchild is redeemed through the female leads supposed specialness pass me a bucket
Mar 18 2012,positive,love seeing them together and how they physically changed all throughout the movie kinda dragging but for me still okay but i hate the ending
Mar 18 2012,positive,i cant help but to feel that they brought everything onto themselves then again its a movie to tell us to act on what we wish for the soundtrack was great and it makes the movie less unbearable anne hathaways acting and accent was less than great though
Mar 16 2012,positive,i love the film it was perfect just the right amount of romance drama and comedy my favorite movie the vintage of the 90s was spectacular jim sturgess handsome as ever and anne hatthaway breath taking
Mar 16 2012,negative,turned it off after half an hour as anne hathaways northern accent was too terrible for me to stomach may go back to it at some point and give it another chance once ive got over the accent trauma
Mar 15 2012,negative,one of the worst love stories ive ever seen and wonder what sort of looser wouldve come up with the idea of that role of such sad woman he must be a guy and also gayp
Mar 15 2012,negative,let me get this out of the way anne hathaway needs to work harder at accents much harder this film left so much out of the book that the story hardly made sense editing is hard but it needed to be more carefully considered massive disappointment
Mar 14 2012,positive,i know that you are going to be a fine man decent loving accomplished but i dont think you are there yet
Mar 13 2012,negative,could have been way better
Mar 13 2012,positive,to be honest it was probably a bad idea for me to watch the film within a few hours of finishing the book but it wasnâtmt as good as the novel as true of any noveltofilm adaptation thereâtms not enough time in 100 minutes to get all of the novels plot points covered this meant a lot of things had to be missed out and i felt the film moved through the july 15thâtms too quickly     emma anne hathaway was a boring character with no real development and without a secure accent  it surprised me that david nicholls â having written the novel as well as the screenplay â abolished emmaâtms affair with her boss i feel that was  an important plot point of the novel that made her a threedimensional real character and gave the end of her relationship with adorable comedian ianrafe spall more meaning     hathaway in the role was good but her accent switching from a soft yorkshire twang to rp english every few scenes was offputting claims she was miscast are understandable but apart from that she was good jim sturgess as the emotionally crippled and corrupt television personality was exactly as iâtmd imagined and was very believable spallâtms portrayal of ian both as aspiring stand up comedian loyal doting boyfriend and emmaâtms heartbroken exlover was adorable and true to the book     the idea of revisiting the same date every year to explore the relationship of dex and em worked well in the novel but without the graphics on screen telling us which year we were watching iâtmd have been lost i couldnâtmt help comparing it to marc webbâtms 500 days of summer 2009âtms linear narrative structure and thinking maybe it would have worked more if structured in a similar manner     the flashback of emma and dexter in university toward the end of the film was really sweet after the heartache of 2004 iâtmll not spoil it if any of you want to watch it weâtmre transported back to a happier simpler time of 1988 and for a few minutes everythingâtms a whole lot cheerier     speaking of 2004â²s heartache that was a bad thing not just because nichollâtms has led us all to believe that emma and dexter are meant to be together foreverbut because it just happens to fast and moves on so quickly 6070 of the film is a light hearted romcom then suddenly we watch the 2nd downward spiral of dexterâtms life and want to cry everywhere     over all itâtms a good film but iâtmd avoid it if youâtmve read the novel itâtms not the same em and dex    
Mar 13 2012,neutral,oh dear really wanted to like this but its badly cast and badly acted stick to the book and you wont be disappointed
Mar 12 2012,positive,this deserves more than it is rated
Mar 12 2012,positive,shoddy yorkshire accent aside i largely enjoyed this motion picture tragic romances such as these are easily related to by individuals such as myself as they parallel ones life quite accurately jim sturgess put on a surprisingly convincing performance although the delivery or certain quotes direct from the book could of had a wee bit more gusto otherwise this is brilliant relatively mindless entertainment would have been five stars if not for the accent yet i appreciate hathaways efforts and she does a relatively good job at a rather specific and kind of obscure accent nonetheless
Mar 11 2012,negative,would rather of waxed my bikini line with cold wax in the winter snow
Mar 11 2012,positive,i thought it was a little slow and not a very original story but wow the ending really choked me up
Mar 10 2012,positive,over 20 years in less than 2 hours and still a touching film i should have read the book to be honest so i would be prepared for such a dramatic end beautifully directed with excellent performances now i definitely want to read the book
Mar 10 2012,neutral,watchable enough and quite touching in places
Mar 10 2012,positive,a very british film
Mar 10 2012,neutral,just as sad as the book
Mar 8 2012,negative,completely unenjoyable i detested both characters from the beginning anne hathaways accent verged somewhere between british english and irish and was quite distracting the ending was predictible and lacking any emotion way too much unneccessary dialogue that added nothing to the story this coming from someone who loves before sunsetsunrise so yes avoid this film dont get sucked in by the lovely trailer as i did
Mar 8 2012,negative,too much information scherfig tried to embrace as much detail as possible from the book the movies chronology runs too fast
Mar 5 2012,neutral,movies is worse than such a pretty posterdisappointed
Mar 5 2012,positive,id recommend the book here on which the film is based a lot had to be cut so the adaptation is just good whereas the book is great
Mar 4 2012,positive,i think this is the highest ive ever rated a romcom  i absolutely loved this movie  it just crushes your heart 
Mar 4 2012,positive,a nice film will have u laughing n crying 
Mar 4 2012,negative,read the book absolutely loved it  i was really disappointed in the film
Mar 4 2012,negative,1were all the actual english actresses unavailable  anne hathaway and a fake english accent no good  2 with this movie you devote an hour and a half waiting for the male lead to get his shit together  then youre immediately shocked and spend the last half hour crying
Mar 3 2012,neutral,probably could have been a good movie but this wasnt
Mar 2 2012,positive,really enjoyed this film did the book justice which most books to movies dont ignore the bad reviews if you liked the book and a heart warming tale watch this film
Mar 2 2012,negative,a misguided adaptation that fails to be as witty poignant and heartbreaking as its original source resulting in a sexless lacklustre and crushingly conventional romantic caper this only adds evidence to a universal truth that some books are better left untouched
Mar 1 2012,neutral,not badnot a big hathaway fan but shes very believable in this role
Mar 1 2012,negative,terrible  very disappointing after reading the book  ugh
Mar 1 2012,negative,awful boring clichã cd piece of shit
Mar 1 2012,negative,after spending a night together after their college graduation two people become friends and maybe more as we see them through a period of years  one day is a tolerable romance chick flick based off a book  the gimmick of seeing how the characters are doing through the years on the same date is an interesting idea but it tires a bit thin by the end of the film  the movie has serious and fun moments but theres not really much excitement to the film  the story is ok but its really nothing special we havent seen before  i wasnt thrilled at the ending i mean it was powerful but really  ive always been a big fan of anne hathaway who does a decent enough job here playing emma and she got some crap on her british accent but it didnt really bother me although her short hair did  jim sturgess does a good job as well as dexter and he and hathaway have good chemistry  the rest of the cast including patricia clarkson as dexters mom rafe spall as ian and romola garai as sylvie are all pretty good too  this is a film the ladies will enjoy much more than the guys who have t sit through it with them  while the cast is game one day doesnt quite deliver in all the places it should    gets alist rating of meh    subscribe to me on youtube at  follow me on facebook at  and on twitter at 
Feb 29 2012,negative,the trailer of sorts before the movie actually shows a clip from this movie among others i did not know it was this movie but did think to myselfanne hathaway kinda annoys me oh what shes in this movie and that clip was from this movie so its not only hathaway but its hathaway with an english accent whatthey couldnt find a british actress really emily blunt was busy more likely she declined the script     i love a good romance and this movie certainly tries to be one its actually not a bad concept two people never have sex on graduation night they dont and the story tells itself as it picks up their lives each year on that day for 22 years unfortunately the characters suck the rest of the storyline sucks the casting sucks i just couldnt get into it or felt like id already seen it i turned it off and got online good thing i turned it off as it evidently really takes an unfortunate turn    one reviewer says its what a nick sparks movie would be if it were aimed at grown women rather than teenage girls i disagree it is clear the male character is a douchebag each time they get together early on all he wants to do is get naked lame but that is lame teenage romance stuff not sophisticated at all i dont care what accent they use or what he drives or how the film is colored
Feb 28 2012,negative,it feels like it takes forever to get to the point just to disappoint at the end
Feb 28 2012,negative,it was the longest depressing movie a waste of timethey spend their whole miserable lives not acting like they knew what they were doing and then 15 years and 2 hours later they get married after finding out she is having trouble having a baby she gets hit and dies and depressing stuff inbetween  not a good use of your time to watch this
Feb 28 2012,positive,the film is a visual rendition of the book and it just goes to show that when the author writes the screenplay for a movie the right elementsthemes of a good novel can become filmic   if you like a nice romance sans comedy movie to snug into then anne hathaways performance wont disappoint 
Feb 27 2012,positive,a bit like a long episode of this life worth it for the 90s reminiscence lots of rom not much com strangely engaging
Feb 27 2012,positive,im very suspicious because i love things from the 80s ok the movie isnt but a part of the history happens there the truth its a great and good movie see with a girlboyfriend or some one youre trying to date
Feb 26 2012,negative,the story has little substance more then an hour of the film is just going though the boring years of their miserable livesnothing new or special going on here
Feb 26 2012,positive,my wife and i saw this one on valentines day so we were both in the right mood to see a sappy love story  i was hopeful because ive always been impressed with anne hathaways acting chops  honestly the movie looked kind of cute so i dove in    one day follows a couple on their lifes journey on one particular date in their lives over a period of 22 years  sometimes the couple is together sometimes not but it is very interesting to see their development from college graduation to full blown adulthood  there are some very interesting side stories that keep the plot going  there are some characters in the film that either shouldnt have existed or needed some additional fleshing out    anne hathaway is again very impressive in one day with a sometimes mousy appearance while at other times looking stunning  her overall performance is not as strong as in other films such as devil wears prada but frankly she just isnt asked to do as much  the rest of the cast while mostly no names still does a very nice job  jim sturgess who plays hathaways love interest does a good job but i cant help feeling like a stronger actor would have played this role a little better and strengthened the overall movie    for a sappy movie to see on valentines day i really enjoyed it  the story is nice and fun throughout but i will say i hated the ending  ill probably give it a three out of five on netflix  if youre looking for a sappy one id recommend one day
Feb 26 2012,positive,very faithful to the book dex is just as i imagined him and em delivers her witty lines very effectively i kept a railway compartment entertained with my reactions to watching it on my laptop quality acting and directing
Feb 26 2012,positive,not too sugary thankfully but would have liked more depth into characters
Feb 25 2012,positive,good movie great but anne hathaway bad performance in this movie
Feb 25 2012,negative,awful and terrible compared to the books not sure who was worsewooden male lead or the worst yorkshire accent ever
Feb 25 2012,positive,i enjoyed this film  great character development  laughs and tears
Feb 24 2012,positive,anne hathaway lights up the whole film and jim sturgess did a good work in showing the changes of a man in 20 years love the story about how love shows up that you might never know and miss it but when you realize it might then be too late
Feb 24 2012,negative,slow and inconclusive for 1h and a half then when finally takes the right way ends up so fastly and unexpectedely that the entire movie could last 15 minutes without problems
Feb 23 2012,positive,so sad and beautiful
Feb 23 2012,positive,the speed in which it flies through the years is a bit much   very dodgy accent from the hathaway  some reminiscent moments that take you back worth watching   look outâ well i saw it coming
Feb 22 2012,positive,i cried nonstop from the beginning to the end and my husband was thinking that i have a dexter in my life no i dont have a dexter in my life but i am emma living a life with lots of rules i would create and stick to them as well as being worried about my family my friends and a better world i cant write a review without directly projecting myself this is a movie in which lots of people who were born in the early 70s would see themselves  but only the extremes emma represents the nerds and dexter represents the ones with no rules it is a very powerful movie with lots of subtle messages about how we choose our paths  and how sometimes is beyond our control
Feb 22 2012,positive,really enjoyed this  heartwarming also makes you realise that life is short and you should fight for what you want
Feb 22 2012,positive,the ending of the girls life is too abrupt this kinda accidents should be rare in the uk i bet
Feb 21 2012,positive,i enjoyed this film very much
Feb 19 2012,positive,its a film equal to a walk to remember ps i love you and the notebookit made me cryits a great moviewith great performers i highly recommend it you wont be disappointed
Feb 19 2012,positive,a very good romance movieits a serious drama    you go in a journey with those characters    i can see some people hating itbut overall it is a really good movie with strong performances
Feb 19 2012,positive,it is a beautiful story it talk about couples that going through the different stage and it take both side to make it work out
Feb 19 2012,positive,so sweet and so sad
Feb 18 2012,positive,esta bonita cursi pudo ser mejor en fin soy fan de anne hathaway
Feb 18 2012,negative,the pace was very slow the characters are annoying and i especially dislike the dexter character although the story sounds very promising the movie is very dissapointing i fell into a deep sleep sometime during the movie and i watched it in a theatre on a saturday night can you imagine if i watch it on dvd i would have slept through 23 of the movie
Feb 18 2012,negative,it was good until the last 20 min why cant movies just end happy
Feb 18 2012,positive,the film is a nice adaptation book was better ah did a nice job as emma even though her accent was well shady with dexter i was less convinced he wasnt charming enough    still good and it makes you look at life and the choices you make
Feb 17 2012,negative,watch the trailer it will save you roughly 1 hour 58 minutes
Feb 17 2012,negative,hathaways accent was terrible it flitted from sounding australian to cockneywhy they didnt get a good english  yorkshire actress to play the part is beyond me  sturgess played dexter pretty well though  i would recommend the book version any day
Feb 16 2012,positive,although i cringed at anne hathaways terrible british accent i thought this movie told a love story in a very unique way and really enjoyed it  i recommend this movie to only the hardcore romantics out there
Feb 16 2012,neutral,just reading the book again everyone needs a dexter
Feb 16 2012,neutral,just reading the book again everyone needs a dexter
Feb 16 2012,negative,first film i watched after drive sorry anne but the accent was no held throughout every so often shed suddenly go really heavily northern and then back to a mix of yankeebritish slow story too but expected this
Feb 16 2012,positive,nice idea but there is something missing in it this film was not bad but it might have been better than this 
Feb 15 2012,negative,basically at the end of this story i felt sorry for the lead actress character the lead actors character seems to be a complete idiot that is unlovable even by the most tolerable of individuals it is probably a considerably better book however
Feb 15 2012,positive,a nice intelligent girl and a bad boy womanizer who become best friends she falls for him but knows he has major problems so holds back from an intimate relationship their friendship and ups and downs of life take them through almost 20 years of july 15thsunique way of portraying the story they did an excellent job of making the physical changes over the years this was a pretty good movie very sad needed tissues
Feb 15 2012,positive,loved it the book was alright so i thought id watch the movie to give the story a little more colour to it the movie was amazing the emotions characters and everything was just as expected the whole storyline was just interesting to begin with definitely a movie worth watching 
Feb 15 2012,neutral,i love anne hathaway and jim sturgess and i think they are tremendous actors but one day is definitely not their best performance its biggest problem lies within the concept of showing one day a year it could be interesting but it needs the proper execution the first half of the movies drags on and can be boring but in the second half it makes things interesting it is like a roller coaster with a long long climb up then slowly going down then balancing out then throwing a big twist and then just leaving me confused i want to say i liked this movie but i think it could have been much better given better writing i guess the chemistry just did not work out that well but i still somewhat enjoyed it find the book of this i am sure it is much better 255
Feb 15 2012,positive,and this is how my valentines ends and it was a good one
Feb 14 2012,positive,a decent stab at the book capturing a lot of its charm and character the only thing that lets it down is anne gathaways accent which seems to slip out of yorskshire as and when it pleases
Feb 13 2012,neutral,the movie lacks the feelings and emotions in the first half for sure but it actually has feelings in the last 30 minutes of the movie and genuinely makes sense as well nothing much to offer in the first 60 minutes of the movie apart from the same old chemistry of girl loves boy and boy is friends with girl love story the way of presenting the story is innovative and unique hathaway and sturgess certainly have acted decently not a bad one watch it for its last 30 minutes
Feb 13 2012,neutral,i love you sooooo much i just dont like you anymore
Feb 13 2012,positive,i wouldnt say the romance works almost lacks of emotions probably caused by the timeframe cut but still managed to keep a good chemistry between hathaway and sturgess the art direction helped a lot
Feb 13 2012,positive,i warn you very very sad 
Feb 13 2012,negative,i did say i wanted to see it but then i stumbled upon it and just watched the last 20 minutes of it you know where the twist ending started needless to say i dont care to watch it from the beginning anymore p
Feb 13 2012,positive,the waiting period and the length of the film is something you wont see in other movies these days the movies prerogative is its charm to lure romance enthusiasts i see a lot of bad review but there is more to this movie that meets the critics eye one day is an unfolding of a beautiful friendship told in time  its highs and lows complications and memories as both individuals mature since their first rendezvous after their graduation it only proves that the best kind of love starts from a solid foundation of friendship props to jim sturgess  the evergorgeous anne hathaway for bringing the characters come to life
Feb 12 2012,negative,i really wanted to like this the trailers i saw in tv seemed like it has a really good story to tell unfortunately the trailers were the best part of the movie 
Feb 12 2012,positive,if its focus watch it enough said great movienightin flick
Feb 11 2012,neutral,disappointing bad accents scattered story no real emotional connection
Feb 11 2012,positive,sure its predictable and about 15 minutes too long but the relationship between mcavoy and hathaway is sweet and a little bit touching
Feb 11 2012,positive,cant quite put my finger on what makes this movie feels a bit off despite featuring my 2 fave actors in it maybe because too little details were told or that i dont sympathize with dexter perhaps i need a 2nd viewing or pick up the book  read it instead
Feb 11 2012,positive,for the unaccustomed this will tend to be boring i mean there were years were nothing eventful happened some years were skipped altogether    i for one appreciated the straight progression i never got bored even on the uneventful portions because i got to see how the characters grew no matter how little    the plot is familiar territory two bestfriends who seemed destined for each other spent too many years dating other people ugh frustrating    i hated the ending and this is the reason why i loved the film more haha i think i felt the film more than if the ending were something else
Feb 11 2012,negative,on a technical note editing was terrible they should never be hired again as for the filmstoryline it was very flat not funny and quite boring sorry but if you made your boyfriend watch it he would not be impressed and probably die of boredom
Feb 10 2012,positive,theres no way in the world any movie could do justice to the book i was a little surprised at some of the edits and thought at least a bit more might have been included in the movie nevertheless i thought the two leads did justice to em and dex and anne captured more of emma than id been led to believe she rocked the pixie hair cut in paris  i still loved the two characters together and enjoyed the way their friendship and love developed over the years some good one liners as per the book who could ever forget the dex classic about giving emma one thing in life  the gift of confidence or a scented candle even though he was often undeserving she made him a better person and he made her light up whether its the book or the movie its just lovely to be a part of
Feb 10 2012,positive,yes im a big softy at heart just watched and loved this movie a great journey through the last 20 or so years great seeing all the old fashions again and hearing all the great music ive grown up with will be getting all my old cds out tomorrow for a good listen great acting performances also a definate must
Feb 10 2012,negative,the basic premise had merit but the way the characters fumble through life is too depressing
Feb 10 2012,negative,i just dont think this film has anything going for it mediocre at best on all fronts meaning overall  poor  hathaways ability to inadvertently slip in and out of inappropriate regional accents was the only thing that stood out to me annoying
Feb 10 2012,negative,with better film script more character development this could have been a great romantic film spanning 20 years it was fragmented disconnected superficial anne hathaway a brilliant actress was miscast and her accent didnt quite work jim sturgess gave a stunning performance but the script didnt allow for deep character development beautiful musical score
Feb 9 2012,positive,not a bad movie but i was expecting more and it just missed the mark the idea of following two people throughout their lives by focusing on a single day as it comes around each year seemed like an interesting one but it doesnt flow organically and just comes off as a gimmick theres nothing really all that new or original about this film and you can see most beats coming pretty far in advance one day has way too many lows and very few highs often times in films this can lead to real payoffs and make the highs feel truly magical but not here you feel good at times but bad most times  b
Feb 9 2012,positive,tear jerker  stayed close to the book
Feb 8 2012,negative,absolute torture this movie never wanted to end   it just kept on going on and on  definitely miss this one
Feb 8 2012,neutral,july 15 two people twenty years cute romantic love story
Feb 7 2012,positive,really good film would like to read the book as well
Feb 6 2012,positive,fantastic very sad love story
Feb 5 2012,positive,wow must start by saying what a sad ending just when you are with the person you love they slip away very moving film
Feb 5 2012,neutral,a tough movie to watch  two very sad characters one complex and one very shallow  if you can sit through it the ending is fulfilling though sad
Feb 5 2012,neutral,i love a good ol romcombut i think the film was trying to be so much more than that it didnt quite get there i felt sadness at times for the two of them id watch this on a rainy day if that
Feb 5 2012,neutral,in a better movie dexter might have been one of those characters who is deeply flawed but charming here hes just a selfabsorbed jerk
Feb 5 2012,positive,whatever happens tomorrow we had today    steven except to say that i think the best thing that you could do would be to try to live your life as if emma was still here dont you   dexter i dont know if i can   steven of course you can what do you think ive been doing for the past ten years
Feb 5 2012,positive,i absolutely loved it there really isnt much to say about it seeing as it follows a book and excellently so a good movie you wont be disappointed
Feb 4 2012,positive,well that happened just when you get everything that makes sense in your world the bottom falls out  of course
Feb 4 2012,negative,it had some sweet moments but overall probably one of the more depressing movies ive ever seen it drains you in its length and doesnt reward you with any b12 shot of emotions that make you felt like you were entertained or that watching it was worth your time
Feb 4 2012,positive,i couldnt understand at all
Feb 4 2012,neutral,watched the first and last 15 min super depressing and the ending doesnt really make up for it im sure the middle was predictable and just built up so the end could be that much more
Feb 3 2012,positive,not sure how i feel about this one i really wanted to like it but it just dragged on for so long without getting anywhere there was a good hour portion of it that couldve been left out to make it a little easier to stay focussed
Feb 3 2012,negative,boo  anne hathaway was a horrible brit
Feb 2 2012,negative,very disappointing no story horrible british accent i skipped most of it
Feb 1 2012,negative,a romantic story but sometimes it seems to be boring and  get on the sflash stage
Feb 1 2012,positive,it was pretty good although i dont entirely agree with the casting choices and it was nowhere near as good as the book
Feb 1 2012,negative,starts out with some promise but quickly becomes almost unbearable to watch nuff said 
Jan 30 2012,negative,its pretty impossible to put this book into a film this movie is missing a lot of important details from the novel xx
Jan 30 2012,positive,beautiful depressing a reminder to make the most of every moment
Jan 30 2012,neutral,threatened to be good in places despite hathaways interesting accent but for most of the film it was just really hard to like the character of dexter which kind of diluted the admittedly powerful ending
Jan 30 2012,positive,i usually like anne hathaway but it felt like shes done this kind of character many times before i didnt love it and i was shocked at how it ended
Jan 30 2012,negative,the last 20 minutes was good but the rest
Jan 30 2012,negative,horrible movie you go to the movies to see a romance not a tragedy
Jan 29 2012,positive,i liked the idea of checking in on em and dex on july 15th through the years that gimmick made this interesting for me i love love love loved ann hathaway pretending to be british and the contrast between her prudish em and sturgesses wildchild dex opposites attract but always miss the moment or do they yeah they do yadda yadda then the ending was a little too obviousuninspiredcliche but at least it wasnt another damn fairytale ending
Jan 29 2012,negative,didnt like it specially the endpretty bad
Jan 29 2012,positive,passable chick flick
Jan 29 2012,negative,i confess to having read and enjoyed the novel on holiday last summer like most of the adult population the key if you enjoy the novel is the affection you feel for emma hence why the critics were so sniffy about hathaways casting and her yorkshire accent    i have to say i thought hathaway pretty much captured the role so ill forgive her for her accent i cant do a yorkshire either ooh northern boys love gravy see thee later as always with adaptations of popular novels the film is a compromise but not a disastrous one nichollsâtm script follows his own novel as closely as you could the leads are perfectly fine although perhaps dexters early obnoxiousness is toned down    the book is better than the film made it look and for a romcom theres not much of the com but the shocking finale still pulled at my heartstrings as much as it did on the page
Jan 29 2012,neutral,solid enough little romantic film the problem is that stretching 20 years of plot into the 15th of july in each year works well early but struggles later   some sections work well but the latter part of the middle section starts to lose you it grabs you back suddenly and dramatically but by then youre tired of characters having short little clips showing them in different stages of their emotions and life  also there is a very unrealistic look to the actors in the later part of the film you cant just cut anne hathaways hair or tint jim sturgess hair grey and claim that theyre in their 40s especially as sturgesss character had lived a life full of excess the characters need to show wisdom from the experiences of the life we have been watching hathaway is solid in this regard but sturgess struggles at times the fact that he still looks too young however doesnt help this problem  overall a watchable film some will enjoy it more than others some will like the direction at the end others like my wife will yell at the screen in annoyance
Jan 28 2012,positive,love itromanticand so heart movinggreat for movie time
Jan 28 2012,positive,wow i just finished watching this movie with my husband so beautiful witty and well written
Jan 28 2012,neutral,well not the worst plane movie ever ill give it that
Jan 27 2012,negative,the endingugh ruined it for me
Jan 27 2012,positive,this movie had everything to become a classic    spoiler alert    except for the tragic twist towards the end
Jan 27 2012,positive,its really good like a gloomy version of 500 days of summer but more english thats why i like it only problem is anne hathaways accent
Jan 27 2012,positive,4 12 stars because i cried like a baby for days had to tell my widowed friends and family not to watch it
Jan 26 2012,negative,alright expected better
Jan 26 2012,negative,rediculous mess is this really what the world looks like in this movies eyes this is a perfect picture into the lives of people without god i couldnt stomach most of this film way too depressing and represents everything that is wrong
Jan 25 2012,negative,the only good thing i have to say about this movie is that it wasnt my pick dear husband had to apologize to me for this one
Jan 25 2012,positive,sweet moving touching story of lifes journey of love and loss
Jan 25 2012,neutral,im still undecided on this one
Jan 25 2012,positive,a wonderful movie for me is the kind of movies which makes me rethink and ponder for at least a short while  one day is this sort
Jan 25 2012,positive,well that  was a complete bundle of fun
Jan 24 2012,positive,the kind of movie where you can relate somehow to the story its a beautiful movie about a relationship between two friends and their lifes after their met this movie only shows the 15th of july of the following years and will bring tears and laughters to you garanteed
Jan 23 2012,negative,boring romantic movie thats just the same stuff over and over again without any surprises anne hathaway puts on a strong performance but the movie hardly amazes
Jan 22 2012,positive,i loved it i thought i would love it when i saw the trailer its just my kind of love story that produced a good amount of tears at the end they had such great chemistry i love anne hathaway and jim sturgess gah so good
Jan 22 2012,negative,awful film very poor representation of a very good book shame on you
Jan 21 2012,positive,well acted but depressing and sad
Jan 21 2012,positive,i loved this movie i am a fan of the book and love that it was captured pretty well in this screen adaption sturgess manages to make a character that is a total jerk dexter for a portion of the film totally likable and so you care about him hathaway was okay as emma i admit i cried at the end as well
Jan 21 2012,positive,at the back of my mind parang i want this kind of setupkilig but im freaking out naligsan dayonhahaha sad ending 
Jan 21 2012,negative,it was pretty depressing what was up with the horrible ending i had a feeling it would depress me it was relatable tho the actors did a good job
Jan 21 2012,positive,surprisingly i like this film so many flaws and thing that could be changed to make this movie better but at the core of story its very bitter sweet
Jan 21 2012,positive,better than expected based on the rt score of 36  captures the essence of the book well would bring a tear to a glass eye  anne athaways yorksha accent wor annoyin ta begin wi
Jan 20 2012,neutral,reminded me of a version of when harry met sally just with all the dates how they remain friends over the years but they kinda have this thing for each other and stuff like that it just wasnt as good as when harry met sally
Jan 20 2012,positive, img    i really enjoyed the story and the two leads worked well together
Jan 20 2012,positive,loved this movie nothing more to say
Jan 19 2012,positive,simplemente touching  bien bonita
Jan 19 2012,neutral,this was a first for me in that i liked he movie better than the book
Jan 19 2012,positive,a welldone albeit slowly paced romantic movie hathaways accent may not be the best ever but you hardly notice it after a while give this flick a shot you might enjoy it
Jan 19 2012,negative,a largely unconvincing affair far more preocuppied with anecdotes and gimmickry than it bothers with psychology and genuine emotion scherfigs mise en scene displays an annoying tendancy to multiply postcardready framings distancing the viewer from the characters inner livers sturgess all badboy groom  puppy eyes dominates the first half as hathaways unfortunate attempt at a yorkshire accent distracts massively but slowly she ends up matching him in the films last reels clarkson underwhelms much like the movie in itself
Jan 18 2012,positive,though the plot was predictable and nothing spectacular and yet this whimsical woody allen wanna be movie struck a cord with me i guess i am a huge hathaway fan and thus would watch anything for her i would still recommend this movie as it is a leg up over such a load of poo a lot of film makers put out there calling cinema
Jan 17 2012,positive,i love all the early 90s fashion its a very sweetcute movie but warning also heartbreaking
Jan 17 2012,positive,at the beginning i thought it was not going to be good it seemed a tad bit boring as the movie progressed you could not help but wonder why that one day at the end of the movie it swallows you because something happens out of the blue it takes you breath away and sends chills through your spine it is definitely worth seeing because you are not expecting what you believe you are you will be surprised and you will cry
Jan 17 2012,positive,i loved this movie  havent read the book yet but they say its a tearjerker  well the movie brought some tears so i guess i better have a box of tissues ready when i start reading
Jan 17 2012,neutral,maybe a bit boring but still worth watching  mainly because of the lovely anne hathaway
Jan 16 2012,positive,this movie was predictable and it was weird to hear anne hathaway talk in a british accent for an entire film the love story was ok its pretty sad actually
Jan 16 2012,negative,i know a movie never lives up to the book but come on this was so so so bad
Jan 15 2012,neutral,it was really slow  jumped to a lot of things and left a lot out hated the endingbut i loved anne hathaway wouldnt watch it again
Jan 15 2012,positive,the ever beautiful and most awesome patricia clarkson makes me want to cry also jim sturgess is pretty the grey haired look  hot and i have liked anne hathaway since rachel getting married so a good watch possibly just downgraded it because i love me a happy ending
Jan 15 2012,negative,the book is better of course
Jan 15 2012,positive,it went too fast  but it was a good journey and i love the chemistry between anne and jim  bit of a tearjerker
Jan 14 2012,positive,started slow ended great cried too
Jan 14 2012,positive,a beautiful romantic story with 2 top actors that made the movie for me whats with the ending though its like they didnt know how or when to finish otherwise very enjoyable
Jan 14 2012,positive,its good but soooo sad i would say this is an indie movie little odd but good
Jan 14 2012,positive,it was a good idea to watch the movie before reading the reviews i recommend you to see it
Jan 14 2012,positive,loved this movie as well as the book some felt it was too sappy love story but i loved how it spanned thru so many years
Jan 14 2012,negative,meh hathaways great performance couldnt overshadow the insipid incoherent plot
Jan 14 2012,positive,soulful romance loved it
Jan 14 2012,positive,i liked it but the ending was a bit much for me
Jan 14 2012,negative,going into the movie i thought the movie would be a light sappy love story so i chose it on flight home and anne hathaway was in it within the first minute i knew i had chosen badly as they start the movie with a clip of the star riding her bicycle in traffic setting up the same old rj movie cliche that seems to be in every romantic movie nowadays acting was ok and the story did not live up to expectations as it shows the same day over 20 years unfortunately the movie felt like it took 20 years from me this is not a feel good take a date to the movie kind of movie it really didnt stay together enough to be anything so i say skip it altogether 1 star just because of having anne hathaway in it
Jan 13 2012,positive,great movie with a gripping story
Jan 13 2012,positive,the movie is super romantic
Jan 12 2012,positive,i did want more from this movie but in all of its quirky lovable and strange romanticism i found a solid flick that kept me enthralled in the characters relationship anne hathaway plays the role of the nerdy yet sexy emma who you cant help but fall in love with and jim sturgess plays the frat boy dexter who you will love to hate the euro feel to this entire movie was excellent however this is no american love story and youll find that out by the end i really loved this movie despite mediocre reviews it was beautifully directed by lone sherfig who creates an atmospheric art that pays attention to details for each and every scene i recommend this movie to anyone who loves indie romance movies and beautiful art translated into a film
Jan 12 2012,negative,there was considerable hype around this film as well as the original book from my peers however i found both distinctally average   it is to be expected now i suppose that big money films will remove much of the charming detail from the books they based on this plot however has been somewhat improved by this editing down process as it has managed to skim off some of the unneccesary emotional baggage and completely uncharming detail that weighed down much of the book as a result it runs at a considerable pace but unfortunately it somehow still manages to feel a little slow and drawn out   to its credit there are some amusing moments and the acting is of a reasonably high standard despite a lack of chemistry between the mains and an appalling yorkshire accent from anne hathaway but the scripting is a little iffy at times and emmas death still doesnt pack the punch of emotion it should this is possibly because as with the book the fundamental success of the story is in the readerviewer caring about the two main characters and their relationship which frankly i didnt
Jan 12 2012,negative,to say that one day is the most disappointing romantic film of the year would be selling it a little short not only is the film incredibly disappointing but it also entirely wastes the incredible onscreen chemistry between jim sturgess and anne hathaway who are electric together the outoftheblue terrible ending was actually infuriating and made me want to throw something at the screen what else is there to think about in relation to the film when that scene is the only really memorable part
Jan 11 2012,positive,an oldfashioned love story
Jan 11 2012,neutral,for a movie like this to work you must first believe in the premise in this case the premise is that two people will meet on the same day every year as friends though their lives go on this is highly unlikely to occur in real life so the premise fails anne hathaway however does her best to keep this movie going 2 12 out of 5 stars
Jan 11 2012,positive,the scope of the production of this film is just epic  endless sets and period styles all the while watching our heroes mature physically and emotionally before our very eyes  but i just didnt like them together  i was invested in these characters and wanted the best for them which is an accomplishment in itself but in my mind they were bad for each other detracting and distracting from each others lives more often than not  a unique romantic piece worth watching for its sharp dialogue and emotional depth 
Jan 11 2012,positive,a touching love story  a day in the life of a friendship between a boy and a girl
Jan 11 2012,positive,relly liked this one its a love story with kind of a sad ending wich i like cuz just not all of the love stories end up like a fairy tale
Jan 11 2012,neutral,kind of depressing but it has its moments
Jan 11 2012,positive,beautiful story very sad and cute all in one
Jan 10 2012,neutral,oh my gosh really be prepared for a tissue box is all i can say
Jan 10 2012,negative,they bush around too much
Jan 10 2012,positive,awesome movie i generally hate this kind of movies but this one caught me from the beginning great storyline great performances a little sad but not every movie can end happily i could really feel like i was in their shoes and thats the concept of true art
Jan 10 2012,positive,the most relateable film ive ever watched this movie touched me to my core  anne hathaway and jim sturgess gave such honest and believable performances and the film was carried out so realistically  the film took on a daring approach with the premises of just showing the relationship of the  main characters on one day in every year of their friendship july 15 but it actually worked and allowed us to see the full span of their changing circumstances yet constant connection  because i felt as if imy life could have been dropped in the middle of the storyline i definitely felt the emotion  and cried a lot  during this movie  while the movie did end by drawing on one of the biggest cliches it made me ask over and over for hours later whats the point meaning the point of life and love in general  it touched my soul and although the critics arent given it much acclaim i highly recommend seeing it
Jan 10 2012,neutral,nice with a little twist chick flick but nice
Jan 10 2012,positive,beautiful in the way life is not movies
Jan 9 2012,negative,23 years condensed to 107 minutes that felt like 23 years
Jan 9 2012,negative,i actually very seriously dislike this film and all of its characters none of the characters appear to have anything about them that makes them interesting and anne hathaways english accent is nothing short of offensive
Jan 9 2012,positive,tedious as showing slides boring at the first time but gets better at the second time
Jan 8 2012,negative,it seemed to drag on
Jan 8 2012,negative,not completely boring or cheesy but one day its just a movie lacking real situations to fill a two hour length
Jan 8 2012,positive,it based on romantic novel dan harus diakui setiap wanita memiliki dexternya masing2 beautiful movie yeah aku msh memiliki sisi romantis sentimentil p     ill find the novel it will be my first david nicholls collection semoga tidak mengecewakan p
Jan 7 2012,positive,i thought it was unique how they showed what happen between to the both of them on that one day but i still wish we could have seen things that were not shown to understand the couple better
Jan 7 2012,neutral,anne is great and the movie has some sweet parts but its a bit slow and depressing it has a sweet overall feel but it leaves you feeling empty and lonely which is not how i want to feel after a good romance film even though the acting is good i can only give up a 25
Jan 7 2012,positive,great love story  i really enjoyed actually loved this movie      it doesnt matter what happens tomorrow cause we had today
Jan 7 2012,negative,just plain boring  i see lots of razzie nominations for this one  no chemistry between hathaway and sturgess  a morass of scenes that were stitched together in a lame attempt to make it a movie  and it has this tv movie feel like it should be a miniseries vs a feature length movie  hathaways british accent is mushy and frequently comes across as more new york  hathaway needs to do a better job of selecting roles otherwise shell get no serious offers in the future
Jan 7 2012,positive,anne hathaway i loooooooooooove you
Jan 7 2012,neutral,an overly long film that ends in an obvious way if you like romances youll love it otherwise avoid
Jan 7 2012,negative,gets kinda boring fast goes back and forth too much too long sadly suspense starts towards the end with the truck
Jan 7 2012,negative,one day i hope for many things 1 for a romance to be romantic 2 for an ending that isnt extremely depressing or predictable and 3for anne hathaway to learn how to talk with a british accent maybe one day but it certainly wasnt today
Jan 7 2012,neutral,annes accent really is rubbish and so is the song at the end credits
Jan 7 2012,negative,heard a lot about this movie but was super disappointed
Jan 7 2012,positive,loved it  not the story i was expecting  not a dry eye in the house looking forward to a game of are you there moriarty with dickie
Jan 7 2012,negative,very dull story about 2 people who fail to see that they are each others soul mates and then we have to suffer thru years of their misguided actionspartnerships until heyho they discover each other and then well the inevitable happens quite boring and frustrating have had more entertainment sitting in a dentisrs chair
Jan 7 2012,positive,this got mixed reviews but i actually enjoyed it it starts slowly and has some twists and turns to follow but the result really is a beautiful story if not necessarily a great critical or box office success
Jan 6 2012,positive,my favorite     simple but deep  i know this story by my bone marrow     i do believe that being true friends while are lovers is pure rare but beautiful    and finally  all the life is one day one hot summer day in july
Jan 6 2012,positive,i have not been moved by a movie in a long time this was a great love story
Jan 6 2012,positive,theres nothing new about this movie
Jan 6 2012,positive,slow paced love movie but gradually make you attached to the characters  laugh with them and cry with them loved the way the story is presented
Jan 6 2012,positive,great little movie with the wonderful as ever anne hathaway starring the penultimate scene is shocking and unforeseen
Jan 6 2012,negative,just like any other chick flicks but worse
Jan 6 2012,neutral,precise and witty reconstruction of era which means a lot for those who had lived through it the end of the film was tooo long and without real dramaturgical need marvellous character  sad comedian
Jan 5 2012,positive,classic romantic movie this is enough and its great
Jan 5 2012,positive,very nice i loved it 
Jan 5 2012,positive,very intelligent truthful and touching
Jan 5 2012,positive,its a bit of a downer but you know what i really didnt think it was that bad for a film that was roundly dismissed by most sturgess is a bit out of his depth but hathaway charms and steals the show
Jan 5 2012,negative,hated this melodramatic story of an immature shallow man and a stupid naive woman 
Jan 5 2012,positive,a very charming romantic comedy the cinematography is wonderful and the chemistry between the two leads really works for this movie perhaps is not too faithful to the book but still manages to be a very enjoyable film the music fashion events and many references through the years are remarkably well done
Jan 4 2012,negative,im only half way through this movie and all i can think about is how horribly unconvincing  anne hathaways accent is  the politics behind how this got such good reviews and above all when is it going to end
Jan 4 2012,positive,i started reading the book a few years ago and couldnt finish it because the characters were annoyingafter reading the critic reviews of the movie i was sure that id hate it toobut surprisingly it was a really good chick flick anne hathaway and jim sturgess have amazing on screen chemistry and that really makes the movie enjoyable there were times when the plot slows down and a few characters like tilly and callum that shouldve been more developed but in the end it was a solid romantic movie
Jan 4 2012,positive,not a good ending at all and the story turns so repetitive but is nice to remember that this kind of situations are real
Jan 4 2012,positive,hathway and sturgess looked so nice together they both acted well overall one day is a pretty nice romantic film but in comparison to the novel its a bit shallow
Jan 3 2012,neutral,i wanted to love the movie but it just wasnt favorite material i like sturgess from across the universe in this film of course and the ending sucks but hey we all saw it coming
Jan 3 2012,negative,very gimmicky the plot jerks around a lot forcing you to quickly invent your own story to make the jump between two years unfortunately the movies not being intentionally mysterious the reason it skips ahead a year or two is because nothing interesting took place over the course of over 20 years in this movie only 20 days are deemed interesting enough to warrant exposition and worst of all when the end comes you see it a mile away
Jan 3 2012,positive,for such a unique novel the film certainly failed to capture the story the film captured the points of the story but doesnt play out with the same fluidity or pace unfortunately
Jan 3 2012,neutral,interesting good story but its patched together with no backbone you can only like it so much until youre like why didnt they explain the reason for anything
Jan 3 2012,negative,well i was waiting to see this movie for quite some time but it doesnt comes out as interesting or awesome as the trailer is suppose to be the end was just a tragic and the movie went no where if i feel any good scene which blew was the accident anne hathaway had on the road but the cinematography was just spellbounding
Jan 2 2012,negative,had its charming moments but was another example of how not all novels work as films
Jan 2 2012,neutral,expected for a long time but the film was just  a slide show
Jan 2 2012,negative,blah felt pretty much nothing for either character and i remember jim sturgess being far more charming in almost every other movie ive seen him in what happened
Jan 2 2012,positive,not a film if you are feeling down yes romantic but not in the pretty woman style more like something out of my life the story arc is good but keeps chopping around too much to the point where you dont know where you are in the story ok but you have been warned be in a good mood when you see this
Jan 2 2012,negative,gimmick movie and the premise just doesnt work  its hard to root for a couple when one of the pair is a complete jerk that doesnt deserve recognition  and those scenes play way too long  hathaway is likeable enough as usual but the twist is ridiculous and contrived  avoid at all costs
Jan 2 2012,negative,poor producing mixed with talented acting give you a very confusing movie
Jan 2 2012,negative,the movie is filmed in a nice style but other than that nothing workslacks emotion unbelievably
Jan 2 2012,negative,they say the book is pretty interesting but the movie didnt convince me so its so boring that almost made me fall asleep thats a shame due to the fact there are two great artists in it
Jan 2 2012,positive,a decent effort but  there was definitely potential for a better film anne hathaway and jim sturgess share a warm playful chemistry and a bittersweet relationship that evolves as we witness july 15th each year from the 80s right to the present
Jan 1 2012,negative,since i havent read the book my review is based simply on the movie  and it is this  dont waste your time watching this one    i get the premise that we are only seeing one day a year in the lives the these characters but we miss out on what happens the other 364 days  they gone on about what good friends they are but from what we see onscreen im left scratching my head at how they ever could have become good friends  much less how they came to fall in love with each other    somethings definitely missing
Jan 1 2012,positive,this is the kind of film that lets you know from the start where it is all going so you can just sit and enjoy the trip there   the charachters are real and well rounded they all have teir good and bad issues and their likable and unlikable traits the plot is simple but with heart and most of the acting is well above the standard for this kind of dramedy  aside from a few parts that seem to run a bit long thereby losing focus this is a nice date movie with a warm heart
Jan 1 2012,positive,one day can be a gimmick new way of a doing  and oldfashioned love story but i cant stop saying that this movie is a recover of a way of doing romantic movies with beautiful scenes and a story that allows you enter in the lives of the characters and share some emotions one of things we rarely sees nowadays
Jan 1 2012,positive,ok try feeling awesome after this  love can be sad thats the premise 
Jan 1 2012,neutral,the timeline and story that made the book so enjoyable didnt translate well into a 100 minute film resulting in a slightly disjointed and cliched chick flick
Jan 1 2012,negative,someone needs to tell anne hathaway and patricia clarkson that they suck at pulling off british accents
Jan 1 2012,negative,i love jim sturgess i really do and his acting was great in this movie because i really believed he was a drunk who fell in love with his best friend and couldnt admit it but this was the most depressing and saddest movie i have ever seen
Jan 1 2012,negative,its like they took when harry met sally and removed every single thing that was good about it and added shit accents
Jan 1 2012,positive,you are hereby advised to ignore the bad reviews and check out this fairly stunning meditation on life love and friendship
Dec 31 2011,negative,story was boring and hard to follow  anne hathaway has been in much better movies than this
Dec 31 2011,positive,this movie broke my heartbut i think not all love stories need to have a fatal ending to be good
Dec 31 2011,positive,jim sturgess so glad his screen presence has evolved from his drab across the universe days anne hathaway is good and cute of course its an indie tale about two good friendsguy and girl whose relationship continues to blossom and change over the years for two decades they change careers lovers fight cry hookup laugh marry divorceand the whole time one particular date july 15th continues to stand out as a special day though it isnt revealed why until the shocking end     what i like most is that there nothings dopey or cheesy about one day it feels real to me its a tearjerker emotionallyinvolving and the characters are interesting to follow emma and dexter are two fairly different people shes a little more levelheaded and likeable he at least in the beginning is a cocky unlikeable horndog but somehow when theyre together they are a charming and most importantly believable couple its a good one for those of us in touch with our innerhipster check it out
Dec 31 2011,neutral,the last ten minutes were great unfortunately the first one hundred and thirty eight were just  so so
Dec 31 2011,positive,my favourite movie of 2011nothing can compare
Dec 31 2011,positive,it has a wonderful message love and friendship is a cliche even in real life as we all know but non have lasted this long what is the meaning of friendship this days love family and friendship are the last things we lose even in death     plot emma and dexter have a long friendship since 1988 they are what we call best pals mates more simple best friends they have been there in the good and bad the sadness and happiness even when they have trouble with their own couples but a thing will change everything and nope is not a predictable ending and thats good enough stars for the amazing story editing and wonderful scenarios set places yes indeed    acting anne in the different times of emma was splendit stunning amazing superb incredible and also wonderful she nailed her role at its best same jim as dex he was so amazing stunning the same words i used on annes role the whole cast was incredible even jodie as tilly was incredible i have the film shes with cillian murphy perriers bounty she has an amazing accent as irish woman and shes british in real life anyway enough said stars for their effort made for the crew and director amazing job    music best part evar they all nailed the score perfectly it was joyful colorful wonderful and beautiful stars for everyone i will always have this music in my heart    to end this review 3  a half stars of 5 enjoy and hasta la proxima amigosas chao bless you all and happy new year  december 31 2011
Dec 31 2011,positive,i actually really liked this movie neat concept and good acting
Dec 30 2011,negative,tedious tragic terrible  a real bummer  impossible to critique without giving away major spoilers  also gimmicky
Dec 30 2011,positive,this movie was tremendously sad however it had moments of charm and hope  simple story and definitely a flick for a night at home with someone special to ease the evening  time is precious and should never be wasted
Dec 29 2011,positive,very good movie the acting was fabulous i am a big fan of ann hathaway
Dec 29 2011,negative,absolutely horrible  thats how id describe this anne hathaways british accent was just laughable and from then on it was snooze time avoid this at all costs
Dec 29 2011,neutral,i like the concept of the movie but i dont like hathaway sturgess puts forth a solid performance but seems too whiny at times
Dec 29 2011,positive,loved it hate what happened but like the ending
Dec 29 2011,neutral,much better than the book a nice tale of love and loss
Dec 29 2011,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this movie although i did find it a bit of a tear jerker
Dec 29 2011,positive,i enjoyed this film adaptation of the novel by the same name  i found myself wrapped up in the lives of emma  dex all over again
Dec 29 2011,negative,i love anne hathaway but it was apparent she listened to three different dialect tapes and then just combined them all aside from that the movie was flat and completely neutered the source material this goes into the time travellers wife category of terrible booktoscreen adaptations the difference is that this one at least had the promise of being filmable
Dec 29 2011,positive,after one day together  july 15th 1988 their college graduation  emma morley anne hathaway and dexter mayhew jim sturgess begin a friendship that lasts a lifetime shes a workingclass girl who dreams of making the world a better place hes a wealthy charmer who thinks the world is his playgroundfor the next two decades key elements of their relationship are experienced over the same day each yeartogether and far apart we see dex and em through their friendships and fights hopes and missed opportunities laughter and tears somewhere along their journey these two people realise what they are searching and hoping for has been there all along as the true meaning of that one day back in 1988 is revealed they come to terms with the nature of love and life itself     also stars tom mison tim key rafe spall jodie whittaker josephine de la baume patricia clarkson and ken scott    directed by lone scherfig
Dec 29 2011,positive,its a very interesting premise  pick one day in life of two individuals and track the progress in their lives and relationship for the next twenty years the moment i put my eyes on the poster i knew this is a film i must see and although i liked it a quite a bit here is another film that could have been so much more    first of all the concept itself doesnt really work in the film instead of feeling like its one random and specific day for 20 years which in this case is july 15 the film feels like one sequence after another and if someone didnt explain the concept through the subtitlestexts it would be very difficult to understand that something different is at work here the acting of the two leads never really created the emotional yearning that such a romantic clever concept can bring we never really cheered for both of them to come together because we never really connected to them since this after all is a film of two people failure to build the character of those two people ultimately ruined it    that being said i am a hopeless romantic and you have to love the story of two people who sort of grows up together bump into each other stand by each other reinvent each other only to find themselves at the end and lose eventually i was waiting for the emotional end that never came but its still story to love and to hold near to our heart because its a fantasy that we share what if we had someone right in front of our eyes whom we never really watched do we know the people we live with for 20 years what would have happened if fate didnt intervene on july 15 1988     i can understand why people love the book so much i just wished for a much better film still its a film i recommend to everyone who wants to feel love in a gloomy winter evening
Dec 28 2011,negative,worst love story ever anne hathaway was great in a sad story most of the movie was boring and then just when it was getting better it took a nose dive i dont hate many movies but this is one of them
Dec 28 2011,negative,this movie sucked i hated it
Dec 28 2011,positive,mediocre at best  its hard to like the leading male in this movie  the main reason i went to see this was because of anne hathaway  i do like the actor jim sturgess however i didnt like this movie because it didnt keep the audience entertained  this is a slow moving move which shows the attraction between two individuals over a span of twenty years  this movie is about lost love and it is sad which would explain my review and three star rating
Dec 28 2011,positive,35 ill want to watch this one again pretty soon  very powerful and moving romance that is told in a relatively unique and original fashion  putting the aftermath of their first night at the end of the film is key as well  it heightens the emotion of the ending and bringing it to a rather satisfying and bittersweet conclusion which is precisely what they were going for  this is probably the best contemporary film of its kind ive seen in a while but ill have to see it again to form a more definite opinion  the little vignettes whether extremely brief or fairly prolonged are fascinating as is the passage of time  top notch performances as well  very well done
Dec 28 2011,positive,an incredible story
Dec 27 2011,positive,friends who become lovers seem to always get each other better than lovers who become friends
Dec 27 2011,negative,one day i will claim never to have watched this
Dec 27 2011,positive,likebuena vintage love history
Dec 27 2011,positive,i like this though most of the critics are negative
Dec 26 2011,positive,this movie was affirmatively a total romance i didnt expect that much at first but seeing from how much i wept i can only say that its very touching both actors played the roles terrifically and i cant imagine for better actors sturgess was charming through the whole movie and hathaway just what you call a sweet girl that you could never get tired to see the story itself was incredible and beautifully told in my very own opinion the only significant thought that the movie left me was i dont think i could ever be as strong as dex being left by the person that you love most in this world but then again emma had loved dex for almost forever now its just dexs turn to love her even when shes not around anymore overall this movie has made its way to be one of my most favorite movies of all times
Dec 26 2011,positive,tragically romantic
Dec 26 2011,neutral,pretty good but also quite sad  cherie says the book is a lot better
Dec 26 2011,positive,the most beautiful part is just the poster
Dec 25 2011,positive,definitely chic flick
Dec 24 2011,neutral,points given for trying something experimental and inventive but its not a movie that coheres together  one day takes a look into the life of two people anne hathaway and jim sturgess after they almost drunkenly hook up after graduating on july 15th 1988  you get to see every july 15th in their lives until you reach present day with them sometimes being together and sometimes going very different directions with their lives  i do appreciate a movie that tries something new but it is like they came up with this great concept but then didnt know where to go with it and it feels very underwritten  it has a lot of trappings of a sappy romantic comedy and it ends up playing out like a nicholas sparks movie  hathaway and sturgess are both likable enough good looking and have a decent chemistry together although i do think the character that sturgess plays is incredibly inconsistent  he whines and cries whenever hathaway isnt being receptive but then is a royal wanker to her when she is  it feels a bit disjointed as you may expect it would but my biggest problem with the film is that i never at any point bought that this is a 21 year arc  they date it with music references and change in personal styles and grooming but it never feels like a years worth of development has passed between scenes more like a week to a month at most and there would be a lot more change than they exhibit  even looking at myself i have grown so much in the past year from a number of different standpoints and it never feels in the movie like they are making any progression at all in terms of development  good idea bad execution
Dec 24 2011,negative,listen i dont mind anne hathaway but which ever way you slice it she was horribly miscast as emma
Dec 24 2011,negative,the film itself is aesthetically beautiful  it sets a lowlight european savory sort of mood that is depressing yet artistic and rather calming however anne hathaways fraud accent delegitimizes the european part and the film grows less and less appealing as jim sturgesss character goes from attractive college boy to creepy television host  an unnecessary change that definitely takes away from the cool mood set in the beginning as a desperate attempt to make audience members cry one day also plays the cancer card and another rather depressing twist that for some or for most will ruin an otherwise decent movie if you want to be depressed and bitter about a horrific ending that you may or may not cry at personally i laughed check out one day
Dec 23 2011,positive,60 good but not enough
Dec 23 2011,negative,watched because of hathaway alas her accent was horrible and all over the map sad bland story
Dec 23 2011,positive,i think this movie deserves at least 85 in my humble opinion  me likey this movie  i criedddddd
Dec 23 2011,positive,sweet and lovely reminding me of when harry met sally both are saying men cant purely be friends with women theres always been an attraction and it took several years for the main characters to realize that the love theyve been waiting for has been there all along one day is a moving romantic drama showing only one day which is july 15th throughout the years i love the ending it shows how the july 15th 1988 went for dexter and emma the beginning of their friendship
Dec 22 2011,negative,weak acting combined with poor scriptresult is a way below average movie
Dec 22 2011,positive,the story develops very slowly but the last part was a shock and really sad
Dec 22 2011,negative,an interesting premise but by about 1994 i lost interest
Dec 22 2011,negative,two lovely characters but an eternity of silly romcom melodramatic fluff render this flick incomprehensible its clear to all that both characters after drifing apart for some time will end up together the only surprise was that the film killed off the females character in a vicious way its hard to understand why a hardworking woman would fall for a handsome and charming sleazeball  all right hathaway is lissome and a pleasure to look at   all women would love to believe that their love would ensnare the man of their dreams but does it have to take so long to do it
Dec 21 2011,positive,i did enjoy this movie because the characters in it were so loveable i liked the way the characters were developed   it was interesting to see how they aged as time progressed  it was funny refreshing and not like every love story ive seen  i liked the way the costuming showed emmas character develop from an awkward teen to a poised young woman  the ending was a bit choppy and disconnected  i understand the message but i think it could have been delivered better
Dec 21 2011,neutral,jim sturgess was really good but no one else was it was a bad movie based on a bad book i felt like it went too fast and i didnt really know the characters
Dec 21 2011,positive,why did it have to end that way
Dec 21 2011,negative,an inadequate effort of a romantic drama one day tells the story of dexter and emma two university of edinburgh graduates whose lives keep intertwining on the 15th of july st swithins day each year the story continues for about 23 years now a task like this was always going to be extremely difficult to do coherently and that is the main downfall of the film the incoherence its just utterly unrealistic to expect things to happen as they do from year to year and the fact that the two continue to love each other despite not seeing each other for year long intervals at a time it makes very little sense to me    this obvious problem could be compensated by a great cast and wellwritten script unfortunately this film has neither there is very little chemistry between hathaway and sturgess and what is there is so obviously faked it will nearly put you to sleep with a better cast i dare say this film could have been engrossing and dramatic the script too lacks emotion and depth the lines are often too obvious and predictable and the most romantic lines seem to come when sturgess character is drunk beautiful eh    the twist at the climax of the film is emmas death in a road accident i havent read the book so i dont know exactly how it happens there but in the film it really appears that the accident is just added in to make a horrendously boring undramatic film seem exciting admittedly it gives one a fright but not much else  the ending is a slight crescendo from the rest of the film after emmas death the film becomes more enjoyable and starts to invoke an enthusiasm in the viewer however its too little too late for what is ultimately a failure from the filmmakers    one day does not come recommended
Dec 20 2011,negative,really slow and sad the end
Dec 20 2011,positive,very excellent moviegirlie girlie though
Dec 20 2011,positive,i laughed cried really nice story
Dec 20 2011,positive,kinda slow kinda annoying kinda cute it grows on you
Dec 19 2011,positive,while theres certainly innovation here and i generally enjoy romantic films and i certainly enjoyed this one i have to admit that theres something lacking in the way it ended the actors did as best they could with the material but maybe its just that mushycushy feeling and predictability you always get with these films that sometimes just doesnt cut it for me
Dec 19 2011,positive,why do you always have to fall for the bad guys and when you get them die
Dec 19 2011,positive,interesting to watch people grow on screen very naturally done you can love someone but does not mean that you like em all along
Dec 19 2011,positive,very sentimental beautifully acted by the leads but the movie lacks the deep meanings intended to exist in the original book
Dec 19 2011,positive,nice romantic movie with the mess life is short
Dec 19 2011,negative,this film lacks dramatic impact for much of its length and that with unappealing and undetermined characters too although halfway until the climax i felt the emotions were much better played they had me in tears there
Dec 19 2011,positive,good moviea story not only about love but also about life
Dec 18 2011,positive,a romantic tale with great actors
Dec 18 2011,positive,surprised it was as well done as it was but i may have been biased because of anne hathaway  she is terrific in everything  im not sure what was gained in a less than ten year modernization  i preferred the 80s references of the novel
Dec 18 2011,positive,anne hathaways pixie haircut  a winner
Dec 18 2011,neutral,the person who did the text tile for each year did a fantastic job my fav part of the movie was the titles music was good but the story was ok it was dragged on too much i also like the poster
Dec 18 2011,negative,in a british accent twas rubbish
Dec 18 2011,positive,its good to know the true love of your life no matter how long we can actually be together
Dec 17 2011,positive,interesting and entertaining
Dec 17 2011,positive,loved and hated the twist
Dec 17 2011,positive,one of the most enjoyable reflective chickflick romances ive chanced upon in a long while perhaps its the two decades since highschool graduation or just the carpe diem feel of this one day in a year sampling frequency of this movie but i felt it trumps the sunsetsunrise trilogy by a country mile a cautionary tale of friendship ruined by plato and murphy
Dec 17 2011,negative,12 out of     adapted from the recent romance novel of the same name which was written by david nicholls who also penned this film adaptation one day is a romantic drama of taste style and what we are expected to accept as wit surely i detect the style but the taste and the wit are terribly outofplace or maybe i should just say they arent there because more than likely this is the case    the genre of romance has never been a favorite but when one that is wellwritten and able to work around the many clichés of the genre comes along i find myself able to enjoy it when it comes to romance i suppose im more of a classic kind of guy ive always found the clichés found in those films more endurable and easy to forget about than the ones present in modern day romantic tales nowadays things just feel so familiar and hokey and while i was most definitely hoping for something special and different out of one day i cant say i liked it one bit    granted its not a godawful movie but id still call it a pretty bad one nonetheless its a story of two starcrossed lovers  emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess  who meet on the night of their college graduation and spend a night together this fateful night is not however about sex it is about the forming of a friendship and its one that they will attempt to keep alive for years to come approximately 23     throughout the film we follow these two friends as they have this contrived onandoff relationship its as if one thinks theyre still dating the other while the other is meeting their sexual and romantic needs elsewhere as far as i can recall the couple never truly calls it quits the film jumps from yeartoyear stopping only on the anniversary of when they first met sometimes they are happily together other times things arent as simple    for instance emma is in london working as a teacher and she meets a man who is initially attractive in more ways than one he is ian rafe spall whose father timothy is amongst one of my personal favorite performers and emma finds him interesting at first but she longs for dexters love and he longs for hers however he finds work in the entertainment business as a host on two separate television programs one a late night program with the other being a video game talk show    the film never gets confusing when its jumping from one year to another it stays completely mainstream and uncomplicated in the way it tells its story but thats precisely the problem theres absolutely nothing new to be experienced here and one day does not intend to pull the kind of punches that probably could have made it work the love story is 100 cliché as are the two lovers at its center ill admit that nearly every major or minor character is wellportrayed but acting is one thing and character writing is another this movie has one of those right and the other terribly terribly wrong    so with that out of the way weve got a terribly lost movie without depth insight or emotional resonance theres absolutely nothing to connect to no human impulses that went into the films making or writing and at that its a pointless waste of your time any film within any drama has the potential to work well even with the clichés seemingly assigned to it but this one revels in such conventions and doesnt even make a simple attempt to shake free of them also it suffers from a destructive delusion that you need admittedly smooth and impressive cinematography to make a romance effective my problem with the film and its appealing visual presentation is that the style itself tends to distract from the story but then again the story that we are distracted from following isnt all that interesting anyways trust me this isnt one youll regret skipping out on
Dec 17 2011,negative,without having the funny and smart insights of their thoughts this movie is nothing but an interesting concept done wrong just avoid it and read the book instead at least original material is funny because this attempt at teaching us a life lesson about love and missing chances is dull and uninspiring it just goes on and on and on and then bam its over thank god for that
Dec 16 2011,positive,a must see romantic movieenglish accent is the best
Dec 16 2011,positive,solid film but i was kind of disappointed at the end i expected the story to pull more emotion out of me than it did but it definitely makes me want to read the book
Dec 16 2011,negative,so bad i lost interest and turned it off
Dec 16 2011,negative,tedious with a wtf ending
Dec 16 2011,positive,beautiful romantic comedy
Dec 16 2011,positive,this was a good movie but after having read the book which i absolutely loved i had high expectations and the movie just didnt do it justice it does span 20 years so it is a bit long anne hathaway is excellent as emma
Dec 15 2011,negative,sucked terrible awful waste of money
Dec 15 2011,negative,was umm ok oh who am i kidding it was boring o predictable
Dec 15 2011,positive,honestlyi cried such a touching story about love and friendship and how people can hurt each other without even knowing
Dec 15 2011,positive,i really liked it nice movie
Dec 15 2011,positive,not a feel good movie and im sure the book was much better than the movie
Dec 14 2011,negative,i enjoy romantic comedies but this movie just sucked it was so damn boring i couldnt even finish it anne hathaway is capable of more she didnt do a damn thing in this movie
Dec 14 2011,positive,awesome extremely sad this brings out emotions
Dec 14 2011,neutral,you might just might like the characters if and only if you have ever been in love with your best friend casting should have been better jim sturgess is not a guy i would have been friends with let alone fall in love
Dec 14 2011,positive,didnt quite live up to expectations but was still enjoyable felt a big long and slow in places but overall a sweet and warming romance
Dec 13 2011,positive,since expectations were not high i can say that i enjoyed the movie i found a little nostalgic in a good way the performances are good as the script but it might be better explored in the hands of a woody allen for example i recommend it but do not make the film your main program
Dec 13 2011,positive,the book brought me to tears because it is soo good the movie made me cry with disappointment how dare lone scherfig who directed the flawless an education trash the book by employing a chemistrydeprived pair
Dec 13 2011,negative,look im a big fan of romance movies what straight guy isnt  well ok you got me there im probably the only one that digs them because as humans and creatures of emotion we make love stories and they make us but this movie which is considered a romance falls short of being one the thing i could not get over was anne hathaways fake british accent i think i would have had more respect for anne had she not resorted to such a speech impairment the actors aside of her are not very much believable  the story takes place in a timeline span of 20 years but really it seems more then that because the actors along with the script go around in circles and never really leading anywhere i like romance movies because much like literature it carries great universal themes and symbolic meanings this movie does not accomplish that the characters lack substance and motifs thereby ultimately leading to story surrounding  two friends who lack direction and emotion stay clear from this one if you are looking for a romantic movie starring anne hathaway i highly reccomend love  other drugs otherwise this movie plain sucks one day you will thabk me for this
Dec 12 2011,positive,loved the book movie bit of a let down but still had me in tears
Dec 12 2011,positive,i love you dex so much i just dont like you anymore  engaging the popcorn chewing time passed well as there are too many ups and downs than in a distinctively mechanical romance film
Dec 12 2011,positive,one great story nothing more to sayi want the book
Dec 12 2011,positive,i did like this reminded me of city of angels in the fact of one should appreciate all that they have
Dec 12 2011,positive,good storyvery sad though
Dec 11 2011,positive,not a fan of romantic comedy but kind of liked this movie though its not really a happy ending  cant help but fall in love with emma anne hathaway though the settings dont quite make too much sense  perhaps its the directing as the acting was fine and the overall plot was okay  however this sentimental movie is worth a viewing  visuals and music were fantastic too
Dec 11 2011,positive,anne hathaway is such a classic babe her short hair was so beautiful i got caught up in the story  finally cried out when i knew what was about to happen great story
Dec 11 2011,positive,what a horrible ending to such a beautiful love story
Dec 11 2011,positive,hathaway plays a dreamer and sturgess plays a playboy the nature of their relationship unfolds during two decades worth of chance encounters on july 15th they find that what theyve been looking for in life has been there all along its well acted id recommend it
Dec 11 2011,negative,sucks ass omfgosh
Dec 11 2011,positive,great cast and a neat plot device turn a very generic movie into something worth watching  its mostly the cast though  jim sturgess is fantastic again
Dec 11 2011,positive,anne hathaway and jim sturgess are absolutely dazzling in a movie that is a fairly standard best friends destined to be more than friends love story the story spans 20 years and at times i felt like it rushed through what could have been poignant and memorable moments to keep the momentum going although the movie suffered from we only have 2 hours to tell this intricate and convoluted story the cast was incredible anne hathaway jim sturgess rafe spall patricia clarkson and the wardrobe and makeup to effectively age the characters was phenomenal  i will need a second watching to pick up some of the subtle nuances of the plot  overall i really liked this film
Dec 11 2011,positive,after 20 years cool
Dec 11 2011,positive,it is not romeo and juliet people it is a story about love and life of ordinary people
Dec 11 2011,positive,its not something for the first date its an experience to see with the one you love
Dec 10 2011,positive,not what i expected
Dec 10 2011,positive,ending is soo sad i cried my eyes out but definately great movie
Dec 10 2011,positive,i didnt expect this film could be so touching
Dec 10 2011,negative,the premise for this movie is clever yet simple  its the story of two peoples relationship from friendship to marriage over 20 years  it tells their story on the exact same day each year july 15th  dexterjim sturgess and emma anne hathaway start out with a potential one night stand then become best friends and eventually lovers  but one day is a very boring cliched movie  i found myself nodding off a few times and honestly disinterested in either character  i really like sturgess and hathaway but not in this  their chemistry was lacking and they just seemed like they were going through the motions and uninterested in anything at all really  i was hoping for something like a lot like love but got something that was melodramatic too long boring and lifeless  on the flip side to all that emily really liked it  so females take what a male says about this movie with a grain of salt  its not geared for us so on that level it hit the mark if the ladies like it  guys watch something else ladies grab the tissue and popcorn
Dec 10 2011,positive,decent movie with good star cast playing their part wellshorter length might have made it more appealing
Dec 10 2011,positive,i really want to see this film
Dec 10 2011,neutral,too goddamn formulaic
Dec 10 2011,neutral,i couldnt get all the way through this movie its played up as some beautiful love story maybe it is if you can sit through the depressing first half but i couldnt make it oh and hathaways accent was so bad it was literally unrecognizable as to what she was saying as certain points dont waste your time
Dec 10 2011,positive,even though anne hathaway is not convincing enough as a british in this movie she still brings great presence in this movie with great chemistry with fellow actor jim sturgess overall an alright movie that needs a tighter plot  timing
Dec 9 2011,positive,im undecided on much of this movie anne hathaway was really good she always is i found the story hard to follow and a little pretentious
Dec 9 2011,neutral,heard this story before only last time more happened and it didnt take so long
Dec 9 2011,negative,a little sappy and a little slow
Dec 9 2011,neutral,a nice european backdrop and good performances doesnt help cliches and an uneven plot
Dec 9 2011,positive,whatever happens tomorrow we had today ill always remember it  one day by david nicholls
Dec 9 2011,positive,im avoiding the critics even the hardesthearted will excite a sorrow because of the bittersweet one day one of the best this year
Dec 9 2011,positive,soo classic in a good way
Dec 9 2011,positive,this british film directed by lone scherfig is not bad at all david nicholls adaptation of his 2009 novel of the same name was much better than the critics say anne hathaway and jim sturgess had a chemistry which worked most of the time maybe there is lack of emotion and depth but i have to say that is usually skilfully compensated by fresh narrative twists executed very well    nothing spectacular but good enough for a relaxing night with your girlfriend or better half
Dec 9 2011,positive,despite all the bad reviews not a bad film its slightly implausible in parts and the core idea of two vastly dissimilar people being deeply in love despite their differences and pretending to be just good friends for years is just plain silly but the acting is good and the characters plausible for eighty percent of the time  i enjoyed it but im soppy like that
Dec 8 2011,positive,this is the kind of movie you should not like because it is sappy and predictable and likely is nowhere near as good as the book however the characters are likeable and the story pleasant enough
Dec 8 2011,neutral,fairly disappointing movie did not care for the ending
Dec 8 2011,positive,it was a really sweet movie watching main charcters evolve in twenty years of ups and downs was just amazingbut it does have points where it lags and they give me a bunch of false moment like makng you thing someone is getting marriedbut overall a sweet movie with a very sweet ending
Dec 8 2011,positive,i liked it as much as the book
Dec 8 2011,neutral,i am not a sappy person and really it has been a long time since i watched anything romantic  not a romcom fan but this was well its watchable with a bunch of girlfriends and a big box of tissue
Dec 8 2011,negative,boring long movie nothing happens
Dec 8 2011,positive,very good movie not just another romantic drama movie
Dec 8 2011,positive,if you didnt watch the movie dont read this  this movie touched my heart despite the fact the story is so sad definitely a favorite both emma and dexter did great job  friends who love each other by the circumstance is not helping for them to be together  by the end of the movie the tragedy of emmas death made me shade a tear this is a very sad romantic movie it was badly good
Dec 8 2011,neutral,good performances but lack continuity
Dec 7 2011,negative,so slow and terrible ending
Dec 7 2011,positive,i like anne hathaway so much  fate is like playing a game with us not giving us what we want at the right moment  so grab the chance if its here
Dec 6 2011,negative,i dont like romantic movies
Dec 6 2011,positive,some unexpected moments i feel this movie  was dragged on but was heart warming
Dec 6 2011,positive,hilarious meg ryan should have warned her toalways wear your helmet  d
Dec 6 2011,negative,terribly cast and directed the chemestry and storytelling were so bad i didnt feel a thing for the characters
Dec 6 2011,neutral,actually i am not a fan of chick flick movies except for one the notebook one day left me neither impressed neither dissapointed the acting was alright the design was interesting but the storyline was way too flatanne hathaway played emma a british girl who hooked up with a guy since their graduation and pass 22 years being bffs her accent was alright it was between satisfactory and disappointing throughout the film jim sturgess in his role as dexter was also weak his character a playboy who just wanted to have fun seemed too familiar he just kept being out of control and it seems like he did not suffer any consequencesthe ending was upsetting for mei never understood whythis film needed an overhaul because with this senseless dialogues confusing plot points and unnecessary characters ian the boyfriend came to my mind i found it difficult to like this film there were some good points such as acting score and some comic but they were overshadowed by the bad
Dec 6 2011,negative,well i would like to hope the book is better than the movie cause this movie wasnt very good i feel like there should have been more story for each year  more what they had been up to  more interaction between them anne hathaways english accent was awful but on the bright side how hot is jim sturgess 
Dec 6 2011,positive,sometimes the timing is just off the film shows that really gracefully sad sad yet romantic but not too cheeky move enjoyed it
Dec 5 2011,negative,a bad potpourri of love me if you dare and 500 days of summer     ps jim sturgess shouldnt be an actor
Dec 5 2011,positive,if youre too lazy to read the book but are still interested in knowing the story and wont mind to know lesser details the movie adaptation will suffice  anne and jim are the perfect emma and dexter for me
Dec 5 2011,positive,different from any other romantic film youll ever see its slow but honest and itll stay with you
Dec 5 2011,negative,the aim of the movie  telling a romantic story with depth  is admirable but isnt achieved the chemistry between hathaway and sturgess is not there and this is not their best performance on top of that hathaways british accent is awful and distracting
Dec 5 2011,positive,a beautiful  mystifying film that spans over the course of 20 years on july 15 st swethins day it remarkably shows how these two people em and dex dex  em how they wasted their whole lives loving each other  never truly realizing it a wonderful story of true love  a lasting friendship that goes on forever anne hathaway has some great moments and the director tries to have some fun
Dec 4 2011,positive,predictable and emotionally manipulative but decent and entertaining points for concept about 20 min too long
Dec 4 2011,positive,well this was so good devastating really loved it
Dec 4 2011,positive,loved it for nostalgic reasons as same era as when i went to uni in scotland and went to london after graduating a clever idea and not just a romcom and definitely not a hollywood ending the book is however  far  better hathaway also did not get the accent right
Dec 4 2011,positive,a beautiful  mystifying film that spans over the course of 20 years on july 15 st swethins day it remarkably shows how these two people em and dex dex  em how they wasted their whole lives loving each other  never truly realizing it a wonderful story of true love  a lasting friendship that goes on forever 
Dec 4 2011,positive,a slowtempo movie and this drama almost made it for a decent rate but the last 15 minutes save the movie so three stars is the rating
Dec 4 2011,positive,lovely still crying
Dec 4 2011,positive,i am quite surprised that this movie has got so many bad reviews its a good movie
Dec 4 2011,positive,oh cmon critics maybe this is not as good as the book i wouldnt know because i didnt read it but this is an amazing story that brought floods of tears to my eyes it is a truly moving story id also like to stress the acting performances seemingly effortless and all though im not normally a fan of hathaway she is perfect  in this role and so is her performance and yes he is indeed an idiot but he does love her which is hard not to see  great and amazingly romantic
Dec 4 2011,positive,i have to admit that i did like this movie it almost succeeded in making me cry which is really something its about two people who admit theyre in love with each other too late in their lives even if they met when they were just 23 years old after their college graduation  so its got a pretty clear and strong message never wait till its too late take your chances whenever you can this is probably the main reason why i did like one day i did also enjoy the locations the way scenes were put together the whole concept of the movie and the soundtrack     but could this movie have been better the answer is yes for sure first i cant see this great chemistry between hathaway and sturgess they just dont fit together in my opinion and no matter what you do to jims hair hell never look like a 40something man then the story was someway confusing at some points it took me more than one hour to realize how was this project structured once i did realize that i saw how beautiful it all was but still it took to long to realize that this was the story of two people who wouldnt admit they are in love with each other and the main characters kept on behave incoherently here and there throughout the movie     shocking ending it really caught me by surprise and made me understand how much i got into the story so thats another positive point so yes i think its worth watching because its really set in a very peculiar way but be prepared to see a quite dramatic depressing movie
Dec 4 2011,positive,this a movie about 2friends relationship over the span of 20yrs i really loved dexters role and jim played him welltotally identified with him   i found annes accent to be annoying    the beginning of the movie was slow and as it progressed it had me then it lost me i kept thinking it was showin like a 10yr span but it just kept goin on and on and there were years when nothin happened which i thought could have been skipped  i didnt particularly like the ending where they showed what happen on the first day they spent together it didnt add anythin to the movie    the movie seems to focus on the fact that they should be together but really there wasnt anythin keeping them apart except themselves they were both in unfulfilled relationships throughout their lives
Dec 3 2011,neutral,everyone was bawling in the theatre i felt kind of manipulated and secretly wished that i hadnt spent the money to see itit was exhausting
Dec 3 2011,neutral,everyone was bawling in the theatre i felt kind of manipulated and secretly wished that i hadnt spent the money to see itit was exhausting
Dec 3 2011,positive,in a way i think this story would have been better told as twenty 30 minute episodes on tv  that being said the score ties everything together emotionally and the film is uniquely touching
Dec 3 2011,positive,wow drama super powerful movie amazing acting
Dec 3 2011,negative,this would have been a better movie if the characters were more evolved  i would guess it is a better book than movie for this reason
Dec 3 2011,negative,was not good till the end
Dec 3 2011,positive,wasnt as cute of a romantic story as i thought it would be it was just kind of meh i can give more details if anyone cares that would have spoilers in it
Dec 3 2011,negative,horrible british accent by hathaway is distracting
Dec 3 2011,neutral,sweet but monotonous

Dec 3 2011,negative,i expected something more of this story was  predictable it became boring improved in the final but for me the movie has too much time and no adds nothing new
Dec 2 2011,positive,its really cute until you finish it then its just heartbreaking
Dec 2 2011,positive,i would beg to differ its okay for anne with that brit tongue
Dec 2 2011,negative,one star because none was an option seriously worse movie ever
Dec 2 2011,positive,very very good little bit weird movie full of not funny and lame british humor which makes one laugh just from how antifun it is  nice story the way emma gets hit by car stays in head like a stamp that was just shocking  liked it
Dec 2 2011,positive,love anne hathaway when shes not telling jokes and jim strurgess looked pretty hot playing the role of dexter  sweet feel good rom com over all
Dec 2 2011,negative,very bad moviebad script bad music predictable from line 1 till the enda total waste of time
Dec 2 2011,positive,good story with beautiful scenes but just not well told and not impressive hathaway with her cloth on showed some acting yet not impressive either
Dec 2 2011,neutral,i couldnt get through the book so i dont know why i watched the moviedidnt expect the ending but really the rest was rather boring
Dec 1 2011,positive,directed by lone scherfig color force 2011 starring anne hathaway jim sturgess rafe spall and patricia clarkson    genre drama romance    question remember the date when you met the love of your life some romantic relationships start right away but there are those that have to ferment before they come to fruition however what happens when you become friends with them and they dont realize youre their soulmate yet well there is reallife and then there is the movie version hollywood loves stories like this dont they     okay i watched one day today and it shot me right back to my youth and this one particular guy in my life that i remained friends with and thats all i will say about that you all probably have that one person in your life that you were willing to sacrifice your passion for because the other doesnt quite see you that way yet hopefully well thats one day in a nutshell    two university grads emma and dex in edinburgh meet on graduation day  a specific day to be exact and strike up a relationship that could have ended that day however fate steps in and veers the two in a direction of a great friendship even though there are feelings there over the course of the movie you see both living their lives post graduation finding their way separately but still in contact its called one day because we see them connect via phone or in person on the same day of the year that they met and thats it  no more details of the story because this one took a path that i wasnt expecting and want you to discover it on your own    lets talk about the actors i am a fan of anne hathaway i have to be i have a daughter and hathaways early movies the princess diaries 1  2 and ella enchanted were played a lot over the past few years anyway i enjoy watching anne hathaway emma act and she was really good in one day she personified the typical female who is in love with her best friend lost in her path of being an adult because she holds no confidence in herself all while struggling to understand the inevitable  that the guy will probably never realize shes the one she particularly showed the angst of her unrequited love of dex played by jim sturgess convincingly well however she was supposed to have a british accent that went in and out but that really didnt bother me all that much    although unfamiliar with any of his previous work jim sturgess dex did a good job at performing opposite of anne hathaway dex personified the bad boy character that is spoiled and thinks he deserves to have his cake and eat it too no matter who gets hurt in the process sure many leading romantic male leads share this persona but usually they have redeeming qualities revealed along the way to evoke some sort of sympathy except for his friendship with emma and sometimes he didnt quite deserve it i didnt see many likable qualities however that may have been the point you will see    does this hollywood story have a happy ending well you know i am not going to tell you i will say that i giggled a few times cried a bit okay maybe one scene got me to cry a bit more and i am still pondering the ending one detail that i should mention its called one day because the movie only reveals one day the same date each year yes i mentioned this before but it was a little awkward at first because many things happen on other days of the year that you would expect to see in the film but are only mentioned or discussed later it took some getting used toso now you know    my favorite thing that somethings only happen in the movies    my least favorite thing that somethings only happen in the movies    rating pg13  length 107 minutes    review 6 out of 10
Nov 30 2011,positive,refreshing and beautiful story
Nov 30 2011,positive,i loved this movie just as much as i did the book which is rare
Nov 30 2011,positive,light hearted fun and flirty with a dramatic ending thatll leave you shattered
Nov 30 2011,neutral,im not a big sucker for gooey weepy romance moviesi wasnt expecting anything magical and i was right it wasnt magical it didnt restore my faith in love i didnt even believe they were in love at the end i was neither impressed nor disappointed     i havent read the book so i cannot compare it to the movie but stil considering all the praise the book gets one can think it deserved a better movie adaptation     its like when harry met sally crashing into city of angels with a poor written script and no chemistry between its leading actors starting from the beginning as most of the viewers i was thinking couldnt they have found one single british actress for the role how hard could it be anne hathaway who i usually love already has a bad reputation when it comes to her british accent and we can clearly see she doesnt care about it that much because there were absolutely no improvements her accent is terribly distracting    there is no sense of love between the two of them and i found it to be a real challenge caring whether they got together at the end or not    hathaways accent and the lack of chemistry between sturgess and hathaway aside the acting was alright directing by lone scherfig is quite good although itll never top last movie an education locations were also great  the settings were more appealing than the leads but i wasnt a very big fan of its soundtrack i think soundtrack is very important in these kind of movies to set the mood but it didnt work for me especially the last elvis castello song is a very bad choice it drowns out all the symphaty if u had any    and yet its not all bad despite its poor writing it had its moments which made me think that ill never find love and probably die alone come on im not made of stone i still shed a few tears there are some beautiful moments in the last fifteen minutes or so giving a pleasantly melancholic ending to an otherwise soso film    so in conclusion if youre into romancedramas you might like it for other ones its not a must see still if you wanna watch i cant stop you but i suggest go play skyrim or something thats what i did after watching the movie
Nov 30 2011,positive,movie just for girls sweet romantic heart to heart story with lovely ending
Nov 29 2011,negative, out of four    a pretty typical melodramatic story wrapped up with nice production values  the slow moving story hits all the plot points you expect  the whole time you can see the conclusion coming    img    anne hathaway and jim sturgess become friends on graduation day in 1988  the story picks them up on july 15th of each year  they go their own ways but they always find their way back to each other    the development of the characters is pretty thin  hathaways part isnt very interesting  sturgess fairs slightly better but not much
Nov 29 2011,positive,very lovely and romantic also a bit of heavy and soul searching superb performance from anne and jim love it
Nov 29 2011,positive,absorbing sadish love story not easily relateable nicely acted well worth a watch
Nov 28 2011,negative,quite slow in parts best to watch on dvd so you can fast forward when needed
Nov 28 2011,negative,awfulboring and slow are three words to describe it i was so bored and actually left the theater and went home
Nov 28 2011,negative,awful film nothing happens until about the last 20 minutes a waste of my day
Nov 28 2011,positive,twenty years two people
Nov 28 2011,positive,sinister tragic amusing tasteful
Nov 28 2011,positive,this is a good movie
Nov 28 2011,neutral,unbearable lightness of being much 
Nov 27 2011,negative,luckily i watched this movie with someone who had read the book to fill in the confusing gaps in this poorly made adaptation of a very emotional story  one day was a very obvious choice to make a movie but it failed to deliver in so many ways  im not mad one day filmmakers im just disappointed
Nov 27 2011,neutral,i watched this by myself dont judge me
Nov 27 2011,positive,gotta readthebook really  no alternative with movie  prob worth watching if cant manage time to read the book
Nov 27 2011,positive,slightly above average at best compared to other chick flicks anyway definitely not as good as the trailer made it out to be i dont know there was just something missing
Nov 27 2011,positive,sweet flick but drags in places
Nov 27 2011,positive,quite tearjerker i know but it is not a bad movie yes i think it is more for the girls but you know when i go to the cinema i often find old ladies in the seats in a certain way this is an historic film because it covers twenty years of the life of these two guys they are friends but  they are in love he is a son of bitch drug addicted womanizer i donâtmt  think  a normal girl would have had the patience of  emma anne hathaway obviously above all i like this film because i am a fan of ms hathaway  i should say that i am a fan of london too but almost i forgot  it is cool love london paris food  all the ingredients for a good story and the final is quite sad but this daughter of him which is not daughter of her  offer us a romantic  end and a sort of continuity with emma i would like to mention romola garai which plays the first wife of dexter which despite of her name is a strong actress  i have not read the novel so i cannot compare film and book i feel fine with that
Nov 27 2011,positive,one day feels disjointed and rushed at times the episodic structure of the movie fresh and admirable as it may be takes away part of the emotional attachment this type of movie needs to make us actually care for the characters     still the film has its moments its not a great film but its not that bad either
Nov 27 2011,positive,if i am ten years younger i would enjoy like what critics are saying a mixture of a few tears with the laughsor even finding it romantic but sadly everything that emphasizes the evil affect of time is making me a little bit too overwhelmed on the other hand i totally dont think the movie is slow and the storyline isnt exicting realistic speaking life is slow and boring most of the time when you are living it there are certain steps you dont want to follow but you do it anyway with lots of  regrations afterwards but as well lots of meaningfull one days
Nov 27 2011,negative,though i like the actors i hated the characters and for a film thats built entirely around the 20 year relationship between said characters this is a fatal problem its not just hathaways attempted yorkshire accent thats the issue though it is quite terrible the chronological sceneperyear structure that apparently works so well in the book feels staccato and disruptive to the central romance which i found very hard to get behind furthermore the plot twists are as contrived as those in your average soap opera cheapening the drama and leading the films conclusion to a paltry and sentimental end
Nov 27 2011,positive,a love story of two people across twenty years
Nov 27 2011,neutral,expected more from the director of education  
Nov 26 2011,positive,the movie is ok but the book is soooo muuch better there are so much they missed
Nov 26 2011,negative,this is a good movie but i couldnt honestly say that i loved it i am surprised seeing the run time is 1 hour 47 minutes honestly i thought it was well over 2 hours as it seemed to go on and on the good things first  it is well cast i know a lot of people werent impressed with anne hathaway and her english accent but i actually thought she did okay with it i havent read the book so i dont know how close in appearance she is to emma but they certainly played her looks down i was stunned by how plain and blotchy she actually looks through most of this so i am assuming they stayed true to the character jim sturgess i thought made a good dexteralso patricia clarkson i always find her pretty good  no change here very moving as dexters mum i also appreciated that the story was a little deeper than most of this genre spanning from 1988 when emma and dexter met and then picking up each year on the same date some entries longer than others i think the final chapter of this is around 2008 so it really does give you time to watch the characters evolve you see them in different careers and other relationships they decide early on to be friends only or rather dexter decides it is always obvious that emma hoped for more finally the obvious happens and their time together comes now for the bad  seriously by this time dexter has become such a prat you wonder what she still sees in him looks obviously but even they start to fade after problems with addiction and unhealthy living im sure i cant have been the only one in the audience who thought the french jazz musician was the better bet then theres the lovely little twist in the story at 2006 wft yes i get that it was based on a book but seriously maybe that kind of crap worked in the book  it doesnt cut it in what has been marketed as a romantic movie
Nov 26 2011,neutral,it was an okmoviehoped for morethe book is worth reading though
Nov 26 2011,negative,the movie doesnt have much of a problem the directing is good and so are the actings but in the end i was sitting there wondering so what i guess what im trying to say is that it was either not a good movie or just not my type
Nov 26 2011,negative,pity jim sturgess and anne hathaway are likeable and capable actors miscast in this rather inferior drama shallow writings dry romance unmotivated performances at least songs from the soundtrack represents each year well for 20 years that this tearjerker stretches over
Nov 26 2011,neutral,found hathaways accent a bit distracting but otherwise entertaining enough
Nov 26 2011,positive,really moving destiny doesnt always get its own way true love does for a change    it sometimes gets a little slow but it has an original way to tell the story that makes it different from other romantic movies i liked as well how the characters change throughout the years and so do their clothes from the 80s to the 00s    jim sturgess a great discovery i have to say    i might read the book hopefully my oppinion about the movie wont change much
Nov 26 2011,positive,my expectations were higher about this movie but still its a successful one good performance from anne hathaway a more extended role could have been given to romola garai
Nov 26 2011,positive,supposedly this is how we grow up or what we called perfect relationship just dont try to be bound to each other the book is better than the movie btw
Nov 26 2011,neutral,didnt meet my expectations
Nov 26 2011,positive,very touchy story i am wondering how many people are actually missing out their right ones for so many years we dont  have many years to waste to finally realise the person we love at the beginning is the right one so just be brave and follow our heart in case we regret years later
Nov 23 2011,positive,dex managed to stay hot from 19882011 jim sturgess are you even real
Nov 23 2011,positive,great banter profoundly movingunexpected and  very wise a nice surprise highly recommended to all who deep down fell that one day
Nov 23 2011,negative,miscast no chemistry between the couple awful british accent by hathaway
Nov 23 2011,positive,every year on 15th july since graduation emma and dexter meet they are like this for more than 20 years but emma died in the end then dexter who was a playboy for the past 20 years for the best 20 years that he should be with emma and love emma can only choose to move on as if emma never left what if they get together from the very begining what if they dont have to spend 20 years to finally realize that all he and she had been looking for for such long time was already around them each otherwhen everytime they decide to meet each other on every july 15th for 20 years sharing sadness and happiness growing up together experiencing pains and joy in life nothing can separate them from that time on  i like this film i really doa quite good one
Nov 22 2011,neutral,the half star is for a few moments of wonderfulness that managed to sneak in mostly due to rafe spall
Nov 22 2011,positive,playing emma morley in one day anne hathaway simply outshines and she does this thing where she leaves me completely bemused talking to the walls asking if they saw what i saw i dont know if i should credit the film or anne hathaway alone she is an absolute delight to watch act one day somehow gave me exactly what i thought it would
Nov 22 2011,negative,mehhhh it plots along with accents i just couldnt get past another one of those movies where the payoff made me throw my hands in the air tricking the audience into feeling emotions some works some dont
Nov 21 2011,negative,why would anyone wanna see a movie about a guy whos clearly a prick and the nicebutprudish the audience is supposed to believe that anne hathaways kind of an ugly loser girl who irrationally falls for him especially when the audience is supposed to empathize with him
Nov 21 2011,negative,clichã c after clichã c after clichã c
Nov 20 2011,neutral,really disappointed 
Nov 20 2011,positive,really nice movie if u liked before sunset and after sunset you will like this for sure 
Nov 20 2011,neutral,doesnt have the magic of the book  this movie is hard for me to review i loved the book and spend months looking forward to the movie  but sadly the movie just couldnt compare which is normal with book to movie remakes  the producers vision of what the book translates into is rarely what i think it should be translated into  the buildup in my head is always too much  the parts i think are important are sometimes parts deemed unimportant and cut to fit the standard movie time     i liked the movie but i will probably never watch it again and it wont make any of my top lists  im not sure if anyone who hasnt read the book would like it at all because i was able to fill what was lacking in the movies storyline with what i knew from the book i had enough back story for all the parts to make sense but i dont think that anyone who hasnt read the book would feel the same way
Nov 20 2011,positive,if i give this film a good rating does that mean im a romantic or that its simply a good film god forbid could it mean both
Nov 20 2011,neutral,pretty decent movie i havent read the book though judging from the movie the book could be so much better the whole plot was tragically beautiful yet i seem to not really appreciate it much in the movie
Nov 20 2011,positive,one of my favourite books sadly the film does not have the emotional grip that the book does however good attempt
Nov 20 2011,positive,when you love someone dont waste timeas you never know when it might end
Nov 20 2011,positive,loved the book every chapter of it but there was something missing in the movie it just could be a bit more it was a bit too fast but of course its not easy to put 20 years in 2hours welllets say  it was good but not wonderful
Nov 19 2011,positive,although the movie becomes a bit boring in the middlethe story picks up brilliantly in the lsst 40 mins or soanne hathaway acts well as usual
Nov 19 2011,negative,if youre looking for a great romance this isnt it one day is clunky and uninteresting from day one
Nov 19 2011,positive,really cute love story
Nov 19 2011,negative,loved the book like loved it hated the movie i was so so so so excited to see this film reading all the extras about making the movie with the vintage clothes and the scenes i thought it was going to be awesomebut nooooo i love anna and jim especially jim 3 but this movie just left out so many good parts and some of the most romantic scenes is the book they just skipped over
Nov 19 2011,positive,dont care what the critics sayim biased and i loved it
Nov 18 2011,neutral,one day goes through troubles by skipping years of storyline and causing the sense of emotional continuity the only thing that seems to keep me entertaining is textmotions when years changing
Nov 18 2011,positive,new take on a old genre
Nov 17 2011,neutral,there are a lot of chemistry between anne hathaway and jim sturgess but one days script feels so flat slow and couldnt live up the potential of its premise and you shouldnt celebrate valentine by watching this movie with your girlboyfriend one day is all about sad love story dialogdriven and the ending is so heartbreaking
Nov 17 2011,positive,the characters were developed well enough that they could be real people the acting was pretty good too complementing the natural quality of the characters an especially touching performance by anne hathaway though it seemed to drag a little the idea of showing a span of two decades was nice because it allowed some deeper themes on life regret timing of relationships stubbornness etc to surface provoking viewers to do some introspection
Nov 17 2011,negative,i dont if its because i was ill when i watched it but i found myself willing for the end  sturgess was great  hathaway on the other hand was dire  her accent switched from english to american to irish to scottish  no yokrshire at all  there was so much of the book that was omitted  most of the good bits  not impressed  not sure why i watched it at all
Nov 16 2011,positive,didnt expect to enjoy this as much as i did because a the book was simply lovely bitter sweet and entirely engrossing and no movie can truly capture what a book can make you feel b because the poster for the film is not only a spoiler do they or dont they ever get it together but its also fairly nauseating and c because id heard many reviews calling this mediocre  disappointing  sickly sweet etc      anyway it turns out that the cast works out brilliantly despite the american who incidentally does rather well and that the story is delivered very well having me weep my little heart out even more than when reading the book  definitely one to watch again on the sofa with a cup of cocoa
Nov 15 2011,positive, 710 six for script one for chemistry
Nov 13 2011,positive,i still havent read the book even after i vowed to read it after watching the movie i think it had all the makings of a great love story the overthetop situation he found himself in as a tv star how many people are really in that role while she slaves away in her dark and dreary life are just sad i dont know if it is the way this was filmed but i didnt connect with the couple barely at all i like all the actors here the story was disjointed in a way that i think took away from the underlying love story that to me could have been epic meh just okay
Nov 13 2011,positive,definitely didnt live up to the book i was so excited to see it but it really wasnt that great
Nov 12 2011,neutral,a decent romance movie that had good acting but not enough time or depth in the story for us to fully grasp the connection between the two characters i was sadden t the twist but annoyed by the lack of time or effort i thought that would have made this movie better than dear john the vow or the notebook just sad really is all i can make out if this film
Nov 11 2011,positive,a movie about how 2 people emma and dexter went through 20 years of their life from knowing each other till the day one of them parted emma from a fresh graduate worked her life as a waitress in a restaurant until she slowly worked towards her goal of being a teacher and eventually a writer dexter on the other hand played around entered show business and eventually lost the glamour and fame they got together with other people along the way but eventually managed to get married in the end however because of all the missed opportunities in the past their happily ever after was shortlived as emma passed away the flow of the movie was quite presentable but the snapshots of 15 july from 1988 made this movie amazing with the details of their lives neatly captured in every short scene
Nov 9 2011,negative,okay very predictable
Nov 8 2011,neutral,books and movies are different as most people know by now so why try to make a movie that takes place over a 20 year timespan it doesnt work
Nov 6 2011,positive,sad to say i liked watching it wt my then girl
Nov 6 2011,positive,just go and see for yourself
Nov 6 2011,positive,very satisfying i was quite afraid of the the movie adaptation because the book was so good the movie is as faithful as screen versions can get to the original novel i would say what i really appreciate is that they bring the humanity of it on screen without making it cinematically artificial plus the characters are flawlessly casted anne hathaway and jim sturgess are thoroughly enjoyable
Nov 3 2011,positive,i really enjoyed the book so was looking forward to watching the movie a little skeptical about how the book would be portrayed in the movie as most books turned to movies can be very disappointing  i liked the movie though although found anne hathaways accent fluctuations extremely annoying sometimes she pulled off a perfect posh girl english accent but then this east end kind of deal would slip out not to mention the irish accent that would come out every now and then  left me a tad confused as to what accent she was actually supposed to be busting out  good movie definitly only a 3 star though
Nov 3 2011,negative,thoroughly depressing miserable melancholic awful and at times painful to watch this film has no redeeming features other than the elvis costello song in the end credits just a story about a notawful person coasting through life pining for an awful person surrounded by more awful people its like forrest gump but without likeable characters without an interesting plot without the humour and worst of all without heart
Nov 3 2011,positive,beautiful movies i believe the book will be great  em  dex they love each but took them 20 years life time to get together  this movie make me think of you i miss you i miss you a lot  i cherish our friendship i love you no matter where your how apart we are you make me decent mature and happy
Nov 3 2011,positive,i knew nothing about the book or film and i ended up loving this very well made solid performances and a tugging at my heart strings lovely
Nov 3 2011,negative,not a patch on the book  im not rating anne hathaway in this film
Nov 3 2011,negative,im probably the last person objective enough to review this as ive read the book prior and imagined carey mulligan to be the lead but so there ive said it and i simply dislike the movie
Nov 2 2011,positive,a beautiful story that revolves around the relationship of its 2 main characters em  dex  both embarking on different paths in life growing up apart yet together and eventually ending up pretty much where it all began on july 15 1988  its a movie that will leave u with tears in ur eyes and a smile on your face
Oct 31 2011,positive, she made you decent and in return you made her soo happy a beautiful movie about love patience and sacrifice
Oct 31 2011,neutral,this could have turned out really nicely if not for the lack of art direction something was just missing
Oct 30 2011,positive,somewhat reminiscent of comrades almost a love story but nowhere as heartwrenchingly great as the former one laughed and cried together with the maggie and leon characters but emma and dex didnt quite achieve that   not to be mistaken though one day was a decent enjoyable watch   ps emma in 2003  bonjour il ya 
Oct 29 2011,positive,good romantic drama that depicts a lifelong romance progressively over twenty years set to the same calendar date while heartbreaking this film adaptation is a respectable story of love under tangible humanised circumstances
Oct 29 2011,positive,one day is written by david nicholls reading the reviews i wasnt expecting much except anne hathaways british accent or the lack of sitting through the years flipping initially confirmed the negativity but as the film moves on to the late 90s and 2000s it was much better and the acting slowly matured at the end i shed a tear or two
Oct 28 2011,positive,3 stars may be slightly generousanne hathaway ruined yet another movie for me   couldve been a good one but i found her very annoying
Oct 28 2011,neutral,nice movie a bit boring though oh god am i getting cynical at such a young age it did get a bit better after emma got hit by a car and died what does that say about me however the climbing on the hills bit in the end was a bit too much
Oct 25 2011,positive,i love science fiction
Oct 25 2011,positive,i can agree it could have ben juste to have another actress in the leading role but it does not make the movie less charming or enjoyable
Oct 24 2011,positive,pretty good actually i think some people found it boring they were surfing the net using their iphones  but i actually cried near the ending 
Oct 22 2011,positive,melancholic  just as i likeem
Oct 22 2011,positive,one day has a wonderful storyline its a story about friendship and love about life and trying to figure out what you want to do with it   this is a storyline that is personally better suited in the book its hard to press in 20 years into a movie thats only 1 hour and 45 minutes long obviously the book that had 435 pages would be more detailed and more understanding   it was a good adaptation and the movie did follow the book well some small parts were missing and that is expected even though i felt that some of them would have been important for the story   im not going to spoil the story now but i must say that im happy that the twist in 2006 was in the movie as well im glad that they didnt change it just for the movies sake i liked the fact that you could see a scene in the movie and you would know exactly which scene in the book it was taken from seeing as the dialogues were so alike even though some of the settings might not match   i really liked jim sturgess as dexter hes incredibly goodlooking hes british and hes a good actor he played well seeing as you could understand why all those girls would fall for him but you also sympathised with him when things werent going too well i wasnt as keen on anne hathaway i think shes a good actress but they could have chosen a british one so theyd know that the accent at least would be correct i think emmas supposed to come from yorkshire and im not really sure how they speak in that part of england but her accent felt too american you could hear that it was british when you listened but it felt like she had changed the accent to make it easier to speak for someone who comes from america    other than that i quite enjoyed the movie some parts might have been too fast and for some it might be hard to understand if you havent read the book or if youre not aware of the storyline for me this was one of those movies where i feel that you should have read the book before to comprehend the story more   to sum this up it was a good movie with both emotion but also a fantastic connection between the two characters em and dex dex and em they showed that you can wait your whole life and not know whats just in front of you and that its never too late to find your true love
Oct 22 2011,positive,this movie didnt get good critic reviews but i have to say i really enjoyed it it was cool to see the progression of the characters through time
Oct 21 2011,positive,not a huge budget not lots of computer made special effects not exotic surroundings but a couple of great actors and a well written story it was a lot better than i expected
Oct 21 2011,positive,never read the book maybe thats a reason why i like the show
Oct 20 2011,positive,fantastic film but a very disappointing end imho
Oct 20 2011,negative,wouldnt watch it again for sure two stars for jim sturgesss sexy accent
Oct 19 2011,neutral,kids thats why you shouldnt ride a bike in the big city
Oct 19 2011,positive,could have been improved with the leaving out of some stuff but some moments of great chemistry humour romance worth seeing
Oct 18 2011,positive,surely not a film to watch if you have a heart condition i think i may need cpr i just feel scared and out of breath still shaking all in all not a bad movie but very sad and well scary in part
Oct 18 2011,neutral,nice will they wont they romance that makes you think about the paths you take in life and what could have been performances were ok but not altogether convincing much like anne hathaways yorkshire accent
Oct 17 2011,positive,amazingly done but so so sad
Oct 15 2011,positive,gua and girl meets on july15 they keep on doing so every year things have then always changed in one or another way they love each other from start but arent aware of it life goes on but july15 remains their day    its not as stupid as it sounds if anne hathaway is in such a movie with such a plot it cant anyway be a disaster and it slightly at least touches things like deeper feelings life disappointments one changing part in command its a little like waves not in an ocean but at least in a smaller lake    emotions as entertainment but with a rather intelligent dialogue and a much intelligent hathaway bringing the best out of comedy scripts
Oct 12 2011,positive,not as good as the book but quite lovely all the same
Oct 11 2011,negative,very disappointing the love was just not obvious which left you not feeling enough empathy with the characters the book was much better at conveying the true love between the 2 main characters
Oct 11 2011,positive,sweet and sorrowful at the same time
Oct 11 2011,positive,i love you dex so much i just dont like you anymore im sorry      the many faces of jim sturgess bzw die maske hat einen tollen job gemacht   natürlich nicht so gut wie das buch   aber dennoch traurig und schön und dazu die tolle location von edinburgh
Oct 8 2011,neutral,it was a great idea and the book was probably heaps better hathaways onoff accent terrible hair slow screenplay and the underdeveloped  characters is worth a skipthe last 5th of the movie was a lot better and almost redeemed the movie
Oct 1 2011,negative,this film was so bad that it actually made me a bit angry its source material the best selling book of the same name had been my favourite book of 2010 but i was desperately disappointed by this screen version the film feels as though it is rushing through the years with some delivered quickly and ruthlessly in what feels like an attempt to get them out of the way so that the plot can progress which is something that you never feel in the book somehow everything that made the novel so beautiful and the story so compelling has been lost in this poor adaptation this coupled with the fact that the two leads have absolutely no chemistry adds up to a shocking film not worth wasting your time on and the less said about anne hatherways accent the better
Sep 30 2011,positive,it made me cry  it was so sad
Sep 30 2011,positive,from ages i did not t c movie quiet charming and amazing like dat one 
Sep 30 2011,positive,i really enjoyed this film but hadnt read the book first everyone i know who read the book first didnt seem to like the film much
Sep 30 2011,positive,this movie could have been great if the director had tried to develop a relationship with the audience the 10 years were ran through too quickly and just when it gets interesting it ends its too bad the director didnt take the time to develop the relationship not bad not good just kind of there
Sep 29 2011,positive,one of the most lovely romantic movies ive ever watched great performance of annne hathaway  jim sturgess and a great directions as well and on the top of the that great scenario based on a best international seller novel of the year 2009 with the same name one day im happier after watching such a movie 
Sep 29 2011,positive,i did feel for the characters and i liked how the film skips forward to show different stages in the characters lives frowned a lot though
Sep 29 2011,positive,wow this gets a 37 but a movie as horrible as dont be afraid of the dark gets a 64 proof that most of these critics dont know what theyre talking about this is a sweet wonderful movie that has a few flow and editing issues but so far the most enjoyable film ive seen all year
Sep 28 2011,negative,while i watched this film all i could think was one day itll be over total waste of money and time
Sep 28 2011,negative,i was actually looking forward to this movie but oh boy was i disappointed the movie was really bland and dull for me    character development just didnt do it i felt like the whole movie flashed before my eyes in seconds and not even to mention the ending which came out of no where the story already lacked so much development from the beginning so the ending felt so out of place and i couldnt care less about what happened the movie felt like a big blob of blur to me plus the chemistry between the two wasnt there for me as well      probably better off reading the book definitely was not romantic sad or touching really maybe you might end up liking it but its a risky shot wouldnt recommend it really
Sep 27 2011,positive,very enjoyable friendshipromance of my era  great looking back at the fads and fashions ahh doc martins and floral dresses
Sep 27 2011,positive,what attracts me is the movie tagline twenty years two peopleone day3755
Sep 27 2011,positive,great love story great script great acting
Sep 27 2011,positive,really good em exactly as i expected could have been longer cut out somme key parts of the book still a great watch captures their relationship perfectly
Sep 27 2011,positive,no matter what happen tmr we still have today
Sep 26 2011,positive,dont really get the merciless panning the book was amazing but i did enjoy the film  i laughed i cried 
Sep 26 2011,negative,awful the accent the hair the actingeverything could not have picked two more depressing lives to follow
Sep 25 2011,positive,a throwaway romance with likable performers and a script that though clicheridden knows how to illicit some emotions from those cliches one day isnt anything special but it looks great anne hathaway and jim sturgess are nice together and you wont feel cheated out of your 100 minutes by the end
Sep 25 2011,positive,the trailer is so much better than the movieplus the ending is bullshit
Sep 25 2011,negative,i did not enjoy this film i didnt get emotionally conected to the characters like i usually do in films so i didnt even cry at the end which is unusual for me i thought that it felt like it went on forever and it got very tedious at times
Sep 25 2011,positive,a lot better than most people say first hour is cringeworthy awful characters but then thats woven into a skilful tragedy
Sep 24 2011,neutral,for a romancy schmancy chick flick movie this isnt the worst movie your girl could drag you toothis movie made me like anne hathaway more as an actress it was just put together poorly kinda like aww hell we know this aint gonna rake in millions of dollars  so lets not put too much into this
Sep 24 2011,neutral,a bit too brocken up as seems to jump around the timeline too much but its a good movie about friendship blooming ino romance
Sep 23 2011,positive,i thought it suck to the book but i personal did not like the end there was no happy endding or feel good factor
Sep 22 2011,neutral,i dont know why she has to die at the end
Sep 22 2011,neutral,is is always the case not half as good as the book
Sep 21 2011,neutral,while it cant be denied that anne hathaway and jim sturgess make for one charming couple neither of them nor scherfigs classy direction can make up for the fact that the story lacks the emotional resonance it strives for and ends up falling pray to the old and ludicrous a man always needs a woman to have any emotional balance in life common place mediocrity which comes straight out of hollywoods guide book on all chick flicks
Sep 21 2011,positive,i look forward to reading the novel
Sep 21 2011,positive,intelligent heart warming and sad by all turns
Sep 21 2011,positive,definitely worth a watch but does drag at times
Sep 21 2011,positive,this story nearly brought a tear to my eye
Sep 20 2011,positive,it was pretty close to the book just okay
Sep 20 2011,neutral,i recommend being very committed to watching the whole film from start to finish i found myself confused after missing 5 minutes in the middle of the film the friendship does last a lifetime and is shown at a swift pace jumping from one year to the next tears laughter and surprise can be taken from this film for those who are true romantics at heart
Sep 20 2011,positive,loved it but wasnt expecting the surprise
Sep 20 2011,positive,glad that we watched this movie it brings out a much more meaningful message than i expected the accident is really shocking as i thought emma deserves a longer time of happiness but i still believe therere no regrets in life as whatever we face its a lesson
Sep 19 2011,positive,having read the book i was interested to see what interpretation the film could bring to the story in all honesty it didnt stray too far from the original plot in terms of acting though jim sturgess did a great job with bringing dexter to life and really saw him as dexter
Sep 18 2011,negative,this movie was ok but overly melodramatic anne hathaway is always hard to not fall in love with but this movie was a bit too contrived for me
Sep 18 2011,positive,although i didnt wanna see this at first as it look a little dull but as the trailer as been heavily promoted i got drawn into going to see it  and tbh i wasnt disappointed although the lovely anne hathaway english is all over the shop  a nice movie all in all
Sep 18 2011,positive,woww tout simplement
Sep 18 2011,positive,a friendshipthat turns into true love after a period of twenty yearsa romantic movie with a beautiful cast inspired plotdidnt expect to like it so much
Sep 18 2011,positive,extremely touching i guess ive felt the same way
Sep 18 2011,negative,070911 potentially a great film but it didnt work for me i found myself drifting off to sleep until the startling ending
Sep 18 2011,positive,my favorite line i love you dexter very much its just that i dont like you anymore im sorry
Sep 18 2011,positive,we dont know what will happen tomorrowlive in the moment and hold tight on your loved one
Sep 18 2011,positive,love the movie poster love the quote im so much better when youre around
Sep 18 2011,positive,despite the dodgy english accent by anne hathaway its not the worst alicia silverstone in batman  robin anyone i really enjoyed it as did the mrs many a laughable moment  cant wait for it to come out on dvd
Sep 17 2011,positive,pretty good and definitely takes the best parts of the book and seemed to carefully select the parts that it could do without movies are never going to be better than the books but this was decent jim sturgess was amazing
Sep 17 2011,positive,one of the best love movie that i ever seen dont know why some people dont like this
Sep 17 2011,positive,good story but not a fantastic film just a reasonable one
Sep 17 2011,positive,the book was amazing the movie was soso
Sep 17 2011,positive,it was good and a little bit romantic i love it
Sep 17 2011,positive,not as good as i expected but still not a bad story even its with a very predictable ending
Sep 17 2011,positive,i thought it was brilliant some times it could be slow but the story line was excellent
Sep 16 2011,positive,simply say i luv it though others gave low ratings just feeling pretty sad for the ending
Sep 16 2011,positive,i think perhaps i shall marry jim sturgess
Sep 16 2011,positive,the beginning of the story was interesting but so slow and i almost felt it was going nowhere just scenes in a life but towards the mid point of the movie all the emotions and shock and love hit you straight in the gut its a tear jerker i was pleased
Sep 16 2011,positive,brilliant ann hathaway at her best x
Sep 16 2011,negative,apart from some nice postcard shots of paris and edinburgh and a 30 second cameo from matt berry this film is dire incoherent and lame i would say that watching it was a snoozefest but it made me so annoyed i couldnt doze off
Sep 16 2011,positive,i loved it beautiful and sad story will definitely recommend it
Sep 16 2011,positive,a lots to think about but i found trouble to love the movie its good but not great when you only have that little time to talk about twenty years and gosh the truck scares the heck out of me
Sep 15 2011,positive,dont listen to critics saying bad stuff about this movie  it is a very good movie solemn performance from both the main actors  they r not in ur face shouting their love but very much a mature love story watch it  i loved the book and the movies been made as good as it could have been made
Sep 15 2011,positive,beautiful love story predictable but very well acted and enjoyable
Sep 15 2011,negative,truly disappointing  read the book instead  far more satisfying
Sep 15 2011,neutral,feel like because i havent read the book i was missing something with this film was bitty and although in the past i have enjoyed anne hathaway as an actress im not sure she was the best option for this role as her yorkshire accent was inconsistant which ruined the flow of the film imo
Sep 15 2011,neutral,feel like because i havent read the book i was missing something with this film was bitty and although in the past i have enjoyed anne hathaway as an actress im not sure she was the best option for this role as her yorkshire accent was inconsistant which ruined the flow of the film imo
Sep 15 2011,negative,positive  it has its touching moments and the big scene towards the end is as shocking a in the book even when you know its coming jim sturgess has the dexter look right down    negative  the american cast could not pull off this british flick the accents were also very bad everything goes by very fast and you have no time to think about whats happening
Sep 15 2011,positive,my first chick flick with my oldest daughter i enjoyed the movie and just when i thought i was going to doze off slam in the back of the head jumped twenty feet in the air and then was glued to the screen worth the hour and half with a box of tissues
Sep 14 2011,positive,a rushed neutered version of the farricher and superior source material thats still worth a look in spite of anne hathaways crazy vocalympics its a shame that they drove this directly toward the chickflick demographic when the book was actually quite a broad contemplation of success in the 90s
Sep 14 2011,positive,i dont think this is as bad as some people are making out one day is built around a simple but effective device it visits the same couple over a span of 20 years each july 15th a bit like 500 days of summer only in straightforward chronological order its set in the north of england  but dont be too put off by anne hathaways emmerdale accent shes absolutely fantastic in this  skilfully playing the selfconscious girl in her early twenties to the sharp witty intelligently sexy woman in her early forties at least with hathaways character there was a sense of growth and maturity     unfortunately i didnt quite buy into the character of her love interest dexter played by jim sturgess who seemed a little bit two dimensional and too much of a prick to deserve the attentions of emma hathaway he does some growing up as youd expect but when it comes to the climax you really do wonder if hes actually done enough to deserve his place there incidentally i felt that sturgess was completely put in the shadows by the brilliant rafe spall who played the emmas illmatched partner ian    while the comingtogether of emma  dexter towards the end didnt quite convince me there was some serious emotional power to be had in the final scenes its always worthwhile to be reminded of what really matters in life and how we should not squander the most important moments by being distracted by lifes trivialities as larkin once said we should be careful of one another we should be kind while there is still time the mower
Sep 14 2011,negative,didnt care  was glad when she died
Sep 14 2011,negative,not only is this film boring is is set with a dull bleak backdrop that is even more dreary than the characters  anne hathaway english accent makes it strenuous viewing i questioned walking out of the cinema but was preying for the film to pick upwhich it did not
Sep 14 2011,negative,i cant say i cared for this movie much maybe it was hathaways accent or just a movie itself but i found it to be quite dull
Sep 14 2011,positive,id never read the book and so went with the simple understanding that the movie focused on two people on one day over the span of twenty years and so cannot comment on its closeness to the novel i however found this to be an engaging journey     while its true that we miss some important days in emma and dexters relationship i appreciate that it makes sense that the pairs most important moments wouldnt all occur on the 15th of july every year we were simply treated to a snapshot of their relationship at the time and left to fill in the blanks about the time in between ourselves    jim sturgess did a good job playing a sometimes unlikeable sometimes charming leading man anne hathaways accent did occasionally grate but i liked her performance overall
Sep 14 2011,negative,a bit of a disappointment having just read the book knowing a film had been made i was intrigued as to how the book would translate into a film as the author wrote the screenplay i had high hopes however although some parts of the book are faithfully transferred to the screen overall it is a bitty piece as a lot of the back story which is in the novel is missing from the film    and as for all the fuss about hathaways accent  ok it is totally rubbish and virtually nonexistant but as nothing is made of her coming from yorkshire or having a yorkshire accent in the film itself she neednt have bothered attempting it in the first place    my advice  stick with the book miss the film
Sep 14 2011,negative,if you look up chic flick in the dictionary it will sayone daynot a good one 4 me
Sep 13 2011,positive,at no stage was i convinced either that they are in love or why they would love each other in the first place his character is an arsehole throughoutwhich is a major problem in a romantic film it had no idea how to end the film like the last lord of the rings film all over again i have a lot of time for anne hathaway but  even i was pushed by her several accents that interchange at regular intervals she didnt know if she was american anne hathaway the hathaway from becomming jane or anne hathaway doing her best geoffrey boycott impression
Sep 13 2011,negative,its pretty awful the central principle  showing two peoples lives on the same day every year for 20 years  may have worked in a book but on film it just comes across rushed and without chemistry i couldnt relate to any of the characters nor to the films depiction of the 80s and most of the 90s so the film just left me cold all the way to the end
Sep 13 2011,positive,while there was definitely chemistry between anne hathaway and jim sturgess i have to say  i didnt love this movie as i thought i would  some parts of the film seemed to drag on while others felt as if they moved far too quickly  overall a romantic love story that will definitely move you but it wont stay with you for twenty years
Sep 13 2011,positive,prefer the book better
Sep 13 2011,negative,when the high point in a film involves the accidental death of one of the main characters and one that you could predict at least 10 seconds before it happens you know its bad seriously anne hathaway should easily earn an acting award with this movie a razzy
Sep 13 2011,negative,what i expected with one day was not what i got for many reasons firstly one of the greatest flaws with this film was of course hathaways train crash of a yorkshire accent well if i am honest it was a total lack of an accent secondly the film managed to turn what is actually a very thought provoking story into quite a forgettable experience in the cinema however it has to be said that sturgess definitely shone a lot more than hathaway especially through his difficult years where his difficulties do seem 20 times more genuine than hathaways performance overall a disappointing film but one that will at least bring a tear to your eye
Sep 13 2011,positive,better book than movie
Sep 13 2011,positive,sobbed like a baby  now theres a surprise me crying at a film lol
Sep 13 2011,positive,its not bad for what it is a love story told in a slightly different way throughout one day in different years it starts as a friendships and ends up becoming a relationship some will like it some dont but i have to admit sturges and hathaway do a great job with what theyre given
Sep 13 2011,positive,a disappointment after reading the book hathaways accent is almost comedic in parts
Sep 13 2011,positive,pretty good movie does require tissues both lead characters easy on the eye thou i have to say annes accent in this was dodgy had to read the book to find out the character was supposed to be from yorkshire
Sep 13 2011,positive,understood something
Sep 13 2011,neutral,it is disappointing firstly it is hardly a convincing story with all the branches imbalance and unnatural moreover director cannot turn cliche into magic finally i am terribly sorry to anne who has obviously passed her prime time
Sep 13 2011,positive,to be honest i expected worse with the silly premise of checking in on the story once a year on the same day but in the end it doesnt suffer too badly from this  ultimately its a good  but not great  story  the comedy here is more of a wry humour giving this more of an oldschool romcom feel
Sep 13 2011,positive,one of the best chick flick of the year
Sep 12 2011,positive,faithful transfer from the novel as the author wrote the screenplay  a little rushed through the years  great costumes and sets which are true representation of the years  both jim and anne are convincing as the characters except annes attempt to do the accent
Sep 12 2011,negative,they have long long puppy love
Sep 12 2011,negative,left me totally cold unconvincing and unlikeable characters it was too keen to get on with the concept ie we visit them on the same day every year rather than establish any reason to care about the main protagonists shocking waste of ken stott and patricia clarkson in supporting roles
Sep 12 2011,positive,disappointed a classic love story with a korea style ending
Sep 12 2011,positive,the story is touching the shooting is fair but the plotting can be much better
Sep 12 2011,positive,such a beautiful movie made me laugh nd cry those are the best romance movies
Sep 12 2011,positive,it could have been a very typical boring love story without emmas sudden death  good to meet anne hathaway one of my favorites touched by wonderful acting of jim sturgess also enjoyed a lot fantastic scenes from lovely places of my favorites edinburgh london paris and provence
Sep 12 2011,neutral,2nd chick flick of the day  yeah i know  not sure what came over me  still the british do it much much better than the yanks  enought  said
Sep 11 2011,negative,anne hathaways accent is the least of this movies problems adapted from a bestseller by david nicholls is runofthemill swill and a major disappointment since i expected better from director lone scherfig who hit all the right notes in her amazing 2009 feature an education anne hathaway and jim sturgess are two illfated lovers who get together on the day they met for two decades july 15th 1988 one day is piffle that goes way too long for its own good and ours
Sep 11 2011,positive,liked it but havnt read all of book so cant compare yet anne h dodgy accent indeeddidnt think male character was likeable until second half of film
Sep 11 2011,negative,got dragged to see this by the missis boring predictable and surprisingly unemotional the soundtrack serves to explain how you should be feeling as the acting is so wooden and her accent is dodgy to say the least avoid
Sep 11 2011,positive,not having read the book this seemed fresh fun and engaging with sharp dialogue and nice period detail the ending was perhaps a bit forced but still moving
Sep 11 2011,positive,amazing movie it made me think about life who we are in this world and where we are going with everything around us
Sep 11 2011,positive,causes you to count your chickens  never a bad thing 0
Sep 11 2011,positive,i adore it anne hathaway is born to act the most amazing romantic roles sturgess is as good as her in his role one day worth watching even at those moments when you are liable to cry you find that hope is just on the way hathaway is the only actress who makes me watch romantic movies
Sep 11 2011,positive,love it very much and missing the time
Sep 10 2011,positive,really liked it a bit sad in places though
Sep 10 2011,positive,judging by other reviews which all totally contradict each other this film seems to be a bit hit and miss personally i really enjoyed it  i liked the idea of the film and i thought it worked well
Sep 10 2011,positive,read the book first
Sep 10 2011,positive,one man go to see one dayv  not bad indeed  still like jim sturgess very much
Sep 10 2011,negative,that last rating sucked 
Sep 10 2011,neutral,give it a miss read the book instead if you must
Sep 10 2011,positive,if you are a romantic this movie will leave you in tears  it is an unconventional tale of souls intertwined yet fated to be kept apart  the film brings the novel to life with strong fidelity  checking in with the characters on the same day each year brilliantly conveys how sometimes so little changes over that span of time yet gradually change and growth do happen with detours along the way
Sep 10 2011,positive,does have its moments but sadly sturgess isnt half the woman that hathaway is
Sep 10 2011,positive,this is the least expected one among the 3 films ive watched in these 4 days but surprisingly its the best one too certainly cheesy  corny chickflick it is but it feels kinda good in a way
Sep 9 2011,negative,movie was okay started off with more promise was predictable as well
Sep 9 2011,positive,absolutely loved this film started off slow but eventually got going something comes to an abrupt end  i was left in shock for at least a few days but then thats the sign of a great film
Sep 9 2011,positive,not bad a wee bit slow but a very good and unexpected ending
Sep 9 2011,positive,i did not read the book so not really know what to expect and enjoyed the film more than i thought i did also helps with  the setting in my fav cities 
Sep 9 2011,neutral,there are some nice ideas in one day but those ideas are also the main problem the narrative is very clunky because of the constant jumping from year to year as a result of the structure each scene or day feels like a mere snippet as the dialogue tries to fill us in on any developments that we might have missed the potential was there and it is nice to see some interesting ideas but it wasnt realised fully
Sep 9 2011,negative,i resolved to put aside my personal opinions and make this all about the facts and entertainment with these reviews and for that reason this film gets 2 stars instead of none    its a romantic drama theres a little humour in there but you have to really search for it i didnt read the book that this was based on but i thought the storyline was weak and frankly went nowhere the highlights for me were the titles for the dates which werent brilliantly done but were cleverly positioned along with the cameo appearance of matt berry from the it crowd    read more here  
Sep 9 2011,positive,fall within the routine love story but not as good as the hk one
Sep 9 2011,positive,unfortunately i could guess the ending and the twist is so obvious still very good photography
Sep 9 2011,negative,a misguided adaptation that fails to be as witty poignant and heartbreaking as its original source resulting in a sexless lacklustre and crushingly conventional romantic caper this only adds evidence to a universal truth that some books are better left untouched
Sep 9 2011,negative,one day i will forget this film i have not read the book but have been told the acting does not accurately reflect the more sensitive side to the characters by the end of the film i honestly really didnt care about the fate of any onscreen characters
Sep 9 2011,neutral,started watching it twice but cudnt get intoit
Sep 9 2011,positive,though it doesnt receive many good reviews but it is a nice made movie to my point of view its noway to compare with the book for sure never theres a movie base on a book can compare to the original creation the beautiful words in the book was wasted at the first half of the movie the skipping of times lost the details of the character i wish they would have voice over or add a scene about the letters between dex and em but the art direct and the costume did a good job on the late 80s to 00s the small change of the era yet its so precise the great part of the story is it captures the possibility of life the struggle to the reality which people can relate to beautiful story doesnt have to be happy ending
Sep 9 2011,negative,repetitive predictable and dull anne hathaways accent is a joke as it makes fleeting appearances throughout the movie and often a single sentence there are a couple of entertaining moments but make sure youve got a comfortable seat to ease the burden of sitting through this rubbish
Sep 8 2011,positive,      best online store    best quality best reputation  best services     nhl jersey woman  40  nfl jersey  35     nba jersey  34  mlb jersey  35     jordan six ringm 36  air yeezym  45     tshirtm  25  jacketm  36     hoodym  50  manicure set  20     handbag 37  ugg boot 43      sunglass 16  bult 17         p8890
Sep 8 2011,positive,maybe im not cut out to be a film critic or maybe im just soft as shte but i loved it a beautiful story well told flawed casting but good performances nonetheless especially from jim sturgess as dexster and anne hathaways accent really wasnt that bad
Sep 8 2011,positive,a good movie about someone whos too cool for school and the dumb chick that pines over him for most of the movie the story is dumb but at least the execution is well done  and the performances are top notch not that we expect anything less from hathaway who puts her own little twist on a tired clichã c but everyone else even throwaway characters all turn in fine work
Sep 8 2011,neutral,i think this is a little too far over the chick flick line for me  yes the leads are convincing  sadly though the film dragged for me  the same day over a number of years may be original idea but i was clockwatching  if i were to explain the aspect of the film that annoyed me the most it would mean id need to include a spoiler  suffice it to say ive seen certain setups so many times that i knew any twists were going to happen way before they did  so i was emotionally dulled when they did  my wife thought this had its faults but would give this movie a 7
Sep 8 2011,positive,funny and sad brilliant chick flick
Sep 8 2011,negative,not good best bit was when she got killed
Sep 8 2011,positive,so so sad beautiful realistical of life and love and made me cry tip bring tissues
Sep 8 2011,positive,nice acting fine music but kind of touchyfeely
Sep 8 2011,negative,may be a good fiction but it is not a good movie the arrangement is like a straight line and most of the parts are quite bored
Sep 8 2011,positive,hathaway and sturgess are good but just not good enough in this romantic and poorly structured tale of unrealised love  sturgess simply lacks the charisma and nuance required to give us the lovable rogue that was necessary to maintain a plausibility and hathaway adorable as she is was stilted by seesaw accent work that ranged from northern working class to kensington high street  again and again as i frequently moan a meaty british role for a female lead is cast from beyond our shores  a kick in the teeth for those like romola garai who was forced to play second fiddle here to a role that she would have eaten up  thats not to say that hathaway is really poor but she just couldnt quite relax into her role because she is not fucking british enough  dialogue in this film was genuinely a problem throughout and some of it was difficult to hear not aided in part by some dreadfully detached adr work  i havent read the book but it seemed to me that some critical setup in the story was missing and that the final scenes were either shuffled from the beginning to soften the bleakness of the ending or to avoid having a full twenty or so minutes without our star  either way it didnt work much in the same way that many novel translations fail to work these days  the source material is spread too thinly across a restricted run time and not stripped far enough back to the bear bones before cinematic interpretation  overall this film was a bit of a mess but deep down i cannot deny that it did warm my cold heart for a few telling minutes and did just enough to make me feel disappointed rather than pissed off
Sep 7 2011,positive,did not meet my expectations the soundtrack wasnt really good either

Sep 7 2011,positive,this film emphasizes on the versatility of a particular day in the relationship between two people the result is a thorough driven introduction followed by a rocky development to be concluded in a finite resolution that still drives a reopening statement
Sep 7 2011,positive,a true chickflick the relationship between the two main characters is as frustrating for the audience as it must have been for the characters themselves  i doubt many men would have the patience to watch this to the end
Sep 7 2011,positive,have not read the book but throughly enjoyed the movie thought it was a quite slow start but eventually showed the friendship of emma and dexter have to admit i cried  probs wont watch again but am defo reading the book
Sep 7 2011,negative,boring as hell one moment of shock horror was just enough to keep me awake girls might love it but they should know better
Sep 7 2011,positive,dodgy accents much preferred the book
Sep 7 2011,neutral,anne hathaways acting and jim sturgess likability are great to watch but the screenplay here doesnt connect emotionally with the characters and leads to a needlessly sappy ending
Sep 7 2011,neutral,the idea is interesting following life through the relationship between a woman and a man over 20 years around the same date every year the problem is that the dozen or so vignettes feel like disconnected clips and dont generate much caring for the characters while there are a few poignant moments the photography is polished and the acting is good the film fails overall
Sep 7 2011,positive,i loved this film itdidnt pan out exactly like i thought it would i liked that it was realistic in a lot of ways of how some relationships play out   ending was sad in a manner the thought of what could have been was so bitter sweet  very likeable
Sep 7 2011,positive,it was alright a simple coming of age story linked with a friendship that was always meant to blossom into love but to be honest even with the shocking climax at the end it was not what i was expecting since it was claimed the author david nicholls wrote the screenplay  although i have to complement anne hathaway for doing a fairly ok british accent and jim sturgess really suited his role as the fun loving spoilt oxbridge boy dexter mayhew however if you are not a fan of soppy romantic films like me unfortunately this film will not exactly change your mind about them
Sep 6 2011,negative,well that is 2 hours of my life i cant get back  the story adaptation was flaky and disjointed at best unless that was how it was written   the 4 scenes that they should of been filmed were left out and merely referred to in passing wtf    very boring   spent 80 minutes waiting for something to happen and then the last 15 minutes thinking why  what  how unnecessary  usually love hatthaway but the american playing a upper class londoner with a subtle western slant creepin in occasionally just did not pull off anything convincing  its a miss wouldnt even bother watching the dvd 
Sep 6 2011,positive,the trailer teased more than the movie was able to deliver unfortunately so anne hathaway was quite charming in this romantic adaption
Sep 6 2011,positive,im not lonely im alone
Sep 6 2011,neutral,what a boring and pointless movie though the leads esp anne were good the movie bored me to death
Sep 6 2011,positive,jim sturgess is the standout here in this romantic drama  to be honest i wasnt looking that forward to it and im not really a fan of anne hathaway  still arent  but as the film progressed and we saw more of the characters and the lives they live and the paths they have chosen i became engrossed  i know that it is a movie but i still dont understand why emma chose the men she did  the only explanation is low self esteem  first is the dead beat ian then she hooked up with dexter after he had taken her for granted for so many years  apart from that i really liked the film
Sep 6 2011,positive,this is absolutely gorgeous 99of the seats have been taken 90 of the girls tearing for it
Sep 5 2011,positive,nice movienot badbit predictable at times id recommend seeing it
Sep 5 2011,negative,not really my kind of movie but decent nonetheless
Sep 5 2011,positive,great not as good as the book but still really good 3 emma  dex

Sep 5 2011,negative,good meaning but i was disappointed by the ending
Sep 5 2011,positive,sturgess and hathaway clearly have good and strong chemistry its just a shame that the direction and script arent as strong as them
Sep 5 2011,negative,anne hathaway and jim sturgess shine but the film does not they had a good idea for a film but they didnt execute it correctly it kind of reminded me of movies like before sunset before sunrise when harry met sally a lot like love and city of angels the problem is the style and structure of the film is completely off it needed a rewrite too while hathaway was ok in her role it seemed liked she had trouble keeping her british accent in the film she did a better job with the british accent in becoming jane sturgess does a good job here
Sep 5 2011,positive,simply fab i would want to watch it again
Sep 5 2011,positive,not only did i cry i full on wept
Sep 5 2011,positive,ok a thinner narrative than the book so dint expect to leave feeling you know as much about the characters as you might expect it works as a film just wish i hadnt read the book before i saw it     oh and the accent is annoying i bet there are talented pretty yorkshire born actresses giving evils at the screen
Sep 5 2011,negative,boring  depressing
Sep 5 2011,positive,big screen adaptation of david nicholls best selling novel it does a creditable effort of keeping to the books story and narrative structure anne hathaway does a reasonable job of a yorkshire accent jim sturgess comes across as more likeable than the character of dexter does in the book
Sep 4 2011,negative,this wasmehyeah there was some nice little twists but other than thatthis movie didnt really interest mevery predictable and it could have been better if one o the main characters wasnt such a douche
Sep 4 2011,negative,good in an up close and personal kind of way 
Sep 4 2011,positive,was good it dragged in a few places but i loved the story  few surprises along the way even made me cry
Sep 4 2011,positive,being a big fan of the novel i wasnt sure what to expect when i heard this was being made into a filmthe actors were wellcast and i did enjoy the movie despite the fact that it was significantly condensed either way i was still left bawling like a fool at the end of the film
Sep 4 2011,negative,that s two hours ill never get back quite remarkably tedious when she got killed i was waiting for him to be done too no such luck
Sep 4 2011,positive,this film was wonderful it pulled my heart in a dozen different directions and id watch it again in a heartbeat anne hatheway is as lovable as she is beautiful
Sep 4 2011,positive,nowhere near as bad as id feared ann hathaways peripatetic accent notwithstanding
Sep 4 2011,negative,boring and annoying story of a needy girlwoman who put her life on hold for a guy who doesnt represent anything worth putting your life on hold one star for edinburgh 
Sep 4 2011,neutral,i loved the novel so the film had a lot to live up to the male lead was good but anne hathaway and her everchanging accent were just awful i also dont feel you could grow to care for either of the characters what a pity
Sep 4 2011,negative,st swithins day the film tedious
Sep 4 2011,negative,not sure what the heck i was expecting here  tragedy you could say this movie was oneim thinking hathaway needs to do something else now  if she doesnt shell get labeled like jennifer anniston and nobody wonts that  i neither like nor disliked this movie
Sep 4 2011,positive,she makes you decent  and about being honest with yourself even if it scares you to death
Sep 3 2011,positive,i dont think ive ever seen a movie so closely follow the book
Sep 3 2011,positive,if youre looking for a good weepie you can do little better than one day its a fabulous film but boy did it break my heart after watching one day youll want to hurry home and cuddle your loved one or if you dont have one youll wish you did    the film follows the lives of a couple emma anne hathaway and dex jim sturgess over a period of 20 or so years we see their relationship briefly blossom amid a failed one night stand and then proceed to seesaw to and fro around the central truth that they are made for each other but neither are willing to consummate it she for fear of rejection and he because he fails to recognise its existence    the film is structured beautifully playing out the tribulations of the lives of these two people in annual steps before coming full circle with a complete account of their first dalliance and thereby affirming why their bond was so special a thread of subtle humour keeps the film buoyant for the most part amid a clear undercurrent of sadness hope and tragedy the film allows you to experience on a deep visceral level what it is to lose almost everything and teaches you to deify all that you hold dear    a film like this would be nothing without great performances and hathaway is just fabulous how could anyone not fall in love with her immediately its a subtle beautiful performance wearing her emotional fragility on her sleeve barely veiled by a facade of confidence and spark between this and love and other drugs however she may wish to star in a comedy next    this is my first experience of sturgess and he fits the bill perfectly we dislike him for his denial of emma but we know hes a good guy locked within a shell of ego self indulgence and self loathing and we as with emma patiently await the emergence of his true heart    patricia clarkson sounds weird with a brit accent but shes great anyway hathaways accent is not out of place at all however she speaks like a native    as an essay on unrequited love and love lost one day underlines the importance of love or more importantly loving and in finding silver linings in the face of tragedy love as if there were no tomorrow and when there is no tomorrow its not the end of the world its possible to move on as torturous as that travail may be    even though the cruelty of the tragedy at times threatens to derail the delicate emotional balance of the film its enduring impression is one of love affirmation not despair it reinvigorates your appreciation for what you have inspiring you to grasp all that you hold dear with both hands and never let it go
Sep 3 2011,negative,im giving this film two stars one for anne hathaway and one for jim sturgess because theres really not a whole lot else to like about this film  both actors were great but they were placed in perhaps the most dull and pointlessly over dramatic plot line ive seen in quite some time  the idea is these two people who are obviously compatible resist dating each other and remain friends for the majority of their lives  the film shows their coexistence apart and together for 20 or so years of their lives based on the same day each year  life happens in the meantime  of course they end up together because it wasnt believeable for a second that they shouldnt have been together in the first place  and im going to spoil the movie for those of you who havent seen it so stop reading if you actually want to be miserably surprised    then the girl gets hit by a truck and dies  everyone is finally happy because these two fairly mundane characters have finally gotten together and put some life in the filmthen in the most cliche way possible she gets pulverized by a truck while riding her bike the man who has already lived somewhat of an empty and shallow existence before he ended up with the love of his life wallows in his misery for the end of the film before finding peace in something that is completely unrelated to the story as a whole  isnt that how all romantic movies should end  with a tragic and pointless death scene  some films can pull off and benefit from a dramatic unexpected death and i can appreciate films like that but this is not one of them  these are two highly likeable charactersespecially hathaways character  you cant just kill her off and expect people to come away from the film moved and full of a profound new appreciation for the immediacy of treasuring love in the moment which i think was the point of the storyalthough im not sure  people are going to be disappointed and pissed off when you kill off a main character like that        i will give this movie points for sticking to the cliches but thats about it  with such a great cast and an interesting concept the one day a year thing i really had high expectations for this movie but it was just a mess
Sep 3 2011,negative,ive been hathawayed i think anne hathaway is one of the most beautiful women in hollywood with little contention her choices in movie roles however is strange shes done fantastic work and is a tremendous actress but she does such a good job in some not so great movies get smart bride wars valentines day come on ive seen all of them because shes in them or partly so one day is going to end up in that pile of forgettable movies and that pile seems to be getting bigger than the good movie stack     the story was so off it was choppy and put together in a way that ensured we were kept from getting attached to the characters jim sturgess is a decent enough actor but he and hathaway had no chemistry what was more creepy is that dexter played by sturgess and his mother the usually fantastic patricia clarkson had better sexual chemistry than he and emma hathaway i was uncomfortable watching it even during the romantic parts of the movie it never seemed like either character wanted to be there every time dex and his mom were onscreen i thought they were going to go at it    hathaway had some strange one of a kind accent not necessarily a good thing that was some sort of cross between british irish and scottish im not sure whether or not she had a voice coach if she did that person needs to not coach again shes played noncharismatic characters before but she did a much better job at them and theyre some of the better movies shes done brokeback mountain rachel getting married here she plays an angry young woman whos stuck being a waitress she pulls it off very well the problem is that her character isnt anyone you want to pay money to watch     david nicholls wrote the book and screenplay so any loss in translation is solely on him i also dont know whether or not editor barney pilling is to blame or just didnt have more to work with to make one day better it was a dramaromance without the romance maybe if they made it some sort of romcom they could have salvaged something     there really isnt any reason to go see one day its an uninteresting movie altogether thankfully its under 2 hours but i still would have preferred it were shorter
Sep 3 2011,neutral,i was spoilt having read the book which was brilliant and so much better than the film  the characters grew on me but had no depth chunks of the book were missing and years went by too quickly sometimes with little or no content of any significance  got used to it but only towards the end
Sep 3 2011,positive,im of two minds about this movie  the linear year after year after year realistictothepointofboredom storytelling is so incredibly slow and without imagination that the huge climactic moment seems either manipulative or melodramatic  an audience who hasnt read the book is expected to feel way too much way too quickly    in the end though i guess i did feel some feelings  as with crazy stupid grammatically incorrect comma love the trailer scenes that turned me off initially are actually fresher with context  i really hated the nauseating in medias res movie poster but the buildup to it  dex and emma giddily racing down the hill into the cobblestone street  actually renders the embrace quite lovely    the characters and their portrayals are decently likable  jim sturgess has a natural rakish charm and anna hathaway once again impresses me with a new gaze and timbre  her accent is indeed either flatout wrong cuz i think emmas actually scottish not english or at least consistently wonky  nevertheless her humor gaze and energy dont seem american if one can quantify or qualify that  im pretty satisfied with her performance overall not to mention her ability to pull off not just so many hairstyles many of which must have been wigs but so many transformations in bodily poise      major spoiler salute      with the foreshadowing of emmas death in 2006 at the beginning of the film i wonder why lone scherfig directed the bushit like a huge outoftheblue surprise  it almost seems throwaway and darkly comedic like when brad pitt gets hit in meet joe black or when barney gets hit in the season 3 finale of himym  she could have incorporated some flash cuts  the oncoming bus emmas horrorstricken face the hurtling bicycle some concerned passersby  to create a full scene instead of just tralalalalawham you know    i realize that some may think a full scene is manipulative and melodramatic which i derided the film for earlier but i think lone scherfig mastress of subtlety for an education as far as i know could have made it dramatic but not meloly so
Sep 3 2011,positive,despite being kicked in the back by the person behind me watch the flick  youll know when this happened i enjoyed it liked the book too  whilst the film left bits out i felt that it kept the majority of the important stuff in both leads were good anne hathaways accent occasionally changing didnt bother me that much  the story of dex  em em  dex played out in a nicely charming  soppy way
Sep 3 2011,negative,loved this book hated the film  why change all the locations to france  why leave out a whole chunk of emmas story
Sep 3 2011,negative,now i know what bored to death really means
Sep 3 2011,positive,not as good as the book but thats always the case with book adaptations jim sturgess is excellent as dexter anna hathaway is not bad but shes completely wrong for the part shes just not emma
Sep 3 2011,neutral,a relationship examined once a year on the same day a little contrite and masochistic at times but not awful by any means
Sep 3 2011,negative,those 2 stars are for jin sturgess everyone else was shayt in the movie another book destroyed by the movie read the book yall
Sep 3 2011,positive,i agree with todd kruegerthis movie works best if youd read the book and could fill in some of the holes because i loved it and the other three people with me did not i started crying as soon as they got together and jumped at the denouement boy i loved that bookaudiobook and i thought both of them did a good job representing the characters also however the people with me said they didnt like it because they hated the characters which is a similar complaint people had with the book i loved those characters not to be my bff but as real honest people
Sep 3 2011,negative,gets better the more it goes on and then its over it seemed like a bunch of actors acting telling a storybecause the two characters are a notacouple and dont like each other much there is no romance here  much better are before sunrise and before sunset which however lack a plot however those two films do have sparkling dialogue and something completely lacking from this film romance  a little highlight was del amitris roll to me on the soundtrack 
Sep 2 2011,negative,if you ate in the mood to spend an hour and a half watching an ambling story and wondering how long is this movie i actually checked the time and then spend 30mins wishing youd brought tissue and kicking yourself for your choice of movie then i highly recommend this one
Sep 2 2011,positive,this was a movie about a friendship for 20 years where they met every year on july 15  this was a great movie and great storyline
Sep 2 2011,positive,wow this movie blew me out of the water or my seat the last time a movie gave me this same reaction was the first saw movie the very end of it when the massive tragedy happens in this movie i know i may be giving this away but this movie really knocks you for six i was cursing at the screen   the movie basically about the lives of two friends and lovers and how they keep their friendship and transform that to love etc but all this is based around a specific day 15 july of what ever year  basically this movie teaches us to seize the day and be with our loved ones cause you never know when its all over  if you want a strong dram watch it if your not ready then really this is not the movie for you a beautiful love story with a tragic end  i just finished watching this flick i still feel traumatized soo i may need a therapist 
Sep 2 2011,positive,the unfolding of the plot was unusual but i like how it portrayed the friendship of hathaway and sturgess i really liked hathaways performance and look forward to seeing her in the dark knight rises
Sep 2 2011,positive,anne hathaway and jim sturgess had great chemistry the movie was romantic obv but it dragged on for way too long i missed some parts of the movie because i fell asleep sad if youre  a romantic comedy type of gal go see it bring a girl friend to watch this with because your guy friend will fall asleep halfway through nice cinematography and music  again its not as exciting and good as i expected

Sep 2 2011,positive,just went to see this movie today i just thought this movie was such a really good movie i really like it it was a great love story 
Sep 2 2011,positive,i havent read the book so it was a total surprise for me i laughed i cried cn we expect more from a movie now i just cannot wfait to read the book 
Sep 2 2011,negative,wowso not for me  didnt see it coming  wish i had seen something else honestly  dont recommend this oneat all
Sep 2 2011,negative,lovely film and i did cry but hathaways northern accent was really really really bad
Sep 2 2011,positive,really good adaptation of the book mainly due to david nicholls writing the screenplay himself  terrific performances from jim sturgess and rafe spall especially and anne hathaway grew in me as the film progressed  i was disappointed they couldnt find a british actress for the role of emma but all in all a great film that stayed true to the spirit and atmosphere of the book
Sep 2 2011,negative,this was depressing and very slow
Sep 2 2011,negative,i went into this movie expecting to have a good cry over how gushy the love story was this was not the case this movie was horrible pointless and annoying
Sep 2 2011,neutral,interminable and contrived hathaway ruined the accent tried to be deep but doesnt make the grade some of the dialogue is quite witty but it gets lost under the weight of tedium
Sep 2 2011,negative,the most depressing movie ive seen in ages
Sep 2 2011,positive,much better than i thought it would be and the trailer makes out the book is of course far better but then when isnt it
Sep 1 2011,positive,i thought it was a good movie a bit slow but a good story
Sep 1 2011,positive,i lovehate this movie or maybe i hatelove it
Sep 1 2011,positive,personally i loved it its a film i would buy in dvd the movie in itself i must admit is not the greatest  it has its cliches and just very abrupt transitions  but it was one of those that regardless of how shaggy still warmed my heart and just made me like it it is definitely worth a try for it is very sweet and warm and a tear inducer
Sep 1 2011,positive,loved this made me cry worth a watch
Sep 1 2011,positive,nice twist and good jumping throw two decades
Sep 1 2011,positive,fucking wonderful piss off haters
Sep 1 2011,positive,a lot of romantic dramas fall flat on their faces basically everything with jennifer aniston in it but this manages to be a fairly well told story theres been quite a bit of criticism towards hathaways accent in this but quite honestly it didnt bother me one bit her acting is superb and sturgess is pretty good too found it quite predictable towards the end but a pretty decent film overall
Sep 1 2011,positive,not a bad movie to see as a couple
Sep 1 2011,negative,really boring and depressing and ann hathaways english accent was bad
Sep 1 2011,positive,does life imitate art or does art imitate life im one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying both one day is the most real save a few accents movie ive seen in a long time it explores time and how it often slips away from us our hearts desires are often decimated by bad timing and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this so in the case of one day art imitates life to the fullest as we can all sympathize if only a little to crushed hopes and shattered dreams though hopefully we eventually find our way  anne hathaway stars as insecure workingclass woman emma who for one reason or another is drawn to dexter jim sturgess a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of selfconfidence it may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other but they are characters im familiar with the woman who is way too into a man thats way too into himself it happens and for the type dex is pretty likeable em and dex have nothing in common but their opposite personalities do what a relationship should make each other better they are yin and yang complementary opposites  an interesting technique used by one day is that we only get to see the events of a single day july 15 for each of 20 plus years some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick in a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remakereboot which critics and public alike have grown tired of i feel fresh ideas should be applauded even if it doesnt quite work for me however it worked to perfection director lone scherfig an education paints the picture of em and dexs up and down relationship with great finesse never having too much happen on the date year to year the filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year without conversations seeming inorganic the cinematography is beautiful especially a scene where our wouldbe lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset theres plenty of humor joy sadness regret and a number of other emotions to be felt i caution viewers that this isnt a romantic comedy nor does it end like one one day is however easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery
Sep 1 2011,positive,anne hathaway just isnt northern enough but jum sturgess was a perfect dex
Sep 1 2011,positive,dont be put off by the critics go  see this film i thoroughly enjoyed it
Sep 1 2011,negative,an appalling adaptation of a very good book the event at the end of the book was completely ruined by the scene at the beginning of the film and important factors were left out the acting was lackluster from both lead characters and they failed to make the banter between the characters humerous the character of dexter was also denied many of the scenes that made him into more than an immature pillock
Aug 31 2011,negative,dont waste your time or money  ill not be getting either back unfortunately
Aug 31 2011,positive,a surprisingly effective story of emma and dexter who meet at university grow up as friends and finally fall in love or finally admit they had fallen in love  its interesting to compare and contrast this with same time next year starring alan alda from 1978 today we are all far more self obsessed  the story unfolds through what they are doing on the same day each year sometimes together sometimes apart  careers and lovers come and go  the acting is very good but there are too many false endings and the actual last seen could have been cut to leave a beautiful moment of dex with his daughter on a hillside the kids last line would ahve made the perfect ending but nobody asked me to edit it  that and the fact emma is an old looking student and seems to sleep in the same tshirt for far too many years are the only downsides  overall a fine romantic movie and one that has that wonderful mix of seeming inevitable and surprising at the same time

Aug 31 2011,positive,i was completely surprised with how good this film actually was hilarious at times yet highly moving towards the end not a dry eye in the whole screen definitely a must see
Aug 31 2011,positive,dont think it worked well for the film though but did enjoyed it and the book was way better
Aug 31 2011,positive,i have not read the book  this movis was a bit depressing to me predictable great acting from hathaway  sturgess nice music
Aug 31 2011,positive,good movie  shame its got a crappy ending 
Aug 31 2011,positive,was very worried about this as i am with all adaptations of books that i love   i wont bother with the usual not as good as the book line cos surely that just goes without saying  a movie is never going to be as good as a book and this is no exception    it did a pretty good job though it worked and i was very involved in the story and the characters   emma and dexter were spot on i loved how naturally normal anne hathaway looked     one huge gripe annes accent is awful  i thought maybe the press were exaggerating but eurgghhh it was nasty   whole scenes with a cringe worthy yorkshire accent followed by some more scenes with a bbc accent slipping straight back into amerian  such a shame cos i found it hard to concentrate on some parts cos if it    love the story of emma and dexter and emma being a character i can completely relate to makes it all the more powerful  i cried  always a sign of a good film    also lovely to see gorgeous edinburgh on the screen especially having just spent a long weekend there myself    recommend  but if anyone hasnt read the book yet go find a copy before watching
Aug 31 2011,positive,having read some awful reviews my expectations were very low but i loved the book so wanted to see how it would play out on screen  i was pleasantly surprised despite some awful scenes i found myself both sniggering and sniveling its bitter sweet and heart warming but i suspect good dvd fodder on a cold winters night rather than a trip to the flicks
Aug 31 2011,negative,the only thing good about this film was the ending i did weep i was not convinced that they would be remotely interested in each other even as friends for one thing they would have different valuesand the wealthy guy is just too dull and shallow to be remotely interesting and bed worthy i even think he would prefer a woman with means as he has to impress his family i felt nothing for the characters lovely scenery but the film was way over hyped and only worth seeing on dvd as part of a lovefilm deal perhaps not worth â12 cinema visit in london
Aug 31 2011,positive,surprisingly i actually q liked this
Aug 31 2011,positive,better than i was expecting lovely very moving story
Aug 31 2011,positive,nice but a bit depressing
Aug 31 2011,negative,wasnt happy i like my romantic movies to have a happy ending and was a bit boring in parts
Aug 31 2011,neutral,a lot of dragging moments and very predictable
Aug 31 2011,positive,this role was a step outside the typical anne hathaway film it is a nice story about the special relationship everyone has with their best friend box office numbers do not do justice for this film it is a film worth seeing
Aug 31 2011,neutral,not quite the ending i was expecting not your usual romantic comedy film either passable yorkshire accent from anne hathaway though worth seeing if there is nothing better
Aug 31 2011,positive,an absolute delight though slow at times the movie manages to pull at your heart strings till the end a must watch for all the diehard romantics out there
Aug 31 2011,positive,oh now i see what all the fuss was about loved it
Aug 31 2011,positive,so much love it really made me cry
Aug 31 2011,positive,not as good as the book
Aug 31 2011,positive,a romantic drama where you dont quite like the characters enough to care about their fate but i still crieda lot well performed especially jim sturgess as dex anne hathaways accent was hit and miss and constantly changing i think ill have to read the book
Aug 31 2011,negative,superficial cliched predictable and sentimental outrageously miscast too chopped up to fully enjoy way below expectations but had its moments and is still quite sweet
Aug 31 2011,neutral,i tried to care but failed still i did almost shed a tear
Aug 30 2011,positive,i love you so much but i dont like you anymore
Aug 30 2011,neutral,will they  wont they  should they  why did she like him so   how did he make her a better version of herself as she did for him anne hathaway needed a stronger male lead to pull this off better  i love hathaway in most things but just didnt care for the lead actor
Aug 30 2011,positive,good interesting film with a twist in the tale  anne hathaway is an excellent actress
Aug 30 2011,positive,anne and jim are very good but there are definetly some scenes that are missing interesting and touching story
Aug 30 2011,neutral,boring unemotional kept wanting to shout at the two leads just have sex and get it over with seriously half the plot could have been skipped and the ending would still have made sense due to the vignettes type style you never really learned enough about most of the characters to really care and anne hathaways accent was terrible  it was like she forgot she was supposed to do it half the time and did a really bad job when she remembered i had to recite the periodic table in my head several times to keep myself awake through the really boring bits which was most of it
Aug 30 2011,positive,anne hathaway was very good and believable strange ending but enjoyed it
Aug 30 2011,positive,when reviewing a film like this which you only saw because it looked decent and you wanted to get in another picture before school it is tough when listing the negatives you can say that it is incredibly quick paced the episodic nature of the film makes it a little disjointed and hathaways accent isnt exactly the best sometimes it feels like shes switching between an english and an irish accent so the beginning of the film is what is against it but from the middle on it becomes much better and you mostly forget about hathaways accent as the film slows down and becomes more heartfelt it is somewhat predictable but you find that you can only predict whats going to happen in the next few minutesseconds the story is overall beautiful but not translated well on screen    read the book
Aug 30 2011,positive,quite moving with some good comic touches
Aug 30 2011,positive,sentimental cute giving you watery eyes and leaves a good feeling because you come out of the movie with the feeling you knew you would
Aug 30 2011,positive,best picture i have seen in some time jim sturgess is a great new addition to the british acting talent pool and has the ability to make every movie he is cast for into an instant delight the story is not something new but the the way the it was told  same day year by year spanning 2 decades made it interesting and refreshed all in all its a movie totally worth the time and money
Aug 30 2011,positive,it was good but the years flew by too quickly and without enough detail  without having read the book i fear i would have been confused watching the movie  also its not a suspensethriller so i felt like the accident itself was a bit overdone    as usual the movie was a nice companion but the book was a million times better
Aug 30 2011,neutral,i cant say that one day is as good as i thought it would be one day is about dex and emma two different people from different backgrounds but they click from the start and spend 20 years questioning their friendship and feelings for one another the film isnt bad but its not great either the whole thing seemed really rushed which really gave it less depth and i just found it hard to get into the film i thought the cast were good even though anne hathaway was kind of disappointing with her bad yorkshire accent even though anne hathaway and jim sturgess had good chemistry i wouldnt say its a romeo and juliet love story you spend the whole time rooting for dex and emma to get together and when they do youre just frustrated this film did have some weepy moments my friend was blubbing like a baby and even i can say i had a tear in my eye however this film had quite a few flaws and wasnt really as enjoyable as the book    grade c
Aug 30 2011,positive,love it despite anne hathaways english accent that visited every part of the uk hadnt read the book but would recommend it literally made me laugh out loud in places
Aug 30 2011,positive,good film sad heartwarming makes you realise that you need to cherish every moment with your loved ones
Aug 30 2011,negative,a movie that tried too hard
Aug 30 2011,negative,ok but would never watch it again
Aug 30 2011,positive,big screen adaptation of the literary phenomenon that every woman seems to be reading on the train in many ways a standard romantic drama the twist being we only meet up with the characters on one day every year for twenty years sturgess tries hard but is ultimately stuck playing a prize knob hathaway fares better in the more sympathetic role her accent maybe a little awry at times but its a very winning performance in the end as in most romances you cant help but think if only they told each other how they really felt at the start it would have saved a lot of heartache
Aug 29 2011,positive,reminds me of a walk to remember
Aug 29 2011,neutral,while not as bad as many other romance films one day is still not a good film while ann hathaway and jim sturgess have great chemistry together they are dragged into the abyss of mediocrity by a woefully underdeveloped script which doesnt allow the characters to develop properly or give us a reason to care since the storyline seems like it has add and cant seem to focus since it felt like a blur and randomly inserted a few time jump scenes that hindered the flow even further there are great ideas hidden within one day but they get suffocated by such a dreadful script and overlong running time

Aug 29 2011,positive,really liked it needed kleenex
Aug 29 2011,positive,i am so happy that i read the book  dexs character was so unsympathetic in the movie it was confusing that emma spent even one day let alone years and years of time pining over him
Aug 29 2011,positive,a curious concept that comes off well looking at a relationship of 2 college graduates meeting then seeing the friendship over july 15th through 20 years based on a very recent book the film which relies on hathaways and sturgess performances works its sturgess that gets acting honours but hathaway is good also the film is both heartwarming and funny throughout and has weight in both areas not funny haha just in the writing and observations getting sad towards end and the look certainly bringing out the late 80s90s200s well
Aug 29 2011,positive,one of the best   came just in time 3
Aug 29 2011,positive,on the whole i was quite impressed at this portrayal of david nichols book of the same name casting had good and bad points jin sturgess played a good dexter and managed to capture the arrogance of his character well ann hathaway although giving a captivating performance i felt didnt quite pull off the essence of emma morley her yorkshire accent was poor and she just didnt quite pull off the cookie ironic nature of emma she appears a little too serene which maybe more an error of casting despite this i felt the film pulled off the climax of the story slightly better than the book due to the visual nature of the medium despite emitting some elements if the written story eg emmas affair with her head teacher
Aug 29 2011,negative,strange ending wait for the dvd
Aug 29 2011,positive,it was an ok well put together movie although hints at more depth in the book which i havent read good performances but romola is under used
Aug 29 2011,positive,i almost hate myself for giving this movie 35 stars since the movies flaws were so rampant and obvious however it receives a star solely for the amount of time i spent thinking about it after it ended
Aug 29 2011,positive,having loved the book sadly found the film adaption a little disappointing most of that may be the annoyance of anne hathaway and her very suspect yorkshire accent
Aug 29 2011,neutral,the central relationship between two university graduates that is depicted every july 15th from 1988 until 2008 fails to be convincing enough to pull off what is apparently a significantly abridged adaptation of david nicholls novel which is a shame given the fine supporting cast and nostalgic music
Aug 29 2011,negative,what was it even about it was boring i literally fell asleep like 12 times
Aug 29 2011,positive,just goes to show as you get older love is very powerful funny romantic sad but overall really good and sometimes its all worth and tragic well worth a watch
Aug 29 2011,positive,very watchable anne hathaway looks great onscreen as emma but accent sounds wrong a chick flick for couples moral of the story  blokes must stop procrastinating and make a move as life too short for messing about girl dies boy lives on sadly
Aug 29 2011,negative,awful  he has no redeeming qualities her motivation eludes me  would have made a decent cautionary tale but instead its portrayed as a love story  tragic
Aug 29 2011,positive,one of my best   came just in time   loved the actress shes so gorgeous 3
Aug 28 2011,negative,probably the worst movie i have ever seen terrible format plot character development etc the roadrunner ending was surprising but simply said that the producers couldnt figure out how to get the plot out of the rut and bring it to a logical end instead of giving this even one star i give it five yuks one positive noteann hathaway was superb  she only made one mistake allowing herself to get talked into being in this film
Aug 28 2011,positive,loved the scenery  now i want to go to paris andor london the romance was ok  i think im too much of a cynic to take it seriously
Aug 28 2011,negative,one day rating 45  honestly we were disappointed with this movie anne hathaway emma and jim sturgess dexter become friends the night they graduated from a college in london their friendship has its ups and downs over a 16 years period which begins on july 15 1988 neither emma nor dexter ever reach their potential as they struggle in jobs that do not challenge them the movie is very predictable almost boring too long and repetitive some scenes should have been cut wait to see it on tv
Aug 28 2011,positive,much better than i expected  although all the bad reviews might have lowered expectations  i read and loved the book so i may be biased but i liked it  anne hathaways accent did not bother me
Aug 28 2011,positive,pros  anne hathaway set in london i didnt get bored and a surprisingly good ending  josette dont get fooled by that last comment dont see this movie  cons  i didnt like the characters the time jumping confused me a little and the first 23 of the film was just okay
Aug 28 2011,positive,great acting by hathaway and sturgess  however this was diluted by a ho hum screenplay that lacked a commitment to which genre it wanted to be  romantic comedy or drama  sadly it failed to fully delight in either category
Aug 28 2011,neutral,the book wasns such a great thing but they definitely threw double splenda to launch it as the romantic movie doesnt matter it was nice and from now on im in love with jim sturgess mr bolena
Aug 28 2011,positive,very sad but a good emotional movie all together
Aug 28 2011,positive,i was intrigued enough to buy the book 
Aug 28 2011,negative,the final half hour is as riveting as a film of this ilk can get and hathaway is incredibly watchable despite her difficult accent however nichols script is fairly dire and monotonous and sturgess supposedly charming dexter is just an arrogant nob there are occasional sparks of humor mostly thanks to hathaways comic timing and spalls impressive sally hawkings impression and jodie whittaker is still an impressive presence sadly though according to an expert on the original material i have not read nichols best seller this miserable effort from scherfig and co feels forced and unconvincing and rather pales in comparison to the book
Aug 28 2011,positive,i really enjoyed this and im glad i havent read the book yet the vast majority of people who dislike this seem to do so because they feel it doesnt live up to the book
Aug 28 2011,negative,not one of the better lorange mecredi watches plus if you know me and my terrible disgusting habit at laughing at the most inappropriate times it didnt go down well with the audience mr inappropriate
Aug 28 2011,positive,interesting but why do writersdirectors like to jump around so much and why couldnt they put the dates in a more consistent place im sure i missed a few one was on the door another on the computer screen
Aug 28 2011,negative,the advert looks sappy and boring and with terribly forced british accents
Aug 28 2011,negative,took my wife out on 38th anniversary to see a nice little romantic movie and chose one day  emma anne hatthaway gets hit by a bus and killed and the movie died with it didnt want to see a tragedy and instead of a nice pick me up left feeling numb wished i could get a refund for tickets and time wasted
Aug 28 2011,positive,i liked the gimmick of showing snapshots of the couple on july 15th of each year of their relationship but i ended up only finding the movie okay the biggest problem for me was that i couldnt see why emma was so in love with dexter dexter come off as a rather shallow selfcentered person with nothing to offer emma so as a viewer i couldnt really root for their romance    also one nitpick is that hathaway really needs to work on her british accent she sounds like an us resident pronouncing certain words in an english fashion
Aug 28 2011,negative,one day is one of the worst movies i have ever had the displeasure to see  besides the fact that anne hathaways accent didnt hold through the movie the plot made no sense the ending was abrupt and the characters annoyed me  besides some funny scenes and jim sturgess face there were no redeeming qualities in one day  i strong advise other moviegoers to save their money  and watch a different movie
Aug 28 2011,positive,this film was worth seeing i like the idea of seeing a multifaceted relationship change and evolve over time as we see the same day in the lives of the characters each year for over 25 years i could have stood to have had a more likeable male character but i guess there is something to him being a jerk this movie made me think about the fleeting nature of life one part in the movie particularly shocked the entire audience in a thought provoking way i appreciated when the film ended with a character visiting the same geographic that he visited at the beginning of the film our journeys take us many unexpected places and when we arrive where we began we can look back and reflect on how profound that journey is
Aug 28 2011,negative,i really wanted to see a movie on my birthday and this was the only movie that i had any remote interest in that i hadnt seen already  someone must have liked this movie like a fifteen year old romanceless teenybopper or a middleaged lovestarved mother of five or someone for whom english is their second language  im all good with chickflixs no problem predictability doesnt bother even but this film was not only shamelessly sappy boringly predictable and selfindulgantly trite it was so shallow   i am told that the book from which it was adapted from was much much better  i really hope so  the one positive note patricia clarkson who is incredible even in  movies
Aug 28 2011,positive,somehow i was not so touched by the story as i expectedbut omg jim sturgess is such a beautiful man
Aug 28 2011,negative,silly little movie full of cliches and desperation to be more than it really is two strong performances from its two leads from characters you wont ever care for
Aug 28 2011,positive,fab film although not sure on anne hathaways attempt at a yorkshire accent chick flick film feel good with a few good blubby bits
Aug 28 2011,positive,all i will say iswth  gotta see the movie to know why i said wth
Aug 28 2011,negative,wouldnt say best romance kinda like the movie of the mash actor that was married in a movies and him and a lady met once a year  this has more downs than ups  some guys just never know how to appreciate a good woman or someone who isnt a 10 in their eyes  so sad
Aug 28 2011,negative,i wish i had asked for my money back i love the movies  am a regular theater goer anne hathaways accent was horrible at times american at times a proper english accent at others it sounded like she was from the country or scotland or regions unknown pick an accent  stick with it its unclear about their love story you got the sense they pined for one another without really believing it the story felt very fragmented  incongruent at the end i got the impression they had perhaps had sex in college but that doesnt really fit given what was shown on screen at the beginning of the movie that dex somehow saw her as sexy is beyond me though i am an anne hathaway fan sexy isnt a word i would ever use to describe her whether she is in person who knows but it doesnt translate on screen for me her character was nerdy  uninteresting in every way apart from her wit the characters overall were boring  uninteresting i hadnt read the book but i hope the love story was more developed in prose parts were enjoyable but not 20 worth
Aug 28 2011,positive,one day each year following emma and dexters friendship  i went in to this with extremely low expectations having heard a lot of condemnation of anne hathaways accent im bad at accents it didnt sound obviously unenglish and didnt bother me and having really enjoyed the book  these low expectations may mean that ive overrated it but i enjoyed this as a love story i dont usually like them even if it did seem very rushed
Aug 28 2011,negative,anne hathaway is not british and it shows
Aug 28 2011,positive,i really didnt find it enjoyable annes accent was kinda distracting
Aug 28 2011,positive,nice  romantic  story  
Aug 28 2011,positive,excellent movie but beware take the whole box of kleenex
Aug 28 2011,positive,i havent read the book but i found this a sweet and very romantic film it manages to handle both comedy and tragedy and whilst the character of dexter mayhew is at times a bit of a caricature emma morley is very believable and demands much empathy and compassion in so small part down to anne hathaways subtle portrayal
Aug 28 2011,neutral,a moving which focuses on a specific day over a 25 year period is intriguing yet sad movies are not enjoyable to me
Aug 28 2011,positive,recounting the friendship and relationship of two friends over the period of 2 decades at times funny other times poignant you never know what life dishes out to you good to savour the moment and treasure the person beside you
Aug 28 2011,neutral,missed lots out from the book
Aug 28 2011,positive,anne hathaway and jim sturgess are very charismatic in this hearttugging film that shows one day in each year in the lives of emma and dexter the shooting locations are evocative lone scherfigs direction is solid but rachel portmans score is unrestrained and intrusive however the major problem of the film is the story itself onedayinayear glimpses in the lives of lovers are not enough to propel the story forward and make a genuine and deserved connection with moviegoers the film loses momentum and drags itself to a standardissue weepy climax
Aug 28 2011,positive,anne hathaway and jim sturgess are very charismatic in this hearttugging film that shows one day in each year in the lives of emma hathaway and dexter sturgess the shooting locations are evocative including sweeping shots of the french countryside and british highlands rachel portmans score is unrestrained and intrusive lone scherfigs direction is solid the problem of the film is the story itself onedayinayear glimpses in the lives of lovers are not enough to propel the story forward and make a genuine and deserved connection with moviegoers the film loses momentum and drags itself to a standardissue weepy climax however the nonlinear time structure somewhat dampens the melodrama and prevents the story from degenerating into triviality a less unconventional approach in telling this very familiar story would have served the film a lot better
Aug 28 2011,positive,liked but not loved the soundtrack for such a loving story of a young love nourished into a great love sad yet pleasant and touching not to mention the appearance of jim and anne both equally beautiful with a great balance of time through the whole movie
Aug 28 2011,neutral,very tragic and depressing definitely a movie you do not want to see on a date acting was great story was good overall an ok movie
Aug 27 2011,positive,stunningly beautiful
Aug 27 2011,positive,seems boring but not boring
Aug 27 2011,neutral,seriously that happened watch it youll know too
Aug 27 2011,positive,another great performance by hathaway about the one who almost got away  a really great love story even with the twist no spoilers at the end

Aug 27 2011,positive,i have a soft spot for edinburgh the film starts and ends in edinburgh despite all the bad reviews i still want to see it i never read the book but i know what its about from the reviews my expectation is not high i can tell you it is not another the notebook its not powerful enough to make you to felt for the characters it tells the story fine but it lacks that crucial punch to drive the audience for me i dont find it romantic more like a tragedy
Aug 27 2011,negative,a boring movie i only enjoyed when at long last the credits scrolled up after it was over
Aug 27 2011,negative,34 rotten more like 100 rotten this movie was an epic trip into failure and bad storytelling if you like your mush served on a plate made of arbitrary scattered than this film is for you serve chilled with a side of anne hathaways donkey smile and a glass of jim sturgess im so dreamy performance
Aug 27 2011,positive,very good bring tissue
Aug 27 2011,positive,wow i thoroughly enjoyed this film with its shocking twist
Aug 27 2011,negative,the funniest movie of the year for all of the wrong reasons
Aug 27 2011,positive,like an average romantic comedy but with charm other than the occasional accent slip ann hathaway does a good job and jim sturgess does a great job as dexter however its rafe spall whom is the highlight of this movie as a hapless pathetic but also love able ian well worth a watch if your tired of the usual romcom formula
Aug 27 2011,negative,only redeeming quality was anne hathawy
Aug 27 2011,positive,one day is a beautifully told romance drama with good performances and a beautiful but tragic story that will bring laughter happyness and tears to you as you watch it    now i have not read the book so i went into this film with no knowledge of the book besides on what i have seen in the trailers and i pretty much fell in love with the movie and it was pretty much an emotional but fun ride     anne hathaway gives a good performance as emma and is very charmming the only problem i have with her was her britsh accent and being from england myself i can tell a bad accent and annes was ok but it did go abit dodgy for time to time but she did do well and the accent is not forced    jim sturgess is good as dexter and for a actor i have never heard of he is very good ive heard hes done a few movies before this but i hope i get to see him act more in the future    the story is like i said before very well told and it does hit you with some pretty good twists and it does get tears to your eyes near the end     this film is very beautifully filmed and they picked some of the most beautiful places to do some of the scenes    romance films have been rare this year the last one i could remember was water for elephants which was also very good i just hope more romance films come out this year because romance dramas are my favourite genre    overall one day is a beautiful romance drama with good acting and a great story i want to read the book now
Aug 27 2011,positive,one day is a drama about a man and woman who are best friends and stay friends for ages but have a difficult time being more than friends and having a relationship together a great drama film with a happysad ending but a good film
Aug 27 2011,negative,oh dear oh dear the book is one loads of people i know have read and they all say its amazing well im sorry but the movie dosnt only one likable character and anne hathaways portrail cant have done the book justice either her accent was dodgy at best one minute shes american then a toff englishwoman then a yorkshirewoman you never feel for the characters so when the ending happens you dont care shame i may still read the book though
Aug 27 2011,negative,plods along in its trite rut while you wonder why you chose to see it  thenbamthe climax 15 minutes before the movie is over  and such an awful choice to end the story
Aug 27 2011,negative,except for the last 25 minutes this movie is awful  and i love anne hathawy 
Aug 27 2011,positive,whatever happens tomorrow we had today  cest ce quon appelle un formidable duo dacteurs
Aug 27 2011,positive,though seems charming and lovable one day suffers from uneven storytelling and lack of proper emotional manipulation
Aug 27 2011,positive,a pleasant occasionally amusing tragically tasteful romantic drama worth a watch
Aug 27 2011,positive,the acting is what makes this movie worthwhile you are gonna hear more of jim sturgess later
Aug 27 2011,positive,great characters and good idea for a twist on a plot not much soul to the storyline because of the catching up of the lost plot easy watching though x
Aug 27 2011,positive,if its rating rotten and its a chickflick often the two go together you can be sure that my aunt and i will go see it so we of course had to see one day the previews looked promising and our expectations were basically low from bad reviews so we came out ahead it was decent it is slow in parts and could have benefitted from maybe 1520 min edited out but its basically a solid story it has many poignant moments especially towards the end hathaway and stugess are well cast and have a lot of chemistry that drives the movie seeing the movie doesnt make me feel the need to go back and read the book but i kind of wish that i had read it first this would be a good rental
Aug 27 2011,positive,my absolute most fav movie now  
Aug 26 2011,neutral,it liked watching a freaking filipino movie 
Aug 26 2011,negative,another great novel wasted by the filmmakers a total disappointment and david nicholls you are not a film maker  so stick to being a novelist dont you know how awesomely  beautiful your novel is
Aug 26 2011,positive,wished i could love it or hate it disappointed in myself that i kind of like it  but i guess thats how nicolas sparks and his british counterpart david nicholls sell books  anne hathaway does a fantastic job in this film in every respect except the accent  once the director heard it he should have had the writers throw in a working class american girl on a scholarship back story or something  but she emotes so well that i got over it    eventually  sturgess might have played his part too well because there was a solid chunk of film where i lost all hope for his redemption and star crossed love stories cannot work if the viewer doesnt believe in the characters redemption  in any case acting and production values almost make up for the failures in story and tone  but not quite  its a weak 3 stars for me and i can almost guarantee it does not deserve even that high a mark

Aug 26 2011,positive,very good movie about love and friendship surprises during the movie some tears well worth seeing
Aug 26 2011,positive,based on a book having not read the book i found the characters diffcult to undersand however i enjoyed watching this film
Aug 26 2011,neutral,if youve read the book them dont see the film youll be so disappointed if you havent then give the film a go and then read the book
Aug 26 2011,negative,this movie took 2hrs out of my life that i want back  now i understand the premise but my first question why was this set in england the fake accents did not inhance my viewing pleasure  normally i love and i mean love ann hathoways acting but i just not get into this charcter maybe the fake accent or the horrible writing  i tried to think of a pro for someone to see this movie but there is nare a one
Aug 26 2011,positive,if i had walked into one day right in the middle of it then i probably would have liked it a lot more the story follows the lives of two young people played by anne hathaway and jim sturgess and their relationship over the course of the film by the middle it has been established that hathaway and sturgesss characters emma and dexter have a special bond although its never clear what kind while theres not a ton of chemistry between them there is just enough to keep the second half flowing but there was still a big problem that i just couldnt ignore     the first half never really established why emma and dexter even like to be around each other the movie is structured to only show you one day out of every year hence the title and while that narrative works later in the movie it makes it hard to understand the base of leads relationship basically its clear they have feeling for each other but its not clear why     despite that problem however there are many good things i took with me when i exited the theater the best scenes in the entire movie are when jim sturgess is with his family his character is quite reckless and not too long into the movie reaches sort of his breaking point his relationship with his parents is damaged but he seems to wish he could fix things but doesnt think he can those are the moments when you really feel for his character and sturgess does a great job of makes us feel sympathy for him despite his negative characteristics its that sympathy that actually makes us accept him and although its not enough to want him to end up with emma it does really make us want him to get cleaned up    hathaways character isnt as interesting as her counterpart but she makes the best out of it she struggles a little bit with the accent but should that really matter     in the end the reason why i enjoyed this film is because it had little moments that were really affective it may follow the nicolas sparks stepbystep handbook but these characters have more depth than that and in the end its more of a story about two individuals and some moments that shaped their lives many that did and many that didnt involve the other
Aug 26 2011,negative,the problem with this is that there is little character development and no emotional involvement so when things happen you dont actually care
Aug 26 2011,negative,i found one day to be a bit droll hathaway carrying a northern english accent was hard to listen to because there seemed to be times where it would be dropped then randomly picked up out of no where   sturgess character i found to be loathsome for the better part of the movie   this is based on a book and so not having read the book i cannot descide if it was originally how the character was written for dexter or how sturgess chose to portray him however i could not understand the desired friendship between dex and emma   the movie jumped without expressing fully the main points in the characters lives in which i would think best friends would be involved his mothers death his wedding anything about emmas family the birth of his childobviously they were important for each other but it is not clearly shown in this movie  i didnt feel the chemistry i didnt get the makeup choices for sturgess hathaway cuts her hair and she is in her mid 30s but he is given crows feet and has his hair lightened  sturgess seemed melodramatic to hathaways dramatic soapopera to drama and they didnt play well to each other i much prefered ian both actor and character though sturgess is very good looking  in the endsad tale good cinematography but the writing and acting left much to be desired
Aug 26 2011,positive,it is a fab film it brought back great memories of one of my all time favourite books and do you know what if i had it on dvd it would be watched again and again and again well done mr nicholls
Aug 26 2011,neutral,average although would probably of rated lower if anne hathaway wasnt in it
Aug 26 2011,negative,no where near as good as the book not worth a watch really anne hathaways accent was terrible
Aug 26 2011,positive,not a bad movie in fact pretty good just a little choppy and confusing toward the end
Aug 26 2011,negative,completely disappointing romantic comedy that has a distorted vision of romance and far too few comedic moments to offset the romantic deficit  anne hathaway infuses her character an aspiring writer with plenty of wit and charm but even she cannot overcome a plot line that just stinks  her love interest played by jim sturgess is unrepentently selfabsorbed and repellent  without being a spoiler let me just say i hated the ending which was further proof that it was seriously misadvertised as a romantic comedy
Aug 26 2011,positive,read my review at     the challenge of one day towards my general stance on adaptations is relative to the fact that david nicholls is doing the screenplay the logic there should be that the original author will preserve whats good about the story but within the strictures of a 12a film that runs for 108 minutes it never feels like anything more than another version of the story     though i hate to say it its almost an advert for the book and theres shockingly very little else to it for the more openminded fans of the book i think it will prove an enjoyable companion piece but the cast who do a damn good job deserved better    for more of my views and reviews visit 
Aug 26 2011,positive,its a wonderful film filled with emotions the characters develop nicely and make u really care about what happens to them
Aug 26 2011,positive,i cant believe it got such a low score whatever it was wonderful the pace was wonderful the acting was brilliant their chemistry was right on i also loved his parents cant place their faces but great actors as well this movie so makes me wanna go back and read the movie now
Aug 26 2011,negative,i loved david nicholls book starter for ten and the film adaptation both were very funny and was just a really a great story this is what lead me to read one day and watch the film the book was very good it captured that time period from late 80s to early 2000s perfectly and was both funny and poignant the film just doesnt seem to work it gets a few things right along the way but it feels rushed and i dont think the actors were totally suited to their roles i think the only reason i found myself enjoying parts of the film was because it just reminded me of the book
Aug 26 2011,negative,this movie tricks you down a dead end road  good actors good acting and good potential but thats it  it painfully takes you through one depressing predictable scene after another it feels like you are sitting through 20 years in the theater and final destination is nowhere  what a waste of time and money
Aug 25 2011,negative,i give this flick 5 really rotten tomatoes i saw it for free and it still wasnt worth it tedious slow boring uninteresting uninspired it got one half of one star because hathaway and sturgess are nice to look at buy the poster
Aug 25 2011,positive,i had seen this on a date and even better a film critic was sitting right in front of us how did i know he was old alone wtf had all kinda writing stuff with him he was taking notesbut he left a quarter of the film so im guessing he didnt care for it    well basically two people meet one day and continually see eachother that day from 1988 to 2000ish they predictablly end up together but it foreshadows something to happen at the beginning i wont ruin it for you though if you read a few other ratings youll find out  the film does drag on at bits it kinda felt like ugg all these years tt  but all in all its a neat little movie that i enjoyed very much id watch it again    what i really liked though was the realisticness of the characters and the situations they go through you cant help but feel for them    i totally reccomend
Aug 25 2011,positive,nice but it just doesnt come to life as a film like it did as a book follow this link for my full review

Aug 25 2011,positive,i read the book and was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed the movie im usually disappointed with film adaptations  the cast was fantastic and yes anne hathaways accent is much better than what you hear in the trailers  highly recommend
Aug 25 2011,positive,i have a feeling that the book is slightly better
Aug 25 2011,positive,not a patch on the book but still a good stab at a romcomcutesy comedy anne well that accent sometimes emmerdale sometimes posh she made michelle collins sound perfcet in corrie but it didnt spoil what was as good perfromance sturgess well he is no firth or grant but he was good quietly stealing the whole show was clarkson she is effortless and one wonders why she isnt a bigger star see it and take a ahnkie or 6
Aug 25 2011,positive,its not the book but nothing could be a good change from a summer of explosions and over hyped action films
Aug 25 2011,neutral,some good performances here in this romantic drama but the pacing of the story is really slow so it was hard to sit through at times
Aug 25 2011,positive,loved every single minute of it   romantic heart wrenching tragic and very recognizable  anne hathaways accent might be a bit off but thats just a minor flaw in this captivating love story  oh and jim sturgess is soo hot  
Aug 25 2011,positive,nothing really happens but somehow you can not keep your eyes off the screen so mystical and golutious sad but happy but sad yeah really sad 
Aug 25 2011,negative,was really disappointed by the ending kind of a shaggy dog story a lot of buildup with a halfhearted ending it had some nice moments but i cant say i would recommend it overall
Aug 25 2011,negative,so cheesy and cliche
Aug 25 2011,positive,i loved it such a beautiful film but with an sad ending wish it didnt have to end like that however it was a beautiful love story
Aug 25 2011,positive,beautiful movingjust a wonderful and heartbreaking film about the complexities of friendshiprelationships thoroughly worth a viewing
Aug 25 2011,positive,episodic and disappointing adaptation of a great book  hathaway tries her best but is miscast edinburgh however looks stunning
Aug 25 2011,positive,book and my imagination were better
Aug 25 2011,negative,begins and ends in edinburgh  which makes it interesting  but its a little dull love story why does she have a crush on this guy who is not even likeable  ho hum females apparently like it guys stay away 
Aug 25 2011,positive,this is a lovely film  it is so emotional and i even had a couple of tears in my eyes  it is a great film
Aug 25 2011,positive,not read the book and do not plan to  as a film i rather enjoyed thisa little slow in parts but enjoyable nonetheless
Aug 25 2011,positive,quite disappointed didnt cry and wanted a good one good story overall but could hav been so much more emotional
Aug 24 2011,positive,saw that ending coming sadly
Aug 24 2011,positive,movie is good except for the accident part which i really dont like
Aug 24 2011,positive,wow i really enjoyed this moviefunny happy sad heartbreakinggo
Aug 24 2011,negative,nobody really cares about this romance they just want to see it over and done with just as much as they want to see anne be done with that lameass british accent seriously were there no british actresses out there to call up
Aug 24 2011,positive,an interesting idea to visit one day every year to see how much has changed in a year but a little self serving and sad the characters were very human and believable
Aug 24 2011,positive,im such a sucker for the sappy love stories  
Aug 24 2011,positive,its hathaway at her most adorable and there is good chemistry between her and sturgess its a witty and transcending love story with a splash of romantic hopelessness most  will be left with a flash of their own memories when the credits roll
Aug 24 2011,negative,the worst interpretation of book to film i have seen in a long time loved the book loathed the movie
Aug 24 2011,positive,she made you decent and you made her so happy
Aug 24 2011,positive,great love story well written  the character portrayal is top notch highly recommended
Aug 24 2011,positive,cute undemanding and engaging enough disclaimer didnt read the book which i suspect might suit the 1 day a year concept better here it is a bit restrictive some expositions feel a bit clumsy and the emotional buildup can feel rushed but some very decent performances who knows patricia clarkson can do a british accent as good or better than hathaways give it enough charm to coast through and as a remembrance of the last 25 decades  brilliant
Aug 24 2011,positive,a good film quick paced and funny two thumbs up
Aug 24 2011,positive,ive been told its not as good as the book but i still enjoyed it
Aug 24 2011,positive,incredibly directed and played  anne hathaway  touching performance xx
Aug 24 2011,positive,excellent movie especially great performances by anne and jim
Aug 24 2011,negative,this film leaves me longing to just open the book and fill in the gaps some of the little details that were changed or reinvented like their walk through the maze made me cringe strangely enough i ended up liking dexters character in the movie much more than in the book and emmas much less overall though im not sure if i would have liked this film even if i had not previously read the novel i dont feel as connected to em and dex dex and em
Aug 24 2011,positive,if youve not read the book go go go enjoy
Aug 24 2011,positive,a bit disappointed but i envy their lives in some ways
Aug 24 2011,negative,there is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout one day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film  this is anne hathaways atrocious accent  many americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable british accent  however anne hathaways character emma morley sounds at different times irish scottish and american but never british  it truly was irritating after awhile  why didnt the filmmakers just cast a british actress  or if they were dead set on hathaway playing emma then move the whole story to america  if not for the distracting aural miscues this film would most likely be much more enjoyable    emma and dexter jim sturgess meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party  this is not a meetcute either  they are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other therefore fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand  things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship  this is mostly convincing as emma is seen to be truly infatuated with dexter who does not see her in the same light in fact he treats her rather poorly as the years go by  graduation night was july 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible      surprisingly every july 15th is actually a pretty horrible sad day for each of them  very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another july 15th  furthermore the film focuses much more on dexter than emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps  emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until dexter happens upon it  this made me wonder that if dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than emma why all the fuss to make anne hathaway british    since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on the storys climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative  the scene is also very poorly shot  the director lone scherfig who made the brilliant an education two years ago completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it  the event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up       another miscue is patricia clarksons role as dexters mother  it feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process  not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie but she only shows up in about twothree scenes moves the plot along and then shes out of there  i have not read the novel but i guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie    ps there is an atrocious elvis costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes
Aug 24 2011,positive,starts slow  really good movie shows timing is everything
Aug 24 2011,positive,a strange film that whizzes by without much actually happening  characterwise its not much more than slightly exaggerated sketches but what makes the film work is its grasp on meloncholia and all the what ifs the one day aspect also means the audience has to work by filling in the blanks as to what happened either side of those particular days the only downside is some days are more interesting than others    jim sturgess is lumbered with an unlikable character throughout and while hathaway does succeed with making her character believable and rounded her accent is well interesting at times i forgot she had a northern lilt as her clipped english would suddenly sprout a norrrrthern lov nice try though which is probably how to sum up the film whilst it does play with your emotions it does pack a punch by the end
Aug 24 2011,positive,really enjoyed this both leads were great also it doesnt quite pan out how you would expect which was good overall
Aug 24 2011,negative,this movie was a mess  this is not the uplifiting movie the trailer makes it out to be terribly miscast too
Aug 24 2011,negative,like when harry met sally but fewer laughs more pathos and not as good  i kind of liked the gimmick of visiting the same day every year but that was about the only creative aspect of the project if you are going to use a formula at least do it well and go somewhere pleasant
Aug 24 2011,negative,very disappointing the story skips through too quickly anne hathaways accent is frankly appalling if you liked the book avoid it if youve not read the book read it and give the film a miss
Aug 24 2011,negative,again dont trust the trailer thank god anne starring in the movie
Aug 23 2011,negative,horrible and a waste of money
Aug 23 2011,positive,one of my kind of movies nothing fancy just about one of my favorite topicslove  it was ok for a tuesday night she longs for the guy hes busy about disappointing his parents and living the wild life but keeping emma as the good friend  ian the boyfriend was a total goofball but funnydid not expect the ending
Aug 23 2011,negative,the last 10 min were ok the rest was so boring
Aug 23 2011,positive,ok i thought it was a great movie a quote from anne hathaway sums it up but i wont post it for fear of it being a spoiler  a very touching film
Aug 23 2011,positive,jim sturgess is great in this movie   i connected to both characters  but particularly dex
Aug 23 2011,neutral,definitely a romantic emotional comedy youve gotta love jim sturgesss character all the waydefinitely very brilliant anne was amazing all in all
Aug 23 2011,positive,this movie was slow to start but then i kinda got into it and this movie can really get ya thinking anne hathaway and jim sturges do a great job  one day is a really good movie but if you plan on seeing it i would bring a box of tissues not the little pack or just onebut a whole box
Aug 23 2011,positive,i enjoyed the movie it wasnt as funny as the book hard to translate all the sarcastic humor on screen but its as much of a tear jerker as the book

Aug 23 2011,positive,good moviebut so sad
Aug 23 2011,positive,one day is my kind of romance movie for once you get two people that you actually want to end up together when all is said and done the idea of popping in on their lives every year for two decades changes formula keeps things fresh exciting and never stale heartwarming in one breath and entirely heartbreaking the next jim sturgess and anne hathaway have chemistry and give both honest charmed and genuine performances gotta say though i like hathaway much better with her american accent
Aug 23 2011,positive,great movie bring tissues
Aug 23 2011,positive,one day is your standard romantic tearjerker while it pleases the target audience if you are not of the target audience steer clear it wil feel like this movie is dragging on forever if you are not interested in the film five to ten minutes into the film the film has some twists but if youre the type of person who predicts every single event that goes on you wont like this film you have to sit back and enjoy the chemistry of the two actors works pretty well so ill give the film some credit there overall its fair but you can find better romance drama films on dvd to sub for this one and there are also some romance films still in theaters released better than this one friends with benefits crazy stupid love etc
Aug 23 2011,positive,not a big fan of this adaptation cutting off too many scenes feels like the whole movie going in a rush but the storys beautiful credit to david nicholls 
Aug 23 2011,positive,a poetic ode to great friendship and even greater love bookmarked by our beautiful city of edinburgh
Aug 23 2011,positive,very surreal at one point but worth seeing jim sturgess and anne hathaway had good chemistry
Aug 23 2011,positive,good but slow in places and not quite the romcom i was expecting  dodgy accent too
Aug 23 2011,positive,one say was a lovely and unique love story granted ann hathaways accent was slightly forced but i forgot about that once i was engulfed by the film great art directions interesting shots and great performances all around my only real complaint might be that it dragged in a few scenes but nothing too drastic that would affect the film its really worth watching
Aug 23 2011,positive,wow this movie is fantastic anne hathaway and jim sturgess are perfect together and this movie is quite perfect
Aug 23 2011,positive,i dont know what the critics were talking about  i really enjoyed this movie  it helps that jim sturgess is gorgeous  i do think anne hathaways accent was dreadful though
Aug 23 2011,positive,not enough details  i red the book but still i enjoyed it
Aug 23 2011,negative,one day 2011  directed by lone scherfig  starring anne hathaway jim sturgess  running time 108 minutes rated pg13  1 mitch out of 5  mitch hansch movieswithmitchcom    the month july the day 15th  that one day a year for 20 plus years is when we get to see into the the lives of emma anne hathaway an dexter jim sturgess in one day  emma is an aspiring writer who is led by her insecurities while dexter is mr popular who gets by with little more than his charm  they first meet in 1988 after their graduation  the two end up at emmas place to hookup until dexter tries to sneak out eventually conceding to friendship      that introduction immediately had me rooting that the two brits dont get together  right away we know dexter will have to do some serious maturing for us to be cool with him getting the sweethearted emma but 15th after 15th there are no signs  because of romantic movie law i know the two will end up together but the further the film goes the more i begged for emma not to be with this incredibly shallow clod    anne hathaway is her usual consistent talent as shes able to nicely show the growth in confidence thats gained from lifes failures  jim sturgess on the other hand is mightily outclassed  sturgess gives one of the worst performances of the year moving through most of the film as if hes been cast in a smarmy highend scotch commercial      dexter gets blevel fame as an obnoxious host on one of the nations most illrespected programs dexter was a pompous jerk before but a drug habit and his womanizing certainly doesnt help  sturgess dexter is one of the most unsympathetic characters i can remember put on film  even dexters own mother patricia clarkson on her death bed knows it lamenting youre not very nice anymore     emma on the other hand is in london losing focus of her dream as she works at a texmex restaurant  she settles for a relationship with a very unfunny standup comedian played by rafe spall who slips in a subpar ricky gervais style of delivery far too often  its so sad to see that it only takes one compliment from dexter and its enough for emma to cling on for a few more years  when the two aim for a platonic vacation emma lights up when dexter tells her that he fancies her but immediately follows it up with happening to fancy everyone  sturgesss dexter says this with no defensiveness scared of how shell reply but with seriousness showing his true shallow colors        the source material comes from david nicholls book same time next year who is also responsible for the screenplay  the narrative sameday gimmick may have worked in the book but in this film it isnt anywhere near enough to overcome this cold story drained of any romance  so void of any warmth and joy when emma asks whats the point of the twos relationship you couldnt agree more        director lone scherfig follows her most acclaimed film an education with this lifeless disappointment  scherfig paints the picture with a message that youll become your potential when youre with the right person  when all along hathaway and sturgess show zero chemistry and portray a coupling that never gives a hint of functional healthiness   one day is an abusive relationship with a romantic drama ribbon wrapped around it             this is an abusive relationship with a romantic drama ribbon wrapped around it    titus 310
Aug 23 2011,positive,id like to think the book was better than the film otherwise it wouldnt have a been an international best seller some interesting dynamics and has a strong finish but up until then is a bit blah blah blah
Aug 23 2011,negative,i fell asleep several times  not that great
Aug 23 2011,negative,um after all that she dies really knew i should have readfinished the book first
Aug 23 2011,positive,i found it is a very touching and beautiful story i didnt find any problem with annes accent although im probably not eligible to comment on that as a nonbritish man i think she will be a legendary actress
Aug 23 2011,positive,a pretty standard romance flick with some twists  i did enjoy seeing the lost chances wild dex what did she see in him and anne growing up from the nerd she was early in the film  dex seemed to always be in trouble  the film was presented in taking 1 day of year to show the progression of their relationship  many good back and forth moments  i did love the cinematography in scotland and london  the accents were odd but anne did manage to pick up some scottish lingo which impressed me  id recommend this as its entertaining and anne hathaway is easy on the eyes
Aug 22 2011,positive,loved anne hathawayawesomethe total concept of the movie is breathtakingloved every bit of it
Aug 22 2011,negative,depressing for no reason also absurdly long
Aug 22 2011,positive,theres something missing here though i really liked anne hathaways character
Aug 22 2011,positive,nice but a little boring
Aug 22 2011,positive,without a doubt this is one of the most emotional stunning and all around fantastic movies i have ever seen the chemistry between emma hathaway and dexter sturgess is one that tugs and pulls at your heart throughout the whole movie then the climax is painful enough to move even the most stoic person to tears i can honestly say that i have never seen anything like it and im glad that i did
Aug 22 2011,positive,as usual the critics are dead wrong this was a very good movie the type of movie you go see on a date with someone you really care about fellas take your girl to go see this movie
Aug 22 2011,positive,beautiful movie about true love and being best friends with the one you love
Aug 22 2011,positive,well once again the critics are dead wrong this movie was really great guys take your girl to go see this movie makes for a great date nite movie
Aug 22 2011,positive,i never expected this ending
Aug 22 2011,positive,i like this movie is not the hollywood happy ending finally
Aug 22 2011,neutral,on july 15 1988 in the wake of many graduation parties emmaanne hathaway and dexterjim sturgess retire to her room to have sex  sadly she puts on a tracy chapman record which ruins the mood and the two decide to remain friends    on july 15 1989 emma moves to london to pursue a career in writing    on july 15 1990 emma is in hell employed as a waitress in a mexican restaurant    at least on july 15 1991 she is about to be promoted to manager and joined in her suffering by ianrafe spall a wannabe commedian  meanwhile dexter is on vacation in paris with his parentspatricia clarkson  ken stott where he remembers that emma could use one too    one day is a disappointing and overlong film from lone scherfig who has fared much better in the past with offbeat material  the idea of exploring a friendship over decades in a single day each year is not a bad idea per se and anne hathaway and jim sturgess are both game and likable  its just that in looking at the adjustment to a post university life the movie forgets the small moments that make life so bittersweet in favor of the cliched extremes of successcorrect me if im wrong but we never hear anything of emmas parents  in fact emma and dexter seem to exist in a bubble not changing much over the decades and not having much interaction with the real world except for some pop music  for example in this movies july 15 2005 no mention is made of the london terrorist attacks that happened eight days previously
Aug 22 2011,positive,plain geeky girls might not be good in the sack but they make great friends
Aug 22 2011,positive,wow i absolutely adored this movie and i hate chick flicks i loved the way it was filmed and the acting was top notch such a relatable story for anyone who has a best friend of the opposite sex
Aug 22 2011,negative,a completely fine movie thats perfectly capable of holding ones interest until a stroke of terrible thoughtless and cheap storytelling derails the entire thing stay away
Aug 22 2011,positive,a sweet film about how our relationships and we as people develop throughout life  the portrayal of the different stages was nicely done but im sure it would come off better reading the novel  sturgess and hathaway did a good job with their roles  as did the lovable patricia clarkson  the only thing that got to me at times was annes accent  she did a good job not going into her her american accent but there were times i heard some scottish tones come out p  anyway still made me cry at the end like all of his movies do
Aug 22 2011,positive,it is not an easy task trying to do justice to this wonderful book and neither is it easy to cover 20 years in the limit of the given time i know that anne and jim are good actors but whoevers fault it was i didnt feel like they portrayed their characters as theyre in the book some things were changed a lot was toned down and everything was moving very fast i would have liked this movie to have been a little longer and done differently maybe focusing on the bigger changes in order for the audience to connect easier with the characters though i must say that there were some scenes that did touch me and i still did enjoy the movie
Aug 22 2011,positive,a very good film which although at times is predictable is in turns heartwarming and heartbreaking  anne hathaways accent isnt great by any means but the acting is so good that its easy to overlook that and just get caught up in the story  the producers could have bothered to make her age over time though that was they did with jim sturgess
Aug 22 2011,negative,not that good i hate how it ended too 
Aug 22 2011,positive,quite undeserving of all of the bad reviews id heard a fair effort but i still prefer the book
Aug 22 2011,negative,it was worth seeing once but kinda slow predictable and definately sad
Aug 22 2011,positive,i loved this moving but then i loved the book and it really lived up to the book sturgess blew away hathaway though i must admit
Aug 22 2011,positive,yy i love them emdexthey are my warmly feeling  in winteri love this movie so much
Aug 22 2011,negative,completely lets the book down has moments of wit and heart but very few and far in between
Aug 21 2011,positive,let me start out by saying i havent seen a movie that i have been this emotionally connected to in a very ver long time this movie has made me laugh and cry and made me feel deep feelings that have numbed since my recent loss of friendship this movie has connected with my soul this movie is an amazing must see film about true love that never dies it is a film i will see over and over again and that is just in the theater i will drag every friend i have to see this film i am touched by the story and once again captivated my the music within and im talking movie score the music that plays during an emotional scene that gives you just enough of a push to make you cry within an emotional scene that is deep in feeling and in understanding of how they feel a connection if you will as to what they are going thru that brings you into a part of the film instead of just being some movie you are watching i have been waiting to see this film for 6 months since i first saw the movie poster and i watched the trailer 1 week before going to actually see it i am amazed by what i saw it was everything i thought it would be plus more not disappointed one little bite i will see this movie countless times just in the theater alone and i will buy this on bluray and it will be a movie that will be keeping tucked in my iphone to watch at a moments notice in case of boardroom anywhere in the world please watch it and connect and enjoy d 3
Aug 21 2011,positive,was not expecting it to turn out so depressingly
Aug 21 2011,negative,that was the worst movie i have ever seen it was worse than band slam its all stupid one day every year and they go through all this relationship stuff and end up together then she gets hit by a bus and randomly dies it was horrible
Aug 21 2011,neutral,a little preachy more than a little saccharine but really not sure why the critics are so eagerly panning this one not as good as one might have hoped but not so bad barring annes wretched manchester accent of course
Aug 21 2011,positive,interesting story with some twists with much more substance than a typical chickflick
Aug 21 2011,positive,point of movie  dont waste your whole life trying to avoid the obvious  enjoyed this movie very much
Aug 21 2011,positive,one day is a great representation of the novel it leaves out a few noncrucial parts of the plot but keeps the important aspects of the story sturgess and hathaway make great main characters and the plot keeps the points that make it such a profound story its really touching and i recommend everyone read the book and then watch the film i cried for the entire second half of the movie its just such a realistic feeling story and relationship all the critics whove reviewed this so harshly im sad that you liked planet of the apes better than this beautiful story
Aug 21 2011,negative,omg you want to kill yourself after seeing this spoiler alert when you want that special someone you cant have them
Aug 21 2011,negative,the last quarter was starting to get interesting and then it reaches back to the mediocre movie its truly is
Aug 21 2011,positive,i find it really truly awful that this movie is getting flack for something as simple as anne hathaway isnt a real brit piss off will you robert pattinson still cant pull an american accent properly and he gets rave reviews for some of his movies i read the book and it was a lovely enough adaptation i mean it kept everything truly important to the essence of the book and the book is just genius to be honest the movie is beautiful heartbreaking and the most honest piece of work i have ever read or seen my grandmother is still getting over it she is in shock but she loved it as much as i did i found myself weeping a day or two over the whole thing it is a true love story it is refreshing and honest no bullshit here bring tissues prepare for a reality check anne hathaway and jim sturgess are flawless as they always are they have a real chemistry and this movie should be doing a hell of a lot better than it is i am disappointed with the reviews because they are utter bullshit see this movie
Aug 21 2011,negative,i looked forward to this film but was really disappointed it was dull and boring i expected a lot more from hathaway
Aug 21 2011,negative,wow way to take a amazing book and trash it they changed things that completely had no reason to be changed added things that werent there and well took away the soul of the book besides that i thought it was jumpy and didnt really get the true feel of their relationships i thought they rushed through the plot to get through all the years i think that if they movie had taken its time maybe added 20 minutes it would have been able to really capture the book this movie was trash and the first time ive ever considered walking out in a theater too bad thing it costs an arm and a leg to get in or i would have
Aug 21 2011,neutral,why am i obsessed with this film bad accent bad accent bad accent hair cut stop it
Aug 21 2011,negative,i have a very high tolerance for movies and this was just awful no plot no anything the best part was when she got hit by a truck
Aug 21 2011,positive,james sturgess is the most gorgeous thing in the entire universe i cant sleep i cant think my oh my what a man
Aug 21 2011,positive,all this talk about anne hathaways accent is overblown since she does a pretty good job the story itself plays like a fantasy with important events always happening on the same day of two peoples life the story spands 20 years but only focuses on a july 15 its a look into the lives of two people who live life a part but in the end are always meant for each other you do know where the story is headed and even the twist ending didnt surpirse me that much there are some touching scenes but most of it is just events leading up to the ending the third act is where the movie loses direction and i wished scenes were shown earlier instead of later this is what happens when you have the writer of the novel write the screenplay you lose that perspective that a fresh writer could have seen the movie is a little tedious following almost every single year in the 20 year relationship of the two leads some years are hits some are misses but in a movie like this you cant afford to have any misses     grade b
Aug 21 2011,negative,one day isboth too much and not enough becoming just an average love story in the end    the relationship of two people anne hathaway  jim sturgess over 20 years during the 90s00sits a good idea to show a relationship through the years on the same day this story device works at the beginning but loses steam as the years roll by too much happens during the other 364 days of the year causing disjoint in the narrativeits hard to see how this relationship grew or even stayed together over the years besides because it didhathaway is good as always and sturgess is good but together theyre really just an average couplethe trick of changing hair and glasses to make people age or seem younger could have been a lot betterthe idea of how love can conquer all is always good but not enough to save this moviethe ending is both gutwrenching and quasisweetthe 90s soundtrack through the years was a nice touchunfortunately this movie poster is probably the most memorable aspect of this flick    personal experience used to write this review 110 minutes of watching one of the only true romance movies of a subpar superhero summer which was also subpar sadly     paul  moxieandcharismawordpresscom
Aug 21 2011,positive,a sweet romance film but had a unexpedted twist
Aug 21 2011,positive,awe it was so good i want to buy it it really hit home with some of the emotions
Aug 21 2011,neutral,good acting should have made the story line better
Aug 21 2011,positive,amazing movie  i really cant describe it without giving it away but its all ive ever looked for in a relationship  it also voices my worst fear in a relationship  watch it and you will know why i cried for 40 minutes
Aug 21 2011,negative,it was alway going to be difficult to do the book justice this film sadly doesnt
Aug 21 2011,neutral,disappointing scenariolast 15 minutes maybe the scenes to seeno chemistry evident between the yearly possible friends to be lovers over 20 years
Aug 21 2011,positive,anne hathaways accent was horrible but the story was quite charming and romantic it was quite nostalgic for me so i enjoyed the movie once you kind of block out hathaways accent its not so bad 
Aug 21 2011,negative,in comparison to the book this movie is really weak
Aug 21 2011,positive,i liked the movie  especially anne hathaway despite what the critics say
Aug 21 2011,positive,such a romantic story
Aug 21 2011,negative,disappointing and i wanted to like it
Aug 21 2011,positive,simply put this is the best rotten film i have seen  when my wife and i decided to see a movie on friday i had three choices that we could both agree onthe help crazy stupid love and one day  i follow the critics admittedly a fault but i generally find a consensus and i was intrigued by the variety of opinions for one day for example claudia puig from usa today said that anne hathaways british accent was spot on peter travers called it one of the biggest modern day frauds or something like that and  roger ebert really liked it  how could these people who criticize movies for a living have such different opinions    before we went into the movie i almost second guessed myself and just about ducked into the help which i know will be good but i stuck to my guns and saw one day    i am glad i did  i agree that there is a lot to pick on from character development to scenes that feel staged  but most movies suffer much worse  i generally find ah as a bit annoying and trying too hard see rachel getting married ironically a critical darling but i feel that she nailed this role to a tee  dont know much about jim sturgess but he did a fine job as well    so if you are in the mood for a romance even if youre a dude go ahead and take a chance on this one you just might like it
Aug 21 2011,negative,sheâtms boring heâtms boorish this is one day iâtmd like to have back thanks
Aug 21 2011,positive,you know heshe is the one when you are a better person around himher so dont waste time guessing hiding because you never know how much time is left for you two
Aug 21 2011,negative,boring no star chemistry skip it
Aug 21 2011,negative,one day is a terrific book  one day is not in almost any way a terrific movie  written by the same guy who wrote the incisive nonsentimental character study of a novel the screenplay here seems like a hallmarky wander through moments in the lives of two notveryinteresting people as they wander in and out of each others lives for 20 years  can i make it abundantly clear that i love the book  love it  its full of tiny touches and surprising turns that make it not so much a romance as an exploration of how a guy grows up because of a girl  but the movie waters it down by both removing detail and adding too much and the result is a soggy obvious mess  yes the actors are appealing and sweet  but i had a much better time reading it and just picturing them in it  i recommend the same to you
Aug 21 2011,positive,i see a large consensus forming within the ranks of the critics but perhaps those who are in the majority just dont possess the depth necessary to really enjoy this film  it is not formulaic  those criticising anne hathaways accent are perhaps not getting that her character is a yorkshire lass and not a londoner while this englishman saw inconsistencies in her accent they were no worse than when many londoners try to do yorkshire    due to time constraints this film while remaining true to the book did rush through the early years in a manner that failed to convey the depth of dexs love for his mother and his utter drunken despair at her passing  it similarly didnt delve enough into dexs alcoholism or emmas huge popularity as an author  however even while skirting so much of the early depth i still felt that by the halfway point of the film the scene had been sufficiently set that a person able to look at human emotion and relationships my wife for one would be drawn into this intricate relationship and ultimately highly worthwhile film    if you want the typical hollywood love story stay at home  if you prefer your storylines not to be spoonfed to you and are able to ascertain depth with your own eyes and perceptions do go to see it
Aug 21 2011,positive,sweet movie  not a big fan of the ending but it was a good movie overall
Aug 21 2011,negative,this movie sucked if i could give it less then half a star i would
Aug 21 2011,positive,i had big expectations from the movie starting with miss anne hathaway one of my favourite actresses but at the end of the film i felt quite dissappointed after seeing the movie i read the book and it was so much better i cant really understand how  mr david nicholls couldnt adapt a better screenplay personally the best element of the movie is rachel portmans beautiful score
Aug 21 2011,positive,whatever happens tomorrow weve had today
Aug 21 2011,positive,excellent writers characters loved this movie
Aug 21 2011,negative,just an odd movie that for whatever reason thinks you should care about the two main leads even though both performances are blah and the characters blah as well with hathaway being horrendous as usual its predictable and incredibly tedious
Aug 21 2011,positive,average movie entertaining  this role for anne hathaway was way beneath her acting ability  scenery was great makes me want to go back to the uk
Aug 21 2011,negative,it wanted to be a good movie but couldnt make it
Aug 21 2011,positive,not as good as expected  dont understand their love storyfeel they are silly
Aug 21 2011,positive,can best friends be lovers would she  he be your soulmate a retroclassicvintage love journey that ran through over 2 decades hits and misses relations together and apart from each other  the true meaning of soulmate was linked through the red thread that ran through the first encounter great movie for hopeless romantics
Aug 21 2011,positive,pretty good couple
Aug 21 2011,positive,anne is always beautifuland such lovely scene in the movieblown me away
Aug 21 2011,neutral,so disappointed for the plot but when we talk about one day thats mean we talking about the acting of anne hataway  and for the music too 
Aug 21 2011,positive,have just read the book   now i have seen the movie also i dont know if its good or bad to have read the book before the movie
Aug 21 2011,negative,this movie is just horrible i love anne hathaway and hoped when i was a few minutes into it that she could save it but this just wasnt the case her british accent was horrible they should have had her play an american in london and left it at that the story is obvious from the title you know that eventually these characters will end up together but getting there is long boring arduous and makes one wish they were asleep this movie is only 1 hour 48 minutes long but it feels like it is 3 hours long the last 30 minutes or so of it are good and there is a surprise ending that i did not see coming but the story is horrible i guess this proves that an author should not rewrite their material as a screenplay at least that is the case with this
Aug 20 2011,positive,ok to watch reality show
Aug 20 2011,positive,one day is a very sweet and heartwrenching story with a fantastic script and a plot that will leave you wondering what will come next  while the film has its faults hathaways accent is atrocious and often forgotten the story is one of life not hollywood life where everything ends perfectly but real life where things dont always go as planned  this is a great chick flick and i look forward to seeing it again when it comes out on dvd
Aug 20 2011,negative,horrible ending warning do not see it will make u depressed
Aug 20 2011,neutral,movie was a little to long and an ending that was so sad why does it take so long for 2 people to find each other and then time runs out
Aug 20 2011,negative,sometimes bad ideas come wrapped in beautiful paper weak plot points poor character development and cheap gimmicks i sat through the movie ticking off the years that gave me the feeling that i was on a treadmill ticking off the quarter miles the bad thing is the concept would work if the movie was stretched into a miniseries just didnt work within an 1 hour 47 minute time frame dont waste the time and gas might be worth a swing on your netflix queue
Aug 20 2011,negative,it was so bad i was angry after watching it
Aug 20 2011,negative,i rarely walk out of a movie but this one was a complete yawn
Aug 20 2011,positive,sad but surprisingly touching and nice makes you wanna have your own guy best friend that you kinda have a thing for jim sturgess if you are available so am i  
Aug 20 2011,negative,very disappointing film  anne hathaway is marvelous but the director gave no positve qualities to her love interest jim sturgess  the result is that the audience dislikes this guy and can not figure out why anne hathaway would put up with this  if you want to see a film that is butchered by a director this one is for you  could have been a very good movie instead it was poor  love may be blind but not this blind
Aug 20 2011,positive,kept me entertained the ending was surprising ann hathaway and jim sturgess did a good job
Aug 20 2011,positive,doesnt compare to the book but still decent sad

Aug 20 2011,negative,the man she loved had few redeeming qualities throughout the years and when he does get his act together disaster strikes i gave it 15 stars because the other 35 represent the percentage of depression i left with ugh
Aug 20 2011,neutral,anne hathaway is her typical glorious self but her counterpart jim sturgess is largely a dislikable cad the whole film wrecking the films hopes of being the memorable love story it wants to be
Aug 20 2011,neutral,i thought that definitely maybe which is roughly similar in its plot line was the better film of the two although one day stayed completely away from politics unlike definitely maybe but one day lacked the emotional impact that i was expecting after all if the main theme of your film is relationships are hard well  we all came into the theater knowing that didnt we ive never been a big fan of american actorsactresses trying to speak with a british accent either the film moved slowly through its storyline in its first 23 still the movie had a surprising ending and did manage to pull together all of the subplots of the movie nicely at the end
Aug 20 2011,negative,this movie sucks even my girlfriend hates it
Aug 20 2011,positive,this is a tricky one  a couple of things made this a great movie for me i read the book and im a huge fan of really subtle movies low drama is what i call it      the book is one of my favorites i wept as i read the 4th quarter  on the train no less  humiliating but very satisfying    there is a lot in the book and i was curious what they would do with it all im glad they cut a lot out  a lot of stuff that was unnecessary having all the background probably made my movie going experience better than if i hadnt read it      what do i mean by this  well in the book dex is a douchebag  and although its touched on in the movie its nothing compared to the book also in the final quarter  you know the weeping part  there is much more substance to what happens  and while i knew from reading it im not sure everyone who sees the movie will know  know what i mean    again its really subtle its not over the top like jane eyre or other romances with big huge music that makes you dry  its more of a sweet story the kind i like
Aug 20 2011,positive,excellent young adult love story that i hope gets remembered academy awards time not really for the below college aged they wont get it but college aged and above since it is about the phenomenon called emerging adulthood it could make for a great discussion piece among friends and with ones own parents  
Aug 20 2011,positive,the good things in life arent always easy a little happy a little sad but i wouldnt change a thing
Aug 20 2011,positive,i thoroughly expected this to be a cookie cutter romcom and i was pleasantly surprised  it will make you laugh it will make you cry  it will make you think excellent movie and definitely worth a watch or two or three 
Aug 20 2011,positive,very soulful  loved the story
Aug 20 2011,positive,the best romantic flim since notebook
Aug 20 2011,positive,good movie but
Aug 20 2011,positive,loved it soooo much more than i thought possible
Aug 20 2011,positive,anne hathaway is greati like her in everything she does and she made this movie much better by being in it  besides her the movie was okaykinda run of the mill  a good rainy day rental
Aug 20 2011,negative,there are some really wonderful moments in one day actually i found scene after scene of wonderful moments where i could have taken an uninterrupted nap without the interruption of good storytelling or characterinterest but im glad i didnt because then the final 20 minutes wouldnt have been so enjoyable unfortunately those last few scenes dont totally rescue this mediocre movie about a long gestating love between a boring girl and an annoying guy
Aug 20 2011,negative,its a rarity for a book to be transformed into a good film  unfortunately this is not one of those rarities  stick to the book if you do not want to be disappointed as it did not compel in any shape or form
Aug 20 2011,negative,sad bad and looooooooonnnnnngg i kept hoping the plot would liven up and it never did it just got longer and sadder not worth the box office monies to see this
Aug 20 2011,positive,i know it got negative reviews and it did drag a little but i still liked it
Aug 20 2011,negative,doesnt do much to rise above its source material and suffers from poor casting  anne hathaway is hard to buy as an unnoticed beauty
Aug 20 2011,negative,wasnt horrible but at the same time i didnt feel it either main characters lacked real chemistry annes british advent was super annoying was predictable i didnt read the book didnt make me cry and i usually do in sad movies
Aug 20 2011,positive,this is not a formula friends that should be lovers become lovers movie but that is the good news  a little slow but in retrospect the time spent is essential to develop each character    im ready for summer movies to end though
Aug 20 2011,positive,more bitter than sweet go back to definition of life nothings really perfect even our loves life
Aug 20 2011,positive,this is only watchable because of anne hathaway this is a romantic drama about two losers who get drunk and tried to hook up upon college graduation and fail only to fall asleep together and become friends instead the movie follows that date for years to come as the losers continue along with their lives the twist comes unexpectedly and then i lost all interest passing grade for hathaway
Aug 20 2011,negative,loved the book not the film
Aug 20 2011,neutral,the story is good and despite the fact that it jumps from year to year the story makes sense and flows decently well it reminds me of a typical nicholas sparks story but for some reason i and the rest of my party at the movie never felt emotionally attached enough to them to feel their sorrow and heartbreak its not a bad movie but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth at the end
Aug 20 2011,positive,a  sweet story about true love and friendship the acting was very well done great date film
Aug 20 2011,positive,ill say it now im actually pretty shocked by how decent all the chick flicks have been this summer predictable yet enjoyable not a big fan of anne hathaway in this film though shes not bad in it but during the entire movie i just couldnt help but think someone else could played her character better
Aug 20 2011,positive,though the concept of one day appears original checking in with two characters on the same day every year the film as a whole remains slightly too predictable and majorly overdramatized my first thought is that this many interesting things could not possibly happen to the same people every year on the same day anne hathaway far outacts her counterpart jim sturgess who becomes less believable as his character grows older there are some great emotional moments but overall the film tries far too hard to be the next nicolas sparks drama
Aug 19 2011,positive,this was a movie that was not horrible but not outstanding it has some humor and some interesting scenes it has a great music playing that went well with the movie the chemistry between anne hathaway and jim sturgess had some ups and downs anne hathaway puts on a pretty okay performance depending on the competition she might get an oscar nomination its a little depressing but overall not an outstanding movie but not a waste of money my grade77c
Aug 19 2011,positive,when it comes to romantic dramas im a hard guy to please not just because im a guy and the whole mushy romance thing isnt for me but because i like to be swept away into a story there needs to be an elegance to the writing and beautiful chemistry between the two main leads this film gave me both of those things it did away with the clichã cs and offered a very different very real perspective on a relationship    the film is the account of emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess who after spending the night together after their college graduation are revisited on the same date each year  july 15th  for twenty years to see where they are at in their lives emma while clever is slow to find success unlike dexter who gets great success very easily and other women as well and while trying to keep their relationship alive the two are just very different people who are gradually growing apart as their lives travel different courses its funny though how even when going in opposite directions each path finds a way to cross the other    i found both hathaway and sturgess to fit so snuggly into their roles  each giving a strong performance and then coming together to form this very believable yet subtle chemistry often played out in witty banter that made the film work i will admit that at times hathaways accent felt a bit off but no matter what her character always came off strong and sturgess sympatheticcharming bad boy character was always shining as the star of the film    there were also some very good supporting performances by rafe spall romola garai ken stott and most notably patricia clarkson    ive not read the novel but seeing as author david nicholls also penned the screenplay im sure it stayed very true the film was shot beautifully and the romance that carried it along gave it quite the emotional impact by the storys end so if youre looking for a good date night film or just looking to be carried away in a unique yet beautiful love story this is a film i recommend you see
Aug 19 2011,negative,i gave it half a star cause ive had a glass of nice wine when i saw it the audience cheered when the car hit the chick that was the best part of the movie
Aug 19 2011,positive,so much criticism online but i beg to differ this is a beautiful piece of love lost and found love wasted and regretted but also love cherished and inspired every frame drips with romance every tune flows with emotions in its simplest majesty heartwrenching and heartwarming at the same time
Aug 19 2011,negative,had high hopes when i first saw the trailer  synopsis was promising but actual movie was dry  literally a sleeper  no chemistry between them  would recommend pass to others
Aug 19 2011,positive,best movie ive seen in awhile  wish i would have had a box of tissues though very good writing and the acting was sooo good 
Aug 19 2011,neutral,not what i was expecting
Aug 19 2011,positive,the stars have chemistry but not much depth
Aug 19 2011,positive,went to see this in spite of the low ratings by critics as an unwind movie from the past week i loved it
Aug 19 2011,positive,ok so im a sucker for a good chick flick and i cried like a baby this was a good movie
Aug 19 2011,negative,unfortunately i think this film was totally predictable from the opening scene i know most romantic films are a horrible cliche but when the cliche isnt believable that is when it is painful  anne hathaway is a lovely actress and i am huge fan but felt the forced british accent didnt work  in addition there was no depth to her character  it seemed her overall obsession was her love for the main character dexter played by jim sturgess dexter is a too complicated and is completely underdeveloped to the audience especially in regards to his love for emma the movie was a huge disappointment i do not want to spoil it for the rest of you
Aug 19 2011,positive,amazing film saw it at the tower theater last night worth every penny tells a great story  for fans of 500 days of summer  its one of my top ten fav movies i will see again soon d

Aug 19 2011,positive,goooooooood life is so short
Aug 19 2011,neutral,one day is a rather bipolar film  there were large portions of it that i disliked but a few others that i highly enjoyed and found to be wonderful  starring anne hathaway the devil wears prada becoming jane and jim sturgess across the universe 21 as two best friends the film depicts one the other or both of them on one day of a year  july 15  each year from 1988 when the graduate university to present day 2011  the films story cannot successfully come through for the first half of the film with this manner of storytelliing because we arent given enough substance to make their storyfriendshiprelationship believable  as the film treads on though the characters mesh and their story comes out so it requires patience to appreciate the film  sturgesss character dex is oftentimes a petulant child and hes hard to tolerate so what hathaways emma sees in him is beyond me for much of the film until he meets a posh rich beauty romala garai  atonement amazing grace who saves him and makes him bearable  while success seems to come rather easily for dex emma has many struggles although ovver time their roles and positions change as does their friendship  i disliked much of dexs early character the style of the film felt like a gimmick and there wasnt enough development earlyon to enjoy what i was watching but towards the end as their relationship comes full circle there were some wonderful cinematic moments onscreen and i dont want to knock them  one day isnt a great film but it most definitely has its moments  and those moments shine brighter than hathaways megawatt smile
Aug 19 2011,neutral,this movie upon based on a novel is following a subject already seen in the play1978 turned movie same time next year  i dont know if its a desperate vehicle to click anne hathaway in a contending acting performance but the reality is that some elements in the writing and direction sank the movie into a mellow hard to swallow to some and soothing to others
Aug 19 2011,positive,i waited for this movie for a long time while the concept of visiting the characters on a specific date every year works better in the book and so is the character development you cant stop yourself from caring about these two and pulling for them good performances and engaging story thumbs up
Aug 19 2011,positive,very engaging but too bad about the tragic ending 
Aug 19 2011,positive,me and my friend went to see this film unexpectedly i cried
Aug 19 2011,positive,its okay for a chick flick
Aug 19 2011,negative,one day  skipit  its refreshing to see some apt plot twists in a romdramcom but the book is much more affective than this script  which even anne hathaway cant influence
Aug 19 2011,neutral,its what a nicholas sparks movie would be if it were aimed at grown women rather than teenage girls
Aug 19 2011,positive,predictable with messed up storylineother than that the acting was great and humors work really well c
Aug 19 2011,positive,i loved director lone scherfigs last film an education cant say the same about this one however the storyline is as clichã c as it gets when it comes to chick flicks and i didnt see the reason behind only showing these peoples lives on one day a year and an insignificant day at that 3 stars are given for anne hathaways acting which echoes her princess diaries days what with the geekwhobecomesprettybytakingoffherglasses
Aug 19 2011,positive,i think i liked this better than the book the book went a little slow for me in parts but the movie was continuously charming and romantic of course it didnt have everything that the book did but i enjoyed it more overall hathaway and sturgess were great
Aug 19 2011,negative,it wasnt necessarily a bad movie but it was depressing  didnt exactly leave the theatre feeling in an uplifted mood not a mustsee wait for the dvd and rent it
Aug 19 2011,positive,i thought it was a beautiful story worth watching
Aug 19 2011,positive,not the worlds greatest romance but enjoyable nonetheless nice way to spend a lazy afternoon of youre up for a romantic flick
Aug 19 2011,positive,beautifully written and delicately crafted carry a box full of tissues and be amazed
Aug 18 2011,negative,wanna know how to make a wildly uneven movie cram 23 yrs worth of two peoples lives in 108 mins  each scene is exposition whats happened to these 2 in the past year straighforward exposition dialogue  smash cut to the next year  so whats happened to these 2 in the past year straighforward exposition dialogue  repeat repeat repeat repeat 
Aug 18 2011,positive,i think i was supposed to hate this or at least mock it for being a chick flick  i cant  i loved it  i want to go see it again  with a box of kleenex this time
Aug 18 2011,negative,doesnt quite come together
Aug 18 2011,positive,not as good as i thought it would be i was not expecting the ending at all at least i have the book to read and see if i like that better
Aug 18 2011,positive,surprisingly goodand much better than the book which i hated if only the detestable hathaway hadnt been cast  her earbleedingly bad accent and general irritating presence was no match for sturgess and the rest of the cast happy surprise  romola garai
Aug 18 2011,positive,beautiful movie loved it  i mean there were some tired story lines but i loved the way it flowed how it was told the acting and especially the ending  great girls movie
Aug 18 2011,negative,save your money we ended up walking out after 30 minutes
Aug 18 2011,positive,not as good as i thought it would be but anne  jims acting was wonderful  anne really pulled off the british accent i hated the ending it took 15 years for them to get together and they were finally married and happy and she dies how depressing is that they deserved a happy ending especially with all dex had been through with his mother dying and his horrible ex wife cheating on him

Aug 18 2011,positive,jim sturgess and anne hathaway are marvelous they capture the subtleties of a relationship over the course of two decades wonderfully and our affection for them grows as their story unfolds
Aug 18 2011,negative,a dreary dismal film about two blithering buffoons from the uk and their 20year quest to find the happiness they had all along sturgess fails to find anything redeeming in his character and its only the shear grace and talent of anne hathaway who looks stunning even in harry potter eyeglasses that keeps this tragedy from sinking even further into the boneyard
Aug 18 2011,negative,pppbbbtttt  turned it off got bored
Aug 18 2011,positive,     4   jim sturgess        anne hathaway    
Aug 18 2011,positive,it was heart wrenching but i enjoyed it
Aug 18 2011,neutral,the movie turned me into jao noo jam mai à¹àà¹à²ààtmà¹àà³à¹à why why why thats the question i think the movie doesnt do the book a good justice and i havent even read the book had someone not told me the plot i wouldnt have understood a lot more only one thing left in my small head is the score and songs picked the songs well to represent each year anne is as gorgeous and charming as always and jims thin lips are so sexy hehehe

Aug 18 2011,positive,a critic called it as a modern classic and it is one day retold the love story we usually hear but present it in a whole new way i read the book before i watched the movie and let me say now i cant picture another emma other than anne hathaway shes so brilliant and so believable i even think that she outshone jim sturgess at the beginning i thought its a little bit too fastpaced but in the end lone scherfig make it great beautiful and one of my favourite from now and probably until years to come thank you david nicholls
Aug 17 2011,positive,i love everything about this film dexter  emma hathaway vs sturgess it made me smile feeling of butterfly in my stomach and also the heartache watching the film i didnt cry thought but it is very touching and remain in my thoughts  so dont miss it gals
Aug 17 2011,positive,love the story especially the ending sad but strong and beautiful very realistic in a way as well
Aug 17 2011,positive,dont listen to the critics  go see it and judge for yourself
Aug 17 2011,positive,thought it was going to be totally differentsort of depressing not the love story i was looking for
Aug 17 2011,neutral,ok not great and nothing to go out of your way for but if it happens to be on its better than whatever else youre likely find if you continue to channel surf
Aug 17 2011,positive,very good movie romance angst heart break and triumph  good watch bring napkinskleenex
Aug 17 2011,positive,a pretty faithful and decent adaptation of the superb source material it is well casted and anne hathaways accent is not that bad  the only weak point of the movie is that they played the romantic angle a little too much in the book em and dex are incredibly close friends but here there friendship is sort of underdeveloped otherwise its a great film
Aug 17 2011,positive,marvellous touching tragic wonderful storyline and acting
Aug 17 2011,positive,i found this film to be rather boring it seemed to be just a montage of scenes thrown together though it did pick up a bit toward the end
Aug 17 2011,negative,the story and the acting was good but the movie itself was slow
Aug 17 2011,positive,hurried in comparison with the book but a decent adaptation
Aug 17 2011,positive,an thoughtfully directed movie over a long span various times and dressings span across 15 years of someones life
Aug 17 2011,positive,interesting point of view about the relationship of two people with different lives but in love with each other we only watch what happen one day every year
Aug 17 2011,neutral,such a brilliant actress wasted
Aug 17 2011,positive,get past anne hathaways ropey stab at a yorkshire accent and what you get is a film which understands the devastating but also very funny heart of its source material
Aug 16 2011,positive,day 24  one day 152 days of quick movie reviews   better than the critics rated it  worse than the audience rating  the chemistry sometimes works but i was never really put off by the story  it starts getting a lot better near the end of it but too little too late
Aug 16 2011,negative,destiny and love  it took years to realize  were not meant to be
Aug 16 2011,negative,not one star uhhhh so thin on the romantics this doesnt even come close to making any kind of best list unhappy for most of their lives this is more a cautionary tale than anything else vreselijk
Aug 16 2011,positive,this was a really sad movie it has an interesting premise seeing where 2 ppl are at in a relationship on the same day every year we see the relationship rise and fall many times i havent seen jim sturgess in anything since across the universe and it was nice seeing him now you almost feel sorry for his character in the movie anne hathaway was adorable at the the beginning of the film with her timid mousy look i loved it overall a pretty good movie oh and ladies you might want to bring some tissues with you
Aug 16 2011,positive,not as good as the book but still worth watching
Aug 16 2011,neutral,anne and jims chemistry was great overall ok a lot more dramatic than i would have liked
Aug 16 2011,negative,i would not recommend this movie unless you like a kind of modern version of love story in the uk and france the end is a bit depressive as well
Aug 16 2011,positive,the editing was off pace  disruptive but overall a moving story that brought a tear to my eye  made me think about my own life

Aug 16 2011,positive,i hate unhappy ending why this things happen
Aug 15 2011,positive,anne hathaway my love 
Aug 15 2011,positive,would watch it again
Aug 15 2011,negative,devoid of any of the novels emotional weight which is an extreme disappointment given all the talent this poor adaption showcases
Aug 15 2011,neutral,good actors but an emotional connection is missing during this film there are other issues like accents coming and going or at times changing to me it seemed like something that nicholas sparks wrote and yes it ends almost like how all of his books end too
Aug 15 2011,positive,this was a really sad movie it has an interesting premise seeing where 2 people are at in a relationship on the same day every year we see the relationship rise and fall many times you almost feel sorry for jim strugess character in the movie anne hathaway also did a great job although im not sure about the british accent
Aug 15 2011,negative,quite a disappointment in its entirety the movie has a nice story but it sadly becomes overly cliched at the end as a whole the film is rather boring and it doesnt go anywhere
Aug 15 2011,positive,good romantic drama with a new idea about only focusing on july 15th  surprisingly entertaining
Aug 15 2011,positive,despite the negative reviews this is a solid movie  anne hathaway and jim sturgess make an attractive couple  the movie chronicles their relationship on each july 15 from 1988 to 2011 as they meet remeet drift apart fight and generally go about the messy job of becoming adults  the films episodic structure is its central gimmick and may be its biggest weakness  it becomes difficult to sustain any depth in the storytelling when you chronicle peoples lives with one day out of each year  now about anne hathaways accent  i did not find it distracting but if you were british i believe her origins keep shifting all over the country  overall however i found the movie to be highly enjoyable although the plot turn near the end may change your mind
Aug 15 2011,negative,this just did not live up to the high expectations i had for it  i adored the novel but it did not translate well as a movie  i am glad they kept the books ending though and i found that part satisfyingly emotional
Aug 15 2011,positive,sooo romantic and tragic better than the book
Aug 15 2011,negative,one day is one big cliched mess from the dull look to the shallow characters to the overly cliched script this film may just be the worst romantic film ever made never in my life have i dozed off during a theatrical experience but this film truly is far too boring to even keep a teenage girl interested if i hadnt been such an avid movie goer i would have walked out of this film after it hit the 20 minute mark this film is the same all the way through its repetitive 30 minutes too long and way too predictable it is easily the worst film so far this year and i will easily forget it after a good night sleep i just wasted 107 minutes of my life and i will never get it back
Aug 15 2011,positive,a really great romantic movie that has all the right pieces that simply just didnt get its deservedly theater showing in movie theaters cause its a great flick that doesnt end how you truly want it to end but still is sufficient for those who wear their heart on their sleeves
Aug 15 2011,neutral,biggest disappointment ever i didnt expect much from hathaway however i wanted this movie to make me fall in love with jim sturgess all over again i was looking forward to this for a long time unforunately sturgess character wasnt likable until the end of the movie and hathaway was just homely and frustrating due to the structuring of the story as displayed over about a 20 year period showcasing events of each years july 15th we didnt really get to develop a good grip on each character the blossoming of the love story was just so back and forth that by the time it happened i was thankful because the movie would end soon
Aug 15 2011,positive,i really liked it  1st off i have not read the book so i cant say anything about the adaption from book to film i thought anne hathaway did a great job and her accent didnt bug me at all she was british in becoming jane  i loved her in that and jim sturgess was fantastic he did steal the show storyline was great and i could tellfeel the relationshipchemistry between anne  jim it was a great movie bring some tissues
Aug 15 2011,neutral,why did the trailer appear to be so interesting
Aug 15 2011,negative,dintt work for me inspite of hathway
Aug 15 2011,positive,i cry a loooooooooooooooot love it
Aug 15 2011,positive,we should hold each other tightly dont let go no matter what you dont know what gonna happen next
Aug 15 2011,positive,this was one damn fine movie my first thoughts about one day involved a lot of drama and crying but it turns out that this movie is bloody brilliant bloody damn brilliant     the plotline is quite usual yet the story is told in a really different way it started in the present and then rewinded to the past of the two main characters emma and dexter two good friends who have been in love since forever lets say since 1988 but havent realized it untill 2004 ore something like that hes a problematic man lived up for his job as a tv host and took fame way too far  had problems with alcohol and drugs and everything else that comes with 5 minutes of fame oh and he also fucks everything that moves just a spoiled rich little brat     she on the other hand is an ambitious girl who dreams of becoming a writer and has also a lot of trouble on the way  a lame job to pay her bills a sticky comediant boyfriend and also the fact that shes dexters shoulder to cry on life isnt easy for any of them yet they keep meeting over the years ignoring their feelings for each other  up to a certain point where they finally realize it but the story isnt at all a fairy tale  indeed the ending is quite tragic and im not going to tell you what happens obviously yet the dialogues are quite funny talk about british sarcasm huh    this movie was supported by a bunch of good actors and an amazing soundtrack staring with the acting i absolutely loved hathaways emma accent  beautifully done also jim sturgess had had quite a role of himself and i suppose this is the first movie i ever saw with him about the soundtrack it was awesome featuring tracks by elvis costello james and ronan keating among others it was a perfect fit for the movie in question    the ending was beautiful and quite touching since after the tragedy one must move on and enjoy the ride also the last flashback to 1988 was indeed awesome to complete the story and avoid leaving the tragedy on the open     over all one day is a movie definitely with a lot to it and youll leave the theater with a smile on your face
Aug 15 2011,negative,i am so bored with so called romances like this one in which both characters obviously care more about themselves than each other and yet the hollywood machine wants us to believe this is real loveand it romantic what strong women will spend her life trying to obtain happiness but also be self damgaing enough to wait around for one man who is an admitted womanizer only in the movies i think its sad that these un commited abusive relationships are all that hollywood chooses to portray just because the characters are good looking doesnt make the movies they pick any better anne hathaway deserves better roles
Aug 14 2011,neutral,the story line was fairly gimmicky following the relationship of 2 people on the same day through different years not terrible emotional driving drama  rent this one with your lady and youll score some aw isnt that cute points
Aug 13 2011,negative,this was grueling to sit through i really felt nothing for the characters even though i like both actors anne hathaway needs to stop making these movies
Aug 13 2011,neutral,one of the saddest movies ive ever seen
Aug 13 2011,negative,tried watching this 2 times and never could finish itjust plane boring
Aug 12 2011,positive,not great but not bad
Aug 12 2011,negative,bait and switch  beware an independent  foreign film starring a likable young american actress that previews as a romantic comedy  this is not a comedy  i walked out depressed disappointed and wondering what anne hathaways dialect coach got paid for the lamest scots accent ive ever heard
Aug 12 2011,positive,i was expecting a bit more chemistry but i got it more from jim sturgess than anne hathway she was however very good near the end at expressing her suffering
Aug 12 2011,positive,absolutely charming one of the more realistic and genuine love stories in recent years hathaway breaks your heart characters have great depth and the screenplay does a wonderful job at illustrating the many ups and downs of a relationship  the poor timing the vulnerable moments the magical memories the jealousy poor choices et al a delightful surprise
Aug 11 2011,positive,my heart has a bit of a soft spot for this book and yes the movie is flawed if anything it made me remember how much i loved the book   perhaps anne hathaway isnt quite plain jane or british  enough to be the perfect emma  id have love to have seen carey mulligan given a try and jim strurgess isnt quite charismatic to be the perfect dex but what they do have is chemistry  the film lacks character development and there are a lot of plot holes left unfilled here that could have been expanded upon  it is a rare case that i wish the movie had been thirty minutes lion her to connect some of the dots  i was expecting the worst but i wasnt disappointed it could have been a better movie but it gave me e chance to live these characters again
Aug 11 2011,positive,i wasnt really sure what to expect with one day i hadnt heard much about it and what i did hear wasnt that good overall i thought one day was average it wasnt overly exciting but it wasnt horrible or completely dull either i found anne and jims characters to be interesting and enjoyed their acting as well i found one day to be pretty typical for a dramaromance movie i wouldnt catogorize this flick as a comedy at all the storyline of one day has its ups and downs as does the movie as a whole
Aug 11 2011,positive,was not what i expected  but is a really good story 
Aug 11 2011,positive,good film had a lot of twists
Aug 10 2011,positive,omgosh  david nicholls is as bad as nicholas sparks  bring your tissues and plan on leaving the theater in a state of depression
Aug 10 2011,positive,on en sort pas indemne
Aug 9 2011,positive,love love loved this movie 3
Aug 9 2011,positive,she made you decent and in return you made her so happythe story of emma  dexter meeting at the same date every year in their lives
Aug 9 2011,neutral,the movie failed where it should have soared a romantic love story told over a life time that seemed more broken and convoluted than it should have been it was too bad because the actors had great chemistry
Aug 9 2011,positive,smile a bit sad and already keep it in my fav movie
Aug 8 2011,positive,pretty good actually
Aug 8 2011,positive,despite my occasional disgust with the book i would like to see the movie  movie was not great not horrible stayed true to the novel but it is harder to connect to the characters in the movie format  if you hadnt read the book i dont think you would care what happened to them
Aug 8 2011,positive,i kind of loved it in a way i was expecting more of a romantic story but the way it was was really great too and more unexpected so i like it the ending really sucked though it sucked even more when a friend of mine started laughing when the other one burst to tears but anyway thats life 
Aug 7 2011,negative,anne was a serious casting mistake  whats up with the phony accent  is she from england or ireland  im not sure she knew also i did not care about her character at all  thats bad  the other actors had more depth but she was the lead  even the little girl was good  if you think this movie is good for a date think again
Aug 7 2011,positive,a beautiful movie and amazing music
Aug 7 2011,positive,overrated and disappointing  and yes  anne hathaways accent is all wrong
Aug 7 2011,positive,all i can say is i cried for a moment i thought this was a nick sparks joint considering tragedies are his thing but it was a great film absolute tear jerker
Aug 6 2011,negative,the book was wonderful the movie hasnt managed to carry the feeling the atmosphere and the characters of the novel but it was not bad for 12 hours at the cinema
Aug 6 2011,negative,this movie is a shining example of the type of girl movie that makes me want to gouge my eyes out
Aug 4 2011,positive,great film hathaways acting superb as always just dont forget the box of tissues
Aug 4 2011,positive,funny  charming  cute  anne hathaway  jim sturgess  a nice mixture however the way one day was told made it less effective in telling its story pretty much the only down point of the movie
Aug 4 2011,positive,it has depth  its not just a rom com additionally its not overdone too bad its boring i did however like the pairing of the main characters
Aug 4 2011,positive,this is probably an unfair score as it really is a lovely movie yeah annes accent is a bit off at times but its really not that noticable and of course it cant possibly delve into the characters like the book did however it was fun and touching and sweet nice night at the movies    i just didnt ball my eyes out and i did in the book so the score may be a little unfair for that reason if you hadnt read the book and i did quite recently then it probably would have been heaps sad     then again maybe the book just drained it out of me as i was a mess during the end of it
Aug 3 2011,positive,definitely a chick flick
Aug 3 2011,positive,3 starts for the attention to detail  the film makers definitely read the book but i did not see anne or jim as emma  dexter very disappointed  rather read the book
Aug 3 2011,neutral,i was expecting a lot more
Aug 3 2011,positive,anne hathaway was great in this movie she brought hope and a little comedy to the big screen aside from her it could have been better directed and the director could have tried to bring more emotion into the movie  the movie failed to capture the tragic dramatic events and it didnt it to the audience  i would recommend this movie because it is different from any other sort of romantic comedies  this movie only gives you the events of one day for 20 years
Aug 2 2011,positive,good moviebut pales in comparison to the book  loved the book
Aug 2 2011,positive,shame really that this film just wasnt as good as the book i dont think the narrative format worked within a film context
Aug 2 2011,positive,very sweet and sad movie love both of these actors it was slowgoing at times
Aug 1 2011,positive,enjoyable movie  had its humorous moments and its sad moments  anne hathaway and jim sturgess had good onscreen chemistry  goes through all of the trials and tribulations of life frienship and love  worth seeing on video if nothing else
Aug 1 2011,positive,i liked it but naturally the book was better
Aug 1 2011,negative,too depressing and slow
Aug 1 2011,positive,the critics are crazy go see this movie loved it
Jul 31 2011,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a while seriously
Jul 30 2011,negative,slow boring lame ending
Jul 30 2011,positive,a romantic movie with an unexpected twist be prepared with some tissue though
Jul 30 2011,positive,great movie i thought the acting was great
Jul 27 2011,neutral,i liked this film but i wanted to love it and i didnt 0 its a bit long and a bit slow however i think still worth a watch if youve got time
Jul 26 2011,neutral,long and depressing with moments of deeper depression
Jul 25 2011,positive,critics were way cruel to this film it is way better than 26 currently on rt that is ridiculous the film is definitely enjoyable but couldve used more character development in the beginning to make the story flow better see it and judge for yourself
Jul 25 2011,positive,a beautiful  mystifying film that spans over the course of 20 years on july 15 st swethins day of two friends whose relationship grows complex
Jul 24 2011,positive,some parts were a little slow but overall this was a very emotional love story nicely done
Jul 24 2011,negative,highly uninteresting and disappointing
Jul 24 2011,positive,beautiful  i tot somethings gonna happen to d boy bt it turned out to b nt
Jul 23 2011,positive,i was aware he film was slated before watching it but it wasnt that bad i wasnt totally impressed with jim sturgess as dexter the first hour of the film did go slow but for a 20 minute period it picked up for the concluding part which gripped you only to drag on a little bit more during the end i have seen far worst romantic movies so not as bad as everyone makes out in my eyes
Jul 23 2011,positive,the book is much more detailed and the film  briefly retold the contents of the book  but movie is sad despite the fact    20 years between two people friends which never love each other at the same time but fate always intervenes  fingers 
Jul 23 2011,positive,great movie the ending was unexpected yet expected annes accent bothered me in the beginning but i got used to it jim sturgess was great
Jul 22 2011,neutral,i really wanted to love this movie i really did but i couldnt the narrative fell flat jumpy and incoherent scherfig failed to find the rhythm of the movie for almost  the entire duration and when she found it it was too late hathaway and sturgess seems to struggle to delivered their best but there was nothing they could do since the structure and the story of the movie was not well made such a shame
Jul 19 2011,neutral,a good one time watchdifferent story and great acting by anne hathaway and jim sturgess

Jul 18 2011,neutral,25 stars  solely from the last 20 mins
Jul 17 2011,negative,i heard the book was good so to adapt it into film sounds like a good idea but although sweet the result was a disastrous movie  starting with anne hathaways fake accent
Jul 16 2011,negative,really very city of angels

Jul 15 2011,positive,yea this is a bit romantic ummmmm
Jul 15 2011,positive,it was romantic in some scenes but i felt disappointed about the guy because he did lots of things that were inappropriately but then everything changed with his life i felt sad that anne hathaway past away in the movie and it was a bad accident 
Jul 14 2011,positive,with good leading performances from anne hatheway and jim sturgess one day is a modest and impressive story sided romcom that with its chemestry between the two leading cast it may work and go on with the story with us actually focusing with the story and some flaws but this is the years gentler and fair romcom b
Jul 14 2011,positive,1if i cant talk to you then what is the point of you of us   2i love you dex so much i just dont like you anymore im sorry   plot after spending the night together on the night of their college graduation dexter and em are shown each year on the same date to see where they are in their lives they are sometimes together sometimes not on that day  grade 810   comment beautiful movie gotta say it breaks out from the old patterns i couldnt imagine what would happen next and well i gotta say i was quiet for a long time after the movie not going to see it again however maybe in a few years great acting from princess mia 
Jul 13 2011,positive,i liked it but mainly because i love the book its a bit empty when yo dont know whats behind the story they tell in the movie it lacks a bit of the sentiment you find in the characters minds i know thats very hard to translate into a book but it could have been better
Jul 13 2011,positive,one of the most romantic movie ever
Jul 12 2011,positive,even though the film isnt quite greater than the sum of its parts the story does work on an emotional level  is a excellent watch nevertheless moral of the story is how sometimes people have to fall apart to realize how much they mean to each other
Jul 12 2011,positive,i went to see this with my mum and sister as they have read the book  i was expecting anne hathaway to be useless im not gonna lie when you watch princess diaries youll understand my point of view and then i found out she was playing catwoman in the new batman film     honestly  i thought she was excellent maybe her accent wandered off a bit at first but not once did she sound as annoying as usual  jim sturgess acting was great and moving at the end which actually made me cry
Jul 11 2011,neutral,that was pretty cute redundant but cute
Jul 11 2011,positive,a better adaptation than i expected considering some of the reviews it definitely didnt do justice to the book but it have some great moments and i enjoyed the way in which the ending was actually made slightly less depressing in my opinion i just felt that the true essence of the two main characters was not 100 captured particularly from anne hathaways emma and that chemistry was sometimes slightly missing between them i imagine the pace could be quite slow and meandering for someone who hasnt read the book but i was kept entertained throughout and i really liked rafe spall as ian a mixed bag that makes me want to go back to the brilliant source material
Jul 10 2011,neutral,not nearly as good as expected and i really like anne hathaway just not here
Jul 10 2011,negative,argh why does every novel have to be turned into a film and with ann hathaway and the lame guy from that beatles movie really
Jul 9 2011,positive,two reasons  1 anne hathaway  2 it reminds me of same time next year
Jul 9 2011,positive,when do you admit your feelings  for these two it takes them over a decade to admit to how they feel about themselves and each other  a unique concept that is well acted by both jim sturgess and anne hathaway  and while this movie is not exactly what the previews make it out to be life isnt always what we make it out to be eitherand maybe that is this movies truest lesson
Jul 9 2011,positive,loved it great story brilliant acting
Jul 8 2011,positive,loved the cast  loved the way that the characters cling to eachother through out the 20 years and how they grow and change as the years go by but there love is as fresh as it was when they first met as if time had not changed at all the ending especially was very good  if it had ended all happily ever after then i would have been disappointed 
Jul 7 2011,neutral,oh my gosh the story was sooooo goooood i was with it every step of the way until she rode that bike
Jul 6 2011,positive,read the book and cried my heart out its going to be the same when i watch the movie ughhh this needs to come out already gotta watch it em  dex dex  em 
Jul 6 2011,positive,i loved the concept of this film and enjoyed watching the years progress with the characters i havent read the book so i dont know how to compare it but i liked the story
Jul 5 2011,positive,how people fall in love however long it takes its beautiful this movie makes me miss my hubby though 3
Jul 5 2011,positive,a beautiful and romantic story but make me really sad at the end
Jul 5 2011,negative,a very contrived and quite annoying attempt at a romantic drama the premise sounded interesting but it ended up getting bogged down in acting flaws and a horribly cluttered way of telling the story
Jul 5 2011,positive,sadness and loss are my two favorite things in stories like this the film is as good as the novel anne hathaway and jim sturgess brought dex and em in life beyond my expectations their performances are outstanding they both portrayed the characters exemplary except for annes brit accent though but still too bad the director didnt include the letter dexter never gave to emma that was mentioned in the book i think its very essential for establishing that they both really felt the same way since they met because dexter said it all in the letter for those who havent read the novel tough luck on you with my same perceptions on the novel its a i dont like it nor i hate it kind of thing what really got me hooked in the story are the emotions emanating from it and the story really happens in real life
Jul 3 2011,positive,sad movie but overall it was good
Jul 3 2011,positive,a little shocked at the ending not what i was expecting at all
Jul 2 2011,positive,well i cant say i had high hopes for this movie mainly because of the poor ratings and reviews i havent read the book so lucky for me i didnt have anything to compare it to   but apart from it being a bit bleak and me disliking dexter mayhew as a character its an okay romantic drama with hathaway even bringing some light comedy to it  for the faults of the movie where it may have been directed better and more emotion put into the movie as there was potential for it to be tragic cryfest romantic drama but it failed to capture that emotion and pass it across to the audience that all said i think hathaway should get plus points for her acting she was funny and gorgeous as ever and did a remarkably believable and good english accent that so many other american actors fail to accomplish  it is my type of romantic movie because its not all lovey dovey with the two main characters hopelessly in love and nothing bad happens and they live happily ever after which is just unrealistic this movie is more honest and although i didnt think mayhew deserved emma its still a sweet enough romantic drama not the best but certainly not the worst i would say its worth a watch even if it is only the once
Jul 2 2011,positive,not what i was expecting but still well acted a good tale however unbelievable at times
Jul 1 2011,neutral,the book is so good so this was going to be a let down no matter what my big issue was pacing
Jun 30 2011,positive,anne as usual was stunning lovely fake british accent but finally lovely  how many of us have loved someone and had to keep it hidden
Jun 29 2011,neutral,i can only imagine that the book that this film was based on was exceptional because the screen version certainly wasnt a disjointed film of cliches with characters that i had no interest in at all until the end which just so happened to be the only part of the film that drew me in not even in the same universe as movies like the notebook or if only
Jun 28 2011,positive,the concept for this romance was to capture the relationship between a man and woman on the same day over several years the concept was a novel idea but one better served for the novel from which it was adapted the director could not devote enough time to the details to provide continuity from year to year instead more focus was placed on certain years in an effort to accentuate the emotions each character felt a strength of the film is its appeal to a variety of audiences because everyone will relate to different moments since the characters are crossing several stages of their life i was fascinated at how accurately the film captured a personâtms natural metamorphosis through lifeâtms priorities of career love and family hathaway delivered a performance on par for her career and sturgess continued to show the talent deserving of a career ready to break out into stardom
Jun 27 2011,negative,ugh this movie i wanted it to be so much better because i waited forever to see it the last 30 minutes or so well okay and the rest was so boring and ugh
Jun 27 2011,positive,the ending was not what i expected little slow in parts but gave me a good cry
Jun 26 2011,positive,this movie was good but i think i need to go back and read the book but it was fun to see the relationship change over the years and listen to the music of each year    but if something didnt happen on 715 each year you didnt get to see it    what i didnt like was anne hathaways british accent
Jun 26 2011,negative,so boring and slow  the two leads had absolutely no chemistry with each other  ended like youd expect to  save your money
Jun 26 2011,negative,on july 15th emma and dex met for the last first time  for almost twenty years through all their ups and downs they have remained good friends  the last couple they are more  then one july 15th something horrible happens to destroy both of them  this movie explores all the july 15ths in their lives together  sometimes very little happens  some are bigger than others  then at the end of the film a happy ending is tacked on to make it all seem like a worthwhile venture  mostly though it is painful and not romantic
Jun 25 2011,positive,love it reminded me of how cruel life can be
Jun 25 2011,positive,anne hathaway was really good i read the book and the story was how i remembered it except for one scene that i thought was kinda important anyway i loved it 
Jun 23 2011,positive,this movie isnt at all what i was expecting but it was surprisingly good the ending is extremely sad but it feels more genuine than the usual happily ever after endings found in most romantic dramas
Jun 23 2011,negative,it was a nice movie but not as mystifying and romantic as the book was many parts strayed from the novel and the chemistry wasnt completely there
Jun 22 2011,neutral,i really wanted to like one day despite all i had heard about it it had two credible charismatic lead actors and a different way to take on the same old love story i am not afraid to admit i can dig a good romantic film and the concept for this one sounded intriguing to take a couple that met on their college graduation day and meet up with them again on that same day through two decades and watch the development of their relationship is not only an innovative way to show the progression of emotions but an interesting way to bring us a story of the most common emotion in the world that has always been experienced since the dawning of man the first of many problems this film faces though is anne hathaways accent that goes in and out through the movies nearly two hour run time also a problem as despite it getting more complicated and interesting as the years go by some parts are just simply boring another reason to expect more from this is the fact director lone scherfigs last effort was the critical darling an education that essentially launched carrie mulligans career while one day certainly has the ambition of being something more than a nicholas sparks adaptation its actually based on what ive heard is an equally boring book by david nicholls and does feature a couple of noteworthy moments it is not all it could have been and certainly isnt the innovation to the love story the genre needed
Jun 22 2011,positive,hmmmmmost people seems not giving one day in good rating but i love it so much just brightening up my day and heart by the simply romance
Jun 21 2011,positive,an absolute touching and emotion filled movie a true romance story for the ages and generations to come
Jun 20 2011,positive,heart warming and cute this movie is great between girl friends finely done with good acting and a cute story line its mist definitely romantic with a surprise twist at the end it makes you think but its a bit nonchalant by that i mean that you cant really be excited to see the end its not a thrilling movie but it still deserves to be watch
Jun 20 2011,positive,loved every bit of it
Jun 19 2011,negative,first  we had a lot of good movies out this summer then we had the worst movie of the summer 30 minutes or less and now i finally know that the worst movie of the summer so far is one day
Jun 18 2011,negative,for a movie w so much potential something went horribly wrong
Jun 18 2011,positive,loved the progression of the story  jim sturgess
Jun 17 2011,negative,terrible film that barely had much of a plot they need to stop making these type of films long distance long drawn out love  affairs dont work well in a two hour film
Jun 15 2011,positive,the story of this film is lovely albeit tragic emma and dex must have one of the worst timings in film coupling history its a beautiful story but i can see that its unique storytelling style is much better suited in novel form or less confusing at the very least
Jun 15 2011,negative,the plot was nice but then it was dragging until of course emma died
Jun 14 2011,positive,now im a sucker for romantic movies and had expectations from this movie the moment i saw the trailer despite the bad reviews i found this movie to be likable the first hour is definitely slow and lacks almost all the possible elements of a romantic movie but its the second half is fantastic its high on emotion the characters seem to come alive anne hathaway is a revelation and her performance just justifies why she is one of my favorite actresses in todays day and age
Jun 14 2011,positive,i have to say i almost cry in this movie sometimes is very confusing because the ellipsis are very fast definitely love anne hathaway
Jun 14 2011,positive,not particulary good but also not as awful as some critics say basically the story is not great per se and at some point very dumb but so is the book too but if you look a little closer you see lovely characters and some witty dialogues a movie that is at its best very entertaining corny as it sounds these two people were meant to be together  they just met at the wrong time but the times comes when both are gonna be ready but as love stories want it it all comes with a tragedy   i loved the character of dexter who was at some moments in this film incredibly complex and deeply interesting  a young clever man with ambitions but whose life goes a terribly wrong way until he manages to get back on the road he does provide the films only spot of unloosed raw emotions  the structural conceit proves more reductive than expansive the big picture too overdetermined to really sweep the viewer away  the chemistry between hathaway and sturgess is bad sadly but it didnt fail completely at making me care for the couple  especially when it comes to dexter it is a watchable film but not very gripping  tho you care for the characters at some point the distance between the audience and them is too large the character of emma is not portrayed very bad but i rarely had a connection to her it felt like she was drifting away constantly  well i shed my tears in the end but not because of emma and dexter  only because of dexter whom i couldnt watch suffer it broke my heart instantly and i litterally cried wishing i wasnt wearing any make up   the movie is not great  but thinking of many critics who praise love story i dont see why they put this film down i personally dont think love story is a good film and i am pretty sure most people only praise it because it is a classic  if that movie would be shot these days it would get awful reviews  so anyway  dont listen too much what others say if you like this genre you will like this film and even if youre not so into it like me it is still not bad but you know what youre getting yourself into with this film  kitsch and tears
Jun 14 2011,positive,i find it really truly awful that this movie is getting flack for something as simple as anne hathaway isnt a real brit piss off will you robert pattinson still cant pull an american accent properly and he gets rave reviews for some of his movies i read the book and it was a lovely enough adaptation i mean it kept everything truly important to the essence of the book and the book is just genius to be honest the movie is beautiful heartbreaking and the most honest piece of work i have ever read or seen my grandmother is still getting over it she is in shock but she loved it as much as i did i found myself weeping a day or two over the whole thing it is a true love story it is refreshing honest no bullshit here bring tissues prepare for a reality check anne hathaway and jim sturgess are flawless as they always are they have a real chemistry and this movie should be doing a hell of a lot better than it is i am disappointed with the reviews because they are utter bullshit see this movie
Jun 14 2011,positive,such an amazing film so romantic and sweet
Jun 14 2011,positive,i will make an exception for this lovestory
Jun 14 2011,positive,not the best film in the world but for a romantic movie it does the job if you like hathaway or sturgess you cant go wrong
Jun 13 2011,negative,i never read the book but it sounded like a nice concept holy crap there are so many things wrong it portrays love as someone you screw fall for every other year then get together with after 17 years it was the same every year there was no 2002 2008 or 2010 1997 was just anne hathaway swimming for ten seconds like many movies nowadays it was way too long i didnt care about any of the characters and hated most of them 3710 f etc
Jun 10 2011,negative,unfortunately i think this film was totally predictable from the opening scene i know most romantic films are a horrible cliche but when the cliche isnt believable that is when it is painful  anne hathaway is a lovely actress and i am huge fan but felt the forced british accent didnt work  in addition there was no depth to her character  it seemed her overall obsession was her love for the main character dexter played by jim sturgess dexter is a too complicated and is completely underdeveloped to the audience especially in regards to his love for emma the movie was a huge disappointment i do not want to spoil it for the rest of you
Jun 9 2011,positive,i never met a girl like emma morley during my time at univ of edinburgh lol usually i hate tragic stories but being so generous as always i have given 3 big stars to this move because i liked the starting part of the movie in edinburrraaaahhhhh d
Jun 9 2011,positive,very touching and emotional film  good chemistry between emma and dexter shame about the accent from hathaway a good watch but take some tissues
Jun 8 2011,positive,creative idea for a movie great chemistry between anne hathaway and jim sturgess
Jun 7 2011,neutral,disjointed and painstakingly slow throughout some scenes  but in the end the story itself is beautiful and joyful and sad and slow and funny and dramaticits drama with a splash of comedy  25 stars
Jun 7 2011,positive,so sad  but a very good story of how if its meant to be itll work out in the end
Jun 6 2011,negative,to be honest i was a little disappointed i would definitely recommended the book not so much the movie
Jun 6 2011,positive,a i wanna see this
Jun 5 2011,positive,totally cheesy and just a plain old love story but i liked it all right
Jun 5 2011,negative,the movie was alrightcant say i loved iti like the characters but wasnt keen on anne hathawaynot sure whyjust wasnt feeling her in this role  jim sturgess seem to fit the role better    it is a lovely story and i did need to bring out my tissues you have been warned
Jun 5 2011,negative,horrible horrible horrible i wish i would have followed the many people i saw walking out of this movie i really dislike when they trick us into paying 20 to watch these tragic movies which they make look sweet and pretty in the previews save your money for some other movie thats actually good
Jun 3 2011,positive,a difficult novel to adapt revealing a relationship over the span of 25 years with not a single use of cheesy montages anne hathaway is charming as emma morley but it is rafe spall that steals the show in his portrayal of ian taking dorky to an awesome new level     shot on 35mm one day is nostalgic in every sense but im still a sucker for the original mike nichols novel
Jun 2 2011,positive,its a lovely love story its slow at times but not too cheesy just the ending was too melodramatic for me and since the is an essential part of the movie i cant be too generous with my rating nevertheless its worth watching just for anne hathaway
Jun 2 2011,negative,even though i cried at the end its still a pretty dull film  maybe with a better casthathaway is dreadful with the worst attempt at an english accent ive heard for some time and sturgess just came across as annoying  i havent read the book but its totally predictable with nothing new or standout brilliant about it
Jun 1 2011,positive,very sweet chick flick that is a love story that spans 3 decadeshave kleenex nearbytearjerker in an old fashioned waysteals a little from at least a half dozen other movies but hehstill enjoyable
Jun 1 2011,positive,one of those weepy films that focus on two lifelong friends with a deep connection with each other that keep on missing on the opportunity to connect for something more once a year on the same date for one reason or another that culminates in one of those prototypical nicholas sparks weepy almost endings only to come around to when they first met to remind you the journey they have been on as well as yours with them definitely the cliche tropes of the genre are at play here but the filmmakers wisely put two strong actors together in sturgess and hathaway that you actually care a bit for the players and what they go through and really hope that things do indeed work out despite the challenges of the story not gamechanging but enjoyable for what it is and nice for a sunday afternoon on the w channel if nothing else happens to be on and good counter programming for hathway here since her next two projects were pretty heavy for the dark knight rises and les miz
Jun 1 2011,positive,she made you decent and in return you made her so happy so happy and i will always be grateful to you for that  really love what ian said to dexter its so to the point i am touched
May 31 2011,positive,one day is a romantic timeline between two friends that always have the odds against their relationship the film begins a little slow and careless but the interest and depth pick up with its unexpected plot twists acting from both leads is somewhat average but the characters will grow on you as their lives unfold and intertwine
May 31 2011,positive,well cast moved quickly through scenes and years and as i had enjoyed the book so much i would have liked to have seen more emmas character did not come across as strong as feisty as the book which is a shame but really enjoyed this film
May 31 2011,positive,oh my godtotally recommended
May 31 2011,negative,its ok i dont think i would watch it again im glad i rented this for a 1 and didnt buy iti was tempted to just buy it cause i do that with some movies
May 30 2011,positive,absolutely loved the film and just as good as the book such a moving and thought provoking story genuine something everyone can relate too
May 30 2011,positive,amazingfull of emotionsssss
May 29 2011,positive,the movie was like  city of angels if only and another romantic movie that i saw before jim strugress was a hunk anne didnt sound too british in some of the scenes overall the movie was a bit dragging and anticlimactic it was still a romantic flick that id love to watch again
May 29 2011,positive,two people one friendship lovely entertaining touching strong characters how romance film should be made today
May 28 2011,positive,twenty years two people    lovely film i enjoyed it alot i thought the story was very touching and moving really outdid itself very good directing and editing and great cinematography if you are a hopeless romantic you will love this film    emma and dexter meet on the night of their university graduation we see them every year on the anniversary of that date  july 15th emma is smart but success doesnt come quickly for her whereas for dexter success and women come very easily through the years they grow apart as their lives take different directions and they meet other people but as they grow apart from those other people and their lives start taking opposite directions again emma and dexter find that they belong with each other
May 28 2011,positive,why do you have an ending like that why i have to agree with this article      you dont have to do it its beautiful as it iswhat confused things more is that sorta alternate universe or flashback in the end for what to compensate the dumb ending     reigning my emotions aside i really think they looked so good and i was crying a lot at the struggles that they have gone through as individuals and as individuals related to each other that should be enough so darn the attempt to make a different ending i hate because of that  minus one star    ok angry now
May 28 2011,positive,i read the book first loved itso i was excited to see the movie but as expected the movie left a lot out of the story as a whole it felt rushed like they were just cramming it in to make it under 2 hours and left some guts of the story out but over all i still enjoyed it jim sturgess was spot on as dexter but anne hathaways british accent was bloody horrid ha
May 27 2011,neutral, its a movie about what could happen in the real life
May 26 2011,negative,i couldnt get into the book and i definitely couldnt get into the film i loved hathaway as jane austen in becoming jane but her accent was going in and out too much in this film and it ruined her character for me the two leads work well together but one day is too full of onetomany sentimental elements versus focusing more on the journey of the characters
May 26 2011,neutral,ok for what it is but it is no different from many other stories weve seen on screens small and big    hathaway was ok to watch  didnt seem much of a transformation except superficial physical looks from 1988 to later years  sturgess is cute to look at and his character is meatier compared to hathaways      the surprise in the movie came as no surprise really  but its comforting to see the reckless youth finally coming into terms with himself
May 25 2011,positive,interesting way of telling a everlasting love story which is sad and makes you even kind of cry a bit towards the end 
May 25 2011,positive,as a fan of the book this adaptation was a disappointment in these ways firstly it almost seems like the mind behind the novel who is also the man in charge of the screenplay david nicholls decided to redo his novel picking from what he liked or making small changes to what he thought audiences would have liked to see on the big screen if it aint broke dont fix it secondly completely ignoring and breezing past some years when the movie is about two decades of two peoples relationship with each year being instrumental defeats the purpose of the concept thirdly anne hathaways accent switched back and forth between being posh and being a small town girl i like the actress and thought she played the role of emma well but her accent was a distraction i had high hopes for it when i found out one days director was lone scherfig who did an education and squealed when i saw rachel portman who did the score for a favourite movie of mine never let me go in the opening credits but it staggers with each passing year even with its strong start the limitations of translating a book to screen is understandable and while i did not think one day was as atrocious as reviewers thought it was a more focused outcome could have been achieved and would have been appreciated
May 25 2011,negative,a disappointing adaptation that doesnt do the book justice watchable but not convincing and heartfelt enough to be a great tearjerker upside beautifully shot rather funny and sweet at times perhaps youll like it more if you havent read the book beforehand
May 24 2011,negative,the story of one significant day in the lives of two friends over many years is told in such quick flashes that anything resembling emotional attachment to its characters dissipates with the fog of these lazy transitions these two numbskulls meet at their college graduation and proceed to remain friends for a significant number of years looking at the same day every day for twenty years the film tries to delve into the neurosis of the two and show that they are meant to be together neither of these characters is very likable interesting or entertaining because both of them are selfish both are juvenile in the way they show their emotions and both never seem to learn from their various mistakes emma hathaway ruins her life falls for the wrong man and settles and loses any respect for her former friend in confluence dexter sturgess sells out becomes a drug addict and loses any selfrespect some things change over the years but really its about long term change over a period of time these drawn out storylines last years and years and dont entertain mostly because their sorrows revolve around their own morbid senses of selfworth over the years they may grow closer together but theres no buildup to their inevitable relationship its one scene that only shows how shallow and beaten down emma is to finally fall for dexters shtick the rest of the movie results in a bunch of jumbled halfthought out ideas that result in a lackluster ending theres just no heart to this film no chemistry between the two leads and no decent ending to tie it together just false sentimentalities to make up for a film that steers nowhere anyone would agree theres really nothing to love in this love story
May 24 2011,positive,beautiful romantic story but so sad
May 24 2011,positive,depressing end confused me kinda long
May 24 2011,positive,i adored this a classic of the romance genre
May 23 2011,neutral,the biggest flaw in the film is sturgess i normally like him but he doesnt work here his character is so unlikeable that you dont care if he ends up with hathaway or not also trying to make him look olderyounger doesnt work either he looks like a kid still when he is suppose to 40 the films only goal is to try and tug at your heart strings and its hard to do that when you dont care about the characters
May 23 2011,positive,the story is told in a very episodic manner but lone scherfig crafts it well and the film is well edited to keep it feeling as one it feels exciting and unexpected even though you know really it never is this film has its share of issues but its a well made romantic film which is hard to say for many i say rent it
May 23 2011,negative,boring  translates really really poorly considering the how great and original the source material is
May 23 2011,positive,terribly sad i liked it much better than the book actually that never happens
May 23 2011,negative,you know a movie is bad when it stars anne hathaway and i still cant make myself finish watching it
May 23 2011,positive,this one had so much potential that it didnt live up to hathaway and sturgess are great actors but they couldnt save the predictable story that seemed like it was trying way too hard it was good and emotional from time to time but overall lacked enough to make it great
May 22 2011,positive,this was really good but really sad the cast was perfect and the plot was good however it was really sad i mean it messed up for a little while
May 21 2011,positive,even though there are moments of appeals and nice performances from its pair its a film only for romantics and whoever read the book anyone outside may lose interest while watching b    full review coming soon
May 21 2011,positive,heartbreaking left me in tears 
May 21 2011,negative,book was much better
May 20 2011,negative,stilted and downright dull in far too many places with dodgy accents and even dodgier writing
May 20 2011,positive,despite the fact i was enjoying and crying during the movie the book is way much sadder and better
May 18 2011,positive,loved it fans of the book wont be disappointed great acting  just ignore the wavering accent it really isnt a big deal
May 18 2011,positive,kudos to anne and her british accent many more to jim and how extremely cute he is very tragic romeo and juliet story but i liked that it was actually kind of real not an epic titanic story but modern and realistic
May 17 2011,negative,another time traverlers wife great book poor film adaptation jim sturgess plays dex very well however anne hathaway is given much of a character to work as she play emma the plot is rushed and fragmented that leaves the audience wishing they knew more about the characters
May 17 2011,positive,much better than i expected  of course it is a great story the book itself is amazing  the film did not disappoint  great casting apart from annes accentthe less said about that the better  i especially liked the use of the music throughout the film to highlight each year
May 16 2011,positive,read the book and already crying over the trailer because i know what happens so sad xxx cant wait to see this
May 16 2011,negative,terrible movie from start to finish
May 16 2011,positive,great story a story that can and does happen in real life sometimes the good girl never gives up on the lost boy the tragic turn really sets a touching tone and brings it to tearjerker status a really good film for romantic movie loverslike me nice sweet soundtrack throughout

May 14 2011,neutral,after having read the novel which i really liked i couldnt help but feel the movie was moving too quickly from one scene or in this case year or even decade to the next
May 12 2011,positive,i love this movie bc it reminds me that no matter how bad things get no matter how hopeless life gets you can endure the pain you feel lets you know youve lived and you carry on despite the scars
May 12 2011,positive,i think the story was beautifully written some parts were funny i didnt expect what happened at the end to happen there were some gadgets in the film which were so new which didnt seem to fit in with the timeline credits to both anne and jim i felt sorry for dexter in the end in a wayhaving found the one and then but then it was a memorable ending i guess for dexter
May 11 2011,positive,anne hathaway and jim sturgess looked really good and i cried

May 3 2011,positive,twenty years two people  based on the 1 international bestseller
May 1 2011,positive,a look at two friends and their journey through life and love a little slow but the plot and the various situations keep one going a nice little romantic drama
Apr 30 2011,positive,i really wanted to like this movie but i just couldnt it wasnt even anne hathaways accent what bothered me the most that the movie kept jumping around the movie was full of emotionally distant character that just jumped through time without a true exploration of their relationship i just couldnt take it
Apr 30 2011,positive,good adaptation of the book anne hathaway is excellent as usual and jim sturgess is pretty good actor didnt knew him before laughter and tears sont au rendezvous just like in the book
Apr 30 2011,negative,not enough if a pay off i found it actually quite depressing
Apr 26 2011,positive,twenty years two people    one great film    this indie style romantic film has so much more to offer than a warm heart feeling it has a perfect sound mix great actors and a cute story that will definitely leave everyone thinking and in love with love and friendship    dexter and emma are two awkward friends who on the 15th of july made an agreement to see each other however not only are they just friends they are deeply and madly in love with each other the movie follows their lives on that specific day for twenty years and bring to life these two amazing characters and their love for one another     lately romance has got it like like crazy this isnt a cheap tear jerker it is beyond that here we have hathaway a marvelous actress with a plethora of talent but even better is strugess who not only sings amazingly but act equally as good they both create an amazing bond on screen and create two characters that everyone in someway can relate and end up falling in love with them the story may be a bit dragging but it is nevertheless fun and interesting to watch     the movie has a great soundtrack it is nicely written and directed i have never read the book and dont think i will but the movie sure is spectacular and i highly recommend anyone to see it bring some tissues and i guarantee you will leave with a warm heart    dexter  if i could give you just one gift do you know what it would be confidence that or a scented candle
Apr 21 2011,neutral,unfortunately the movie was a disappointment i had such high hopes in seeing anne hathaway in a chick flick but the movie was kind of predictable and a bit annoying
Apr 20 2011,neutral,a little to slow and very predictable
Apr 18 2011,positive,romance movie differently with the same cliches what changes is the time it rolls many years do not leave for tomorrow what you can do today
Apr 18 2011,positive,whatever happens tomorrow weve had today
Apr 17 2011,positive,been awhile since i read the book but it was pretty true from what i remember enjoyable
Apr 14 2011,positive,very interesting way of telling a love story  i wasnt enjoying it for the first 15 minutes it just felt disjointed until i got into the method of the storytelling  the ending literally made me jump out of my seat
Apr 13 2011,positive,this is a good movie but i couldnt honestly say that i loved it i am surprised seeing the run time is 1 hour 47 minutes honestly i thought it was well over 2 hours as it seemed to go on and on    the good things first  it is well cast  i know a lot of people werent impressed with anne hathaway and her english accent but i actually thought she did okay with it  i havent read the book so i dont know how close in appearance she is to emma but they certainly played her looks down  i was stunned by how plain and blotchy she actually looks through most of this so i am assuming they stayed true to the character  jim sturgess i thought made a good dexteralso patricia clarkson i always find her pretty good  no change here very moving as dexters mum   i also appreciated that the story was a little deeper than most of this genre spanning from 1988 when emma and dexter met and then picking up each year on the same date some entries longer than others i think the final chapter of this is around 2008 so it really does give you time to watch the characters evolve  you see them in different careers and other relationships they decide early on to be friends only or rather dexter decides it is always obvious that emma hoped for more finally the obvious happens and their time together comes  now for the bad  seriously by this time dexter has become such a prat you wonder what she still sees in him  looks obviously but even they start to fade after problems with addiction and unhealthy living  im sure i cant have been the only one in the audience who thought the french jazz musician was the better bet    then theres the lovely little twist in the story at 2006  wft  yes i get that it was based on a book but seriously  maybe that kind of crap worked in the book  it doesnt cut it in what has been marketed as a romantic movie
Apr 13 2011,positive,a beautifully told romance is somewhat dampened by a heavyhanded plot twist great cast and great chemistry
Apr 11 2011,positive,twenty years two people one day
Apr 10 2011,positive,i liked how this movie was set out great film
Apr 6 2011,positive,good but not as good as the book even though they really did stick to the story
Mar 27 2011,positive,not as good as the book  but still good
Mar 26 2011,positive,such a sad and lovely film its a great film
Mar 13 2011,positive,a great movie to instill your belief and hope in true love a very non cliche type movie it is a chick flick definatley one of those movies that you see on your own because your too affraid of what your friends will react to your reaction of the movie because you yourself arent to sure how youll react or iff youll even like it
Mar 8 2011,positive,the pace of the first part was way too fast and it failed to build up a ground for the relationship the narrative also seemed floppy focusing on too many points and failed to create an impact it should still it was beautifully acted and at times it was painfully real i did shed a few tears its a movie that i enjoyed watching and would love to watch it again many times partly because of jim sturgess of course it just didnt hit me as hard as i had expected
Feb 27 2011,positive,loved it i was very pleased to see that the author wrote the screenplay it shows jim sturgess shines as dexter mayhew
Feb 17 2011,negative,a quiet usual type of love story with untalented actors despite a nice twist ending
Feb 16 2011,negative,it wasnt as good as i thought it would be
Feb 15 2011,positive,a beautiful  mystifying film that spans over the course of 20 years on july 15 st swethins day it remarkably shows how these two people em and dex dex  em how they wasted their whole lives loving each other  never truly realizing it a wonderful story of true love  a lasting friendship that goes on forever
Feb 5 2011,positive,its a great movie but so incredibly depressing i still cry about it every now and then
Jan 2 2011,positive,this is a good story but i wouldnt want to be in such story what greater crime than loss of time lifes too short for regrets he treats her like a spare tire like a life buoy and she waited for him so patiently its like however far he goes or however fup he makes himself shed always be right behind waiting for him its so painful to watch how can you spend 20 years to realize how much you love someone on the first day you met each other sad
Dec 23 2010,positive,i thought it was a very lovely film with very lovely actors i know there were lots of people complaining about anne hathaways accent but it honestly didnt bother me i didnt think it was too bad anne did a great job but shes always pretty great but for me jim was the real star i think his performance moved me the most     i have the read the book so i was already familiar with the storyline btw a great adaptation but i didnt like how at the beginning of the film it starts  with emma in 2006 too much foreshadowing if you ask me it was a little slow at times but understandably they were trying to fit 20 years of friendship and love into one film but sometimes it dragged sometimes it was boring but at the same time it was nice seeing the two characters grow into themselves and yes i was starting to tear up so caution to all those who see it but bring the kleenex    i really liked all the costumes it really felt like the 80s or it really felt like the mid 90s at times i really felt like jim sturgess looked convincingly young at the beginning just as he started to look convincingly older up to a point that is at the end of the film he has his gray hairbut he still has a babyface i think they needed to add more wrinkles or something     overall a very enjoyable film its the kind of film i wouldnt mind seeing again maybe on dvd but not necessarily one of the best of the year
Dec 14 2010,positive,cast anne hathaway jim sturgess patricia clarkson ken scott romola garai rafe spall tom mison jodie whittaker joséphine de la baume     director lone scherfig     summary after a romantic tryst on college graduation night emma and dexter pursue separate dreams this romantic drama based on a novel of the same name checks in with them each year on the same date tracking their personal and professional progress    my thoughts i am not one who is a big fan of romantic films but this film is my kind of romance its just honest shows people at their weakest and strongest points you feel for these characters especially emma there is no fairy tale ending and usually i am one who prefers it not to end so perfect and sweetly put together but i wanted it so badly for this story you can just feel what the outcome of this story near the end as its happening i cringed as the momentum built up brilliant performances by both anne and jim they were great on screen together a must see and i hope to read the book
Dec 2 2010,negative,disappointment as expected  will still read the book someday 
Nov 15 2010,positive,i love the story  got swept away in the emotion of the film if not for ah i would probably watch this film again  again
Sep 29 2010,positive,i read the david nicholls book in the summer of 2010 and it became an instant favorite of mine its one of the few books ive loved so much and one of the few books that i find myself caring for so dearly i sort of see my relationship with my best friend in emma and dexters relationship and maybe that is why i so cherish one day    when i saw the trailer for this movie i felt slightly disappointed i didnt think it was going to be as good as the book and its not but its very beautiful and vibrant and realistic and alive just the same     anne hathaways british accent kept changing throughout the movie but thats honestly one of my three small complaints the other is that a few key scenes from the book were missing and it the humor of the book was also absent  the movie went with the almost entirely dramatic tone and my third complain is the soundtrack i think this movie deserved a better musical score  a more present and memorable one     but otherwise the performances were great and this movie makes me a lone scherfig fan the poster is just stunning  and i fell in love with practically every scenery in the movie     it was not perfect but it was almost there fraught with intensity realism beauty and tragedy
Sep 29 2010,positive,one day is one of my absolute favorite books so its taking a bit of work not to be that person that picks a film to shreds by explain each and every way in which the film and book differ as far as specific details and events go i really cannot see how it matters as long as the film ends up in the same places what differences does it makes if it takes a slightly different path from the novel the only thing that bugged me about the adaptation here is that the relationship between dex and em just felt so much different they feel like lovers from start to finish and the span of the film seems to mostly exist to show that they need to be together but they are both unaware one of the things that i loved the most about the book is that dex and em and first and foremost friends incredibly close friends their relationship changes and becomes more complex as they grow older but even the relationship as lovers blossoms out of their friendship its just different and the film takes the same material as the book but comes out so much weaker by simply using a romantic angle still i liked the film a lot had hoped for better but will still revisit it again
Sep 21 2010,positive,ian she made you decent and in return you made her so happy so happy and i will always be grateful to you for that
