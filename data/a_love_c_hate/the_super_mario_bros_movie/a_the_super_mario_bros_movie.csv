Apr 14 2024,positive,the animation voice acting and everything else despite its mixed reception i regard it as one of my top favorites of my 2023 movies all of the voice actors including charles martinet should be what 21st century animation voice actors be like 
Apr 11 2024,positive,absoutley wonderfull movie the animation is cool the models are great and this movie is a total movie of 5 stars
Apr 10 2024,positive,this movie was pretty good in fact they add the mario kart stuff and it was amazing it dropped points because the pasting was so fast
Apr 9 2024,positive,this movie is 100 5 stars let me explain first off u have to be a mario fan to enjoy this movie for the most part but maybe some of u who dont even know what mario is will enjoy it but there are many references to the games which i love and will now talk about     this mario movie is probably one of the best movies to ever exist my family and i watched the movie yesterday as a family movie night and let me tell u boy we were blown away but how much from the games are included in this movie we loved the rainbow roads and lunas star how they are plumbers and how they got to customise there cars and the obstacles and how real they are to the game i wont keep going so i dont spoil too much but there are many more things we loved how there was a part from almost every game and the character traits onnn point and how close mario and luigi are in the movie is adorable     the song that was included about bowser songpeaches kind of ruined bowsers personality but it definitely made the audience laugh including myself and my family    one of the best things as well in this movie issssssss the animation omg it is so good now we watched it off a bad quality website but even so it was so good i wonder how good it would be in the theatres the colours as well we loved how bright the mushroom kingdom was and the quality of the colours was perfect    now for the plot the plot was kind of weak and a little boring but as a huge mario loverthat wouldnt really matter in a way because even though it was weak it still related to the game and is still coming of of the games plot which is amazing i cant describe how good this movie really is     my favourites though are the toads they are so fricking cute    anyways that is all i would definitely recommend this movie and for every person on this earth to go watch it i loved it in many ways that i cant describe 810 for sure   i am really looking forward for another movie with or without bowser but please the cast if there is going to be a second plz make sure it doesnt change the games and it would still have all the references to the games     thank you love the movie ever so much
Apr 8 2024,positive,i hate these stupid critics who cannot be watching the same film as everybody else like bro the literal blue shell was in the film also it is visually stunning and the best lineup of voice actors ever
Apr 8 2024,positive,kids loved it very thin plot but plenty of laughs and the excitement of seeing mario on the big screen saves it
Apr 7 2024,positive,as far as video game movies go this is one best it looks great acting is pretty good and it actually feels like mario game my only complaint is that luigi doesnt get that much screen time but at least he does something i the end
Apr 7 2024,positive,loved it took me right back to my first nintendo days i honestly think i loved it more than my kids characters were played perfectly but i wish yoshi was included more cant wait for the next one
Apr 6 2024,positive,a wonderful film i recommend it people
Apr 6 2024,positive,wow it was so cute it was sooooo nostalgic i love it
Apr 3 2024,positive,good movie improves on the 1900s movie a lot enjoyed looking for easter eggs for nintendo 455
Apr 2 2024,positive,it  is the best movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,the greatest video games movie ever made including all actor
Apr 1 2024,positive,i was very pleased with this version as mario fan any person who played games will be pleased with this version and jokes hidden stuff they have in movie fun to look for really like mario training at castle takes me back to nes game and donkey kong fight to game on nes as well good for mario fans i recommend this
Apr 1 2024,positive,i am a massive mario fan so thats already one thing thats gonna make me love this movie but oh my god this movie was so funny and awesome and the voice acting while questionable in some parts was incredible 8510
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie is genuinely fantastic my only major issue i have with this movie is its pacing and thus why this movie should have been a longer movie in order to have a better pacing 1 hr 32 minutes was way too short this movie needed at least another 1020 minutes
Mar 30 2024,positive,as a lifelong nintendo fan this was largely a very well done movie about big ns mascot
Mar 30 2024,positive,even though it was a little kids movie as a older person and not a kid i enjoyed it very much
Mar 30 2024,positive,it is a movie based on our childhood game we have waiting for for a long long long time and it did not disappoint despite chris pratt was okay as mario really had a good time with this movie doesnt deserve much hate
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun and faithful adaptation to the game both old school fans can appreciate it as well as new super mario fans film is fun and punctual a very fun watch for the whole family the character designs are fun as well new and refreshing for a feature film but nothing too out of left field all the characters look as they should very solid film
Mar 28 2024,positive,amazing amazing amazing i was scared because the last mario movie you made was was ummmmm i guess something i highly highly highly recommended this amazing epic
Mar 28 2024,positive,ngl this movie is underrated as heck why do people think the movie plot is bad mario is a classing video everyone know and love i was so exited months before the movie came out and it didnt disappointed me
Mar 28 2024,positive,its awesome ngl i seen it in school  and it was the best movie go see now and sub to mrbeast or else
Mar 28 2024,positive,if youre not a fan of mario you will still probably enjoy this movie but you will not get a lot of the references definitely a movie made for kids but also a movie that adult mario fans can enjoy too if you are very knowledgeable on the mario universe youll have a blast with this movie i loved it just taking off half a star since the movie relies a lot on prior knowledge to the mario universe to understand what is happening not a lot of explaining happens within the movie itself they rely on the audience to do their homework essentially
Mar 28 2024,positive,has very funny scenes
Mar 27 2024,positive,a fun time indeed while not having much of a plot its still is very enjoying for the start to the end
Mar 27 2024,positive,awesome movie cant wait for a 2nd one with hopefully a lil more story and interactions with the brothers please i need more wholesome brother moments nintendo i beg        but yeah its a awesome movie i liked it a lot sure its not perfect and has a lot of references which i actually liked cuz i get them fr    but u shouldnt let others change ur mind on the movie if u enjoy this movie then enjoy it   dont let some random tell u otherwise and even if u didnt like the movie the least u can do is not hate others for it everyone has different tastes after all ik crazy right     again the movie isnt flawless so ofc take that for account however every movie isnt perfect and even with that its still a pretty awesome movie and u should think for urself unless its stupid like some of these critics without following someones opinion without watching it urself or creating ur own opinion first 
Mar 26 2024,positive,this movie is truly a masterpiece any person of any age would enjoy watching this weather theyve played the games or not
Mar 26 2024,positive,probably the most faithful video game movie ever as a normal movie its not amazing or anything but its still pretty good
Mar 26 2024,positive,wow if you grew up with mario you must see this film it gives fun easter eggs to the fans and gives bowser as this funny evil villain that i and hopefully everyone enjoyed
Mar 25 2024,positive,lumalee is my spirit animal fr
Mar 24 2024,positive,looking for a night out with the family look no further this movie is perfect for all ages and is enjoyable heart warming and has a slight comical tone woven into the story hearing chris pratt as a small italian man takes some time to get used to but i think the cast as a whole was on point the plot is a bit rushed but when youre trying to fit almost 40 years worth of games into one movie it can get a bit crowded overall it was a treat and i recommend seeing it while its in theaters
Mar 23 2024,positive,wow what animation what a magnificent story  i was enchanted and i want more  best animation of recent times
Mar 23 2024,positive,this is without a doubt the best illumination movie a movie that is great for children and adults who grew up with the super mario bros franchise if i had to list any problems with this movie id say luigi needs more screen time and charles martinet would probably be a better role for mario than christ pratt and thats really it great movie please watch
Mar 23 2024,positive,not much of a movie here but worth watching once
Mar 20 2024,positive,its a nice family film nothing special it has its fun moments but nothing that ill remember for life its ok
Mar 19 2024,positive,it gave me defining myself as a person who played this game a bit when i was young what i expected very entertaining indeed
Mar 18 2024,positive,one of the new rare animated movies that actually feels like a movie in todays dreadful cinemas leave it to illumination will save the day
Mar 17 2024,positive,the second best video game movie behind the fnaf movie
Mar 16 2024,positive,im just going to say it f the critics on this one this is easily one of the best video game movies of all time and it is way better than the bob hobskin one and i will admit chris pratt as mario while it is a weird casting choice he did do a pretty good job and the peaches song was the funniest part of the entire movie
Mar 16 2024,negative,this was interesting but not really worth the time
Mar 16 2024,positive,movie was so fun to watch also the song peaches was well done
Mar 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed watching this movie it was wonderful and im really surprised it did well hopefully they show more mario characters in the sequel
Mar 13 2024,positive,im a sonic fan and mario is a pizza fan and im  a fan of burgers
Mar 13 2024,positive,i love every single second of it although i kind of wish that peachs and toads voices are more soft spoken because of the games i played but i love it to pieces
Mar 13 2024,positive,love the mario movie and its good movie for kids
Mar 13 2024,positive,love that movie chris pratt nail it
Mar 12 2024,negative,it was fine nothing really happened in the film at all i wouldnt watch it more than once
Mar 12 2024,positive,the kid in me who grew up playing mario  wants to give this 5 stars but i also have to be objective  the movie looks beautiful and i had a great time  on the other hand there was so much potential that wasnt met   i dont mind fast paced movies but this almost felt like a montage or something one of the movie posters was so beautiful that i wanted them to take their time and let me live in that world for a while i wanted to know a bit of its history to know how the world works how the people in it live and all the world building details we should expect from an animated movie in 2023  dont get me wrong no one plays mario games for the plot but a movie is a different format this was the perfect opportunity to expand on the wonderful world universe of mario     this could easily be fixed in the sequel tho with the money this movie made nintendo knows the potential for their cinematic universethere is so much and not just for mario i hope they recognize that and bring better writers next time around its perfectly possible to have a fast paced movie but still take the time to let us be part of that world for a moment
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was funny charming and it was so fun to see characters youve grown to love being shown on the big screen 
Mar 9 2024,positive,very fun movie to watch very colorful and nostalgic
Mar 9 2024,positive,i am not a huge mario fan so for me this movie was just ok it wasnt bad but im not going back to rewatch this movie ever again
Mar 9 2024,positive,honestly one of the best movies ever created seriously one of the songs got an oscar you know that it has to be good right loved it so much that after i watched it i begged my parents to buy it on youtube or some other streaming service the moment it came out absolutely must see your money wont be wasted ps theres a secret scene if you wait long enough after the credits
Mar 8 2024,positive,itsa perfect in every single way i love how the movie featured so much for our red and green plumbers idc what the critics say i watched it and i loved it thank you so much charles martinet for making an appearance in the movie letsa go
Mar 7 2024,positive,the mario movie was funny and good to watch
Mar 7 2024,positive,certainly one of the best video game to screen adaptations ever conceived its no masterpiece by any means and falls apart in the 3 rd act but still enjoyable none the less and a great movie to keep the kids entertained for an hour and a half visuals are beautiful and some chuckle worthy moments make this a decent watch elevated by the source material and easter eggs nostalgia goes a long way must watch for long time mario fans
Mar 7 2024,positive,probably giving this a little more leeway because i got all the references but this was obviously made by people who knew the source material
Mar 5 2024,positive,hands down the best videogame adaptation alongside twisted metal and fnaf
Mar 5 2024,positive,this movie was so outstandingly amazing spectacular and so cool there was so many good amount of references like mario kart koopa stompings and the awesome thing i love in the movie is the super mario bros super show theme song in their plumbing commercial i thought that was so genius for the movie especially for 80s and 90s kids who grew up watching the super mario bros super show this movie is just like the original video game 100 
Mar 5 2024,positive,with this film showing the animated scenario of the how super mario bros became our parents favorite childhood plumbers this movie was accurate to the mario games that are very well known today
Mar 4 2024,negative,the movie was originally going to be longer with luigi having a subplot but since its a kids movie despite having pg raiting they cut it short  only to 90 minutes the only things i liked were the animation music and marios and luigis bond even thou luigi had only 7 minutes of screentime everything else was just bad like how some already pointed out the 80s pop songs were ditracting  voice acting was pretty meh the rushed pacing one dimensional characters a lot of these problems are caused by the neverending waves of using references as substitute for story its like the movie doesnt have trust in its self to tell a story  one scene that made a bad taste in my mouth was the in the third act where mario is chased down by banzai bill and instead of directing it anywhere else he directs right into a warp pipe that leads to his home not only it made him stupid but he probably killed a lot of people once bowsers castle crashed into brooklyn i also had problem with the constant use of slow motion especially in the climax and with dk being frustraiting to watch him mockerying mario all the time only to immediatly befriend him over daddy issues in one scene   while this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen and its true that it doesnt have to be complex that doesnt exuses its flaws i felt i was watching a commercial rather than film  if you ask me because of movies like the super mario bros movie people will forever think that any animated movie regardles of its rating is a kids genre especially when people will constantly defend its flaws  edit  if you like this movie its completly fine this is just my opinion
Mar 2 2024,positive,the super mario bros movie was a fantastic film the reason is because i love how the plot of the movie tells the basic origin story of how mario  luigi became plumbers as part of theyre living right after they found a hidden pipe that separate each other to another dimension most importantly mario will do anything to find luigi and protect the mushroom kingdom from bowser and his army    the reason why i love the movie is because the film is filled with tons and tons of easter eggs references and hidden messages of course im upset why a few critics would rank the movie on how much effort nintendo  illumination worked through like rotten tomatoes ranked 59 while audience score ranked 95 at least most nintendo and illumination fans and everyone from around the world really enjoyed the movie and this is all that matters to me i truly believe that the movie was a true masterpiece and i will definitely buy it digitally again best movie ever
Mar 1 2024,positive,the animation is so amazing  if you are a mario fan you absolutely love it
Feb 28 2024,positive,it had really good visuals and animation one problem i have though is the characters that voiced the main characters
Feb 28 2024,positive,this is a work of art very infinitely better than the 1993 super mario movie this is much more faithful to the games not only of mario but also of donkey kong and other nintendo games without a doubt this is the best games film of 2023
Feb 26 2024,negative,the needle drops are baffling what year is this and after hearing donkey kong say its on like donkey kong i think someone involved in this crime against humanity needs to serve prison time
Feb 25 2024,positive,the super mario bros movie is absolutely amazing  totally super awesome cooler than ever seen
Feb 25 2024,positive,cool movie i watched on hbo on cignal disk its super cool when koopas invaded the pengiuns
Feb 25 2024,negative,wasnt good it was ass
Feb 24 2024,positive,it was very legendary
Feb 24 2024,positive,i cant believe illumination made a movie better than despicable me 2
Feb 24 2024,positive,if youre never played any of the mario games before this is probably a boring cookie cutter movie lucky for me ive played a lot and found all the references really neat the soundtrack is especially great incorporating some of marios greatest hits i also found the movie very pretty to look at i appreciated the movies explanation of how mario goes from brooklyn ny to the land of the mushroom kingdom showing him interacting with the new world and meeting our favorite characters like peach toad and donkey kong had the movie started after all these characters had met i think it would be far weaker the film gets to show us how these iconic characters may have met now is the plot especially compelling or original no but this is the mario movie no one was expecting a masterpiece the fun energy visuals and soundtrack make it worth a watch for anyone whos played the video games
Feb 24 2024,positive,it is vary good do not lisen to the people how say it is bad it is a vary good movie
Feb 23 2024,positive,best movie ever  im a die hard nintendo fan so this was great
Feb 23 2024,positive,i think the movie is absolutely fantastic and amazing i rate it a 1010 such a good masterpiece i love it so much and i already want to watch the movie again
Feb 22 2024,positive,its ok fun time for kids nostalgia for adults gamers like me will appreciate it better otherwise its just another generic childish animated feature and why chris pratt again wasnt there another voice actor available
Feb 22 2024,positive,its a cute little movie they included all of the major mario games growing up playing mario i loved it its a must watch 
Feb 21 2024,positive,i just watched the super mario brothers movie and i have to say it exceeded my expectations the visuals were stunning and the storyline kept me engaged throughout i believe it deserves to be at the top of the charts i really hope they decide to create a sequel and retain the same talented cast additionally i am eagerly anticipating the opening of the theme park the creators of this movie have done an exceptional job
Feb 18 2024,positive,like everyone else i was a bit skeptical when the casting for this movie was originally announced however like everyone else i was wrong chris pratt and charlie day do a fantastic job as mario and luigi the animation was beautiful the music was classic and the story itself was compelling enough to keep you interested while tossing in a ton of easter eggs for the longtime players of the franchise
Feb 18 2024,positive,critics are not true video gamers  we super mario fans are true video gamers  this movie wont and will never be forgotten had a great time watching and rewatching it minimal about of missed opportunities most detailed illumination movie by far nintendo knew what they want this movie could might and will age perfectly
Feb 17 2024,positive,it is a funny and great adaption for anyone that is fun enoughgreat voice actinganimation and humor
Feb 16 2024,positive,this film is one of if not the best animated film since spider verse has lots of references to the game amazing storytelling sure the voice acting wasnt amazing but its still good this is an amazing film for fans of the game and for people who havent played the games this film is a masterpiece
Feb 11 2024,positive,it was a wahhoooooo movie and i enjoyed jamming out to the soundtrack and the easter eggs chefs kiss it was a great experience and i hope to see more in the future   55
Feb 5 2024,positive,great movie really liked watching it with my 10 years old boy finally an enjoyable new release
Feb 5 2024,negative,a set of incongruent action scenes with almost no plot whatsoever
Feb 4 2024,positive,good i love mario so a mario movie really good but its need bowser jr
Feb 4 2024,positive,very nostalgic i love the way mario meet and rescue peach its modern visual game a good fan service super fun
Feb 4 2024,positive,peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches  thats all i have to say
Feb 3 2024,negative,ive been a huge fan of super mario since i was a kid the games have aged extremely well and even as an adult now i find myself enjoying them from a enjoyment and critical mindset     this movie fails as a movie and is mildly entertaining if you want to watch a 2 hour ad for a variety of nintendo products with little to zero story and substance its the movie for you     however ive come to expect more from movies and theres no excuse if lego can do it seemingly flawlessly and sonic the hedgehog gave it the old college try witnessing super mario do nothing except remind me of better games was extremely disappointing this should of been better
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was really good i love mario and this did for fill the good video game movie the only thing that gets me is that the movie went by too fast like stuff was happening faster then i was seeing it was still a good movie and i do recommend it
Feb 3 2024,positive,this is a childrens movie and its just that fun and total nostalgia im so sick of chris pratt though
Feb 2 2024,positive,the super mario bros movie is good  movie need a sequel
Feb 2 2024,positive,the movie is awesome the color is amazing story is engaging except these rotten tomatoes score it should be higher than 54  the moment that you realized that movies are amazing not depending on someone else opinion
Feb 1 2024,positive,i thought they did a great job with it mario games dont have much story so given the source content it worked the art direction was accurate and felt like i was transported to that world good entertainment for anyone but great for mario fans
Feb 1 2024,positive,this movie is great the critics are trash
Jan 31 2024,positive,i dont know what movie critics in this site watched but im sure that wasnt the super mario bros movie it have your problems but this site already rated better worst movies here
Jan 31 2024,positive,awesome family movie
Jan 30 2024,positive,it might be rotten to the critics but i thought it was a pretty great movie ive watched it twice now
Jan 27 2024,positive,no explanation needed
Jan 24 2024,negative,brings me back for sure of my youth visually speaking otherwise i just didnt care for the film at all it really stinks because i was so excited for it to be something fantastic it just was so hard to sit through and this is coming from a movie lover and a fan of mario or maybe this is more for the kiddos than for adult fans of the mario bros
Jan 22 2024,positive,great movie and many game sounds references in movie amazing
Jan 22 2024,positive,definitely a kids movie with lots of nods to old school easter eggs fun to watch
Jan 22 2024,positive,watachble but nothing special
Jan 21 2024,positive,the mario bros movie is a good movie that i can say that is better than the horrible one from 1993 the actions is good and a best family movie
Jan 20 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie a lot but there is a lack of development from luigi and only some for donkey kong princess peach was a good character though but toad couldve used more action he didnt do much but help mario get into the castle and give peach the ice flower the final fight was great which i cant find any flaws in
Jan 19 2024,negative,this movie was awful the plot sucks the quality is awful and everything made no sense its awful how movie producers can get away with some stupid plot like this how did they just suddenly assassinate me out of nowhere that makes no sense the movie just sucked i wanted my money back but they didnt give it back so i burnt down the theatre  010 movie would not recommend i would rather kill myself 
Jan 19 2024,positive,great movie and also its an illumination movie so what else do you want
Jan 17 2024,positive,even if youre not a frequent player to the videogame icon the film remains a compelling phenomenon that seems it only played in canonizing the multiplatform lore into one muddled thin plot but enjoyably fun nonetheless over the playful charm across the appealing characterization by impressive efforts amidst a faithful capture into the recognizable visual world that should be defined as crowdpleasing b
Jan 17 2024,positive,i love the references and dont care about a lack of story
Jan 16 2024,positive,i hate stuff like this but it was so good really funny and it looked amazing xx
Jan 16 2024,negative,this isnt even for children its for babies
Jan 16 2024,positive,easily the best animated movie of all time
Jan 15 2024,positive,flashy quality animation mixed with a decent albeit thin plot leads this to be a charming animated adventure  mario references keep fans happy and newcomers feel welcomed you dont need to be a mario fan to enjoy this movie
Jan 15 2024,neutral,ehhhh alright it didnt feel like the mario i grew up with tho
Jan 15 2024,positive,the best movie in the world
Jan 15 2024,positive,i liked all the references and easter eggs but there was no real storyline or plot
Jan 15 2024,positive,if you dont nitpick it youll love it especially if youre a fan of the games
Jan 14 2024,positive,this is the best movie ever
Jan 14 2024,positive,very enjoyable movie for mario fans great cast
Jan 14 2024,positive,the movie was so good
Jan 13 2024,positive,great movie better than i expected they gave it real thought
Jan 13 2024,positive,these critics must have banished their inner child to the void a long time ago to collectively miss the mark this much this film was a blast from start to finish jampacking as much game related content as reasonably expected the kids were blown away and having never known of the lore behind super mario brothers have become life long fans yeah it was a simple plot but the video games were never mindbenders in the first place leave the critics to their sundance avantgarde pieces this movie is for the people
Jan 12 2024,positive,i waited years for this and it did not disappoint me everything was perfect nothing was bad about this movie
Jan 10 2024,positive,this movie everything a super mario fan would want to see its very nostalgic shows a ton of references from mario and other nintendo games you can tell that the movie took a lot of hard work to make great job nintendo and illumination
Jan 9 2024,positive,very good movie but the plot gets a bit weird would recommend though very good movie
Jan 9 2024,negative,were used to these updated nostalgia fest films now when tv cartoon computer game icons of the 90s get a makeover and a film for modern times this one does all youd expect by shoe horning as much of the games into the film as possible the plot was incidental and the jokes were a bit meh it was all pretty weak and the franchise has nowhere to run with this now as the computer game backstory was always threadbare to start with im afraid this one just didnt work but nintendo got to cash in on the second highest grossing film of 2023 and a senseless easy money making picture enough already watched this one on sky cinema
Jan 9 2024,negative,i refuse to suspend my disbelief that a film about a video game could be this unfulfilling
Jan 8 2024,positive,its cute my dad whos a major fan absolutely adores this movie
Jan 8 2024,positive,a true love letter from nintendo to the super mario franchise as a whole with numerous nods and easter eggs to the beloved series the story is a little simplistic and it feels rushed at times but those are the only glaring negatives
Jan 8 2024,positive,ive been waiting all my life for this
Jan 8 2024,neutral,who is this movie for its inappropriate for kids and would piss off most adult fans of mario
Jan 8 2024,positive,plot is generic and overall voice work is disappointing but the shoutouts and nostalgia still make it worth seeing
Jan 8 2024,positive,although the plot and character development of this movie might be a little underdeveloped i still really enjoyed this movie this movie is a mustwatch for all the mario fans out there
Jan 7 2024,positive,as advertised great voice acting
Jan 7 2024,positive,great movie that all i have to say
Jan 5 2024,negative,it was so bad waste of time
Jan 5 2024,positive,peaches peaches peaches  so good
Jan 4 2024,positive,good family movie chris pratt does an excellent job voice acting this world looks amazing i hope they do a take on mario galaxy in the future
Jan 3 2024,neutral,the super mario franchise finds itself at the same turning point that all longlasting intellectual properties do should our franchise age with the original fan base or should we revitalize it for a new generation in our current media jungle some ips can get away with both but trying to choose a third option to satisfy both camps can be a gamble as the result is often a tepid concoction
Jan 1 2024,positive,the best kids movie i have seen in a long time me and my 4 year old son had a great time seeing this movie
Jan 1 2024,positive,really well done  cute story to watch with the family
Jan 1 2024,positive,the mario movie is unironically the best example of how to make a videogame based film i didnt mind chris pratts performance as mario but the rest of the cast did great    this film embraces the videogame its so faithful to the source material everything alligns to the actual games   unlike the liveaction mario film we dont talk about    the amount references and fan service is extremely nostalgic its like every time i watch it it feels like theirs a new character or leitmotif i havent found before    the peaches song is so good usually im not into musical numbers in films but this is just so enjoyable to listen to     peach is more than just a damsel is distress shes actually shown as a strong female character and she actually fights back with bowser    the only criticism i have with this film is the licensed songs i just wish they used even more mario songs rather then hearing take on me or something random    overall i declare this as a cinematic masterpiece for a videogame based movie this is as mario as a mario film gets and im sure that this film will inspire future videogame based films to come
Dec 31 2023,negative,so  movie was terrible  worse than the 1993 movie which has a sub 30 score    it has no plot and the animation is behind garish purple neon washing everything out for more than half the movie  moving from set piece to set piece     made me check to see if the writers guild strike was active when this was in the works  i watched the whole thing its inoffensive i just expected a plot in my movie and animation that i could see    every scene i go why are you doing this and the answer no reason pad out the run time get to 90 minutes and call it a movie
Dec 31 2023,positive,great movie with beautiful animations definitely has a lot of good easter eggs also
Dec 31 2023,positive,good level of humor and story line the voice acting was great and funny used the games as a reference but didnt over power it
Dec 31 2023,positive,an amazing origin movie for one of the most amazing duos of all time
Dec 30 2023,positive,its plot may be simple but the super mario bros movie is an absolute love letter to video game cinema that accompanied by beautiful animation and a fabulous cast manages to crown itself without a doubt as the best adaptation of a video game to film in history without fear of contradiction i give the super mario bros movie a solid 10 out of 10
Dec 30 2023,positive,alright so i am not a massive fan of mario but i have to hand it to the creators of this film they did well with it the soundtrack was incredible i loved hearing lots of different music for different scenes and for most of them it was the first time i had ever heard of the music if you are a fan or know a fan of mario i would give this a watch
Dec 30 2023,positive,i think that the movie had little character development and went too quickly but perfect for people that like action and games
Dec 30 2023,positive,this is a fun movie though the movie isnt the most complex it doesnt have to be the use of copyrighted songs is to show what the scene wants to be interpreted overall if you can enjoy a good mario movie this is the one we dont talk about the other one
Dec 30 2023,negative,maybe its for fans of the videogame i dont know good animation though
Dec 29 2023,positive,how is it so funny it is actually insanely good
Dec 29 2023,positive,for a movie that is based on the beloved video game franchise the story was perfect  especially each characters backstory however the dialogue could use more work sometimes the jokes doesnt register overall the film was ok
Dec 29 2023,positive,really fun movie that is enjoyable for all ages the story telling stays true to mario for the most part and the voice acting is great
Dec 28 2023,positive,best movie ever no words for how amazing this masterpiece is   my boi luigi needed more screen time but he still saved the day 9510
Dec 28 2023,negative,this movie is garbage the only reason any adult would like this film is that they like the super mario franchise thats it theres nothing smart or interesting about it its literally just a simple babybrained plot with mario the reviews of this are unhinged
Dec 27 2023,positive,a good film better than i expected i thought the marioluigi accents would be offputting but it wasnt
Dec 27 2023,positive,this movie is funny me and my partner laughed the whole movie it is also really wholesome if you play mario as a kid this would be fun ride honestly would totally watch it again if they have dvd lol
Dec 27 2023,positive,this is everything a mario movie should be a fun and exciting video game movie that gives the fans what they want
Dec 27 2023,positive,wow i cant believe how amazing this movie is its definitely the best one ive ever seen in my entire life and you know what mario is my absolute favorite character hes just so cool and always saves the day
Dec 27 2023,positive,the cgi was topnotch and the story was alright but the characters in the movie did not feel like the characters in the games there were off somehow so that threw me off  also it felt like the writing was lazy  maybe if i had seen the movie without playing every game in this franchise i might have liked it more
Dec 27 2023,positive,i think the movie was pretty interesting for the most part i think it was up to my expectations but it was a little boring in some parts but i do recommend
Dec 26 2023,positive,without a doubt the best animated film of 2023
Dec 25 2023,positive,brownie points to the creative animators on this i dont think either of the brothers are spotted with the same expression twice nor does peach repeat the way those bangs are sorted i enjoyed the backstory into peach and the brothers lives i love those easter eggs with doug from pixars up and then the mario kart characters included along with some new variations of koopa troopas as well overall a good watch and i would say anyone over 7 would enjoy and follow along pretty well
Dec 24 2023,positive,a very impressive homage to this famous franchise very worth a watch with a lot more funny moments than expected i look forward to a followup if its consistently made
Dec 24 2023,negative,why is lugi such a baby  why are the human i dont get the storyline best part of the movie was rogan as dk
Dec 24 2023,positive,can we talk about how peach just left mario to die in the rainbow road scene after he fell into the ocean i get that her kingdom was her first prority but there was not even a single tear in her eyes
Dec 24 2023,positive,its funnybut too many characters in only 90 minutes really
Dec 24 2023,positive,absolutely gorgeous animation terrific easter eggs and references an all star cast delivering some of the most awesome performances in illumination history the super mario bros movie is easily one of the best animated films of all time     an easy 1010   chris pratt and charlie day have amazing chemistry as the mario bros
Dec 24 2023,positive,it does just enough to satisfy for a date night but this is a premise stretched very thin its nostalgic and a trip back in time for adults and it should be entertaining enough for youngsters visually it does what you expect and the voice cast is solid made for the hbo generation hubby 58wife 64 average 6110
Dec 23 2023,positive,cute movie nice storytelling
Dec 22 2023,positive,very fun good family movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,just fun would recommend to a friend
Dec 21 2023,positive,it wont blow your mind but its a good time and if you arent sick of referential easter eggs by now this will give you more than your fill
Dec 20 2023,positive,not a bad movie lots of fun to spot all the easter eggs decent story animation is well done
Dec 20 2023,positive,a video game movie that does almosteverything right the story is nothing new however the jampacked amount of references and easter eggs dont fill handfisted but instead flow really well to a point where even the most casual fan can pick up enough from the games theyve played    its not a groundbreaking movie but its certainly a fun exciting movie that does enough to earn praise
Dec 18 2023,positive,awesome i grew up playing mario this was amazing
Dec 18 2023,positive,a really great movie a satisfying story and ending also lots of easter egg scater around the movie
Dec 18 2023,positive,good specially for a video game movie
Dec 18 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a really fun movie for families and kids grownups who remember super mario bros from the 80s will like it too because it has cool 80s music the movie doesnt have a real bad guy which makes it interesting and leaves you thinking about whats right and wrong its a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy together
Dec 17 2023,positive,i think the movie looks good i love some of the easter eggs and reference to other mario games but they added some pop songs in it but overall the animations looks neat got gonna lie
Dec 16 2023,positive,cool movie loads of easter eggs and recognisable game play scenes enjoyed it very much 
Dec 16 2023,positive,if you are looking for a movie that represents the video game saga this is the ideal one
Dec 15 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was an amazing family friendly feel good film from the colorful landscaping to the nostalgia to the wellmade plot and the beautiful animation and the clever nintendo easter eggs everything was on point just an amazingly wellmade movie
Dec 14 2023,positive,this film knows exactly what it wants to be a fun ride from start to finish a stacked voice cast a killer soundtrack and hilarious beats makes this fun for the whole family
Dec 14 2023,positive,its a magical nostalgia coloured for childrens and fans of the franquise fuck you critics
Dec 14 2023,positive,mario delivers exactly what it offers a fun somewhat entertaining kids film with heart to boot yes ill admit that i did laugh multiple times i even had fun looking at it however if i had a dime for every time i saw or heard the phrase mamma mia id have enough to properly finance these gorgeously animated sequences
Dec 13 2023,positive,youll have a great time with this film
Dec 12 2023,positive,i didnt like this movie that much here the the pros of this movie im in love with the animation and character designs the realism in these characters is crazy the backgrounds in this movie are beautiful like the rainbow road and the references too and now the cons this one slowmo scene where mario almost completes the practice obstacle he uses his rizz skills i feel like that was so unnecessary to make mario like that like you just met her mario you dont know anything about her and some of the lines are cringe it makes me almost turn off the tv and the pacing of this movie is almost not good i got confused a lot but overall its not terrible im only going easy on the movie because of the realism and animation and the amazing detail
Dec 12 2023,positive,the movie while its character development song choices and plot was not the best i think visually it was illuminations best work not that that is a high bar and is just a fun movie to watch you can for mario to see this movie not a 100100 award winning movie and with all its references and different locations i think it serves the fans well the movie does really banks on the fact that you know al lot about mario before watching the movie as explanations for the world are short or non existent so i would recommend more to people who have seen some mario media before     overall fun movie to pass time with friends or family
Dec 12 2023,positive,lovely movie fun and light
Dec 11 2023,positive,as your average super mario player i really like this movie i understand all the references the music quality is cranked up to 12 and the movie doesnt overstay its welcome however there are a few flaws with the movie that you cant ignore like the short runtime the licensed music and the fast pacing make this movie for me a 910 love or hate this movie we can all agree that its better than 1993
Dec 11 2023,positive,the movie just got better and better with every scene from the iconic winks to the original games to the revamped soundtrack if youre a true mario fan this will tap into that long lost child youre looking for id go so far as to say this movie is the best ive seen through horror action comedy drama etc this is hands down the best thing that has graced our generation and prior in a long long while
Dec 11 2023,positive,entertaining and kept my attention good for kids and adults
Dec 10 2023,positive,absolutely amazing i loved it so much it was amazing and i loved all the characters and the story line best movie
Dec 10 2023,positive,that movie is amazing and cool and a spicy meatball
Dec 9 2023,positive,absolutely incredible the design is spectacular the comic scenes are hilarious and it is full of nods to all the video games in the franchise it is a dream come true for gamers and an absolute joy for children   1010
Dec 9 2023,positive,its a great faithful adapation but the plot could had a little more meat
Dec 9 2023,positive,very entertaining didnt change the story creative story
Dec 9 2023,positive,people today rate movies as excellent only because they have a lot of fan service 
Dec 9 2023,positive,does everything it was supposed to do and more it is a better family video game adaptation than the sonic movies and i really like the sonic movies
Dec 9 2023,positive,a nonstop adventure from start to finish fun for adults and kids i think this could be one of illuminations masterpieces i thought this movie should have grossed 1 billion
Dec 8 2023,positive,this movie was the best movie ever and i loved it
Dec 8 2023,positive,it was sooooo good it brought me back so many memories it was very fun to find the references to all the gamesmade me tear up at the end very funny too
Dec 7 2023,neutral,the voice acting felt almost across the board miscast and there are no real moments that stood out to me everything good about the movie showed up in 1530 second trailers
Dec 7 2023,neutral,when you look past the bright lights the movie is pretty dark
Dec 7 2023,positive,i watched this with my 4 year old today and it totally brought me back to 8 year old me when i had my nes and watching the super mario brothers super show with captain lou this is the mario brothers we wanted back in the day and deserved not the live action that we ended up getting so glad i lived to see this movie
Dec 6 2023,positive,goods solid story good characters and great score princess peach bowser and donkey kong are all perfect in my opinion toad is good though undeveloped mario has good moments and good action love all the references to the games in both scene selection story and in the musical score    bads rushed pacing undeveloped characters and missed opportunities the movie length is my biggest issue the story rushes at times leaving out golden opportunities for characterization toad never really gets his big moment and luigi is kind of nonfactor for much of the movie
Dec 6 2023,positive,finally a game video that actually gives fans what they want something faithful to the spirit and mythology of the game
Dec 6 2023,positive,just a fun kids movie to watch if your a huge mario fan then you will love this movie although if your not its an okay movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,i loved this movie in fact mario is one of my favorite characters of all time chris pratt does a great voice impression as mario
Dec 4 2023,positive,despite the stellar animation the rest was just not there the movie felt like they made the trailer first and then had to tie it all together with a plot afterwards illumination was presented with a tough task turning a beloved videogame franchise into a movie and while this is no disgrace to the name of nintendo it doesnt sell itself much further than that the starstudded cast doesnt really shine and the many references are no replacement for a compelling story
Dec 4 2023,negative,boring script and plot the movie tried to appeal to nostalgia based on the amount of sfx and references but it was overkill and thats pretty much what was holding the movie up could not get past 15 minutes
Dec 4 2023,positive,such a fun movie colorful and bright and powered up
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie for any age
Dec 4 2023,positive,more like super mehrio too short not enough character development not enough story sped up the parts you actually would want to see some of the voices are atrocious but not the ones youd think and why dear lord is princess peachs head so friggin big its bigger than her upper torso and why isnt anyone talking about how good keegan michael key is as toad he should be the official voice in the video games from now on also they definitely should have had john leguizamo do a voice
Dec 3 2023,positive,the best movie of 2023 so far this is one of my favorite movies of all time
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is the greatest achievements on how illumination made a super mario bros movie in the great way possible i would remember watching this movie its an fantastic movie
Dec 3 2023,neutral,usually the princess needed saving  now mario and luigi are the ones that need the saving plus they get downplayed a bit too much in their own movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,so fun for the kids no hidden messages just fun
Dec 3 2023,positive,nice movie its good if youre a kid and its good youre a mario fan child or not this movie is a fun time waster
Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing i loved this movie the story was fun the easter eggs were brilliant the music was perfect i loved seeing all the bits brought in from the movies the tanuki suit the cat suit luigis mansion a must watch for any super mario fan
Dec 2 2023,neutral,a bit ridiculous but i could see a 10 year old me finding it fun
Dec 2 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was an amazing family friendly feel good film from the colorful landscaping to the nostalgia to the wellmade plot and the beautiful animation and the clever nintendo easter eggs everything was on point just an amazingly wellmade movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,this was by far the best video game to movie to exist it paid so much homage to the super mario bros games mario vs kong kart racing etc etc etc ive seen it several times over and it doesnt get boring or dull  it has to be a phenomenal film for me to even watch it twice  or multiple times in the same year bravo to the developers for making an instant classic my favorite part was how the mario bros commercial had a thick italian accent and they played if off as it was just for the commercial noone wanted chris pratt to play the voice and he did it fantastic donkey kong however played by seth rogan with his dumb comical involved was the only downfall of the movie  donkey kong is tougher than that this is the only reason this movie doesnt get a 5 star rating other parts of the movie made up for that disappointment jack black did a decent job because hes great at singing and he tried his best to sound like a evil villian peach stole the show with her tough attitude protecting the wonderful mushroom kingdom the little details to how peach arrived at the mushroom kingdom to how we actually got to build our go kart looking forward to the sequel
Dec 1 2023,positive,ive been waiting for this movie my entire life it was worth the wait i loved it i hope there would be a sequel the animation was beautifully done well so much creativity and a colorful movie with a great origin story the details on the characters are perfect and beautiful and it has a perfect runtime of 1 hour and 32 minutes lets hope for april 3rd 2026 the super mario bros movie 2 will be again a great successful sequel video game at the box office
Dec 1 2023,positive,a fun movie  kids loved it  no political preachy identity politics
Nov 30 2023,positive,nice animation but story is a bit boring and standard casting is a hit  miss not a lot of good jokes but some good easter eggs for fans of the franchise overall pleasant experience watching though
Nov 30 2023,positive,so good great movie watch now on netfilx
Nov 30 2023,positive,might be a bit all over the place at times but good fun regardless so many references to the games its clear this was a passion project and not a quick cashgrab loved it
Nov 30 2023,positive,as a mario fan i thought this film was alright it including amazing refernences but the one thing we missed out was a good plot
Nov 28 2023,positive,significantly better than the live action movie from 30 years ago chris pratt was good at his version of marios voice my only complaint about this film was that it is to short 55 stars
Nov 28 2023,positive,for a nintendo fan this is just a great movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,video games have long been plagued by subpar adaptions of their materials but on their second attempt the mario bros save the day being on par with the likes of sonic and detective pikachu this film hits all the fun beats you would want from a mario film including plenty of fun moments for fans of the expansive franchise this also stays completely understandable and entertaining for anyone who checks it out with some interesting voice acting choices no one took you out of the film and everyone felt like great choices for this vibrant world wishing that it stood out more or took on more intriguing choices i was still walking away happy and hopeful for the future of this franchise and the possibilities to come
Nov 27 2023,positive,its alright but overrated in my opinion the easter eggs are cool though
Nov 27 2023,positive,a surprisingly awesome movie definitely seemed to paid tribute to as much as possible of the source material
Nov 27 2023,positive,having played mario kart growing up and having visited super nintendo world at universal studios hollywood i was excited for this film knowing that this film is likely geared towards fans  kids and adults alike  but mostly towards young super mario players i wasnt expecting oscarworthy plots or cinematography i watched this movie with the wonder of a child and i wasnt disappointed this movie had all the references the fans would want to see and of course easter eggs galore this movie was not going to have a deeply enriching plot because of course games are not novelas or epics like illiad or the odyssey movies based on games follow a simple heros journey plot good guy defeats bad guy and shows some thrilling action that mimics gameplay this movie hit all of those notes and more adults can enjoy this movie because of course theres some dark humor lumalee that our main characters respond to with wit and sarcasm i recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience the world of super mario and luigi with the wonder of a child
Nov 26 2023,positive,while i will admit that the plot is a bit rushed and it certainly isnt perfect this movie has all the fan service humor and fun that you would expect from a mario movie it has some of the most beautiful animation i have ever seen and the voice acting is pretty great as well i wasnt expecting chris pratt to be a good mario especially after the trailers and i can say that i was pleasantly surprised i think this would definitely be a better watch in theaters as when rewatching it at home it lost a lot of its magic but overall i would certainly recommend this film to anyone who was ever a fan of anything nintendo as i think that you will find something to love here
Nov 26 2023,positive,the critics are garbage i hate critics i laugh when critics die siskel was the first cant wait for the rest to follow sub human garbage
Nov 26 2023,positive,i had been waiting for this movie my whole life i had the highest expectations possible and somehow it surpassed my expectations d
Nov 26 2023,negative,if this is the future of cinema were fucked
Nov 25 2023,positive,its perfect in every way possible
Nov 25 2023,positive,fun and entertaining  overall great movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,when they announced this i knew this is going be a good movie if you a mario fan you should definitely watch it and on top of that look for some references and easter eggs in the movie its fun
Nov 24 2023,positive,this is some excellent animation work
Nov 23 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is the best movie ever see look like a video game
Nov 22 2023,positive,a fun and enjoyable movie it lacks in the story department but the sheer amount of references is sure to make any long time fan happy
Nov 22 2023,positive,i freaking loved this movie very good peach and mario was on point
Nov 22 2023,positive,i have played the mario games only several times in my life but this movie was so much better than i thought it would be wahoo
Nov 22 2023,positive,this movie is amazing and what us fans wanted great characters great production and awesome action great for families and friends im giving 10 out of 10
Nov 20 2023,positive, 7410      a fun faithful adaptation that isnt all that funny buttttttt is really fun grade b
Nov 20 2023,positive,this was the the greatest video game adaptation ive ever seen
Nov 19 2023,positive,you may see some movies based on videogames and you see this its an fantastic movie i saw in teathers
Nov 19 2023,negative,i was expecting a lot from this but it was too much for kids
Nov 18 2023,positive,this has got be illumination best movie of all time im not even joking bro i had a amazing time with this movie i highly recommend you watch this movie
Nov 18 2023,positive,9410  excellent if you want more grime and drama try the live action movie or alita battle angel
Nov 18 2023,neutral,there was so much potential and they failed to deliver what could have been a great film
Nov 18 2023,positive,its been a while since i watched the film but i loved the film so much im not as big of a nintendo fan as i used to be and i thought i wouldnt care about the film at all but i was wrong nintendos world translated into the big screen hit all the right notes    chris pratt being the voice of mario was kind of odd at first but he did a great job personally he hit the new yorker mario just right all the other voice actorsanya taylorjoy charlie day jack black and everyone elsedid a great job this is a great family movie and i would recommend it to anyone
Nov 17 2023,positive,the movie was awesome i really loved how they made it like the real video game but in the end princess peach doesnt kiss mario 
Nov 16 2023,positive,perfect for kids and adult who love game
Nov 15 2023,positive,87 overall fun movie with good voice acting before seeing this i wasnt excited at all because the voice acting of mario actually aint that bad overall a fun movie with great animation
Nov 15 2023,positive,it was a lot of fun and made me wish i was into mario more when growing up
Nov 14 2023,positive,greatest video game adaptations ever jack black was great as bowser chris was great and wished it was a bit longer
Nov 13 2023,positive,kids loved it fun story and great animation
Nov 13 2023,positive,it actually brought me back to my childhood and showing my little sister this movie and seeing her reaction was really special
Nov 13 2023,positive,wonderful movie definetly i recomend this masterpiece
Nov 13 2023,positive,wahoo what a great a movie the characters and plot were spoton and the scenes were spectacular most actors werent half bad and were right on queue i would definitely rate this as an awesome movie brings back so much memories that i could think of back in the day playing the super mario bros and new super mario bros series would love to watch it again
Nov 12 2023,positive,this movie was genuinely not what i was expecting from illumination of all studios its a decent movie to pass the time some of the jokes were funny aswell 710
Nov 12 2023,negative,in the realm of video games super mario has dominated consoles since the 8bit era there is no denying it its a fact whether you owned a piece of nintendo hardware and or played a super mario title super mario is engrained in pop culture if youre not familiar with the franchise then one can assure that youve been living under a rock even with that said the two entries  that i know of  within film have yet to stick the landing in any capacity though 93s was trippy  kind of cool  and aside from that matter for someone who went in not having high expectations i still walked out feeling underwhelmed in what is certainly a checklist of items expressions etc that stem from various iterations of the tentpole character if it were any other film the title would be crucified for its lack of explanation of things existing happening within the world it takes place however the studio and filmmakers know well enough that what they churned out is for the fans and the fandom is global in other words they can get away with it and absolutely did    on a more positive note this is by far illumination entertainments best work to date theyre known for the despicable me films minions and more from purely an animation perspective its wonderful to see a studio such as them get a bigger budget from start to finish its one of the best looking animated movies to date no bullshit its gorgeous    video game adaptations arent quite there with the transition from home console to the big screen and this movie doesnt further the case of it in a positive manner talking about it more would result in myself being a broken record because from this point on its all down hill    one more thing voice acting wasnt bad even chris pratt as mario wasnt bothersome and lumalee is my spirit animal
Nov 11 2023,positive,soooo good  im not the biggest fan of animated movies  i had high expectations as a super mario game fan  i was not disappointed   it was funny visually appealing  i think they included every little reference from the games  nice easy watch
Nov 11 2023,positive,it was a fun  fan movie and made me buy a new mario game mario wonder  also i want to give my thumbs up to the production and voice actors they did great work
Nov 10 2023,negative,boring shallow mostly boring
Nov 10 2023,positive,im shocked at how low the critics rating of this film is this film exceeded my expectations tenfold it was a great fun movie that kids and adults can enjoy its got great heart and tons of fun     i dont have too much more to say other than this film respected the source material and audience they made a great film and established a fun world im excited to see more films take place in
Nov 10 2023,positive,nostalgic hits the right points funny detail is amazing and even made me cry lou     i had low expectations due to my experience with the 90s movie and lately movies on general but this movie is so good and bowser wow i really hope this goes round again cause they did such a great job love it
Nov 10 2023,negative,the mario teaches typing game from the 1990s has a better script than this feature film  what a bummer
Nov 9 2023,neutral,the super mario bros movie is clearly made to be a popular blockbuster it succeeds in terms of appealing to a broad western audience with its bright colours silly humour and fastpaced action however as a longtime nintendo fan i am disappointed    while the source material is hardly shakespeare mario bros has enough backstory and lore for me to have solid ideas of what the characters are like this movie doesnt match that     sadly its a miss another not so stellar gaming movie
Nov 9 2023,positive,i liked all the references to the games and the story was good would recommend
Nov 9 2023,positive,even with its obviously wellknown story among casual and hardcore gamers alike the super mario brothers movie was a heck of a fun watch crampacked with everything from easter eggs to great humor for kids and adults alike if you love mario you will love this movie
Nov 9 2023,negative,the animation may be 3d but the writing is so flat its two dimensional i struggled to sit through the first thirty minutes of this dreck
Nov 9 2023,positive,the movie was near perfection as a nintendo fan the easter eggs were really good  the landscapes were b e a u t i f u l the only thing holding this back was the pacing which was too fast thx nintendo and illumination only their second mastapeece tbh
Nov 8 2023,positive,so colourful and thats about it
Nov 8 2023,positive,the best movie ever this movie came out on my birthday april 5th and my favorite character from the movie is princess peach because shes cool and also this movie is about two italian brothers whose job is plumbing and saving brooklyn this movie is based on a game the peaches song is cool and i like the part where luigi gets trapped in a cage and meets a luma and that movie is cool
Nov 8 2023,negative,visually the film is beautiful unfortunately it is lacking both in the areas of character and story the beginning of the film starts off strong as we follow mario luigi and their family in brooklyn this is the most endearing portion of the film as we see mario and luigis relationship with each other and their family once the duo enters the mushroom kingdom the film becomes a paint by numbers adventure story that is severely lacking in substance the film does not leave much room for character interaction between mario luigi or their newfound friends instead the film hastily jumps from set piece to set piece at a breakneck pace until the films conclusion the little time spent in each location is dedicated to enticing the viewers with shallow pop culture references rather than character or plot development even as a nintendo fan seeing mario drive on a rainbow road or hearing the gamecube jingle as someones ringtone is not enough to make for a compelling experience it is far from the worst viewing experience imaginable but it does little to obscure its nature as a sanitized corporate product with the goal of relying on game references and meme culture to carry the movie to success overall it makes for an experience that is tedious at best
Nov 7 2023,positive,this is a mustwatch movie i enjoyed the entire movie all the way through the experience the music and the story were very true to the games while i wouldve preferred luigi to accompany mario instead of princess peach i will say it added a good twist to the story and added a bit of mystery to the plot this was an amazing fan experience for all of the mario enjoyers to video game enthusiasts this movie was an easter egg and nostalgia trip that im sure everyone and their family can enjoy
Nov 7 2023,negative,the start had stupid and had unnecessary parts that just make absolute zero scene then half way through everything went by so fast a movie made for people with very little attention spans so perfect for their audience of childrens but if you other then 10 you wont enjoy it
Nov 6 2023,positive,mario is part of my childhood and this movie was awesome although it could have had a little more luigi and toad
Nov 6 2023,positive,its very nice and it has loads of easter eggs in it i can tell that illumination and nintendo put a lot of effort into it
Nov 6 2023,negative,didnt live up to any of my expectations boring and too long this movie should be called the princess peach movie
Nov 5 2023,positive,this is most definitely the best movie adaptation of a videogame it hold dozens of references to the games and stays familiar with them although its one of the most popular franchises with the same plot it has a very unique way of implementing it and stays original
Nov 5 2023,positive,a lot of people said that chris pratt wasnt a good casting choice for mario but i think he went above and beyond with the role and i love how it hints toward a sequel
Nov 5 2023,positive,as a fan of a the franchise i loved it obviusly the story was a little bit basic but the style the music and the memories when i was a kid really helped still a lil mad cause there werent daisy waluigi and wario
Nov 5 2023,positive,a colourful and sometimes visually disorienting film thats weighed down tremendously due to its paperthin plot and distractingly fast pace that doesnt allow for the character relationships it so desperately wants to display
Nov 5 2023,positive,if you like a fun childrens movie to take your child to to burn that time on a weekend this is a great movie for that its funny its entertaining and a very quality movie
Nov 5 2023,positive,low 710 all i can describe it as is a fun movie i was never bored which for an illumination movie is a miracle it can be very chilish and confusing especially for non mario fans but i dont think this movie is aimed for them which in my opinion is a much better aproach to a video game adabtation the voice acting is mostly solid with some amazing and some not so amazing genuilly this is just a fun and good movie for mario fans    ps the dog at the begining should have been poochie or the duck hunt dog  instead as its the only really illumination part of the movie
Nov 4 2023,positive,this movie is great very funny and enjoyable to watch i would watch this movie everyday if i could good job illumination
Nov 4 2023,positive,mario is the coolest guy ever
Nov 4 2023,positive,the movie shouldnt be taken so seriously as a super mario fan and 80s90s kid i couldnt stop smiling throughout the movie it ticks all the boxes for fans and brings so much nostalgia 
Nov 4 2023,negative,its the most hated movie ive ever seen not enough characters
Nov 4 2023,positive,really good and it has its own comedic and cartoonic style must see and they have put in alot of work in that film amazing movie for a holiday really made my day with my family mama mia
Nov 4 2023,positive,perfect movie for any mario fan
Nov 3 2023,positive,i wish that we had gotten the super mario bros movie back in 1993 instead of the liveaction dumpster fire we were given this would have been a dream come true back then because its a fun  faithful recreation of the nes games i grew up on however its obvious that this movie was made for kids its not as humorous as i had hoped it would be and there are a few shortcomings i cant really overlook as an adult and i dont think the rising generation will appreciate this adaptation like i would have because the games are so old its a great video game adaptation that arrived just a little too late
Nov 3 2023,positive,it alright better than most illumination movies
Nov 2 2023,positive,once again the glaring difference between critics and audience shows us that the world is pretty much done with movie critics and they offer little value to society as a whole  the mario movie was a fun blast into retrogaming nostalgia is it for everyone of course not what movie is will you laugh and have fun absolutely which is really all of us are asking for from movie studios fun and entertainment  the lore of mario has no real canon set in stone and it doesnt need it so lets just sit down and enjoy a new take on an old set of characters
Nov 1 2023,positive,all i can say is that it was a good movie scenes musics all perfect
Nov 1 2023,positive,this movie is an amazing story depth driven and fascinating movie that made me feel nostalgic yet still makes me feel new to mario series as it introduces so many perspectives of so many characters and situations that i felt amazed from this mario world it was just enough that i wasnt feeling over whelmed but also enough to the point that i wasnt under whelmed it was perfect the movie has bowser as the main villain and portrayed him very well and very early in the movie to declare who he was very quickly i loved mario and i love this movie just as much
Nov 1 2023,positive,a great tribute to fans filled with references and good for newcomers to the franchise  the voice cast is outstanding with perfect casting for all the characters but the movie is still horribly paced and has no real arcs or compelling characters it feels like its just jumping from action scene to action scene still worth a watch
Oct 31 2023,positive,while the movie is decent enough on its own i watched it as an entry in the mario series rather than as a feature film  and i loved it there is so much stuff put in for the fans the voice acting ranged from good enough to fantastic the animation is gorgeous and the action scenes were topnotch if you dont play mario you wont enjoy it as much as others but you probably will find something to enjoy but if you do than this is a mustsee
Oct 31 2023,positive,this is the dream of every nintendero and every child who ever met the plumber this movie is hilarious its soundratck is beautiful and is full of references to the plumber everywhere  that is fan service but that doesnt take away from the good things about it the movie  and i tell you something if you are not a fan of the plumber you will still enjoy it with your family and friends since it is full of adventure fun magic the only bad thing about this movie is that it feels very rushed which when see maybe you dont understand some things or you want to know more but you cant and it tries to put  to put references  to the game everywhere and it moves away from the plot that is  it replaces important things with references that make  you waste your time watching it and sometimes if you are not a fan its story can entangle you but without a doubt it is a love letter for the fans of nintendo  and the video game film industry
Oct 30 2023,positive,my girlfriend said the 1993 film was better and thats why i dont have one anymore
Oct 30 2023,positive,best video game movie i have ever seen it was great seeing my childhood in a movie like that
Oct 30 2023,positive,this movie was good nothing mega special about it id say but i did like all the references and jokes in it
Oct 30 2023,positive,a funny and entertaining film that not only children but everyone should watch
Oct 30 2023,positive,as someone who grew up with mario this movie is full of nostalgia the music was definitely my favourite part along side the voice acting the story is great it makes sense and stays consistent although it does seem quick at some parts overall i really liked this movie it is on my top 3 for this year
Oct 30 2023,positive,i really love this movie the voice acting is good
Oct 30 2023,positive,i liked all the little easter eggs about the in game world references and i liked the reference of the mario kart racing games as well as the peaches song what i didnt like about it was the hint of a sequel in the end as 99 of the time sequels are always worse
Oct 30 2023,positive,the mario movie was fun quirky  fantastic on it visually delivery great for fans  families to enjoy watching the origin of the mario brothers wish they had more time to follow certain storyline but overall a exciting hype 
Oct 29 2023,positive,common kids movie
Oct 29 2023,positive,fun movie for the whole family enjoyable jokes for most great voice actor choices even chris pratt as mario cringy at time but it makes up for that with its charming moments my only complaint is was everyone just fine with the fact that there was a literal talking mushroom gorilla and turtle in brooklyn at the end did the new yorkers taxesinsurance go up and property value go down after everyone realized theres a portal under the street where things may come through and cause significant property damage to the area did my taxes go towards the cleanup operation that probably had to take place after the final battle these are the real questions we should be asking about this film
Oct 29 2023,positive,best movie in existence i have waited for them to make an animated mario movie my whole life and this definitely lived up to my expectations
Oct 29 2023,positive,as a super mario bros fan the satisfying adaptation of a popular video game series leaves you wanting more of its charm and one more chance to experience the phenomenal world again
Oct 29 2023,positive,this film is fun to watch as well as being extremely faithful to the source material however a problem with this film for me is the fact that it is very rushed and doesnt give much space for things to develop better causing problems to be resolved in somewhat meaningless ways
Oct 29 2023,positive,an amazing tribute for super mario fans
Oct 29 2023,positive,the fnaf movie was better by far
Oct 29 2023,positive,when i first saw the movie all my aspects of it were all perfect the storyline the music the hidden details and of course the characters were all perfect super mario bros was a huge part of my life when i was a kid when i would play mario kart after 38 years of shigeru miyamoto had work in the franchise he finally makes a movie with everyones favorite italian plumber
Oct 29 2023,positive,very fun movie a great watch
Oct 29 2023,positive,it did have a basic story but everything other than that it is amazing best illumination movie ever made
Oct 29 2023,positive,critics are actually insane for not giving this movie a higher rating sure it does have its flaws and it was a bit rushed but come on man its mario this movie was just full of nostalgia and i enjoyed every second of it
Oct 29 2023,positive,absolutely loved it it exceeded all expectations and was exactly what i hoped it would be
Oct 29 2023,positive,the best movie in next super mario movie mario fans want to see wario and warluigi
Oct 29 2023,positive,its the type of movie that when your borde and have nothing to watch its a fun time and even tho its based of a game a family could have a fun time watching it and not everything about this movie is perfect but its a fun time
Oct 29 2023,positive,i love the super mario bros movie it is really amazing ive seen it 3 times and i know everything about this movie
Oct 29 2023,positive,just fan service with the wrong mario voice cough cough chris pratt
Oct 28 2023,positive,was not what i thought it was going to be wasnt bad wasnt great thats why i gave it a 3
Oct 28 2023,positive,great movie for fans it got many references for the games and relives the super mario experience for many peopleit also looks great  yes storyline isnt the greatest but its a videogame character movie for a wide demographic sincerely no one should ever listen to a professional movie reviewer theyre just corny people
Oct 28 2023,positive,my kids and i absolutely loved it
Oct 28 2023,negative,just play the video game
Oct 28 2023,positive,if you liked them as a kid you should like this movie they did a great job keeping the classic feelings of the pair while adding just enough modern touches to it to make it feel current
Oct 28 2023,positive,great adaptation of the mario franchise
Oct 28 2023,positive,the movie is amazing
Oct 28 2023,positive,loved the film and the hidden easter eggs from a fellow mario lover exactly what id expect from this sort of film not much of a storyline but the graphics and characters development make up for it
Oct 28 2023,positive,its the perfect videogame adaptation
Oct 28 2023,positive,this movie was so nostalgic and had great references throughout it was colourful amazing and had great character development and a lovely boss fight scene it was a master piece
Oct 28 2023,positive,has very obvious pacing issues and character development especially with toad   it has its references for the fans and decent visuals
Oct 28 2023,positive,maro did the jump good enough
Oct 27 2023,positive,i was a big mario fan since i was a kid and i love this movie so much
Oct 27 2023,positive,must see for every mario fan
Oct 27 2023,positive,the super mario bros is an adventure through nostalgia that together with a beautiful animation style that delights the eyes
Oct 27 2023,positive,the animators and writers did a good job with this project
Oct 27 2023,positive,great movie tones of nintendo references great for nintendo fans and gamers alike
Oct 27 2023,positive,as someone who played a handful of mario games and is a little older than the intended audience this is a great movie
Oct 27 2023,positive,im a huge fan of the games and this movie hits so hard   if you love mario watch it
Oct 27 2023,positive,so much potential wasted this movie was a kids movie it wasnt bad but it wasnt good it definitely does not deserve 1b at the box office respectfully disappointed
Oct 27 2023,positive,everything about this movie was nostalgic so much easter eggs in this movie
Oct 27 2023,positive,it was ok no the bust but good
Oct 27 2023,positive,super mario bros movie is a great adaptation giving fans nostalgia vibes through eastwr eggs and references and entertaining younger audience with its funny  and yet somehow a bit thrilling plot
Oct 27 2023,positive,i thought it was pretty good probably wouldve been better if someone else played mario instead of chris pratt i didnt like that mario didnt have an accent like there wasnt one at all
Oct 27 2023,positive,amazingly faithful with a bunch of outstanding references the only thing i would change is to get rid of the dog part and to maybe strengthen the plot just a little bit
Oct 27 2023,positive,i had a wonderful time watching this movie it was so faithful to the games and was i do have a little nitpick about the runtime it should have been 2 hours but who am i to judge anyways i love this movie very good 45
Oct 27 2023,positive,good movie with nice plot i was anticipating this movie but i was originally worried it wouldnt keep up 8485
Oct 27 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a dream come true for lifelong nintendo fans
Oct 27 2023,positive,a superb film which im sure anyone who doesnt overthink it can find enjoyment in it delivers an experience that really brings the world of the super mario games to life the animation itself is impeccable and whilst the writing the dialogue in particular is here and there throughout the film illumination and the rest behind this film have really outdone themselves in delivering a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end
Oct 26 2023,positive,the story may be simple but the whole movie is super perfect
Oct 26 2023,positive,a good piece of art from nintendo no more questions
Oct 26 2023,positive,when i heard that there was going to be a mario movie i jumped up in excitement and when i watched it in the movies me and my friends kept going on and on about all the references and easter eggs the movie had it was an amazing movie and i would definitely recommend watching it
Oct 26 2023,positive,i think this movie is for the mario fan my own con of the super mario bros movie is i need more luigi should be with mario because it call the super mario bros movie other than that the super mario bros movie is good
Oct 26 2023,positive,story was incomplete and couldve been reworked in some areas but overall an awesome video game movie blew my expectations out of the water
Oct 26 2023,positive,i was gonna give it a 4 because i genuinely liked it but my daughter 4 absolutely loved it   so it gets a 5
Oct 26 2023,positive,the movie can work on more plot than easter eggs but its a decent solid movie that everyone can enjoy
Oct 25 2023,positive,the critics must not be mario fans if they saw this film and thought it was bad
Oct 25 2023,positive,it was well done and fun to watch but its not quite what i was expecting i think i was visualizing it to be more visually reminiscent of the super mario 1 2  3 nintendo nes video games and it wasnt the mainstream rockpop music seemed a bit out of place and really had nothing to do with the super mario franchise whatsoever if anything those songs should have been replaced with a few more familiar sound effects from the video games
Oct 22 2023,neutral,yeah the stars are exactly what it was it passed the time ironically too fast
Oct 20 2023,positive,a pretty good movie i cant say five stars because this movie is not perfect but maybe like 78810
Oct 19 2023,positive,i liked this movie its fun
Oct 19 2023,positive,great movie highly recommended a 
Oct 17 2023,positive,sick movie masterpiece of a movie if you think the mario movie is rubbish well your opinion is wrong and invalid it is true perfection
Oct 17 2023,positive,its given to the best movies ever wahoo
Oct 16 2023,positive,i think this movie was really cute i enjoyed the story even though it was very simple to be fair i believed it was catered for a younger audience i enjoyed the plot and found it a good idea to have the brothers be from the real world the animation was amazing and there was not one point in the movie where i was bored watching it there was always something to look at and it was always beautiful i cant talk much about the franchise as i am not a die hard fan but i could tell there were easter eggs in the movies that was meant for them even not being a huge fan of the games i really enjoyed the movie the acting was phenomenal everyone pulled their weight and it made it that much more enjoyable to watch i will say the gold star goes to jack black as bowser because he just blew me away with his portrayal he was not only a big scary villain but a person with a soul that just wanted to be loved by peach he definitely went the wrong way about it  i think all things considered it was a really good animated movie and i would watch a sequel
Oct 15 2023,positive,it was fine  definitely a crowd pleaser and popcorn flick  they also made the right move in making this a childrens movie primarily  i felt they did not make the best use of the mythos in the super mario world  but they can do that in the future  but it felt more like a good tv show rather than a movie which was my only problem with it  its also not very funny unless maybe youre a 6 year old  but it was entertaining and i can understand why this made so much money  the suits made the right moves on this one albeit its soso overall    grade  76100 c
Oct 15 2023,positive,fun and nostalgic very enjoyable
Oct 14 2023,positive,absolutely awesome movie im gonna watch it again for 7 weeks
Oct 14 2023,positive,solid film great watch for all ages
Oct 13 2023,positive,i was excited when i found out this movie was out but didnt set my hopes too high just in case i was left disappointed but i was not disappointed in the slightest bit this movie has been on repeat in our house for the last couple weeks now my children love it as much as i do its really nice being able to share part of my childhood nostalgia with my children
Oct 13 2023,positive,the movie is amazing in anyway even though everything is happening in one second its still a good movie the animation is great and make something easter eggs form previous mario games 910 go watch it if you want to have a good time at the movies
Oct 11 2023,positive,one of the best video game adaptations ever made although the plot itself is pretty meh still enjoyed this movie though also for me its not really one of the greatest movies of all time its a pretty great movie id recommend it if you grew up playing mario also the rainbow road and the brooklyn fight scenes heavily carried for me so did nostalgia too again i still enjoyed it though
Oct 10 2023,positive,it manages to stay faithful to the work but still manages to overly play to a simple infantile audience it does what it says on the cover but fails to fully develop its story and rather remain as a kids babysitter movie that the parents would least likely wish to indulge in
Oct 10 2023,positive,id like to say that im surprised at the low score from this site but at tis point we all know that the audience score is usually the one to trust its clear that the movie is aimed at people who enjoy or have already enjoyed mario bros as part of that targeted audience myself i am surprised at how well the game references were placed and its full of them throughout the whole movie i had thoughts before watching it of how will they manage to transport some of those games actions that dont make much sense in real life into a story like this and i felt theyve done an incredible job placing all those elements together into an enjoyable story that makes sense if you are a mario fan you are guaranteed to enjoy this movie babes xxx
Oct 9 2023,positive,brb gonna scout the internet for all the easter eggs
Oct 8 2023,positive,i was surprised i ended up enjoying this movie so much i would recommend to it
Oct 8 2023,positive,the critics need to log off go outside and interact with humans again the ratings gap proves yet again how out of touch they are with mainstream audiences the vast majority have rejected your dystopian ideology and the horrible films and shows that go along with it you wont find no agenda here just good ole fashioned wholesome fun that doesnt take its self too seriously can only hope more movies follow suit
Oct 6 2023,positive,surprisingly good saw it the day after its release
Oct 6 2023,positive,interesting charcters saw it the day after it released took 3 hours for the screen projector to work
Oct 6 2023,positive,was the most perfect thing ive ever watched cant wait for the 2nd one
Oct 6 2023,positive,awesome i had a blast from start to finish this is one of the greatest that both nintendo and illumination have ever done since the animation was wonderful and astonishing the easter eggs are great and my childhood came back to me i am now with the audience side one of my other favorite movies liked by audiences is where the crawdads sing first venom movie and bullet train i like this movie so much cant wait for the sequel screw the critics next time make it longer it felt rushed
Oct 6 2023,positive,an animation nugget theres nothing more to say or youd have to write a novel to explain why this film is so beautiful    perhaps i should point out however that the audience is fairly targeted and wont necessarily suit people who dont know the mario games although its not particularly complicated to watch for those who know nothing about the license
Oct 6 2023,positive,this one is for my one and only true love  princess peach  peach youre so cool  and with my star were gonna rule  peach understand  im gonna love you til the very end  peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches  peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches  i love you oh  peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches  peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches  i love you oh  mario luigi and a donkey kong too  a thousand troops of koopas couldnt keep me from you  princess peach at the end of the line  ill make you mine oh  peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches  peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches  i love you oh  peaches peaches peach peach that is all i can say
Oct 5 2023,positive,the greatest movie from illumination for a while and i would recommend for those who like mario
Oct 5 2023,positive,i grew up playing the super mario bros games so this was a trip down memory lane  it was fun and very refreshing in comparison to todays mostly politically motivated propaganda disguised as entertainment
Oct 3 2023,positive,ive heard a lot of criticism from multiple sources around the voice acting but once you realize that those decisions were part of the plot it makes the movie far more interesting i think its a very cute and fun watch would have loved to see it in 3d or 4dx
Oct 1 2023,negative,just the nostalgie and great animations but the story is not incredible i was waiting for something more original and creative
Oct 1 2023,positive,fantastic movie chris pratt was a swing and a miss but the animation was flawless and it was incredibly faithful to the nintendo world
Oct 1 2023,positive,great with a lot of easter eggs and a lot of fantastic music
Oct 1 2023,positive,all my three kids used to play super mario bros games and two of them played them a lot when they were younger so this movie was kind of a mustsee movie for us    for myself  this felt very much like a movie made for super mario bros fans and less for the general audience    the characters the completely illogical platform jumping everywhere and the rather childish story are certain to appeal to younger people still playing the game or those that grew up with the mario bros games    for me though the movie was ranging from okayish to sometimes cringe worthy especially the scenes with bowser starting to sing ouch my ears are still hurting    the best parts of the movie was when they entered the ape kingdom that was quite fun and so was the car chase on the rainbow road    the rest of the movie was for me personally rather forgettable not bad just not that good that said it is not really a bad movie either the rotten rating on woke tomatoes is entirely undeserved
Oct 1 2023,positive,light hearted vibrant film i couldnt wipe the grin off my face watching this
Sep 30 2023,positive,greatok though my only problem with this movie is the story like it shouldve been much more of an origin story
Sep 30 2023,neutral,overrated overhyped i personally think that this movie was over hyped a bit i expected the story to be a bit better the story line was very simple i think although the animations were good 510
Sep 29 2023,positive,how can you not have fun with this movie is it a super rich story that keeps you enthralled and deeply emotionally involved no its just fun its what i go to the movies fortoo forget about the bad crap thats going on in my life and in the world and just enjoy myself for a little bit so i can see something that touched my childhood so greatly on the big screen without being changed without being race swapped without deviating from the source material so much it was unrecognizable and not fun thank you for setting out to make a movie about the source material and sticking to it cannot wait for the sequel
Sep 29 2023,positive,fans of the video game series will enjoy the super mario bros movie as a whole because it is lighthearted and entertaining
Sep 29 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie a lot more than i expected to it had great humor and a lot of awesome references to the games jack black as bowser may have been one of the best casting choice of all time
Sep 28 2023,positive,an excellent experience filled with easter eggs from practically every mario game sure to please even the youngest fans couldve been longer with a more interesting plot but overall a solid movie illumination and nintendo have made something really special a crowd pleaser but clearly not a critic pleaser
Sep 27 2023,positive,perfectly serviceable but its the princess peach movie
Sep 27 2023,positive,the movie was highly anticipated because it almost always used the formula of its video games but at least 40 is original
Sep 27 2023,positive,the adventure of mario bros is so awesome and cool
Sep 26 2023,positive,amazing no wonder it has beaten so many records
Sep 26 2023,positive,this film is so good for new watchers and olds followers of mario bros its just perfect
Sep 25 2023,positive,the super mario movie 2023 is the best 2023 movie that i ever watch
Sep 25 2023,negative,not sure how this movie made that much money and princess peach just looked weird and the story sucked
Sep 24 2023,positive,pretty good movie and i loved the easter eggs and game references good easy watch for families  anyone who playedplays the games
Sep 24 2023,positive,this is great and its a lesson that never listen to main stream critics hollywood has crashed and burned and gone to a halt due to their woke criteria  expectations these snowflake clowns are the reason all these writers and actors are going broke go woke go broke    super mario is very fulfilling weather for little kids that dont know what it is or to the older people that grew up playing the game    we need to stop listening to the mainstream clowns and support such traditional movies
Sep 24 2023,positive,i dont know if the audience and critics watched the same movie but this was simply a fun time the cast was hilarious and the animation was great timeless
Sep 23 2023,positive,this movie is one off the beast movies ever 1005
Sep 22 2023,positive,that was amazing this movies story so fun its just like dream movie
Sep 22 2023,positive,just a casual mario fan here but even i thought the movie was fun the story is good pretty much follows the video games and the animated cartoons the cast overall was pretty spot on jack black as bowser though was the stand out theres some funny moments and i enjoyed the fights smash brothers is my favorite mario game mario kart being a close second so anytime the movie payed homage to those games i loved it a few nit picks i thought the songs were out of place not the score but the actual songs like acdc didnt fit this movie at all also seth rogen as donkey kong was a bit weird overall though solid enough 
Sep 22 2023,positive,this is an experience that the super mario franchise will never forget
Sep 22 2023,positive,its better than that 1993 box office flop and its the bestest film illumination made
Sep 22 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is incredible lots of humor and great action sequences right from the games and tons of easter eggs definitely a movie must watch
Sep 21 2023,positive,odd casting choices but overall a fun time with nice characters who unfortunately have the same motives as a cardboard cutout but you can get swept away by the joy of the references for a good time in the theater
Sep 21 2023,positive,growing up as a super mario fan my whole life this was a pleasant experience for me in the cinema a great watch for the full family  beautiful animation on show as well as perfectly hitting the tones with the super mario music maybe ignore the pop songs however the previous concerns for the voice casting are quickly forgotten about other than seth rogen as donkey kong as he sounds exactly like seth rogen  the plot is simple and safe works well enough for marios animated debut to the theatre   the super mario bros movie is a great homage to the video games and brought out a variety of feelings that i have had my full life playing the video games
Sep 20 2023,positive,this movie was amazing illumination did a good job with this
Sep 20 2023,positive,a fun experience for any nintendo fan or not a nintendo attempt at a moral plot would have ruined it im glad they stuck a simple plot
Sep 20 2023,positive,it was a pretty good appropriation but just didnt feel how it shouldve
Sep 19 2023,neutral,with a short run time the only great thing about this movie was jack black as bowser
Sep 19 2023,positive,this movie is perfect i loved the music i love the casting everything was perfect as a mario fan this is the perfect movie for me
Sep 18 2023,positive,probably the best animated movie that i saw this year the movie have a great pacing beautiful animation nice jocks a ton of reference to the games a simple story without pretensions maybe to simple for some people but guys its super mario not kafka  and there is jack black 
Sep 18 2023,positive,definitely worth seeing but not going on the favorites list
Sep 18 2023,positive,stays very faithful and accurate to the series funny moments  great action the voice acting was good by not great the 80s songs were a little strange
Sep 18 2023,positive,a great adaptation with tons of fun references that make up for the subpar plot
Sep 18 2023,positive,this was a great fun movie for kids and adults no emotional manipulation no trying to send a political message just great fun and the shorter runtime is also great as kids can actually watch it from start to finish
Sep 18 2023,positive,i mean this movie is great must i even say anything its official for mario and its great
Sep 18 2023,positive,without seth rogan as dk this would get a 5     all around great movie excited to see where they go next
Sep 18 2023,positive,amazing movie with great animation and comedy  i questioned why wario didnt show up in movie
Sep 17 2023,negative,the movie was just a basic movie animation was pretty good
Sep 17 2023,positive,filled with nostalgia smooth crossover between the worlds and very enjoyable and watchable
Sep 17 2023,positive,first movie that i have seen based on a video game that i have really liked and lightyears better than the first ie 1993s mario film also a very welcome relief to see a current film that is actually good considering the bad quality of most films in the past few years
Sep 17 2023,positive,i watched it for 60 seconds very good
Sep 16 2023,positive,whilst the film doesnt exactly break any new cinematic ground it does tick all the boxes of a solid family film and is undeniably very well made the voice acting is top notch the cgi is excellent the music has plenty of mario flourishes and the film is wellpaced with plently of light nintendo type humour it captures the essence of mario without succumbing to fan service with tons of stuff for the fans but care taken to avoid excessive character worship sonic 1 and 2 showed that it is possible to make an enjoyable movie of a video game super mario shows that sonic wasnt a fluke well deserving of its 1bn plus box office haul
Sep 15 2023,positive,this is awsome best video game adaptation aside from sonic
Sep 14 2023,positive,this movie was the greatest thing for anyone to watch its better the sequals in star wars
Sep 14 2023,positive,great watch and its filled with lots of references
Sep 14 2023,positive,one of the best movies of 2023 next to oppenheimer much better than barbie
Sep 13 2023,positive,its not a movie for critics its a movie for children and mario fans theres basically no plot and the incredibly basic plot is an excuse for action scenes there really isnt much to this movie its just action set pieces with a flimsy plot but its a fun movie and thats it 710 incredible for illumination
Sep 12 2023,positive,the critics have seen another movie i think this was a good movie
Sep 12 2023,positive,i think the movie was great as a super fan of mariodonkey kong bowser and all the other creatures i love how they incorporated all the games into the movie i dont appreciate how rotten tomatoes opinion is usually rottten and doesnt give it more credit who ever reviews for them lacks interest in things that are interesting id like to rate rotten tomatoes 2 stars for their lack of taste in many movies most find favorable
Sep 12 2023,positive,its pretty much exactly what youd expect tons of nostalgia generic plot memberberries everywhere it was a solid watch but i think it could have been better if they took more risks and made it more memorable as it stands it was a decent watch that will likely fade into obscurity until the inevitable sequel voice acting by jack black and charlie day stood out as excellent
Sep 11 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a fun and entertaining movie that generations of diehard mario fans will enjoy the casting in this movie i thought was perfect as i was skeptical about chris pratt voicing mario but after seeing the movie i honestly love the idea anya taylorjoy as peach jack black as bowser and charlie day as luigi are three voice castings that were just perfect from the casting announcements the scenery and cinematography within this movie was so gorgeous i really felt nostalgia towards the beginning when mario and toad walked up to the castle straight out of super mario ds this movie just unlocked so many deep memories from my childhood that filled me with warmth the big thing that this movie lacks on is the story the story within this movie feels like a generic fish out of the water type of story similar to narnia or the smurfs movie to name a few i felt like there wasnt any depth to just that and they didnt build on the story either to develop a bond between mario and peach and i think a part of that has to do with the short runtime there wasnt a lot of time to build the story up and the writers took the time to make this movie filled with nostalgia and easter eggs instead overall the super mario movie is a great time to relive some good nostalgia to see these beloved characters on the big screen mixed with some entertaining comedy and action but other than that the story was really disappointing and felt like there was no thought put into it whatsoever b
Sep 11 2023,negative,an entertaining romp through the super mario universe buoyed by jack blacks delightful voice acting though the traditional damselindistress role has evolved into a more empowered character bowser remains a persistently troublesome antagonist embodying an unwelcome sense of entitlement to female affection
Sep 11 2023,negative,the movie is almost empty without references on games
Sep 11 2023,positive,finally a visualy good looking exciting  funny show without any woke bsh1t simpler good old times when a show was strictly entertaining and for everyone hope to see more shows like this in the future the art and style is a 1010 for me
Sep 11 2023,positive,i honestly didnt mind this movie i went in with high expectations because of the fact that hey its the mario movie but if i sit back and think about how the movie was without all my high expectations its decent chris pratt couldve tried a bit harder and i was a bit nervous about the jack black pick but ive come to find out that jack black actually tried harder than chris pratt for this movie
Sep 11 2023,positive,very funny movie good color and attractive plots 3d effect is impressive i do like it
Sep 10 2023,positive,this movie was okay but i found that they needed to add more to the overall story
Sep 10 2023,positive,exceeded all my expectations as a lifelong fan of nintendo this was fun from beginning to end lots of laughs cant give it five stars because the choice of the worst chris as mario is sad
Sep 10 2023,positive,dont listen to the rotten tomatoes reviews they are hypocrites  this movie is sensational as proved by sales with no vitue signaling  just good old fashioned comedy and fun  you will find people like me who are generally quiet are starting to speak out and stand  against the hypocrisy i decided to look st some of the critics and all i can say is you have no talent for this at a guess you reviewers would like all the typical virtue signaling crap that the majority have starrting taking a stand against and you cannot handke it one of the profile photos looks exactly like a cranky old person with a grudge against fun and anything or anyone who has a different opinion  know this the majority are standing up and saying go back in your hole you forgettable pathetic people
Sep 9 2023,positive,great movie im  not sure whats with these critics and their harsh reviews im thinking theyre just a bunch of old people who never played the game or just cracky now a days but movie was great i love it and even the audience reviews agree on that note i wouldnt put much thought to these critics reviews really not sure what makes them so special anyway just look at the actual audience reviews   thanks   thanks
Sep 9 2023,positive,this was a fun family movie it had an engaging story and it was filled with humor and adventure parts of it will be very nostalgic for 80s and 90s kids i think its current audience score of 95 is a little too generous  but it was definitely good
Sep 9 2023,positive,it took nearly four decades one spectacular liveaction misfire and dozens of other failed video game adaptations to learn from but none of it went to waste illumination and nintendos super mario bros movie finally gives the most iconic character in gaming the onscreen adventure hes always deserved benefitting immensely from the endless creativity of the innumerable game developers artists and musicians whove made the mario franchise a pop culture juggernaut the super mario bros movie rockets along with the momentum of a bullet bill exploding out of a cannon the mushroom kingdom is realized with incredible detail and reverence and not even a paper mariothin plot can keep the magic of the games from being lost along the way    the super mario bros movies setup is dead simple while on a plumbing job underneath brooklyn brothers mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day are sucked into the mushroom kingdom through a warp pipe and become embroiled in king bowsers jack black plans to steal the super star which would give him the power to take over the toadfilled domain of princess peach anya taylorjoy marios cheepcheepoutofwater journey hits all the predictable beats of the warrior from another world narrative but decades of mario games ensure codirectors aaron horvath and michael jelenic teen titans go have an infinite well of wild scenarios and iconography to pull from to stage inventive action moments especially once marios gotten a handle of how to properly fly with a tanooki suit  then mario gets the super star with luigi and i love it boom  i want to see the mario movie 2
Sep 9 2023,positive,nostalgic funny witty the songs and visuals just took took be back to every gameboy game wii and switch game such a good movie
Sep 8 2023,neutral,its not the worst movie to watch in cinemas wouldnt watch it at home tho
Sep 7 2023,negative,the beginning of the movie is maybe even okay but the second mario is on screen i begin to writhe in agony its not even ironically fun its genuinely terrible
Sep 7 2023,positive,this brought back so many memories and was perfectly executed  so impressed with this movie 
Sep 7 2023,positive,great movie i have seen it a dozen times my girls watched it twice today alone
Sep 7 2023,negative,i enjoyed the first half especially the characters of peach and bowser jack black was allowed to do his thing which always makes for good entertainment at best the super mario bros movie is a visually well rendered bringing to life of the mario video games at worst it feels simply like a train ride through a series of images presented to evoke nostalgia for specific mario game characters i found the second half of the film to be too mindlessly action heavy and boring
Sep 6 2023,positive,maybe theyre could have been more to the story but for a video game movie adaptation it was great and seeing the backlash for the cast itself this live definitely passed expectations
Sep 6 2023,positive,i do jot understand everything i need to play again the game and back to the theater
Sep 6 2023,positive,the is the hyperactive adhd fever dream of my life i feel like a kid having a sugar rush all over again and its not a bad feeling    i think the one thing that i appreciate about this most is that it doesnt waste your time there is zero downtime in this film it is constantly prepared to move from one point to the next without any delay    the film is very stylish actionpacked and full of fun everything it should have been its really hard to find criticism here it knows what it is does exactly what it wants to do and is perfectly shameless just a fun silly adaption    the literal only downside to the entire film is the bizarre casting of chris pratt but thats been harangued about endlessly so theres not point in yammering more about it besides that and the fact that the film isnt exactly one filled with substance its otherwise a joyous hollywood romp and frankly thats all i wanted good stuff
Sep 6 2023,positive,i waited five years of my life to watch this movie and i loved it the only problem was that the movie was going to fast and the overdose of references
Sep 5 2023,positive,such a great and fun movie  full of life and nostalgic scenes
Sep 5 2023,negative,for an illumination film i was unimpressed it had a weak script and seemed to focus on the vfx rather than the story and felt like i was tripping on acid while watching it i found it unamusing and a lot of the music placement seemed a bit odd why play takeonme when driving to donkey kongs fathers palace it just seemed they were playing on notstalgia from the 1980s
Sep 5 2023,positive,this movie was fun to see with friends and enjoy some nostalgia and the hilarious performance by jack black was great the only problem is the plot and overall story was kinda shallow it felt like an ip cash grab with the mario name seems like something disney would do to make a shallow movie to get money out of it this was a great movie for kids but as an adult i might watch it again in my life with pals my parents or my future kids otherwise i am content with only seeing it once
Sep 5 2023,negative,chris pratt is a terrible mario and the pacing is bad character motivation is sub parr and the music is 5050 at best
Sep 4 2023,positive,so good i would watch it again
Sep 4 2023,positive,for about 9 years i have been a been a big mario fan when this movie was announced i was so excited about it and here i am about 3 years later writing a review this movies animation is stunning it is not as ground breaking like movies such as spiderverse but for a movie made entirely with cg animation it is noticeable the amount of effort and detail put into the movie including lots of easter eggs i can spot a new one each experience i have watching it in the game versions mario and friends dont have a specific personality so watching this movie reimagine these characters in a unique way was great each character was great but most characters lack in development and are presented out of the blue now at the time of writing this marios voice actor confirmed his retirement so this movie doesnt impact the franchise at all for the most part the acting was great it had a unique feel in a good way they gave these characters an extra boost of personality finally my only true problem with the movie was a lack in plot after seeing first two trailers nintendo set up an expectation for a recruitment story involving lots of familiar faces yoshis kongs etc this was sort of the plot but in shorter terms unfortunately lots of the things we were expecting was and shown was crammed into a short montage however this movie in time become a classic to me and as a huge mario fan this is impossible for me to dislike its worth a few watches every now and then and for mario fans this is most likely its in your top 10s 4 stars   its worth a sequel
Sep 4 2023,positive,im honestly not sure how this couldve been better this tickled us in all the right places incredible
Sep 4 2023,positive,good movie is a family movie
Sep 3 2023,negative,great animation to an unfunnny paintbynumbers story so many wasted comic talents in this but only the demented star is truly funny
Sep 3 2023,positive,ignore the rotten rating by the top critics as a kid i played mario on the original super nintendo so to see that world turn into thisso cool this was a beautifully animated and fun movie hope they make more
Sep 3 2023,positive,fire they did amazing 
Sep 3 2023,positive,such a great movie ugh watching this movie brought me back to my childhood so much back to the wii days when i would play super mario bros peaches by bowser so iconic added that song to my playlist there is no better bowser then jack black character choices were just so spot on 10000000 suggest anyone who loves mario to watch this movie such a family movie so amazing
Sep 2 2023,positive,this movie really hit right in the nostalgia lots of hidden easter eggs that only a gamer would see animation was superb
Sep 2 2023,positive,awesome movie brings back so many memories of when i was a kid awesome from start to finish    ps rotten tomatoes critics are just mad its not woke enough
Sep 2 2023,positive,so i base my rating on my kids enjoyment watching a kids film they were in wrapped awe the whole time even my youngest they laughed my oldest got references and they talked my ear off about it the whole way home exactly what kids should be like after a kids movie so 5 stars    as an adult it was a good yarn i agree its not exactly cranial ly stimulating but thats not the point of these movies it was bright amusing and i enjoyed it to just switch off from the week and relax
Sep 2 2023,positive,this was like a dream ive had as a child that i never realized i had if that makes sense the animation was supreme as well as the casting for the voices and the whole setup of the film i didnt plan to watch this so i didnt have any expectations but im so fucking glad i ended up watching this movie because it was pure magic i didnt play as much videogames as a child so i wasnt a super fan of the mario bros franchise but when i did play both mario bros and mario kart were two of my personal faves and just realizing that story on the big scree was somewhat refreshing and incredible to experience of course it was a childrens movie and it wasnt that big of a deal compared to more mature and astonishing productions but nonetheless i had such a joy watching it all and it all just felt right i mean i never knew the story behind the videogame and to now understand it it was just the cherry on top again i didnt know i needed the pace was fast and catchy the characters were cute and that fucking peach song was so sticky my favorite part was when they made and took their karts through that rainbow because it was like playing the game and it somehow hit of course there was a happy ending and the message it gave the movie about brotherhood and bravery was just an awesome way to teach children how to behave with others i dont even know what im saying anymore but hey i just loved the movie had a blast of a time watching it and it was just très magnifique pour regarder 
Sep 2 2023,neutral,the animation is very good but the movie is a ok movie
Sep 1 2023,negative,really bad movie and story
Sep 1 2023,positive,great movie watched it in 4xd and was blown away 
Sep 1 2023,negative,it was fine but even for someone who played the games i didnt find it to be quite as entertaining as id hoped
Sep 1 2023,negative,this was the worst cash grab ive ever seen
Sep 1 2023,positive,i have no idea why critics didnt like the movie a good view of the past i like the all the characters specially princess peach and bowser jack black made a beautiful work love princess peach song hundreds of references to the games a movie for all people adults kids very kind and entertaning
Sep 1 2023,positive,had so much fun watching this with the kids we had a blast in the theater   i also think its hilarious how blatantly out of touch the official rotten tomatoes critics are so obviously elitist film enthusiasts that cant tell the difference between a movie made for pure fun and a story made for messaging dont trust this paid critics they are a symbol of the real rot in so many of todays institutions their incentives are in the wrong place not surprised
Sep 1 2023,negative,ive never been a fan of mario but i sure did play it during my childhood in my super nintendo so i had a little bit of faith in this movie which did it poorly its a movie to pass the time and very childish the plot is weak the songs are annoying and some of them makes no sense such as take on me being played at the kongs kingdom for no reason at all the jokes are weak princess peach is just a walking stereotype of a girlboss overall shes annoying but i guess it does the job of being a watchable and profitable movie that nobody but mario fans will remember after a while
Aug 31 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was too good to call trash or bad but i was one of people who enjoy this movie to be honest illumination was a bad choice and i would rather dreamworks not because they have some best movies but because bowser need to be more of a villain in the mario movie but still i love this character but part from that i dont hate this movie as i watched it so much i lose count
Aug 31 2023,positive,its a perfect wahoo
Aug 31 2023,positive,i felt like this was a love letter in a movie to millennials that grew up playing mario my wife and i were laughing so hard watching this movie and loved all the references and little things in it absolutely great there was no political stuff that took away from it just good clean fun in a high quality format that really added to the movie the only thing missing was more yoshi but maybe if they do a number 2 loved it this is a 1010 movie the music the voice acting the animation story it was all perfect can you make other movies of the games we grew up on this good please
Aug 31 2023,positive,trust the audience score its great
Aug 30 2023,positive,it was amazing great charactersgreat build up and story and also had a lot of references other mario games
Aug 30 2023,positive,loved all of the easter eggs knew every reference 1010 best video game movie ever made
Aug 30 2023,positive,great my kids love the movies fun and entertainments
Aug 30 2023,negative,the movie only had 1 fight and the fight was only 10 minutes long at least
Aug 29 2023,positive,voice acting from the likes of chris pratt and seth rogen is hilarious the plot is solid and make sense various aspects from the mario games carry over well and overall i had a fun time
Aug 29 2023,negative,the reason why people like this movie is probably because of the reputation of video game based shows and movies being the bottom of the barrel in terms of quality when its not bad in terms of genuine quality people feel like its a good product when its clearly subpar i will admit the little references sprinkled in here and there are kinda fun and the visuals are pretty but these things are definitely not enough to make this movie good first of all the plot its generic and boring the story was definitely the worst part of this movie it drags on and on and ends predictably and safely the dialogue is at best boring and at worst hard to listen to the characters are boring and disappointing the voice actors werent that bad but werent good either they were at this weird middle ground that you dont wanna be in for this medium the needledrop choices were also very odd and not fitting in the slightest overall this is a bad movie that is not worth watching
Aug 29 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie  7510 nostalgia takes the forefront here as the mario bros take the lead and finally get their own proper adventure and though the story is pretty meh to be honest its a movie that rides on its visuals and its ability to invoke and remind you the legendary lore of the mario series theres so much stuff theyve shown and tapped into in this movie and thats what you go to watch to be frank its not a movie youre gonna go see for the plot no this is a movie that makes you smile from all the characters being brought to life and the locations being shown the voice acting is decent enough and though the story is whatever you cant help but feel enjoyment from seeing the gang going on the adventure purely fun cause of the nostalgia
Aug 29 2023,positive,pretty fun watch it is a kids movie though so dont expect much more than that  princess was a baddie tho fr
Aug 29 2023,positive,best animated movie thus far
Aug 29 2023,negative,lack of humor poor script
Aug 29 2023,positive,honestly whoever wanted to make this movie is absolutely brilliant brings back so many memories man that fact this movie made over a billion dollars is not surprising and it makes me glad a lot of people like it now because when the first trailer came out the chris pratt mario wasnt very amusing but as usual he grows on you like any other character and why wouldnt he i love chris pratt despite marios voice being replaced i also did notice charles martinet was still in there but he played as marios dad and another guy its good that he had a cameo but everything else in the movie is outstanding not to mention jack black playing as bowser which he did an amazing incredible job on by the way luigis actor was totally flawless toads actor was lit and peachs voice was utterly phenomenal and then theres donkey kong whos played by seth rogen    this movie has so many references from all the mario games for instance the penguins and eel from super mario 64 the raccoon and cat mario from mario 3d landworld and god knows what else i totally recommend seeing this awesome fantastic excuse of a masterpiece  i mean if this movie is not iconic then honestly i dont what is
Aug 28 2023,positive,the nintendo nes makes an appearance and i also heard the nintendo gamecube jingle as a ringtone even the game punch out makes an appearance as punch out pizza thats what i love about this movie 
Aug 28 2023,positive,fun movie enjoyed all the easter eggs from nintendo
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was really good movie for the hold family to enjoy
Aug 28 2023,positive,it was a fun time all around we saw it in theaters and still rented it twice at home
Aug 28 2023,positive,weve come a long way from the 1993 version to this they finally did it they made a good super mario movie this does have several issues that hold it back first is that a lot of scenes that contain winks and nods and are faifthful to the video game source material make no sense at times unless you have played a couple of the games the blue shell why the camera cuts to 2d the mushroom powerups racing on rainbow carts none of that really makes sense unless your a fan and its never really explained what is tons and tons of easter eggs and tip of the hats to source material ends up becoming major parts of scenes constantly this goes hand in hand with the second issue that this film has a frantic pacing to it and keeps throwing tons of new stuff at lighting speed and never slows down after the first 15 minutes it can be a bit much but its clearly made for fans of the game and little kids who will like this a lot thats the other marginal issue this movies style is all over the place at times mixing classical music the mario songs 80s hits and cinematic together is fun but its all over the place same with the camera angles as well which can get a bit much at times with how much variety there is this needed to slow down a bit and be a bit more sensical at times that being said it works and works well the voice acting is solid all around with peach and bowser being the stnadouts with really good performances aside from that its fun colorful not scary like the 93 one it makes sense everyone is likeable and its funny as well and mario doesnt put his face in a womens cleavage this has a much better understanding of what makes mario loved and is a love letter to mario as well anyone who loves mario or any voice actors in this will like this a lot
Aug 28 2023,positive,as a mario fan i loved this movie i think this is probably illuminations best movie yet though this movie could be more its already perfect
Aug 28 2023,positive,such a cute cartoon with a happy ending great characters
Aug 28 2023,positive,my kiddos really enjoyed the movie
Aug 28 2023,positive,i saw in 4dx regal the chair vibration is bit too much sometimes and the other effects arent enough
Aug 28 2023,positive,loved the quality sound the music the sesting was very comfy as the reserved seating very smooth transaction the food line busy to be expected but 3 of us meaning different guests my being 1 of the 3 waited over 30 minutes for our pretzels due to them given to others in line that didnt order them
Aug 28 2023,positive,i loved the movie it was so awesome
Aug 27 2023,positive,my 9  10 year old loved it  i appreciated some of the easter eggs of nostalgia  jack black was money  but it didnt have as much of a storyline as some of the kids movies im used to  i guess mario learned hes special and luigi learned to be brave  not sure
Aug 27 2023,positive,loved the donkey kong fight and the racing
Aug 27 2023,positive,the attention to detail and all the video game easter eggs were enjoyable for us that grew up playing these titles
Aug 27 2023,positive,kids liked it  cant complain 
Aug 27 2023,positive,weaved expected elements of the game with novel storyline well
Aug 27 2023,neutral,a really lame story line even the kids said it was just ok
Aug 27 2023,positive,perfect  its good memories for the childhood
Aug 27 2023,positive,amazing movie and never felt too long or short
Aug 27 2023,positive,we own this movie but i decided to take my twin 2 year olds to see it at the theater on national cinema day they sat through the entire movie any movie that can do that gets 5 stars in my opinion
Aug 27 2023,positive,worth the four bucks not much more
Aug 27 2023,positive,i got tickets to the wrong movie we got there and he had already seen the movie i wasted my money
Aug 27 2023,negative,making mario oblivious to the game world of his own game wasnt the best plot choice i liked peach being her own hero but the movie lacked because of how lame they made the mario brothers
Aug 27 2023,positive,the movie is great it really spoke to the true lovers of super mario brothers its a fantastic movie for families two thumbs up i hope they come out with another one
Aug 27 2023,positive,absolutely radical the animation is stunning the movie is fastpaced and even a teaser for possibly another one the plot isnt amazing but i think its fun
Aug 27 2023,positive,must see for fans of the mario games i have played a majority of the mario games so this movie was super nostalgic and fun for me the orchestral soundtrack is amazing i had to watch it again at home so i could pause and replay all my favourite parts
Aug 26 2023,positive,great for the whole family made me relive my childhood
Aug 26 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this moive and the animation is beautiful  the story is really straight forward and is a absolute must see i just wish it was longer other then that its a great moive
Aug 26 2023,positive,super fun full of creative ways to mix in all the super mario bros elements
Aug 26 2023,positive,so freshthis movie is so good i want illumination to make more nintendo moviesi cant wait for the sequel
Aug 26 2023,positive,wow captivant te prinde filmul 
Aug 26 2023,negative,just mindnumbingly boring from start to finish half a star for jack black though
Aug 26 2023,positive,it was awesome for a mario fan it was definitely worth watching
Aug 26 2023,positive,really nice good balance of fun its homy and true to a mariogaming fans heart but sometimes you cant get over the sometimes ridiculous performances and obviously most notably from chris pratt but if you turn your mind off have some cereal and just enjoy this as a early morninglate night goof off youll be ok
Aug 26 2023,negative,cute did visual justice to the game but overall boring not a movie i would rewatch
Aug 26 2023,negative,ive seen this theaters twice and it sucked as the first time the characters are bad written most of them are not supportive they just treated them like dirtballs
Aug 26 2023,positive,its everything you want in a mario movie even a mostly 80s soundtrack that includes some familiar videogame classics
Aug 26 2023,negative,the blue star gets it an extra half star in ratings this movie was horrible beyond that the plot and dialogue were non existent and it just was runs of the games for nostalgias sake and honestly if i wanted to see the games id either just play them on my switch or watch streams of someone else playing them feels like a lot of not good reviews though even kids would get bored none of the ones in my life have tried rewatching it yet and they rewatching movies to death if they like them 
Aug 26 2023,positive,i think was a totally awesome movie it has great voice actors and so many nostalgic moments the only con is that they kinda just recycled the sound track too much and i am totally ok with using the iconic main theme for both donkey kong and mario but they used it too much
Aug 25 2023,positive,i love this movie i want arother movie of this one
Aug 25 2023,positive,perfectly nostalgic and fun  exactly what it was supposed to be
Aug 25 2023,neutral,meh they tried too hard to include all of the tropes of the video game 
Aug 23 2023,neutral,eh its okay im a big mario fan and even i thought it was disappointing lets start with the positives the animation and designs are amazing illumination doesnt make good movies but they always animate them great the voice acting is good for the most part peaches is a bop and brian taylor does some other amazing orchestral pieces for the movie the movie has funny jokes so thats good if you only watch a movie for references than this movie is like a wet dream for them now for the critiques the references annoy me to my core i got a lot of the references i think but that doesnt matter theres hundreds of them and they dont add anything it feels like the main focus was on animation and references the references are also really distracting sometimes some were clever and subtle but some were plain irritating the story is fiiine and youd think for a movie where a story is important the story would be interesting nope all that happens is that the mario ends up in the mushroom kingdom and has to save luigi and stop bowser from marrying peach and taking over the world its not a bad story it may be basic but it could be great with the right team behind it the bad guys is one of my favourite animated movies and the story is pretty basic but the characters make it fun and interesting this movie doesnt do that the characters are fine but they dont make the story interesting luigi and toad despite being big mario staples do basically nothing throughout the movie i thought that luigi would have a prison escape subplot or whatever but thats more of my idea than anything the pacing of the movie is also too fast if youve seen all the trailers than theres basically nothing else besides some action scenes and cool moments and of course the second postcredit scene stinks its just a reference to godzilla but with a yoshi egg i really want the second movie to be about mario sunshine since a storyline with bowser jr saving his dad on delfino isle would be great it makes sense that one of the last lines charles martinet had in the mario franchise was these are my boys because this is definitely a mario movie but it just isnt a good like movie watch it if you want i guess
Aug 23 2023,positive,super fun film with a good story line and lots of nostalgic throwbacks to the mario bros universe
Aug 23 2023,positive,stunning animation an incredible soundtrack and great voice acting wahoo
Aug 23 2023,negative,besides references this movie is incredible boring and not at all faithful to the source material
Aug 23 2023,positive,78 liked the references to the old games had a lot of the classic characters but not all solid watch overall
Aug 22 2023,positive,absolutely loved the references and how it was a good film without no yoshi
Aug 22 2023,negative,so incredibly lazy it introduces so many themes yet explores literally none a rushed and poorly written movie with nothing but references to offer its viewers
Aug 22 2023,positive,awesome not woke the real deal great job sony awesome movie for 40 year olds to watch and reminisce with their kids
Aug 22 2023,positive,very fun movie had me going the whole time
Aug 22 2023,positive,really fun kids movie
Aug 22 2023,positive,the movie is pretty good the references are fire jack black being bowser already deserve another star but what is really weird has to be  the plot its not a great plot but its better than some of the other illumination plots the only reason why i did give it four stars and a half and not just four is because they didnt add toadsworth and replace him with some stupid blue toad but thats all the negatives this im glad were not left with some bad live action take for the last mario movie good job for illumination they finally made something that isnt trash
Aug 22 2023,positive,the new  animated mario bros movie looks good i say its certified fresh

Aug 21 2023,positive,this movie made me love mario now
Aug 21 2023,positive,this movie is so good like it has everything a nintendo fan would love or heck if someone thats not a nintendo fan thats fine anyone  would love this movie they would love that plumber mario also one more thing the critics should like this movie more its so good i love it and i would watch it so many times if i could yeah the critics are so wrong about this movie giving it to 59 on the tomato meter there really wrong

Aug 21 2023,neutral,its a very straightforward movie and it doesnt break the pattern of every comedy movie also it lands a few jokes but the rest are just flat out corny and its humor is for like 3 year olds but i guess it did pass some time
Aug 20 2023,positive,when you see mario movie for ferst time is amaizing
Aug 20 2023,positive,the whole family loved it plenty of easter eggs for us 8090s nintendo fans

Aug 20 2023,positive,not enough luigi on screen
Aug 20 2023,positive,this is the mario movie we have been waiting for the story cast and animation was amazing all the marks were hit for a mario movie that nintendo cast and crew should be proud of achieving the fun characters and story make this a must see for any long time or new fan of the mario franchise the fact that its made a point to point out the stereotypical italian voices are not needed to know who the mario brothers are and that plumbings their game the super mario bros movies was a fun and exciting adventure this one was definitely a level up for sure
Aug 20 2023,positive,the critics cant accept a little fun as usual the movie has emotional depth laugh out loud moments and too much fun to summarise its perfect
Aug 19 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic the kids love it chris pratt and charlie day do an amazing job
Aug 19 2023,positive,a must see for nintendo fans they did a great job
Aug 19 2023,positive,this was good to watch once i didnt realize that the super mario brothers started off as plumbers i liked the graphics and they incorporated a lot of the game into the movie the brothers live in brooklyn but they get lost in a different world where they meet a villain who wants to either marry or harm the princess if she doesnt marry him the brothers manage to defeat the villains but obtaining a star powering up and becoming invincible
Aug 19 2023,positive,its not perfect but fun art style is good mario vs donkey kong is a blast so pretty fun move
Aug 19 2023,positive,easy movie with characters and music everyone knows it was fun to watch but not that deep so just an easy movie with a very nice style and nice backstory to the characters
Aug 19 2023,positive,i want this to be 60 or over because it was really great  i may understand why its a 59 but it really wasnt bad come on 
Aug 19 2023,positive,folks will complain saying the pacing is horrible but with how much they were able to cram in a kids movie they pull it off this isnt some long 3 hour cinematic film it is an hour and a half kids film that does a great job introducing a new generation to mario while also throwing nods and easter eggs into the film for long time fans
Aug 19 2023,negative,so dumb  not funny not interesting i like the game i love the voice actors
Aug 19 2023,positive,the mario movie runs on nostalgia and mushrooms its a colorful bouncing movie that will leave you smiling even if not fulfilled
Aug 18 2023,positive,5 stars they absolutely knocked this out of the park holy cow ill watch this again and again for sure
Aug 18 2023,positive,super mario brothers movie wants great to me i love charlie day and chris pratt and one more keegan michael key and ava taylor joy are perfect cast 
Aug 18 2023,neutral,nothing worthwhile about this flick except maybe that you can watch it with kids 
Aug 18 2023,positive,better than expected and the proof the nintendo can start making movies of their popular titles
Aug 18 2023,positive,i loved it fun  entertaining with a ton of easter eggs  nostalgic references to many video games over the years
Aug 18 2023,negative,i was really hoping the voice casting was going to be the only problem but it turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg first the only voicecasting choices i could get behind were toad donkey kong and bowser the rest sound wrong and youre reminded of it every time they open their mouths the animation style is great everything looks amazing and the level of detail is amazing i also have to give props to the music updating the original game music worked out perfectly but what dragged it down was the addition of popular media songs take on me and holding out for a hero really those snapped me out of the moment and had me rolling my eyes if the voice casting was good then i could have appreciated the guardians of the galaxy nod in the end as you can guess the praise stops here and now were on to the bigger issues the script and pacing were both terrible the plot of the games was so simple it should be impossible to screw up but the studio still found a way with the help of woke culture luigi ends up being the kidnapped damsel in distress instead of peach because now all women have to be untouchable badasses peach is so op there really isnt any need for mario and luigi to even be in the movie since the focus is more on her anyway its called the super mario bros movie but mario is the only brother who gets decent screen time for some reason they added paternal drama and an exboss which only gets a second mention before being dropped i dont even know why they bothered to include donkey kong in here since its supposed to be a mario movie this all leads to another problem the movie is so short but they tried to cram in everything from all the games in order to fit this in the movie everything goes by so fast its hard to process so we dont get to know the land or characters beyond their job titles the movie really should have been a full 2 hours cutting out the kongs marios family the exboss and the mario kart area so we could get more story they also need to work on continuity mario goes from being agile in brooklyn to clumsy and scared in the mushroom kingdom and since when does mario hate mushrooms bowser hates mario because hes jealous but they only meet in the ending for about 10 minutes whats worse is the movie isnt even funny i only laughed once the entire time and that was when the luma was sad over not dying in the lava how did this script even get greenlit it cant even be blamed on the writers strike
Aug 18 2023,positive,an absolute blast that any gamer  mario fan will endear fun characters world music easter eggs  everything else one can ask for from a mario movie the future is bright for faithful video game adaptations that cherish   honor their source material
Aug 18 2023,positive,i grew up playing mario games all the time and seeing these characters on screen was so fun such a cool film
Aug 18 2023,positive,amazing better than the 59 they gave this and probably better than the romancedrama mario which was made in 2018
Aug 17 2023,positive,1010 this is my favourite movie of all time i love video games especially super mario my favourite video game franchise and this is the perfect video game adaption nintendo and illumination did a great job on this if youre looking for the best video game movie to watch this is for you this deserves a sequel
Aug 17 2023,positive,packed with tons of references to not just the super mario games but also to mario kart mario maker donkey kong luigis mansion and even references to pikmin and duck hunt while not perfect it was a fun and enjoyable watch peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches i love you oh
Aug 17 2023,negative,what the heck did chris pratt do to deserve this illumination is just weird yknow
Aug 17 2023,negative,the plot was a little too simple the characters didnt really feel like someone or something you would trust and would protect no hate to the studio because mario a really hard character to make a good movie out off anyways one and a half stars
Aug 17 2023,positive,the movie is as fantastic as the wonder of bljing in sm64 or finding the  world the movie is just what mario needed i mean who would have thought as this if it wasnt obvious enough im talking about the live action one duh any who i know you have seen it so ill shut up lol

Aug 16 2023,positive,really enjoyed the movie but i think it couldve used a little more love to detail there where so many things they coudve shown and the movie felt a little but rushed
Aug 16 2023,positive,the references are great for old and young people funny humour great storyline 1010
Aug 16 2023,positive,the film was amazing with so many visual and musical easter eggs not to mention the incredible level of detail that was done in the animation it can only bode well for the nintendo cinematic universe this film is a must see
Aug 16 2023,positive,a great fun attended for more younger audiences movie about super mario bros that will never get old
Aug 15 2023,positive,video game feel with a great voice over cast tells enough backstory so newbies arent confused while giving personalities to each character nice comedyfamily film and a great message about supporting each other
Aug 15 2023,positive,i absolutely loved it  best family movie this year  there is no propaganda of any kind and it made me think i was watching a movie from the early 2000s which is an amazing thing  i hate movies now a days but this one really is a breath of fresh air so glad they dont shove stupid feminism or lgbt shit down our throats
Aug 15 2023,positive,as a simple film for kids its really ok but as a mario film with big hype that i had its big meh
Aug 15 2023,positive,from start to finish fun fun fun and that last battle sequence at the end was just cherry  on top
Aug 15 2023,positive,so awesome they did a great job of capturing what mario is and pouring out in a movie
Aug 15 2023,positive,this movie is just perfection from start to finish all the nostalgia ive been through over the years of my childhood has came true for just this immaculate movie like i cannot get over with what i just watched all the references in this are so surprising and everything illumination did with this movie did an absolute job and is one of their best movies ever made the peaches peaches peaches scene is just too funny to watch over and over again that i just cant stop singing it outside of me        super mario bros movie is just perfect and it literally deserves a 1010 star
Aug 15 2023,positive,this movie was amazing

Aug 14 2023,positive,great movie spectacular animation and stellar voice cast nice to see a video game film that stays true to its roots
Aug 14 2023,positive,so much fun to watch the plot is simple but it works
Aug 14 2023,positive,movie was spot on to the story line of the game characters were great good humor jack black is a crack up
Aug 14 2023,positive,the critics must be old and without children my kids loved the movie and as a millennial parent it was genius for the directors to use throwback music that was popular during the height of the video game of super mario bros 3 very cute and the casting was perfect i loved the training scene the most
Aug 14 2023,positive,mamma mia i rewatched this last night on prime and im undecided on whether its good or bad illumination is trying to cram in as much mario nostalgia as they possibly can into 90 minutes i get it they dont want to disappoint hundreds of millions of fans who grew up with the mario bros love jack black but not the voice that comes to mind for bowser as far as the story i mean its weak but the movie passed the time for all the hype i was expecting something better
Aug 14 2023,positive,kid oriented movie that is entertaining from beginning to end 
Aug 14 2023,positive,terrific family friendly movie fun easy to watch and short for younger audience hit on a lot of the key elements for people who played the games didnt try to do too much 
Aug 13 2023,negative,this story was not very creative lots of cliche moments and dialogue themes and dialogue of death dying ill kill you were all used in this pg movie ai should get a crack at the script next time if this is the best human writers can come up with animation was beautiful and colorful the actors all did great jack black funny as always everyone one was entertaining missed opportunity here with the lack of creativity in the writing though 
Aug 13 2023,positive,fun watch for what it is certainly nothing innovativeand that isnt a bad thing only two major downsides to me  a without knowledge of the universe i think this movie risks feeling fragmented and having linesdialog that seem out of place in some ways it is an easter egg hunting fest b some strange voice casting
Aug 13 2023,positive,is a very good movie for kids specially because it doesnt have any homosexual or lgbt gender confusion scenes or characters
Aug 13 2023,positive,interesting movie want to watch it a second time
Aug 13 2023,positive,its a masterpiece gives me faith back on upcoming movies
Aug 13 2023,positive,super fun movie but you had to have played the game to get the most out of this flick
Aug 13 2023,negative,so boring there is no emotional investment in the characters or real humanity effect reels are only interesting for so long and the movie outruns its time
Aug 13 2023,positive,as a fan of the franchise this colourful film was delightful treat super fun characters beautifully animated worlds fast paced story with many easter eggs for gamers well voice acted and just an overall enjoyable experience for the whole family
Aug 13 2023,positive,great fun and amazing animation 
Aug 12 2023,positive,a thin plot and some questionable voice acting choices can be ignored in favor of jack blacks great turn as bowser a ton of old school game nostalgia and great visuals especially the rainbow road sequence
Aug 12 2023,positive,loved how the incorporated so much of the mario world and game aspects especially mario kart i want a sequel with even more characters
Aug 12 2023,positive,i dont know why critics rated it so poorly the movie has so many songmusic references to all the games and the animation stayed true to the newer video games which was nice  the story followed what was expected from a mario story and there are plenty of hilarious moments for older and younger audiences  ive been playing mario games since nes and loved this movie  also lumalee the blue star was hilarious  enjoy the movie
Aug 12 2023,positive,finally a really great video game adaptation this movie was made with love by people with a genuine emotional connection to the source material and it shows absolutely a good pick for all ages
Aug 11 2023,positive,finally a movie that did the characters of a beloved franchise justice by making a great movie with all the characters you want to see together unlike what disney has done with everything they have made in the past decade where instead of giving the fans what they want they screw with the characters by gender or race swapping them and worrying more about ticking the lgbtq boxes then making an actually good movie this movie was great great animation and cinematography to simulate the video game style great music from the games great characters and plot great humour and nods to the games throughout once you hear marios voice in this you get used to it in a minute because the movie is actually good would like to see more video game movies thoughfully created like this movie was its not that fans dont want to see movies based off games its that they want the movie or show to not be garbage ie the witcher season 12 vs the complete disastor season 3 and beyond
Aug 11 2023,positive,your kids will like it there is enough nostalgia and easter eggs to make it watchable for adults
Aug 11 2023,positive,jack black singing bitches was the best part
Aug 11 2023,positive,i was talking to the audience during parts of this movie that was probably my favorite part when i talked to them only some 15 people would reply and i thought even that was funny
Aug 11 2023,positive,its the best and very awesome movie ever screw you critics the one who made the movie 59 almost everybody thinks its awesome i give it 100100
Aug 11 2023,positive,this was so fun to watch and i was trying to guess which of the games that were place in the movie and easter eggs
Aug 11 2023,positive,i am old enough to remember when the game was released and i was a bit worried about a movie  i had absolutely nothing to worry about i laughed i smiled i grimaced i cheered and i sang along to absolutely every songeven the one in the end
Aug 11 2023,positive,kept true to the game nostalgic was on overdrive   kid friendly and was hilarious for adults to watch
Aug 11 2023,positive,real nostalgic 84 out of 10 story is simple but it was good enough for me
Aug 11 2023,positive,im mistletoe virus im saying i like this movie this movie for the the fanbase not to the general audience this is a movie that feels like a love letter to all the nintendo fans out there even if they dont necessarily play mario anymore
Aug 10 2023,positive,entertaining from start to finish i just cant believe this movie exists the best illumination movie so far so many great references
Aug 10 2023,positive,the mario movie was epic the sound track and references and also they have the minons mario kart very funny and also i was wrong about crish pratt was cool he did great job and my favorite part bowser and sound track in my favorite sound track donkey kong rap and also his name who made song not here in end movie jungel groove and donkey kong theam song and my favorite song take on me and thunder track and my favorite jack black i love bowser princess peache you so cool princess peache understand peaches peaches peaches i loveee youuuu and ending was great make me dance a lot untail was secret ending and egg hatch and say yoshi that means mario movie part 2 you know what means ncu  and also person who never watch mario movie stupid and blind dont judge something before you never watch it watch the movie is cool and great has many nintendo references was funny
Aug 10 2023,positive,a great movie the plot is very exciting i like it very much 
Aug 10 2023,positive,a very fun time for nintendo lovers and the whole family really wish it had more plot tho but still very enjoyable
Aug 10 2023,positive,a great movie with a lot of callbacks to previous entries in the franchise it wasnt a great story but the nostalgia was enough to carry me out of the theater happy is recommend this movie to anyone mario bros fan or not
Aug 10 2023,positive,i think the movie is great but its not the best movie ever made and i think is the best illumination project  ever made and its better than the first sonic movie
Aug 10 2023,positive,it was purrfect perfect every single detail was perfect
Aug 9 2023,positive,i loved this movie what i loved most of all was the amount of easter eggs like there was a customer that was the voice of the guy who created mario there was a lisence plate that said m4rio bros and luigi in the mansion was a nod toward luigis haunted mansion
Aug 9 2023,positive,it is a great movie for anyones who plays on nintendo or like mario
Aug 9 2023,positive,finally was able to watch it and i have to say i had a fun time with this movie it had a few pacing issues but everything was wrapped up really nicely at the end i am excited now to see a sequel and it looks like without a doubt we will see one
Aug 9 2023,positive,this is definitely not a bad cartoon based on the game the platformer mechanics are played just as well here i think fans will find it interesting to watch im not a fan but as someone who has seen a lot of mario games it was interesting to watch the movie i didnt regret  perhaps they could have stretched the lore of the game a bit more for the movie but im afraid its too late i wonder what lies ahead
Aug 9 2023,positive,i spent a really nice time in the theatre with moving chairs flash water wind and smells for movie in this kind of room a lot of references for old player like me story a bit short but i wish to see the sequel
Aug 9 2023,positive,amazing movie especially if youve ever played nintendo  just shows how far the critics heads are up their you know whats 
Aug 9 2023,positive,as a longtime mario fan this movie filled my expectations and did just a little more definitely a great film but not as great compared to the other movies that were released this year
Aug 9 2023,negative,i understand the hype but i did not like this movie at all
Aug 8 2023,positive,if you just want to have a good time and not think too hard about things the super mario bros movie is a good way to enjoy a fun adventure based on these iconic nintendo characters there are definitely parts that couldve been handled better and the story couldve used more time to flesh out especially if you arent a diehard fan of nintendo games but for a true first outing for the mario bros on the big screen this was a solid introduction to these characters and this world lets hope that their next adventure can be even greater and take things to the next level
Aug 8 2023,positive,it was really good 
Aug 8 2023,negative,this was a very bad movie and not even funny they could have done better the pacing was way too fast and not even character development  i would not recommend giving this a second watch 
Aug 8 2023,neutral,this film is a mixed bag my reservations towards the voice cast and praise were confirmed jack black is awesome the animation is great charlie day and ana taylor joy are good as well chris pratt phones it in the jokes either hit or miss mario being hit by things arent really a joke but the subtle background humor of the toads and cleverness of animated subtleties work well the story doesnt exist and tries to make you forget what happened to the flooding at the beginning of the city do they have a successful plumbing business when and why did they move to mushroom kingdom when did luigi learn how to jump etc it doesnt matter its a kid movie i guess its the illumination money curse do anything that makes money but forsake the art but bowser was awesome
Aug 8 2023,neutral,the animation and references were good i suppose but it jumped from action scene to action scene with very few breathers making the plot feel rushed and shallow it was extremely formulaic and cliché to the point where i was bored watching it jack blackbowser was the best part overall it was fun to see all the references and the quality wasnt terrible but it felt less like a movie and more like a vessel for mario references not worth paying money to see and only worth your time if youre pretty bored
Aug 8 2023,positive,12yr old liked everything except the voice of mario didnt sound right  7yr old it was amazing and fun
Aug 8 2023,positive,a super fun experience for an mario fan as a hardcore nintendo fan this movie was a blast cant wait to see what they do in the future it was kinda short so things were squished together and i can imagine a nonmario fan enjoying this but it looks amazing and you feel like youve known this world forever illumination really worked hard on this for the longtime mario fans and you can tell
Aug 8 2023,positive,its brilliant they strike a near perfect balance of everything this film needed to be    once again the critics are just clueless and know nothing about movie quality or audience preferences
Aug 7 2023,positive,this was a fun watch the animation is beautiful the humor is light hearted and hits just right the action is great and the nostalgia meter is maxed out what this movie lacks in story depth it makes up in spades with good old fashioned fun and entertainment and thats kind of the heart and soul of a mario game isnt it i think the box office numbers and the differential between the critics score and the audience score speaks volumes to the chasm between what hollywood wants you to watch and what audiences actually like to watch this movie did one thing and honestly its the only thing that matters it entertained me mario 2 shut up and take my money already
Aug 7 2023,positive,i liked it but the story went by fast
Aug 7 2023,positive,this is an excellent movie as it is my favorite movie of all time this movie is perfect for nintendo fans and people who just enjoy animated movies
Aug 7 2023,positive,if you enjoy the games you will love this movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,a movie for the fans i can pretty much guarantee the experts giving this a low rating have never beaten a mario game tons of references with the basic save the princess plot we were all expecting and i wouldnt want it any other way
Aug 7 2023,positive,so awesome everything is perfect better than sonic movie cant wait for sequel
Aug 7 2023,positive,mario is a vibrant colourful and even at times hilarious movie although it is the lack of originality in the story as well as very little depth in the characters that hold this movie back quite a bit
Aug 7 2023,positive,the movie knows what it is and doesnt try to be anything else which benefits it greatly though the plot isnt great and some humor doesnt land its undeniably a fun adventure
Aug 7 2023,positive,awesome the story is great and also how they implemented the mario characters in was great the only problem was the ending why have they go to the real world it didnt affect the plot that it was in the real world almost at all so why even have it there besides that great movie
Aug 7 2023,positive,this movie is clever and fun idk what the hell the critics are talking about the directing is on point and the clever camera angles make lots of scenes without over doing it the icon music is just great to hear in the movie and the acting is top notch heavy hitters keegan michael key as toad to me just really stood out there is room for improvement on some of the writing idk why peach said mario is not important and proceeded to take him on her adventure  and it was a little sad they kept luigi locked up in a cage most of the time with a depressed star over all the movie is just an enjoyable easy watch if you are a fan of nintendo and the games you will likely enjoy this
Aug 7 2023,negative,terrible they just popped a nostalgia ingredient list of mario characters and called it a movie
Aug 6 2023,negative,honestly pretty terrible characters are super shallow and there is no real back story the music is pretty good but the story is wet garbage if you like pretty animation and music with no actual substance then this movie is for you
Aug 6 2023,positive,great mario movie so many easter eggs and game related things thoroughly impressed with everything animation songs everything was fantastic
Aug 6 2023,positive,the best movie in the world the animationsongscharcatersand the voice even christ pratt voice by mario but its still good 1010
Aug 6 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie its so much fun i love that it blends the elements from various games so seamlessly i hope there will be sequels 
Aug 6 2023,positive,amazing video game adaptation
Aug 6 2023,positive,good movie for kids looks good and the scenes are good fullfilled for the mario universe storywise its pretty safe and doesnt explore alot which is ok for a movie aimed to a young audience
Aug 5 2023,neutral,unlike great adaptations such as pokémon or sonic which told some interesting although cliché settings mario didnt try hard to have a decent plot to keep track with even with a colorful yet shiny animation still doesnt carry a deepening and charismatic story to emphasize nor its awful voicing cast choices only id recommend it to childish millennials and kids
Aug 5 2023,positive,this was the best representation of super mario brothers video game maybe the best gamer movie of all time other games try to capture the essence of a gaming franchise but this one got it on the mark i really liked how they humanized all of the characters right down to bowser
Aug 5 2023,positive,if super mario is what you want super mario is what you will get im a fan of all the voice casting here except seth rogen but watching donkey kong heheheheh was enjoyable enough to forgive it the plot is basically that of a mario game bowser plans to attack the mushroom kingdom and the usual heroes have to stop him i laughed a good few times and the references and easter eggs made me smile all around fun movie and you get exactly what you expect the only people i wouldnt recommend this movie to are snobs that think animation is for children and people who dislike super mario
Aug 5 2023,positive,its a great movie with a lovely story behind now playing super mario makes a lot more sense i enjoyed every minute of it
Aug 5 2023,positive,if you are a fan of mario and have a decent display to watch it on then this is a must see the animation was so great the only minor critique i have is that i would like it to have been a bit longer  no filler however understanding this is a childrens movie and the fact that animation takes so much work and it was so high quality i give t a pass and still love it
Aug 5 2023,positive,watch this if you like mario
Aug 5 2023,negative,terrible couldnt continue watching this commercial disguised as a movie poor plot
Aug 5 2023,positive,brilliant plotline not entirely jokes for the adults but hilarious    jack black as bowser 
Aug 5 2023,positive,a love letter to the old and new fans of mario the plot is not that deep but who cares its a children movie and we are there to have fun
Aug 5 2023,positive,great nostalgia not ruined by the normal woke hollywood bs 
Aug 5 2023,neutral,about what i expected the movie looks pretty good in this day and age we should expect nothing less from the animation department it isnt terrible it is mildly amusing i thought dd hot was overrated mario bros is nowhere near as good there is no reason for it to exist other than to make some money for the studio it is nothing special nothing clever about the writing its just acceptable if youre bored and cant find anything else to watch i guess its okay ill certainly never need to revisit it
Aug 5 2023,positive,1010  one of the best video game adaptions hands down   marios big leap to the screen had me smiling the entire time loved the easter eggs from the video games it moxed the elements from the games to create a spectacular new world stunning animation a talented voice cast that genuinely surprised me
Aug 5 2023,positive,for a movie about a video game its perfect the references to the games and references in the music were amazing if you want a movie that can surpass the sonic movie this is a must watch
Aug 5 2023,positive,great animation very funny  having a poor critic score guarantees its a good movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,fun little ride im relatively young but went through the phase of playing super mario in my childhood with my brothers and cousins in a old nintendo it is a very pretty animation i got some of the references in the movie and liked how naturally they were inserted in the storyline loved the relationship between mario and luigi and all the little characters  i really liked the scenes that bring the platform game feel to it like in the beginning when mario and luigi were running
Aug 4 2023,positive,this was a fun exciting interpretation of the super mario franchise that had something for every mario fan the story was pretty simple but it was told well and showcased every character and paid homage to every game
Aug 4 2023,positive,i watch this movie this summer with my nieces and nephews who were the ages of 3 to 9 years old in addition us adults watched it as well as my kids who are in their 20s it is a fun and entertaining movie for all ages we all loved it it had a happy ending perfect movie for the whole family
Aug 4 2023,positive,its so much better then i expected     watched 8423
Aug 4 2023,positive,about everything you could want its fun fast paced and a great paean to the video game forget the critics if you liked playing mario bros at all youll enjoy this
Aug 4 2023,positive,this movie is very well done and stays true to the story of mario and the mushroom kingdom i look forward to an entire nintendo universe full of new movies
Aug 4 2023,positive,its mario and the movie captures all the fun and colorful themes as seen in the video games its a fun movie that hits home for nostalgic adults and a nice introduction for children new to the franchise ignore the critics on this one if something should be reviewed and criticized its them
Aug 4 2023,positive,after almost a whole year since this movie came out does it hold up well kinda this is a fine video game adaptation but i just think it couldve been a lot better   so the plot is pretty much your standard origin story the movie begins with bowser stealing the power star to which is later revealed to be used to force peach into marrying him eventually mario and luigi discover a pipe while trying to stop a flood in brooklyn then the two of them get separated mario goes to the mushroom kingdom and meets toad while luigi ends up in the dark lands one scene with peach later she trains mario for when they have to seek out the kong army so yeah the plot is pretty simple its filled with a ton of great scenes whether its action packed or to take a breather although with everything going at a lightning fast pace due to the short runtime it makes it hard to simply enjoy it or take a breather a longer runtime for a movie based on mario is something that should desperately be needed   now im gonna talk about the characters in which some of them are my biggest problems with in this movie  mario is a fine protagonist although what i dont like about him is how hes a punching bag throughout most of the movie but by far the worst thing about him is that he doesnt really feel like the main character even though hes the title character  youd think that peach not being much in the games mean that she would be much better in this movie right nope sadly not princess peach is just another one of those characters whos made out to be perfect in every way has absolutely no flaws and exist just to make the main character look worse peach was also condescending and a jerk to mario in this movie not by much like overhead slamming him size shaming him forcing a mushroom down his throat and announcing that hes not important peach is pretty much treated as if shes the main character when she clearly isnt supposed to be and she takes up around 50 of the movie i completely understand why people would like her but personally i cant stand her  despite luigi being a great character hes just completely sidelined in this movie so theres not much to talk about him other than he shouldve gotten way more screen time this is another reason on why the runtime shouldve been longer  bowser was the best character in this movie despite the motives being copied from mario odyssey  toad was a great character and unlike most comic relief characters he actually contributes in the story although he was kind of a plot device in the 3rd act with the whole ice flower thing   donkey kong was just insufferable in this movie hes just salty ever since he lost the fight and never changes once over the story it wouldve been really nice if the swallowed by the eel scene if we actually see mario and dk bond or at least have a truce when they talk about how theyre fathers thing theyre a joke it wouldve been a nice act of character development from both of them but nope we just had to have dk be salty to the point where hes just not enjoyable   the side characters except for spike and charles martinets cameos were also really good   but then theres lumalee the most pointless character in this entire movie he has one gag of him constantly saying death and depressing jokes and its never funny i guess he was supposed to fill in the role as the comic relief character but heres the thing we already have toad for that like luigi lumalee is barely shown on screen so theres not much to talk about him well except for all the stuff i just said  now im gonna talk about some other positives and negatives  the animation looks absolutely stunning and a nice change from the overused despicable me art style the music score is perfect except for all the licensed music theres a lot of neat references to catch onto i consider scenes like the dry bones chase and the mario kart scene to be the best in this movie the chemistry between mario and luigi was endearing the mushroom kingdom in this movie is by far the best iteration of it the locations are beautiful to look at even though we barely spend any time with them the peaches song is just annoying in my opinion all the scenes with lumalee were filler the climax is way too similar to the one in sonic 2020 there was little to no character arcs or development the movie in general felt kind of rushed and the last post credit scene wasnt all that revealing or shocking  and here are a couple of nitpicks i personally had peach and dk using the fire and ice flower when mario and luigi didnt and the fact that they can just blow out a fire flower when that was never something in the games so does this mean you can blow out an ice flower would it defrost it    this movie had a lot of potential to be outstanding its still good but i wished it couldve been better lets hope the sequel will be a huge step up
Aug 4 2023,negative,so many cool references must see if you see entertainment in pointing things out
Aug 4 2023,positive,good fun some odd animation and story choices peach having an enormous head why    the voice acting minus jack black and charlie day who were great was fine some good jokes not many chris pratt was particularly bad    good music nostalgic and fun    if you like mario bros youll probably have fun but i doubt it will blow your socks off
Aug 4 2023,positive,really nice animations and the easter eggs are nice
Aug 4 2023,neutral,ok could have been so much better a little too much man bashing but at this point im not too surprised the cgi was well done chris pratt nailed it as usual but some of the other choices for voicework leaves a lot to be desired decent story some cool easter eggs to be found the charachters appearances were all in line with the mario universe decent overall but not great
Aug 4 2023,positive,it was cool to see all of the characters and references to games like super mario bros and mario kart but i didnt find the story that exciting i cant say i didnt enjoy it though mostly because ive been playing mario since i was little overall it was a fun and decent enough movie
Aug 4 2023,positive,movie was so much better than i had expected i enjoyed it my kids enjoyed it and it had a lot of nostalgia for me with the visuals songs and easter eggs
Aug 4 2023,positive,funny and entertaining mario film great for kids and families to love but try not to listen to the critics who wrote rotten reviews it rocks
Aug 4 2023,positive,didnt expect to like this movie as much as i did brought a lot of memories when i played on the wii its a must watch just a lot of fun at all ages
Aug 4 2023,positive,i throughly enjoyed the movie the nostalgia is great and seeing what we play in the video games on the big screen only slight issue i had was them making luigi such a pansy ive always been a luigi man myself really hope they do make a 2nd one so we can see yoshi and even more nostalgia
Aug 4 2023,negative,terrible movie i didnt mind chris pratt voicing mario or even the disappointing voice of toad what i was bothered by was the complete ignorance to mario lore including real life settings in the movie rainbow road road was a disaster as was the mansion full of shy guys it is as though the writers producers and director saw the cover art for every mario game and decided they knew enough to make a movie zero effort zero quality the only good part was donkey kong and the kong kingdom
Aug 3 2023,positive,that movie was a legend
Aug 3 2023,positive,a movie so good that not even seth rogan could ruin it
Aug 3 2023,positive,absolute must see been waiting for this since i was a kid in 95 love love loved it
Aug 3 2023,positive,it was a fun family movie with laughs and easter eggs from past games
Aug 3 2023,positive,the super mario movie was a the best video game movie of all time it had some fantastic action scenes straight from the game and fun easter eggs and most of all christ pratt did a amazing job as mario to those who doubted him you were wrong best video game movie ever watch it now
Aug 2 2023,positive,jack black   seth rogen are so funny in this movie im so excided for a sequel
Aug 2 2023,positive,honestly if youre a nintendo fanboy being one myself you will see a lot of game references that honestly could bring pure nostalgia to you
Aug 2 2023,positive,its like the best movie ever
Aug 2 2023,positive,i was unsure and a little skeptical going into this movie because  video game movie but the way they used so many of the game characters and incorporated aspects of game play were brilliant  nostalgic but still felt new loved it
Aug 2 2023,positive,this is a great film that borrows a lot of content from its video game archive fans like myself will love this film as its highly nostalgic and has great voice actors that i thought will dilute the films value but i was wrong great film hopefully nintendo lets studios bring more of its characters profiles into the big screen
Aug 1 2023,positive,its a great family video game movie is it high brow no does it need to be no its a great cross generational family movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,excellent nostalgia based movie  it wastes no time developing the world  this is a movie that is meant for those who know the nintendo universe  the movie does feel rushed at times and would have done well to be more along the 2 hour mark but the story is fine and the tease at the end is a good indication of more to come
Aug 1 2023,positive,took my kids to see it when it came out we all loved it
Aug 1 2023,positive,the best animated movie of the year
Aug 1 2023,positive,ive been a fan of super mario bros since i was a kid and im currently close to nintendo and their video games in my childhood and adolescence i did not have the opportunity to have a video game console but i always liked the nintendo franchises and their affiliates and i stayed close to them buying nintendo power magazines and talking to my friends about video games since i started working and earning money i have the opportunity to play and learn more about video games and when i found out that a super mario bros movie was coming out i was happy and i went to see it at the premiere i guess youre already getting fed up why i dont get to the point but now i will when i saw the movie i understood all the references and the nods to video games and i enjoyed that but as a connoisseur of this video game saga he knew that he would not find a story worthy of a movie still i felt the empty film and at an accelerated pace in the sense that they did not finish proposing something and from nowhere they jumped to something else some scenes seemed unnecessary to me such as the one with the house in the first mario and luigis work or the car trip through the kingdom of the kongs my final criticism is a good movie because of the references and easter eggs but with an empty story and approach
Aug 1 2023,positive,the best video game movie of 2023 mario and luigi are the best peaches song was the best song in the movie
Jul 31 2023,positive,i looked with pleasure do you know why this simple animated film has something that is now almost nowhere else  simple truths without irrelevant characters and ideas everything is nice nice and beautiful many people should think
Jul 31 2023,positive,lots of references to the videogames great movie just felt a little bit short that 130h went away fast
Jul 31 2023,positive,one of the best animated movies ever i cant believe that illumination  nintendo worked perfectly chris pratt makes a stunning performance i love how the visual effects and the building almost represents the original and the accurate buildings and details of the mushroom kingdom    this definitely deserves an oscar
Jul 31 2023,positive,must watch great storyline good for the family
Jul 31 2023,positive,you can see how for the most fanatic ones this is a pearl of a movie it is lovely to see your video game heroes being more real and the movie manages to summarize a bit how these two plumbers ended up being star chasers in a quite elegant way   from brothers with barely any dignity not even their family believes in them to heroes saving brooklyn from some interesting creatures that noone is surprised to see around town  the animation is great how the story pull up most of the video games into it is interesting and there are hilarious moments mostly on the behalf of bowser that are remarkable  the best that peach is actually stronger and full of drive compared to the usual version at least some justice considering that the two plumbers brothers seem a bit clumsy
Jul 31 2023,positive,it was a great enjoyable nostalgic movie the animation was very colourful and spectacular the scenes of rainbow bridge were really nice the movie was true to its source material the references of various mario games were really nice chris pratt was excellent as mario jack black as bowser was great story was decent it was a great nostalgic experience it also got good values of brotherhood and heroism it is a must see for the fans of super mario and donkey kong franchise the post credit scene was nice i am looking forward to the next part of this movie franchise
Jul 31 2023,positive,cool movie to watch 
Jul 31 2023,positive,very loyal to the original games i highly recommend it
Jul 30 2023,positive,very great movie  i loved it

Jul 30 2023,positive,loved all the references of the nintendo games took me back to when i used to play definitely worth a watch
Jul 30 2023,negative,if you saw the previews you basically saw the movie the voice acting was terrible the plot had a couple jumps that made no sense i didnt feel connected to any of the characters and i have been a long time nintendo fanplayer
Jul 30 2023,positive,i am a fan of the super mario game since i was a teen so it was a must for me to see the movie the color the scenes everything was just perfect for me i enjoyed every second 
Jul 30 2023,positive,the movie brings so much childhood memories it was perfect would recommend 1010
Jul 30 2023,negative,every character movement and action is on 200 everything over exaggerated and fast paced its nauseating every scene is rushed through literally ran through and with quick basic dialogue up we go here we are its written for toddlers i think horrible to watch i hated every minute of it and i enjoy kids and family films
Jul 30 2023,positive,it was perfect highly recommend
Jul 29 2023,positive,best live action of the year
Jul 29 2023,positive,it was a fun movie my son and fiancé liked it i liked the call backs to the mario games of old 
Jul 29 2023,positive,the critics can expect a banana slamma from my lord and savior the one and only dk
Jul 29 2023,positive,i really loved it just wished it was longer really
Jul 29 2023,positive,fun movie that brought a game i loved to play to life i enjoyed it so much
Jul 29 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
Jul 28 2023,positive,this was super fun to watch if youre an old school fan youll love all the easter eggs and if youre a casual fan youll love the colorful story that flushes these characters out
Jul 28 2023,positive,one of the best renditions of video game culture was fun for all ages with great easter eggs also jack black is brilliant
Jul 28 2023,negative,better than expected but could have developed the story more
Jul 28 2023,positive,rented this for the grandbaby to watch and it was a lot cuter than i thought it would be  so many times video game movies just fall flat of the nostalgia and love of the game yes sonic 2 im looking at you but it was just cheesy and fun enough to hit all the right button combos
Jul 28 2023,positive,classy cartoon the plot is interesting the characters are well developed the graphics are top notch
Jul 27 2023,positive,really cute movie  brought my youngest and he really liked it  voice acting cast was perfect jack black always a scene stealer  id recommend for a family movie
Jul 27 2023,positive,i wasnt expecting too much but it was a fun ride what is good about the movie is it knows where to stop reasonable action enough jokes and no pushed storyline i mean good please do movies like this
Jul 27 2023,positive,not the best movie ever but it was really entertaining and cool chris pratt as mario was definitely a good choice in my opinion i also loved all the fun easter eggs about the games something i didnt like was that it moved waaay too fast like bro the final battle if you can even call it that is only like 1 minute and 45 seconds they should have either made this movie longer or put it into 2 movies to really bring out the beauty of mario
Jul 27 2023,positive,one of the best animated movies ive seen since brave
Jul 27 2023,positive,its a fun romp through mario ip but doesnt really push the medium forward by any stretch of the imagination
Jul 27 2023,positive,excellent my husband and i enjoyed it i spent all the movie laughting i havent had a great time in a long time
Jul 27 2023,positive,why this movie is bad for the others
Jul 27 2023,positive,amazing references but not that good of a plot still would watch
Jul 27 2023,positive,the movie was great im a huge mario fan it was jam packed with references and easter eggs id reoccemend it to a mario fan so 5 and a half stars
Jul 26 2023,positive,was a lot of fun  theres things i would have done differently or wish they included  most likely theyll save them for subsequent films or spin offs  visually beautiful and decent sound track  pratt wasnt as bad as i thought he would be  jack black was the bright spot as was anya taylor joy definitely a film made for children  adult score 35 kids score closer to 5 stars im sure
Jul 26 2023,positive,felt kinda rushed in between the middle of the movie but was good 
Jul 26 2023,neutral,this is easily illuminations best movie but that really isnt saying much its not a bad movie by any means but it really isnt that great either the story is honestly the worst part of the film its very cliche and generic you can pretty much predict every single beat before it happens and it really leaves a lot to be desired i appreciate that its paced quickly but i do also wish it would take more time to flesh out its ideas and themes because at the end of the day it really is a do you remember this kind of movie thats not necessarily a bad thing for this movie though as the references do show that the people involved did care about mario as a character and wanted to honor him compared to something like the flash which does the same thing except to get people in seats and not for the betterment of the film as much i as like the references i definitely wish it was toned down a little bit in order to make a more interesting story the characters are just okay as well the performances from okay to pretty good chris pratts mario is nowhere near as bad as i thought he was going to be but he was just fine anya taylorjoy was okay as peach and most of the rest of the cast is okay jack black as bowser was perfect casting though and he was easily the best part of the film the music was also very well done it takes a bunch of classic mario themes and gives them an orchestral and cinematic spin to them which i really appreciated the soundtrack choices were god awful though and really took away from the scenes was playing take on me really necessary the animation was also fairly good as well it wasnt incredible but compared to illuminations other films it definitely feels like there was a lot of effort into making the film look good as much as i have criticized this movie i still think its very fun i did enjoy myself while watching the movie and even though i think it could have been so much better i still walked out content with what i saw if you like mario then id probably recommend it but dont expect a masterpiece
Jul 26 2023,positive,its good i guess  very nice
Jul 26 2023,positive,lots of fun great voice acting delivering a pretty simple story that pays homage to the game quite well i saw it during a matinee in a theater full of kids seeing how much they loved it was a delight in and of itself
Jul 26 2023,positive,this movie was one of the best illumination movies yet it is better thn the 1993 mario movie 1010
Jul 26 2023,positive,looks great and aimed at the younger audience with a basic plotstoryline but very watchable for all
Jul 26 2023,positive,amazing visuals and easter eggs but my only criticism is how slow the beginning is until it gets to the actual plot i recommend for any mario fan
Jul 26 2023,positive,so nice the super mario movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,not much of a story and the film rushes through the plot but who cares because this movie is still awesome and fun came to a mario movie to see iconic mario characters and i did loved it
Jul 26 2023,positive,my kids loved this movie and have watched it several times already jack black did amazing as the voice of bowser like seriously doesnt even sound like him and chris pratt and the rest of the cast did great with their respective characters great graphics and funlight movie overall 
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie was ok it was nothing special in my opinion but it accomplished its job of setting the framework for a franchise that could one day be great i had fun with this movie and i think its best not to analyze a relatively simple and enjoyable super mario adventure
Jul 25 2023,positive,i love this movie it was nice to get a movie of an amazing video game franchise i thought chris pratt would not be that good as mario but i was wrong he did really good as the plumer luigi was amazing to i wish he was in the flim more though peach is better then the game peach dk was good too and i loved diddy kong i wish he was in the flim for more time maybe in a dk movie i could do a good job voicing him and bowser was amazingmovie rating 8510
Jul 24 2023,positive,even though the actual plot of this movie was thin the characters and the music was amazing i loved seeing the actual characters come to life and who couldnt love the peaches song by bowser    the thin plot perhaps an argument against the coherence of the movie is more in line with the mario of the games nostalgia great music engaging characters and great action make this movie worth watching again and again
Jul 24 2023,positive,fun and zaney the super mario bros movie delivers a mushroom load of nostalgia and good times there was certainly opportunity for a more complex indepth storyline but the film manages to do just enough while giving us a delightful taste on where this franchise can go the biggest disappointment of the film is what it could have surmounted to and what it ended up being which in all fairness is still pipeloads of fun
Jul 24 2023,positive,quality is the name of this movie this is mario essence at all who cares about mario bros will like this movie surely perfect landscapes clothes visual effects the style of animation is a high quality one but we all think that we need more emotion more drama and action maybe
Jul 24 2023,positive,i really liked it watched few times now
Jul 24 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was a fun energetic movie and probably by far the best illumination film yet however the casting choice for this movie made it eh i dont believe chris pratt was a good choice to play mario his voice acting was subpar throughout the movie when i first saw the movie in theater it sort of ruined the vibe for me other than that the movie was pretty great the animation was crazy good and it felt like i was there jack black never fails at being such a great actor the peaches song was so funny and catchy sometimes i hum it randomly all in all its a good movie and id recommend to all ages
Jul 24 2023,positive,rating 710    the new super mario bros movie takes us on a nostalgic journey back to the beloved world of mario and friends as a longtime fan of the iconic video game series i couldnt help but smile at the familiar characters and settings brought to life on the big screen while the movie isnt without its flaws it ultimately succeeds in capturing the essence of the beloved franchise    one of the movies strongest points is its faithful representation of the characters mario luigi princess peach and the rest of the gang are charmingly portrayed staying true to their quirky personalities from the games the voice acting is topnotch with the actors effectively bringing these classic characters to life adding another layer of authenticity to the experience    the films animation is visually appealing filled with vibrant colors and captivating landscapes that pay homage to the games iconic levels the attention to detail is commendable and its evident that the creators genuinely cared about capturing the essence of the super mario universe    where the movie stumbles a bit is its plot while the straightforward save the princess storyline is a staple of the franchise it felt slightly clichéd and lacked some depth however it does serve as an excellent entry point for newcomers to the mario world    additionally i would have loved to see more of the secondary characters like yoshi and toad play a more significant role in the adventure their limited screen time left me wanting more of the charming interactions that have made them fan favorites for years    on the positive side the movie boasts an energetic and upbeat soundtrack incorporating some of the classic tunes that gamers have grown to love these nostalgic melodies enhance the viewing experience and bring back fond memories of countless hours spent playing the games    another highlight is the humor which stays true to the playful nature of the mario series from the quirky interactions between mario and luigi to the amusing antics of the villains the movie had its fair share of laughoutloud moments that kept the audience entertained throughout    in conclusion the new super mario bros movie successfully captures the spirit of the beloved video game franchise delivering a fun and enjoyable experience for both longtime fans and newcomers while it may have some storytelling and character development shortcomings its authentic portrayal of the mario universe and charming humor make it a worthwhile watch for any mario enthusiast so gather your friends and family and get ready to embark on an entertaining nostalgic adventure with the worlds favorite plumbers
Jul 24 2023,positive,this movie was awesome of course partly due to nostalgia but also the story was very fun easy and entertaining best of all there was no woke agenda
Jul 24 2023,positive,its a great family movie a great adaptation with humor and a story definitely recommend
Jul 24 2023,positive,i loved the mario movie its a movie that feels like a mario movie having a bunch of references to old games and new and even sometimes other games that arent mario yeah the story is fast and everything is to simple but thats another thing i love about it its being what it is for a mario movie story mario games stories have always been simple and not over complicated like other games franchises fnaf kirby and tloz its a nice fun movie but i hate cranky kong in this movie
Jul 24 2023,positive,funny faithful to the source material amazing music and great voice acting not to mention that the movie looks stunning mario is one of the popular and recognizable ips ever and currently to me this movie does such a great service to the mario and nintendo lure i enjoyed this movie thoroughly and it was a fun watch with the kids the story is ok but this movie was not only meant to celebrate mario but to make money and so with the exception of a handful of characters theres a lot going on in this movie and a bunch of it feels like its just to sell toys at the end of the day its still a great movie and something that can be enjoye many times over 
Jul 24 2023,positive,the kiddos loved this one but i found the opening with the dog to be the funniest part this kept a toddlers attention
Jul 24 2023,positive,so good better critics are special as they need to pull their head out of their butt they probs dont get any action movie is so goated a good way to adapt a video game into a movie form thx illumination and nintendo for making this masterpiece i salute you good sir
Jul 23 2023,positive,young fans will have a blast
Jul 23 2023,positive,strong 910 for me really enjoyed to watch great music much action stunning graphics without drama light comedy
Jul 23 2023,positive,fun nostalgic and doesnt outstay its welcome
Jul 23 2023,neutral,the animation was good and all but the story was a bit too short dont you think and it wasnt as good as i expected but dont get me wrong it was a great movie
Jul 23 2023,positive,i loved the movie it had good plot the scenes between mario and donkey kong were so amazing
Jul 23 2023,positive,awesome game movie ever sorry sonic fans but marios gonna be better
Jul 23 2023,positive,if you were born in the 80s and grew up on mario in the 90s you will love this movie nostalgia and big smiles throughout
Jul 23 2023,positive,this was better than the live action one
Jul 23 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is an amazing experience for every moviegoer especially for mario fans of any kind there is numerous little easter eggs for people that just played the original game in 1985 or people that have played mario odyssey along with the many other games most of the voice actors are on point especially jack black as bowser even chris pratt as mario does a pretty good job as for the supporting cast such as luigi toad and donkey kong they all add a different layer to this movie the only big flaw is the plot if your here for amazing storytelling you wont get that there isnt any huge problems with the plot its just a little basic and there can be pacing issues with the hour and a half runtime if your here to find an excellently animated movie that puts a smile on your face until the credits that is what youre going to get
Jul 23 2023,positive,the characters are vibrant  the plot is simple and enjoyable  voice acting is on point  animation is great
Jul 23 2023,positive,this movie is nice for kids and elders that grew up with mario this adaptation is perfect with peach and marios relationship growing this movie is a 55 for everyone i recommend it
Jul 23 2023,positive,best movie ever i would rewatch this ten times
Jul 23 2023,positive,the best movie i watched also i watched it 5 days after it released and late review lol
Jul 22 2023,positive,it was perfect perfect
Jul 22 2023,positive,all around fun movie with very solid visuals the whole cast surprisingly does well despite the backlash they got when casted the movie didnt feel long and while it was catered towards kids it still was a movie you can see as an adult and enjoy the only negative really was the plot felt kinda basic but besides that it was just a good time and i left feeling satisfied
Jul 22 2023,positive,this movie could not be more fun for the kids as an adult i can see some obvious flaws but my kids loved it
Jul 22 2023,positive,amazing movie way better than the barbie movie so im not sure why its rated lower but the audience score speaks for itself if you have kids this is the movie to watch the barbie movie was just awe full with a terrible feminist agenda if it existed in the mario movie it would have been reunited but glad nintendo didnt allow it
Jul 22 2023,positive,i couldnt stop smiling the whole movie they made me recall the happiness and all the good memories of my childhood while playing this game in the nes and snes thanks for making me happy again
Jul 22 2023,positive,its a movie to turn off your brain and enjoy the characters and its ok this movie dont need to be a masterpiece
Jul 22 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches i love yooouuu
Jul 22 2023,positive,solid entertainment its pretty much what you think it is
Jul 22 2023,positive,this movie is grouch rated but i will debunk more bad reviewers because they retaliated by being so grouchy grumpy and rude to everything and everyone i watched almost the end of the movie at my school and with my family on tv i like this movie
Jul 22 2023,positive,while visually appealing and a decent story the voice and dialogue was not good  jack black was the only good casting choice  the rest just do not have the voice or voice talent for this  go way arcane to see what voice actors should sound like  also why was the music of such poor quality
Jul 22 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie it was well made you cant go wrong with illumination and nintendo giving the green light great movie
Jul 22 2023,positive,its a really good movie thats for sure watched it the day after it came out it did feel a bit short in my opinion like there was just too much content to squeeze in the time frame the storyline felt a bit rushed they tried to fit a lot of ideas into it which i do respect because i think they where right and a lot of them were really good however i do i feel like it could have either benefited to be slightly longer of a movie or perhaps split into two parts given the majority of the audience is probably too young to have the attention span for it anyways nevertheless its still a really solid film and if youre looking for something to watch id give it a shot
Jul 21 2023,positive,the references animation voice acting and world building are amazing however there is a lot of filler throughout the film the construction of the story is precarious and the plot is not good either despite that i still really enjoyed it however while admittedly a little unnecessary i really enjoyed watching the film it is dynamic and nostalgic despite nintendo jointly with illumination having created it to leverage sales of their products so overall a solid 710 movie should be watched by mario fans but might not be for everyone else    portuguêsbrasil  as referências animação dublagem e construção do mundo são incríveis porem há muito filler ao decorrer do filme a construção da historia é precária e o enredo também não é bom apesar disso eu ainda gostei muito todavia embora reconhecidamente meio desnecessário eu realmente gostei de assistir o filme ele é dinâmico e nostálgico apesar da nitendo em conjunto da illumination têlo criado para alavancar as vendas de seus produtos  portanto no geral um filme sólido de 710 deve ser observado pelos fãs de mario mas pode não ser para todos os outros
Jul 21 2023,neutral,the talent of this movie lies in the way its designed to be the ultimate people pleaser something that shouldnt be surprising considering it was made by illumination it wont make you cry it will make you laugh but not too hard it has songs everyone has been proved to love plus a great song by jack black its not scary dramatic neither does it have a deep message or reflection its trying to convey    it is the definition of a run of the mill mass produced pop corn movie which its box office clearly depicts
Jul 21 2023,positive,this movie is great for the fans new and old  and its the greatest video game adaptation of all time
Jul 20 2023,neutral,it was an ok movie for me
Jul 20 2023,positive,this movie is amazing i love how all the characters were portrayed jack black is great at protraying bowser
Jul 20 2023,positive,good movie full of nostalgia for me this character no series has been there in my childhood for years
Jul 20 2023,positive,very good nice to watch woth family peaches pezches
Jul 19 2023,positive,the animation in the movie is amazing our favorite nintendo characters on the big screen loved every minute of this movie and look forward to the next
Jul 19 2023,positive,despite the fact that this film is imperfect as can be and that it has many areas for improvement i cannot deny that as i sat watching everything that happened on the screen i could not help but smile and let myself be carried away by the journey that this film has to offer all the winks references tributes fights stunning designs charismatic characters and the heart that the film has make it possible for one to enjoy and enjoy something that personally has always been very special to me its certainly one of the best video game movies as theres a genuine respect for this universe and these characters theres a lot of heart here the movie more than being good or bad made me go back to those days when as a 4yearold boy i played super mario 64 all day without stopping that feeling and those moments are something that i will always keep in my heart
Jul 19 2023,positive,if you like supah mario you will like the movie
Jul 19 2023,positive,very nostalgic brought back so many memories impossible not to enjoy music was excellent couldve been longer
Jul 19 2023,positive,hit all the nostalgia points but lacked a riveting plot
Jul 19 2023,positive,a very nice movie adaptation of my childhoods favourite video game visually it was stunning i like the inclusion of several easter eggs from my beloved video game then the presence of donkey kong and how he was represented was very enjoyable jack black was a fun bowser too maybe the role of princess peach was a little bit exaggerated but i understand that now in hollywood the image of the damsel who needs to be rescued is no longer accepted oddly luigi took that role anyway apart from this the authors were smart enough to stay quite faithful to the amazing source material i cant wait to see the sequel
Jul 18 2023,positive,are critics just dumb or what ether ways it was a great movie it was fast paced but i still recommend it
Jul 18 2023,positive,its hard to ignore the grandiosity of the mario bros movies visuals the colours are vibrant the stunts and visual effects are ambitious and massive in scale and most importantly it all works its so exhilarating to watch it almost makes up for some of my concerns about the movie my biggest one being that while it quite successfully distracts from the movies simplistic writing it unfortunately doesnt overshadow it too many dialogues follow a familiar pattern and even the plot arc isnt exactly ingenious even though the movie picks up in the second half and absolutely breaks into a good kind of chaos were back to tame and predictable in the end however to the movies credit a lot of its comedy lies not in the writing but in the character antics and it makes for an enjoyable watch it gives a lot of the characters more personality and it elicited a healthy amount of laughs from me on another note the soundtrack is a bit busy but fun nonetheless the voiceacting is charismatic and the animation literally pops overall id say the super mario bros movie is a win
Jul 18 2023,positive,its actually really good has that pixardisney vibe which is surprising went into this thinking it will be alright and mostly fan service nope a genuinely good original movie nintendo and illumination have hit it out of the park with this one they absolutely need to make more
Jul 18 2023,positive,1010 i dont even play mario games that much but this was amazing not just because of nostalgia but it was fun had great characters and great acting
Jul 18 2023,positive,the first video game film adaptation by illumination chose brothers mario and luigi italianamerican plumbers who are transported to an alternate world and become entangled in a battle between the mushroom kingdom led by princess peach and the koopas led by bowser a straightforward animated movie with a very clear and enjoyable storyline that appeals to nostalgia from beginning to end it is visually gorgeous and the inclusion of so many nintendo characters and easter eggs here and there is stunning the song peaches may be overrated but it is just funny a very safe effort in general from illumination but its box office numbers are really amazing also maybe stop casting chris pratt as the lead he sounds the same in everything on the contrary jack black was great as bowser and the character is the best part of the film
Jul 18 2023,positive,this movie is without question amazing for children older watchers who grew up with super mario cant have very negative feelings about the movie its simple and has some really great moments song writing and animation was also top tier only issue i see is the movie being overly simple although thats a positive in some cases i do see some watchers being bored due to this 910 movie though
Jul 18 2023,negative,peach song should have had fart sound effects and it should have played throughput the entire movie as i dont feel like it had enough screen time also bowser should have had bigger abs
Jul 18 2023,positive,waluigi wasnt in the movie peach was kinda hot tho i ate a crunchwrap from taco bell before watching it mario shouldve had a bakery if u know what i mean 
Jul 18 2023,positive,this movie is great for all of the people who cherish this iconic video game franchise
Jul 17 2023,positive,other than the poor pacing this movie was amazing
Jul 17 2023,positive,ill admit i didnt think this movie was going to be good when i saw the critic reviews then i saw it in the theaters and i was completely blown away this movie is actually really good and probably illuminations best movie so far as a major mario fanboy i was very impressed with the recreation of the mushroom kingdom and all the cool easter eggs to not just mario but nintendo in general the voice acting is really good especially jack black as bowser he absolutely killed it as bowser i actually felt sorry for him when peach rejected him its fun for kids and adults who were fans of the game as kids so unsurprisingly this movie made over a billion dollars dont pay attention to the critics who rated this movie low these critics probably havent played a single mario game in their entire lives this is for the fans and i highly recommend you watch it the visuals are also incredible and the action is good also peaches is a hilarious and surprisingly good song
Jul 17 2023,negative,the movie in the técnic part was amazing  but i felt the story very weak  there was not a complex story  and i didnt enjoy it too much
Jul 17 2023,positive,i think im in the minority for this one specifically because im not the biggest mario fan
Jul 17 2023,positive,amazing as soon as we got out of the movie the kids wanted to enter to the cinema again it was fun it was marios world the soundtracks amazing the characters super i love peach so i 1010
Jul 17 2023,negative,o man i wanted to like the movie just because of mario but thats not mario what the heck is up with the voice in all the games he doesnt have that voice but here he does the princess is the one doing the saving hahaha nothing here reminds us of mario but they want to milk the nostalgia but it doesnt match anything we remember failed movie
Jul 17 2023,negative,you cant help but feel they knew this would make buckets of money no matter what so they diddnt even bother putting in much effort
Jul 17 2023,negative,just like most other chis pratt films   he absolutely packs a theater and by some extraordinary measure disappoints us every single time
Jul 17 2023,positive,finally a good animated movie the movie is so well made its funny entertaining and perfect for anyone to watch the jokes are clever and i enjoyed all the reference they made to the games and how the incorporated everything i think this is a movie that you will show your kids and they will show to their kids and so on definitely recommend hopefully we get more animated movies like this
Jul 17 2023,negative,literally the worst pacing ive ever seen you cant connect with any of the characters its all fan service with no effort out into it to make it an enjoyable movie for normal people
Jul 16 2023,positive,nintendo appears to be here to stay after the shopping success this movie has had over the past couple of weeks i wouldnt mind an ncu lol im sure youve already heard the common complaints with this one the story is generic and some of the voice acting is just average i can agree with these sentiments aside from that i have to say that i really enjoyed the ride overall seth rogen was the main one that i didnt like the rest of the voice cast was fine the story is what it is weve played the games for many years so what were we expecting i wish mario and luigi were together more because its so much more fun when they are    its not perfect but it captures the nintendo magic and has plenty of easter eggs throughout for fan service thats really what it all comes down to it made me chuckle a couple times and even got me emotional once or twice but its all fueled by nostalgia and our already established connection to these characters id love to see another nintendo movie soon because i think they can improve on some things and make the next adventure even bigger and better
Jul 16 2023,positive,the movie was pretty ok though just because it has a thin plot doesnt necessarily mean the movie is bad
Jul 16 2023,positive,i thought the movie was very good but i think the movie should have more scenes and force some scenes but the movie is incredible
Jul 16 2023,positive,bowser is the standout in this movie
Jul 15 2023,positive,i loved this movie nostalgia happyland  i will pay to see any mario
Jul 15 2023,positive,good but forgettable movie
Jul 15 2023,positive,it was fine not great
Jul 15 2023,neutral,meh i know this is an unpopular opinion but i didnt like this movie all that much i didnt hate it but even as someone growing up playing mario it didnt connect with me might end up giving this another try in the future but yeah
Jul 15 2023,positive,honestly id say this is one of the best video game adaptations out there no wonder this made a billion dollars lol
Jul 15 2023,positive,you cant say youre a fan of mario and not love this movie the way they followed the true nature of the game  unlike that other movie  and supplied plenty of the familiar and nostalgic the soundtrack was enjoyable too chris pratt was fairly decent as mario they did a great job of making peach a true warrior and jack black was perfect as bowser heres looking forward to a sequel
Jul 14 2023,positive,it was really good yes i understand the whole voice controversy but it was nostalgic for me
Jul 14 2023,positive,adult children wanted to go see as a family i had low expectations but found it thouroughly enjoyable with limited wokeness
Jul 14 2023,positive,if your a big mario fan then this is an obvious must see but if your not that big of a mario fan like me then this is just a fun movie to pass the time the visuals are stunning compared to illuminations other movies like sing and the secret life of pets over all i really recommend this
Jul 14 2023,positive,once again this proves that this so called critics are nothing but ignorant boring woke political racist hasbeens the movie is fantastic but it doesnt have enough blackwashing homosexuals or females for these sjw pathetic morons
Jul 14 2023,positive,for those who grew up playing nintendo games in any console or format the super mario bros movie is an exciting and new yet nostalgic experience within cinema as i had hoped you can really tell that the movie was written with heart and those who appreciated the franchise overall i would consider the film very fun while the film doesnt resent a deep and enriching plot i find that the lighthearted tone suited it much better would recommend
Jul 14 2023,positive,this movie was a phenomenal masterpieceso many vibrant colors and several humorous scenesvery good animationdespite its low critic scoreits a must seehighly recommend
Jul 13 2023,positive,as a huge nintendo fan and i have been a fan since the very beginning with the original nintendo that being said my family loved and grew up with nintendo we would all play together and get the new next console as it came out so hearing about a mario movie was so exciting yet very nervous cause all previous mario movies werent that great but this movie they did sooo good i absolutely loved how they have taken mario from the beginning and brought each and every part of him into the movie  it was so funny and cute i am definitely buying the dvd and its now in my top 10 movies

Jul 12 2023,positive,a fun and wonderful adaptation of a beloved video game series that is full of heart its not the most complex plot but it also doesnt need to be after all its about a pair of new york plumbers who get sucked into the magical mushroom kingdom who then must save a princess from an evil dragonturtle thing
Jul 11 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches
Jul 11 2023,positive,a love letter to all mario fans great references good story great cast and spectacular animation
Jul 11 2023,positive,while it may be inaccurate i thought it was a good choice to have ilumination pick jack black as bowser though we never even got to see fire mario which is sad but we also learned that other people can also use the fire flower i heard they are making a dk spinoff lets hope that movie will be good
Jul 11 2023,positive,super mario bros is fun fastpaced occasionally frenetic ride that devotes much of its effort to bringing these video game worlds including donkey kong and mario kart to life lovingly embracing the games many silly details while skating by on very thin plotting great casting jack black as bowser kmk as toad etc levelup the humor and help remind viewers that this is a video game adaptation not to be taken too seriously
Jul 11 2023,positive,now this is a true classic game adaptation full of enjoyable adventures and fun till the end with decent story
Jul 11 2023,positive,so fun and exciting illumination has made another fun adventure this movie is special though the animation is great and the story is like the games but added more to it
Jul 11 2023,positive,the critics are full of crap this movie is my favorite ever i feel those critics that gave it bad reviews should retire they sound too old to accurately rate this kind of movie it is just plain fun something they dont seem to like
Jul 11 2023,positive,i watched this movie 2wice at the theater 3 months ago lets review shall we this is without a doubt illuminations best movie of all time where do i even begin theres alot that i like from this movie i like how the voiceactors acting to the characters with chris pratt as mario seth rogen as donkey kong dk jack black as bowser charlie day as luigi anyataylor joy as princess peach km key as toad etc i like how we get to see mario amp luigis family i also like the actions like from anything to do with the games especially the mario kart scene i hope they make a sequel to this when they make a sequel i hope they put more characters in the sequel like jr toadette yoshi princess daisy princess rosalina josephkoopa troopa etc    overall a very great movie i cant wait for the 2nd to be released its definitely better than the abysmal 1993 liveaction film    rating amazing movie 100100
Jul 10 2023,positive,i love it ive watched it before
Jul 10 2023,positive,the fact of the critic score is so low is absolute insanity were they watching the same movie as the rest of us     if youre a fan of the super mario franchise youll love this movie it completely honored the spirit of the source material my kids and i all loved it the casting writing animation and design choices all of it was just spot on i think even if youre just a jack black fan its worth the watch for his portrayal of bowser that solo kills me every time
Jul 10 2023,positive,if you give anything less than a five star you are lyinggggg like why lie its so good it slays tbh
Jul 10 2023,positive,very entertaining and well made movie we all loved how they really stick to the franchise made my kids laugh and had a great time

Jul 10 2023,positive,my family and i love the mario movie
Jul 9 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics they dont know how to have fun genuinely one of birthdays ive ever had was going to see this movie in theaters for my 18th it was just as amazing as seeing jurassic world fallen kingdom in theaters for my 13th if you enjoy playing the mario games youll enjoy watching the movie just as much     i would also like to mention how well the film characterizes the two brothers seeing them interact as siblings and even with their family is something so rarely seen in the games and i think having the plot focus on rescue luigi instead of peach was absolutely the right choice keeping marios relationship to peach a b plot just really cements their brotherly love in a way most media featuring them just doesnt it feels like a fanfic in the best way possible    watch it for the fun of it for the nostalgia not for the plot do you play mario for the plot i dont think so lol
Jul 9 2023,positive,i thought first that this movie is going to be a flop kinda but was still excited to see what they actually have in store saw the teasers  trailers  heard of course jack blacks peaches masterpiece and then i watched it and it was one of my all time favourite gaming adaptations on the big screen nintendo illuminati  universal nailed it perfectly had a very fun time watching it also big shoutout to the soundtrack composers they also very well nailed the job with music of the movie just hearing all the popular mario songs being remixed  brought back to live since ages was just amazing recommend to all to watch it only downside is that the movie is short but was still a pleasure to see
Jul 9 2023,positive,the critics here shouldnt be able to rate this movie tbh ofc its not the greatest movie storywise but it doesnt have to its supposed to wake nostalgia and it did that 100
Jul 9 2023,positive,vary good but i wouldve liked it longer
Jul 9 2023,positive,absolutely amazing movie through and through it had a perfect balance of newage and nostalgia i highly recommend this movie to all
Jul 9 2023,positive,this is a must see the storyline is great with so many classic mario characters funny fast moving and overall great writing kids and parents will both love this tale of the beloved mario borthers
Jul 9 2023,positive,they dont let mario fan disappointed really fun to watch beautifully poetry the original mario game and cart racing must watch

Jul 9 2023,positive,just adorable i was pleasantly surprised
Jul 9 2023,positive,pretty cute kids movie a bit boring for adults
Jul 8 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is an overall fun time with stunning animation and a great cast of characters however it has several looming problems such as the fast pacing and shallow narrative
Jul 8 2023,positive,despite is a good movie the movie itself was a huge hit proofing the critics wrong for this
Jul 8 2023,positive,if youre a fan of mario nintendo or gaming in general this is a great video game movie adaptation fun quirky and exciting love the callbacks to all of the nintendo characters
Jul 8 2023,positive,1110 music was perfect beautiful visuals a little fast paced but included everything i could have ever wanted from the movie honestly think that the brooklyn accent was a much better choice than an italian one extremely cute story the chemistry between mario and luigi is amazing
Jul 8 2023,negative,no real reason to watch it unless you like the whole this is a video game movie and has reference to said video game could of been better if the movie was longer and had plot development and not just plot convenance
Jul 8 2023,positive,overall great movie packed with nostalgia for nintendo fans however the story was lacking and some of the characters are hard to connect with
Jul 8 2023,positive,this movie has so many characters and the story is for the first movie from nintendo okay the second one will much better im sure
Jul 7 2023,positive,this movie was worth the wait for 3 12 decades it was surprising funny and heartwarming cant wait for more
Jul 7 2023,positive,good for the kids butt lacked plot this film should have had more feeling a message
Jul 7 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches peachespeaches
Jul 7 2023,positive,so cute and fun loved all the references to the original video games the storyline worked well and i was never bored
Jul 7 2023,positive,a must see full of laughs thrills and nostalgia from the game and a handful of surprise cameos from the true mustachio plumbers game voice actor himselfcharles martinet
Jul 7 2023,positive,love it very funny and child friendly best animated move ever
Jul 7 2023,positive,i love this movie  almost every joke made me laugh that accomplishment to do  the movie looks amazing
Jul 7 2023,positive,super mario bros was a lot of fun the star of the film has to be jack black as bowser which was hilarious and menacing i enjoyed chris pratt anya taylorjoy charlie day and seth rogen in their casted roles were perfect animation was great and the story is still fun for the family universalillumination is the king of animation
Jul 7 2023,positive,every moment of this movie was a blast so many great refrences to the video games too strongly recommend if you are a fan of the games
Jul 7 2023,positive,so much fun family friendly this is something my wife and i enjoyed love all the easter eggs and would have no problems letting our kid watch again and again
Jul 7 2023,positive,as a fan of this franchise for years this was a highly enjoyable movie that took the aspects of the games and did a fantastic job putting them on screen with great storytelling i would absolutely recommend
Jul 6 2023,positive,mario in a go cart riding around on a rainbow road that what i came to see and that is what a got it was a super cute movie and kept the kids so entertained  it was a win for my family
Jul 6 2023,positive,its fun feels like playing the game and million times better than the last movie attempt it is a little short
Jul 6 2023,positive,this movie is the best adaptation of video game that ive seen the voice acting is unrecognizable which is so surprising because this is a star studded cast my faults are since the movie is not that long its too fast paced in areas i never thought i would ever say too much easter eggs but they are very excessive one after the another im so ready for the next mario movie this one was a great origin story for him and luigi also other mario based characters showing separate worlds as in bowsers world and donkey kongs rating 810
Jul 6 2023,positive,alright this movie first up critics are quite wrong movie critics i mean movie audience critics are quite correct but there are flaws so this movie has a bunch of flaws but it also has tons of fun the acting is quite good the story is basic but good the villain is really good so there are many fun parts and id say those overcome the negatives its definitely flawed but for a mario movie its quite solid id say in general this movie is something kids would enjoy the most adults and teens probably not so much i really liked the donkey kong fight i think that was quite funny and cool i also liked bowser singing that was really good the beginning of the movie was really solid too my favorite part was probably the final fight man that was fun seeing both mario and luigi take down bowser without a problem really fun stuff but the negatives some parts feel a bit boring or weird or in general just unnecessary its definitely got the flaws but i think the positives overcome this gonna have to disagree with the critics here i will say i wouldnt recommend it to everyone id say kids will love this movie the most teens probably too adults can definitely enjoy it too i think the critic rating was just a bit unfair if i could i would probably tone down the audience rating a bit and would definitely increase the critic rating but thats about it its just a fun movie nothing else overall its good  id recommend it
Jul 6 2023,positive,incredible no politics no reality just a fun fun movie
Jul 6 2023,positive,the movie is on the right foot the plot is good so much nods to the games like the cat suit and mini mushroom and the a button on big red button because thats the button you press to select your car in all mario kart games and this little nod from the games keep coming its endless and i love but the problem is that some characters should had more screen time like luigi but the the but nods from the games save the review to eel from mario 64 and king boo and king babomb this is a great movie
Jul 6 2023,positive,this is an amazing movie with funny moments and tons of references this is the best movie of 2023
Jul 6 2023,positive,great and entertaining film
Jul 6 2023,positive,if you grew up playing the games you will enjoy all the little easter eggs throughout the movie some see bowsers behavior as bullying mean or even creepyso this is a good tool for talking with your kids about what not to behave like i loved the action the story and the giggles throughout it was a perfect movie to depict super mario world i hope there is more
Jul 6 2023,positive,loved the easter eggs only issue was some parts could have been longer to develop the story
Jul 5 2023,positive,the film was good the best illumination film
Jul 5 2023,positive,actually awesome highly recommended
Jul 5 2023,positive,while the plot may be straight forward and simple the world of super mario bros still packs a punch while servicing fans of the games throughout the series 45
Jul 5 2023,positive,this movie is an exercise in giving the people what they want there were a number of times i almost stood up in the theater to cheer on the heroes but for almost the entire movie there was a smile on my face pure enjoyment
Jul 5 2023,positive,i really loved this movie and i loved the easter eggs and i especially loved how it played mr blue sky at the end because its my favorite song and its in guardians of the galaxy and chris pratt plays star lord
Jul 5 2023,positive,the animation is great and the voice actors while questionable delivered strongly highly recommend if you are a mario fan
Jul 5 2023,positive,this is the best animated film ive ever seen its enjoyable for the younger generation with all the action and for the older generation due to it having so many easter eggs and throwbacks to the old super mario games and even some other nintendo games theres really nothing wrong with it other then the amount of screen time luigi got but im not gonna complain about that
Jul 5 2023,positive,i liked the movie i saw it in theaters the day it came out and i was really surprised with how turned out compared to other video game movies it stayed true to the games and i respect illumination for that but it did feel a little rushed actually it kinda was rushed i get they didnt want to spend too much time in brooklyn but they couldve shown more of what mario and luigi did while they lived there it seems they showed luigi as a type of filler for it but overall i would recommend
Jul 5 2023,positive,pros  its very entertaining to watch  all the voice actors did a pretty good job  the animation is pretty  luigi and bowser were the best characters  this movie felt like a true love letter to mario fans  i really liked the blue shell koopa for some reason  cons  it has a very weak story  the pacing felt way too fast  luigi only gets like 5 minutes of screen time
Jul 5 2023,positive,this movie is definitely for the family all kids and adults should enjoy the story line and visual effects 
Jul 5 2023,positive,a fun homage to every step in a long varied beloved franchise
Jul 5 2023,positive,amazing adaptation they capture the spirit characters and soul of the game
Jul 5 2023,positive,the movie was ok i think it was too short i wish it wouldve been a bit longer and i also think the plot couldve used a bit more work all in all its a good movie to pass the time left wanting more though but not because it was good but because it was lacking
Jul 4 2023,positive,a very good movie dont be fooled that it is made by illumitation a company for children because this movie is very well made and very controlled by nintendo full of references such as voices objects or even the own soundtrack for me a 10
Jul 4 2023,positive,well done obviously this is a kids movie but its not one of the ones that make adults want to rip their eyes out my daughter and i enjoyed it she would see it again which is a reliable indicator and of course peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
Jul 4 2023,positive,im not the biggest mario fan im not the biggest video game fan in general i know some of the lore because i have had gamer friends for years but i have no attachment to the mario franchise thus i went into the super mario brothers movie with very few expectations but came out having had a fun time  the animation is really good most of the voice acting well done and even as someone who knows very little about mario the fan service works really well  but the comedy is very hit or miss a lot of the already existing music feels very forced and the story feels very predictable  still though predictable and safe isnt necessarily a bad thing especially when the main goal is just to offer a fun time for families and fans of the franchise and nothing more and considering this does just that its not bad
Jul 4 2023,positive,the video game movie curse is well and truly lifted with this brilliant entry   at its best it sores with lego movie feel and vibe to its pacing humour and style   however you cant help but feel that it spends a little to much time world building then just telling us an engaging story   we dont want to be thinking about the nintendo expanded  universe till after the credits have rolled   holding back certain characters from the classic series is a grate way to almost guarantee  we will  return once again to the mushroom kingdom   but the ending was far to similar to that of films like sonic with a predicable big boss fight like the end of every mario game   perhaps a fresher way of ending the movie could have got that final shiny star from me as a five star classic but i think 4 is more then fair for the plumbers first outing   a special mention must go out to the bathroom dog animation scene team i could have watched a whole film stating that new character and his what i hope to be on going rivalry with the mario brothers
Jul 4 2023,positive,one of the bestanimated movies of all time  its aladdin and super mario 4 and a half stars
Jul 4 2023,positive,great movie with great animation
Jul 4 2023,positive,so i didnt have high hopes for this movie i think mario was the least interesting character in this one everyone else really pulls it together otherwise the references and easter eggs all through the movie will be really nostalgic to anyone who grew up with nintendo in the late 80s and the 90s    overall worth a watch but most likely not multiple viewings
Jul 4 2023,positive,well done exactly what the mario fans needed thanks
Jul 3 2023,neutral,i do love the idea but the movie is so safe that its almost hard to watch at some times it can just feel like an ad rather which is unfortunate due to the insane cast and incredible history of the franchise
Jul 3 2023,positive,if there is any message to be taken from the super mario bros movie it is this what a fortune a privilege a joy it is to have had such an experience it leaves me hopeful that as a community  as a world  there is time for us to become our greatest selves as great as we ever could dream of in our wildest most ambitious visions for a brighter future
Jul 3 2023,positive,its visually stunning the storyline is terrible but everything else the nostalgia the sounds the expert visuals takes a 2 star story to a 4 star movie if youre looking to sit back and just immerse yourself in your youth watch this
Jul 3 2023,positive,it was perfect everything was perfect i have zero complaints about this change the 58 to at least 80
Jul 3 2023,positive,fun clean family movie thought chris pratt would bomb on this but all the children really liked it a lot not a lot of crude humor or smutty inside adult jokes jack black is hilarious as bowser nintendo should be proud mainstream cinema critics may not like this one but it is a hit simply a funny iconic childrens movie that doesnt try and go political woke on children great
Jul 3 2023,positive,absolutely loved it  being a cartoon movie based on a popular video game it also delivers an important message to the audience that one should never give up even if ur family and ur enemies lose hope in u and think ur no good
Jul 3 2023,neutral,im split on the hand i do like jack blacks bowser and charlie days luigi and the chase on rainbow road was well put together and was some great entertainment but as a whole the story and characters could be much stronger than they actually are 
Jul 3 2023,positive,pretty good as far as most movies today go the references were spot on worst thing honestly was just seth rogan
Jul 3 2023,positive,the mario movie is a great movie the animation the voices are great the nostalgic sensation that i got when i watched it was great and i loved it my only problem is the plot is pretty basic but it doesnt need to be some multi movie plot to be good and this movie proves it
Jul 3 2023,positive,very good kind friendly move
Jul 3 2023,positive,it was a amazing moviei was surprised how well chris pratts voice as mario turned outi loved jack blacks voice as bowser wasit really fits to into itand it was the first movie i watch in the theatre                                                       i cant understand the rotten tomatoes critics put
Jul 3 2023,positive,if youve ever played a mario game you will enjoy this movie
Jul 2 2023,positive,this movie was awesome from start to finish a breath of fresh air zero political bs zero agenda pushing zero bs cliches just nonstop family friendly fun this is an awesome movie
Jul 2 2023,positive,perfectly fun movie dont shy away if your worry is chris pratts mario voice great cast and performances all around
Jul 2 2023,negative,my thoughts on the movie    bad           story was boring and basic           voice acting was horrible except for                 bowser            most jokes fell flat             mario did not have to rescue           princess peach as he does in the          game    good                animation was beautiful                 great references                  peaches song was good
Jul 2 2023,positive,the music and story line followed along with classic nintendo game   some violence and mention of death
Jul 2 2023,positive,this is the colest movie because bowser was awesome that makes the mario movie the top movie of 2023
Jul 2 2023,positive,greta for kids and adults too fast paced with no dull moments my kids first movie in the theatre
Jul 2 2023,positive,surprisingly a pretty good movie full of fun references
Jul 2 2023,positive,the critics score for this is laughable  was an absolute blast  full of fun and nostalgia it appealed to older guys like me and also to younger audiences as my daughter absolutely loves this movie
Jul 2 2023,positive,great movie for all ages
Jul 2 2023,positive,its an exception movie for children and an ok movie for adults the movie has a great plot and is extremely wellmade but the ending feels a little shallow
Jul 2 2023,positive,the mario movie is just about what youd expect a mario movie to be the plot is rather juvenile and uninteresting and over all it is basically just the heros journey but with the mario characters the casting choices are pretty good chris pratt did a better job than i think most thought he would but i have to say jack black did the best job the movie was also filled with many fun references to the mario games which were fun to notice over all this movie is fun but has little content to the story
Jul 2 2023,positive,extremely fun movie have seen it twice in theaters love the story and in particular the charaterization of bowzer his song is the best also love the development of princess peach not too crazy or overbearing overall fun romp with tons of easter eggs
Jul 2 2023,positive,really cute animation and i like how they could put a lot of games versions in just ine movie but i foind the story generic although its a fun movie to watch
Jul 1 2023,positive,i dont know what does chritics have in head but this one is way awsome and way better than the version of 1993 because that one is garbage and this one just like luigi said thats cinema
Jul 1 2023,positive,saw this movie three times in the theaters it brings back memories from childhood and nostalgia moments
Jul 1 2023,positive,my kids loved it the vivid colors were amazing but the story line was lacking
Jul 1 2023,positive,absolutely amazing i would definitely see it again
Jul 1 2023,positive,while this isnt a great overall film its a must see experience for any mario fan
Jul 1 2023,neutral,nostalgic entertainment decent acting but the plot is pretty basic and the jokes arent anything to write home about plenty of better options out there for kids movies
Jul 1 2023,positive,all the nostalgia to keep me smiling and all of the new storyline to keep the kids and the whole family engaged plus jack black absolutely killed it as bowser  peaches
Jul 1 2023,positive,super fun movie we all loved it 4yo 10yo 13yo and parents
Jul 1 2023,positive,absolutely insane this movie is so much fun even if youre not a mario fan youll enjoy it
Jul 1 2023,negative,the mario movie is one of the worst and most bland films i have ever had the displeasure of watching in theaters   pros the animation is quite good the voice acting was all right  cons the movies plot and pacing was god awfull i hear the argument that  its mario mario isnt supposed to have a plot being thrown around quite   often in defense of this movie however plot should come first over anything else  if you dont have a worth while story to tell than your movie is inherently flawed  the mario movie is a boring film only made to be a cashgrab
Jul 1 2023,positive,it is incredible amzing and nostalgic it made me almost cry with all the memories funny slow and fast paced at the same time battles and romance all together a must see for all nintendo fans long term and new it is a great movie for all ages perfect length so your kids dont get bored at all no blood or innappropiate scenes it is just pure magic it will make you cry laugh jump up and down in excitement and aww it is the perfect description for a perfect movie also peaches the song is incredible i laughcried nonstop through the whole movie you will also most definitely get the biggest goosebumps even if the oldest nintendo game youve played is super mario 2 imagine what it would feel if you were in the 1980s     my dad fell in love with the movie and said it was 100 10 times better than the crappy sonic the slowasfwordhedgehog movies      truly recommend watching the mario movie  by a true nintendo fan
Jul 1 2023,positive,es retraining and nostalgic 
Jun 30 2023,positive,great for kids and adults rich storyline amazing animation would see over and over again
Jun 30 2023,positive,a lot of fun and easter eggs
Jun 30 2023,positive,charming movie for the whole family children will love it adults will love it finally a fun version of a video game which respects the video game is that the formula is simple this is one of those movies that will be repeated many times not only in cinema but also by steaming enjoy the passion of the cinema be a child again eat a lot of popcorn drink a lot of soda
Jun 30 2023,positive,overall this is an excellent animated film with a lot of nostalgia
Jun 30 2023,positive,this movie is perfect for fans of mario and kids but not for anyone else
Jun 30 2023,positive,so many references to nintendo and mario what critics say is wrong its a kids movie so the pacing will be fast but amazing movie
Jun 30 2023,positive,loved it 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐭𝐟 𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐭 𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧 i loved it
Jun 30 2023,positive,a fun movie that isnt very deep it has a lot of member berries but i thought it was excusable because the movie is not ment to be a rich and plot filled story the animation is great and is a short and fun adventure that is true to mario
Jun 30 2023,negative,as a life long mario fab i wanted to love this movie but simply its to fast no character development and really no story only watch if you like mario
Jun 30 2023,positive,this movie is the bomb like literally its the best movie ever the acting was phenomenal but jack black oh my god he was the goat i rate this movie 1010 100 must absolutely see this movie
Jun 30 2023,positive,accomplishes everything it should have doesnt have a bloated runtime with needless exposition and dialogue harkens back to popular video game mechanics without shoving it in your face kids will enjoy it parents will at minimum be able to tolerate it and it will boost sales for merchandise and games
Jun 30 2023,positive,this was a fun family film it was an entertaining experience illumination does an outstanding job with the visuals the voice cast was great overall  however i did feel like the movie couldve taken more risks instead of taking it the easy route but overall illumination and nintendo bring us a very good video game movie that can be enjoyed with the whole family
Jun 30 2023,positive,loved everything about this movie chris pratt absolutely crushed the roll will be watching it a few more times
Jun 30 2023,negative,its so borring i dont enjoy it
Jun 30 2023,positive,this is a movie for mario fan exactly it was fun and interesting as a mario fans watching this movie is fun listening to the music it was goosebumb
Jun 30 2023,positive,loved everything about it except i wish it was longer the way they incorporate different aspects of the video game into the movie was unique and really fun to watch   jack black is great
Jun 29 2023,positive,i thought the movie would be terrible but it was actually amazing must see
Jun 29 2023,positive,very well done super funny spot on with video game and best of all it was not hollywood trying to teach us something but rather entertain us which is all they are really good for other wise they would have important jobs like the rest of us no wholeness here just good fun no wonder the critics hated it
Jun 29 2023,positive,this was such a cute movie my kids and i loved it and literally cant get the peaches song out of our heads lol cant wait to get some money together to go visit mario world 
Jun 29 2023,positive,this movie does just about everything youd want it to the action scenes are electric the characters are all likeable funny and distinct the jokes land more often than not and the animation is beautiful every frame has something interesting going as well as being colourful and visually engaging every voice actor brings their a game i was as shocked as anyone that chris pratt as mario and seth rogan as donkey kong actually kind of work and i dont think anyone was surprised by charlie day or jack black nailing their roles while i did play the games nostalgia played no role in my enjoyment i absolutely recommend especially if youre a fan of the games
Jun 29 2023,positive,jack  black  main  reason
Jun 28 2023,positive,the soundtrack  the visuals  the characters   jack effing black  good movie nuff said
Jun 28 2023,positive,i liked how it had drifting mechanic from mario cart and all the characters designs   were amazingand the  voices 
Jun 28 2023,positive,i loved it a fun movie from start til end
Jun 28 2023,positive,this movie is very nostalgic and fun to watch i was very happy how they protreyyed all the characters and the plot
Jun 28 2023,neutral,funny good and obviously with lot of references it is a dream for many fans but unfortunately this is not for kids they are the biggest fans of mario
Jun 28 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie 2023 a funfilled adventure with iconic characters by josé beltrán    rating  4 out of 5 stars    review  the super mario bros movie takes audiences on a delightful journey into the beloved world of nintendos iconic video game franchise directed by aaron horvath and michael jelenic this actionpacked adventure is brimming with humor heart and an allstar cast    chris pratt steps into the shoes of the famous italianamerican plumber mario bringing his charisma and comedic timing to the role anya taylorjoy shines as princess peach displaying both grace and determination charlie day captures the endearing personality of luigi while jack black keeganmichael key seth rogen and fred armisen provide uproarious performances as the supporting characters    the films storyline follows mario and luigi as they navigate a series of unexpected events from their humble beginnings in brooklyn to being transported to the mushroom kingdom and the dark lands the brothers face formidable challenges while trying to save princess peach from the clutches of the villainous bowser played by an impressive and largerthanlife presence    the movie strikes a balance between nostalgia for fans of the game series and introducing the mushroom kingdom to a wider audience the film captures the spirit of the games incorporating familiar elements such as warp pipes powerups and memorable characters like toad and donkey kong it successfully blends the whimsical charm of the source material with a fresh and engaging narrative    the visual effects are stunning with vibrant and colorful worlds brought to life on the big screen the mushroom kingdom and the dark lands are beautifully realized showcasing the imaginative design and attention to detail the action sequences are exhilarating particularly the kart racing scenes and the thrilling confrontation between mario and bowser    while the film primarily focuses on the adventure and excitement it also explores themes of friendship heroism and the importance of family the dynamic between mario and luigi is heartwarming highlighting the bond between brothers peachs journey from an orphaned child to a leader in the mushroom kingdom adds depth to her character and the conflict between mario and bowser provides an interesting exploration of rivalry and personal growth    one minor drawback of the film is the pacing as some scenes could have been trimmed to maintain a tighter narrative flow however this is a minor quibble compared to the overall enjoyment provided by the film    in conclusion the super mario bros movie is a delightful and entertaining adaptation that successfully captures the essence of the beloved video game franchise with a talented cast stunning visuals and a charming storyline it offers a funfilled adventure for fans and newcomers alike strap on your red caps and get ready to embark on a nostalgic and whimsical journey into the mushroom kingdom

Jun 28 2023,positive,its a me supa mario in theaters wahooo
Jun 28 2023,positive,we waited to buy the bluraydvd to see this movie this this is the mario movie weve been waiting for it was absolutely fantastic so much fun my family my friends and i all watched it together we loved it there are so many easter eggs and references to look out for that got us all super excited the nostalgia of this movie is mind blowing my family and i have already watched it multiple times     jack black is phenomenal as always just and absolute legend he really brought all his greatness to the bowser character nobody else couldve done it any better
Jun 28 2023,positive,the most amazing movie ive ever seen
Jun 28 2023,positive,please put it 75 tomatometer but with certified fresh tomato icon on it pleasethis needs to be fresh
Jun 28 2023,neutral,im surprised so many people loved this its not bad but bowser wasnt show enough and the story wasnt good but the characters were solid
Jun 28 2023,positive,well put together movie with exciting sequences would watch a sequel 
Jun 27 2023,positive,needs more jack black bowser
Jun 27 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie l really like the movie but i want to see more     kadhir alarcon
Jun 27 2023,positive,the greatest animated film based on a videogame the animation  the cast the easter eggs everything is greate
Jun 27 2023,positive,i loved the entire movie i did not expect it to be this amazing it was like a flash of my childhood into adulthood with mario and the others little hints easter eggs and jokes i caught that others did not i loved it all
Jun 27 2023,positive,i loooooove this movie ive always known about mario and sometimes played the games with my friends but now im really into the marioverse by now i know so many theories and facts and ive played so many games this movie is full of tiny details from every mariorelated product which is honestly brilliant the animation  is stunning the plot might not be the best but it is still good though and some of the songs used do not fit but the ones that are composed for the movie or are used from the games are a blast and if youre a fan and you notice an easter egg from a game or hear a recognizable music theme your heart is full of sentiment and the love for the movie grows even though the film is made for kids adults also enjoy the movie the humor is excellent and as mentioned earlier there are these classic elements from older productions that especially the older viewers can appreciate i would also like to add that the voice actors made a great job especially jack black in the role of bowser also charlie day as luigi and keeganmichael key as toad i was also surprised by how well chris pratt did as mario because at first i thought it was a very weird decision to cast him
Jun 27 2023,negative,while some kids movies offer enough for even adults to enjoy this movie amounts to nothing but flashing colours poor voice acting a vapid empty plot terrible pacing and frankly annoying dialogue not even worth the time put in to watch itm only valuable for children up to age 8
Jun 27 2023,positive,what the heck is wrong with these critics very entertaining movie
Jun 27 2023,positive,the movie is great i watch it on amc and the songs are good cuz of bowser casle figet and pluming i love it
Jun 27 2023,positive,this was the best video game movie i ever seen since the sonic movies
Jun 26 2023,negative,i think a lot of people will love this movie and thats fine but it just did not work for me luigi was good but he gets shafted so like whatever bowser was good but hes kinda a jerk like way worse than he is in the games as times so like whatever i liked some of the soundtrack songs but they are used at poor times except for 2 original songs which i loved  but they were both used at bad times in the plot so like whatever thats just this movie its just like whatever i like some mario games but im not the biggest fan ever but like this movie is just a bunch of random mario stuff and a boring story so like i just did not like it very much like i said it does have some goated songs and 2 good characters but like whatever i did not like the rest i like chris prat as an actor though and i just dont think he fit this role anyways yeah this movie was just forgettable and was full of random mario stuff that had to do with nothing related to the plot d
Jun 26 2023,positive,movie was pretty good the colors the reference of other and the acting and it does feel like its kinda rushed a little but that doesnt mean it sucks unlike the critics but at least this movie isnt that bad then the live action one
Jun 26 2023,positive,this movie is so awesome that i did not enter the cinema to watch this movie like a slave the critics lied to us about it theyre just giving negative reviews because these guys arent interested in watching it again
Jun 26 2023,positive,wahoo an amazing blast from the past filled to the brim with cool nintendo easter eggs absolutely awesome loved every second of it
Jun 26 2023,negative,so very tedious it has nothing to offer as a movie even as background noise while playing a game on my phone i had to turn it off
Jun 26 2023,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen a movie that feels like it was made by committee and corporate expectations no emotional depth no meaningful storyline or arc the movie is more concerned about references and ruins the nintendo brand in its sheer existence
Jun 26 2023,positive,the fact that mario movie has great 3d animation and story telling that it not only restored someone elses childhood its also let me to think that animation really is a medium not a genre for kids and besides who knows what will come next after the movie premiere i hope its gonna be fantastic in future despite what the critics might says
Jun 26 2023,negative,how bad can voice acting get
Jun 25 2023,positive,its funny how critics hate this movie this much but the audience love it just watched with friends it was an absolute banger definitely worth watching even if you aint a super mario fan
Jun 25 2023,positive,very family oriented
Jun 25 2023,positive,i loved this movie i am such a big mario fan the references were insane and the movie was so much fun to watch
Jun 25 2023,positive,absolutely stellar must watch 
Jun 25 2023,positive,after the sonic the hedgehog duology it was about time we got a movie around the super mario brothers and im glad to say it didnt disappoint this film perfectly captured all the characters and i was surprisingly fine with the voice acting for mario chris pratt did a pretty good job but the real star of the show was jack black as bowser he put his heart soul and more into this role and i love it this film is a haven for long time mario fans with thousands of different easter eggs but at some points it can lack on the story side after the recent announcement of a legend of zelda film i think a nintendo cinematic universe is completely possible
Jun 25 2023,positive,i watched the movie at theatre colwyn and was so impressed with the animation of mario and luigi we had a great time watching the film
Jun 25 2023,negative,this isnt a movie its a demented series of ingame cut sequences filled with fanboyservice and every video game sprite that ever existed in the super mario series if you were expecting a plot  i mean this being a movie and all  youre in for disappointment instead you get what must have been a jack black improv session with the rest of the cast just phoning in reactions and cashing their checks at the end of the film im old enough to remember the bob hoskins film sure it sucked but at least it tried to be a movie this pile of garbage didnt even pretend to care about trying to write a coherent script thanks for trying to retroactively ruin my childhood nintendo
Jun 25 2023,positive,as a film this could have been stronger story and script wise but as a life long mario fan the nostalgia was too strong for me not to enjoy this film getting too see some of these visuals on the big screen was worth the ticket price alone
Jun 25 2023,negative,its not something new
Jun 25 2023,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing and everyone needs to see it this movie is better then across the spiderverse and i dont care what everybody else says this movie is the only one the level as the perfection of morbius 100 score
Jun 25 2023,positive,i think this movie was really good and had amazing animation i think thats what won me over the most the story itself is a little basic but its still worth the watch 100 it has lots of references to the games from the classic and modern i wanna see what they do for the sequel i think it will be great
Jun 25 2023,positive,better than expected     my sister and i were surprised at how much we enjoyed watching the film a main concern that we had about it was the lack of the italian accents which the mario bros are known for but they explained it quite well and didnt disrupt the storyline of the film at all     there were a lot of great jokes and exciting action sequences it had a lot of great details that made us feel really nostalgic like the rainbow road and mario kart     it wouldve been nice however if they just stool to the original super mario bros plot mario saving princess peach from bowser it seems a bit unrealistic that princess peach would know how to fight and save her kingdom     nevertheless the aesthetics visuals and animations were top notch would recommend watching
Jun 25 2023,positive,this has been the best video game movie ive ever seen im looking forward to seeing it in the theater and id like to see it again i really liked the classic references and clues from other nintendo sagas i congratulate nintendo and illumination for their great work keep up
Jun 25 2023,positive,fully nostalgic and fully entertaining throughout the entire movie fun for families and dates
Jun 25 2023,positive,its an amazing movie which brings back the memories to the older audience and introduces the younger ones to one of nintendos biggest franchises you really feel the love and enthusiasm which was put into it the charme and action make you more and more excited the longer you watch  the only critic i have except for a few slight personal dislikes is about the critics themselves sorry but where did you leave your objectivity and professionalism the movie isnt your thing  that doesnt justify a bad rating neither does a missing deep story judging the movie by a too simple story the franchise was never known for makes no sense to me in my opinion it only shows that the top critics didnt inform themselves of what to expect on a mario franchise nor its fundaments and i dont mean the awful movie from the nineties and having completely forgotten about the main audience the movie is for    if you want to say some negative you can criticize the speed of storytelling which i think is here and there a little too fast and doesnt let you enjoy completely some moments also there would have been more screentime for other scenes and maybe some characters giving them more tension and complexity     all in all its a great movie which has added a little more drama to the usually simple mario storys by keeping the funniness also combining the game soundtracks with some well chosen regular songs is good to me they could have added some more too but everyones got their taste  i personally was a bit astonished by the mass of things going on on the screen sometimes it was a bit too much input for me but many times i almost cried by bringing back the nostalgia and the feeling as a kid when mario was your hero and you always wanted to be like him tough lovey and never giving up
Jun 25 2023,positive,i thought they did a great job recreating the video game my grandchildren loved it so much i purchased it
Jun 24 2023,positive,i am a huge mario fan huge gaming fan and an even bigger nintendo fan there were so many easter eggs in this movie for any nintendo fan it was such a blast
Jun 24 2023,neutral,the super mario bros movie is deeply fine
Jun 24 2023,positive,it was great  watched it in 3d wished i had watched it in 4d
Jun 24 2023,negative,it was like the video game i suppose its good for kids a little boy said that was a really really good movie so i guess it was entertaining its safe for parents to take their kids to because theres nothing adult about it in the way most family movies relate to older audiences
Jun 24 2023,positive,spot on with the sound  visual effects from the original game console of the 1980s at the beginning and end of the film my teens enjoyed the 1980s music played throughout no attempt to change anything from the original version to make it like the modernchangepush of today four out of five stars because i kept napping 5 times my youngest teen kept waking me up
Jun 24 2023,positive,i think this movie was a graphical masterpiece the animation and color palette just pop mainly though the nostalgia is what makes it so special i couldnt believe how many references to both mario and other nintendo games there were the plot could be a tiny bit thin at times but all in all it was great
Jun 24 2023,positive,great movie from illumation
Jun 24 2023,positive,fantastic movie for families and you dont have to worry about ridiculous messaging throughout
Jun 24 2023,positive,better than i expected watching that movie brought me back memories of playing donkey kong mario mario kart etc etc
Jun 23 2023,positive,absolutely the best mario movie to date its cute funny and has a good cast they knew what they were doing with this movie
Jun 23 2023,positive,this was such a great movie
Jun 23 2023,positive,saw this as 55 group of 2  food  flix moviehouse enjoyable from start to finish plenty of nostalgia for those of us who played the games the actors were all into their roles and clearly had a great time emotionallyconstipated movie critics who panned the movie need to get good at their jobs and relearn what makes a popcorn movie enjoyable for normal people this was a good time even at movie theater prices
Jun 23 2023,positive,its my top three animation feature that ive ever seen
Jun 23 2023,neutral,it wasnt awful as much as it was totally forgettable this movie was heavily based on nostalgia and not enough on story  it was entertaining enough but i forgot about it an hour  after i left the theater

Jun 23 2023,negative,the super mario bros movie is a bad movie truly one of the worst illumination film and the worst video game movies of all time i  know guys i like super mario franchise i didnt grew up nintendo but i prefer the legend of zelda and pokémon as well except donkey kong because donkey kong looks great that i enjoy and also i prefer to play thirdparty developers on the nintendo system the story is about destroying mushroom kingdom by bowser himself one as the worst antagonist in my opinion of the movie its up to mario to go explore to the mushroom kingdom and find their friends including luigi before its too late the voice cast were good but the animation its exactly the same thing as the previous illumination films i really hate bowser who destroyed the mushroom kingdom by bomber bill is the worst clip ever because they go through the pipe and they destroy the mushroom kingdom this movie is mothercluckedup also brian tyler is the worst conductor ive ever seen by the way this is actually the same composer from the fast and furious franchise and the director was exactly same thing as teen titans go this ones having a nightmare to you nintendo its over my opinion of this movie is cash in and directly is not better than live action while the animation version is getting my ass on a cake so i give this movie a 2 out of 10 so right now the lego movie and sonic the hedgehog movie trilogy its way better
Jun 23 2023,positive,1010 trip down nostalgia lane for the whole family
Jun 23 2023,positive,it is the best movie that deserves to be respected by a perfect and interesting script it is also the best movie based on a video game so far
Jun 23 2023,positive,as a mario can myself i enjoyed the movie alot with all these neat little refrences  it was an exceptionally good time however as for those who are not that big fans of mario whilst you would still find this film a nice time you would start to notice the story is pretty basic and bland so i guess the choice is yours
Jun 23 2023,positive,fun entertaining and nostalgic film that calls back all the great thing about the mario bros including the tv show cereal and cartoons from the early 90s  all the cameo voices were great and the next movie should be equally as fun
Jun 22 2023,negative,trash movie worse than sonic a bad rip off of lego movie the fact the audience score is so high is a sign of how nintendo can cash in blind fandom people are sheep wish it was better
Jun 22 2023,positive,very fun and enjoyable movie animation was great and very visually pleasing one of my only gripes was that the voice acting wasnt the best
Jun 22 2023,positive,this movie was so awesome i loved i cried i sang peaches and wach it u will not regret
Jun 22 2023,positive,everything a super mario bros movie should be loved it b

Jun 21 2023,positive,a great movie characters very well done with excellent graphics design  dont need to know nintendo nor mario to have a good time with the kids family loved it and then that peaches song  lots of fun
Jun 21 2023,positive,history revives for more than one generation this is how you do it while respecting a story and an audience without resorting to a lot of forced inclusion
Jun 21 2023,neutral,it could nice if marios voice gonna be by charles martinet  not chris pratt bc mario he dont say like that voice like his dark his silly and italian so yea to nintendo and illumination you guys need swap two actors charles martin as mario and chris pratt well i dont know maybe well just put charles martin as mario i like that voice bc chris pratt sounds terrible   well like the say mario 64      see you next time  
Jun 21 2023,positive,we took our 3 kids to see it 7 5  25 yrs old and they all enjoyed it my husband and i loved the nostalgia  lack of politics while we thought they could have taken a little more time to develop each of the storylines the length and constant excitement was perfect for our kids attention spans we hope there will be a sequel
Jun 21 2023,positive,good entertaining show for kids and adults
Jun 21 2023,positive,the movie is really good and adventurous and my cousin loves the peaches song its really amazing and cool
Jun 21 2023,positive,with no shortage of nostalgia or sheer sense of passion for the world and characters the super mario bros movie is a fast paced and joyous cinematic experience that hits all the right beats
Jun 21 2023,positive,although the hate is clear i liked this movie the graphics were 1010 and the character designs as well the movie was definitely targeted for children but i felt like i could still enjoy it side note i loved that they added take on me by aha thats conveniently my favorite song lol so overall i would definitely watch again
Jun 21 2023,negative,bad plot sometimes it becomes somewhat boring and slow it has noteworthy things
Jun 21 2023,positive,this movie is indeed a childrens movie that adults can enjoy in nostalgia plenty of easter eggs from the old games and the start of a nintendo verse the idea is thrilling and jack black is excellent as bowser youre in for a treat
Jun 21 2023,positive,its anything youd expect from a video game movie it stays true to the reference plenty of fun easter eggs characters stayed true to the games too its all the games but better tbh id recommend if it wasnt so popular in the media
Jun 20 2023,negative,a lot of references to games so little of plot and character development humor here was so childish and slap stick that i cant even recall any film that was worse in this case wasted potential ok for hardcore mario fans
Jun 20 2023,neutral,it was alright  princess peaches voice didnt match her character plot line was a little weak my five year old loved it though
Jun 20 2023,positive,the movie had some good music and some good laughs for not so young movie goers
Jun 20 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was my favorite movie of 2023 so far  my 1 best family movie of 2023 this far amazing job illumination universal  nintendo also im the 1 big nintendo  super mario fan of all time so the super mario bros movie is perfect movie of 2023 from vaughn brooklyn ramclague 6 wallangara drive pakenham victoria australia
Jun 20 2023,positive,chris pratt  charley day lend their voices and talent to play the titular characters mario  luigi in this beautifully animated movie  from ilumination studio     one of the best video game adaptation movies till date super mario bros tells the story of two brothers and their journey through self discovery as they encounter literal magic when they accidentally open up a portal to the mystical mushroom kingdom they must protect its citizens and the charming princess peaches played by anya taylor joy from the manacing bowser played by jack black     the movie is quite entertaining and full of family friendly  action however i think the producers and nintendo have done a really good job of fan service which would definitely appeal to adults people like me who had their childhood defined by the super mario franchise it may not connect the dots that much with kids as a result but the fan service here is top notch     an easy 455 if you just want to take the kids to see something new  entertaining  its also got 2 post credit scenes and i would definitely advise you stick till the very end this shows got everything from that universe i promise     glad to see keegan micheal key lending his awesome talent to play toad
Jun 20 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is way better than the 1993 liveaction super mario bros movie i give this movie an a
Jun 20 2023,negative,no redeeming qualities terrible
Jun 20 2023,positive,an ordinary movie to watch with the whole family even though im not a fan of mario and similar games i completely understood all the references and i really enjoyed it i recommend it it will do for one viewing
Jun 20 2023,positive,loved this movie just enough nostalgia and comedy to make this a great film
Jun 20 2023,negative,what a stupid movie lame unoriginal and jack black what a waste of characters money and time hard pass
Jun 20 2023,positive,my favourite hero since i m young
Jun 20 2023,positive,its perfect for what it is and for what its supposed to be  yes the plot is flat and linear for the first time ever thats actually to the movies advantage  the fact that it is that way makes it feel so much like the games  if you never played smb you can never understand how much this elevated the experience  thr movie is clearly designed to entertain and introduce a new generation of kids to smb while also kick the now 40 year old nintendogenetation with a massive nostalgia boot  and it accomplished this far beyond what i could ever imagine    all the critics complaining about the plot youve completely missed the point of the movie and your score hold little to no real value  it would be the same thing as if you were rating dog food its the most nutritious healthy ecofriendly lowest price and all dogs love it but you mark it down to 25 cuz you a human didnt like the taste  it makes no sense
Jun 20 2023,positive,i went to theaters twice to watch this it was so well done it truly caters to us who grew up playing nintendo but also to a new generation of kids my only minor critique is that i wish luigi had more screen time but thats just nitpicking
Jun 20 2023,positive,this is an enjoyable movie for all ages i just purchased the new blue ray edition its a must have
Jun 20 2023,positive,my kids really liked it specially my 8 year old
Jun 20 2023,positive,entertaining and child friendly
Jun 20 2023,positive,a good entrance of nintendo characters in the teathers fun and nostalgic to whatch with the all family
Jun 20 2023,positive,it was everything expected from a nintendo movie i had low expectations because illumination was in charge however nintendo seems to have been more than vigilant with their source material and it didnt let the movie turn into referencial nonsense overall im happy the movie exists
Jun 20 2023,positive,too short of a movie but amazing
Jun 20 2023,positive,my grandson loved it there really wasnt anything in it for adults but kids will love it
Jun 19 2023,positive,its funny and colorful  it so nostalgic go see it if you havent
Jun 19 2023,negative,some good moments but overall boring and unsatisfying ending
Jun 19 2023,positive,a fun and colorful movie its actually more a game than a movie when you think about it and not because its based on a game franchise but because the main fun of it is to recognize every easter egg cameo and reference thrown at you sometimes though some references are so up on the nose that they became awkward its like theyre literally winking at you    if i found that the first act introduced well the universe and the stakes the story disappear pretty quickly to become just a string a fun scenes and references     anyway you can feel how the team behind the movie has a blast using the 40years old video game franchise and all the popular characters it created im waiting for the sequel already
Jun 19 2023,positive,so good took the kids to see mario when it first came out  so many easter eggs and childhood nostalgia  bonus end credits scene if you didnt know
Jun 19 2023,positive,it was fun to watch how universal studios squeezed every mario game ever created by nintendo into this movie great looking 3d movie but thank goodness it was short
Jun 19 2023,positive,good film satisfied my childhood gamer nostalgia could have done more though wish they had yoshi instead of milking it for the next film
Jun 19 2023,positive,couldnt have asked for a better super marion bros movie
Jun 19 2023,positive,i dont why people are leaving 1 star review   the movie is perfect
Jun 19 2023,positive,i thought it was a fun and positive movie made for children i didnt see any flaws in the characterization or storytelling
Jun 19 2023,positive,my 7 year old enjoyed the movie he liked everything about it the soundtrack was also a highlight
Jun 19 2023,positive,i thought this was cute i dont have children but i fully expected a childrens film since this video game is aimed for children to play i remember playing the original nintendo game was i was 8 people are complaining about the plot but was there much of a plot in the video games we never played for the plot so i dont know why folks expect some sort of epic mind bending plot i think the plot was simplistic which stays true to the games it definitely was nostalgic which i love how they interjected the tunes from the game it was great to hear voice acting from khary payton as the penguin king i immediately knew that tone jack black of course is a fantastic voice actor him singing brought back nostalgia for  tenacious d he did steal the show i thought chris pratt did well i couldnt tell it was chris pratt so definitely a good voice acting for mario charlie also altered his voice overall the kid in me was happy this movie is definitely not something that will blow your mind with a oscar winning plot line but it definitely is a cute film that appeals to the kid in us of course reviewers have negative comments nothing makes humanity happy anymore even light hearted children films
Jun 19 2023,positive,this is the first movie that my son actually sat in his chair and watched from start to finish plus i enjoyed the throwback and nostalgia graphics on point
Jun 19 2023,positive,watched it with my kid not a big fan unfortunately
Jun 19 2023,positive,dont listen to the negative critics the story may lack but its a kids movie who cares
Jun 19 2023,positive,really fun  great movie  great time with the kiddos  they loved it  peaches
Jun 19 2023,negative,1 short film went by too fast  2 in my opinion it was boring  3 not worth the hype  4 main good part was the peaches song by browzer
Jun 19 2023,positive,a fun movie filled with as many references and easter eggs as youd want for a franchise with this amount of history but with  a thin plot and extremely fast paced movie it doesnt hold up itself
Jun 19 2023,positive,enjoyable and unique twist with bowsers crush on princess peach  all in all a fun movie
Jun 19 2023,negative,terrible move horrible storyline
Jun 19 2023,positive,definitely recommend for a mario fan has some pretty funny and cute moments good for kids adults will enjoy it to i think its good
Jun 19 2023,positive,loved it i mean its a mario bros movie these critics are a little much lol
Jun 18 2023,positive,the best adaptation of a video game ive ever seen lots of references to my childhood made for audiences of all ages its a perfect movie with no forced inclusions
Jun 18 2023,positive,simple back to the basics movie touched on fan service really well for a long time enjoyer of the mario brothers universe
Jun 18 2023,positive,a mustsee for any mario fan with amazing animation and a perfect score full of humor and a pretty good story
Jun 18 2023,positive,fun and entertaining we loved all the old school references
Jun 18 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is one of the best films and is among one of my favorite films since a few other animated movies its plot wasnt too great but everything else about it was a beautifully crafted masterpiece that deserves the recognition it has been getting and the status it has as of this year thank you nintendo for one of the most beautiful treats i have ever seen
Jun 18 2023,positive,this movie is great handsdown i want to go back and see it again great for the whole family
Jun 18 2023,positive,it is not a movie created for the oscars it is for all of us who grew up with mario it is a simple story with fantastic animations
Jun 18 2023,positive,fun movie that stirs up childhood memories of the super mario bros dont expect much of a storyline but the visuals and small pockets of entertainment will keep you watching
Jun 18 2023,positive,extremely well put together family fun film the studio really understands the material and what would please the fans of the franchise
Jun 18 2023,positive,the animation was extraordinary a wonderful movie from start to end i laughed i cried and i laughed some more
Jun 18 2023,positive,this was way more fun and better than it had any business being 
Jun 18 2023,positive,as a child of the 80s and a hardcore retro gamer this one is a hit ignore the critics most likely boomers
Jun 18 2023,positive,the movie was great with an enjoyable plot and fun momenta the movie was filled with fun easter eggs and nostalgia enjoyable for any long term or short term mario fan and jack blacks acting is one of the best acting in the movie the movie did have its flaws with the pacing and chris pratt acting but overall a enjoyable film for mario fans and the audience in general
Jun 18 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is definitely going to work for families this massive world is interesting the nostalgia level is high and the animation is the best out of any illumination movie the downside comes with the pacing the story not being interesting and the humor that is aimed solely at kids in conclusion this is definitely a family movie
Jun 18 2023,positive,the simple direct and very good for more movies like this
Jun 18 2023,positive,this should have been the iron man of the neu nintendo expanded universe  but its a generally pleasing if not at least mid movie  perhaps if instead of bowser the main enemy of this movie had been donkey kong with them eventually reconciling to overcome some common menace even a naturalenvironmental one  bowser could effectively have been their thanos with all the movies building up to that  alas
Jun 18 2023,positive,its exactly what you would want from a super maro bros movie
Jun 18 2023,positive,super mario bros is a nostalgic adventure the highly anticipated movie adaptation of the beloved video game franchise finally brings the vibrant world of mario and his friends to the silver screen while it may lack indepth storytelling and leave viewers yearning for more the films positive aspects far outweigh the negatives    one of the films standout elements is the portrayal of bowser the iconic antagonist jack blacks performance infuses the character with a delightful energy that makes him an absolute pleasure to watch furthermore chris pratts portrayal of mario complete with an accent that aligns perfectly with the narrative adds an authentic touch to the character pratts charismatic performance captures the essence of the beloved plumber endearing him to audiences    what sets this movie apart is its selfawareness it acknowledges its narrative limitations compensating with a heavy dose of nostalgia the film pays homage to the source material making it an enjoyable experience for fans it successfully creates a sense of being part of the thrilling ride while acknowledging its own shortcomings    the films animation and aesthetic choices deserve commendation they flawlessly capture the essence of the video games resulting in a remarkable adaptation for the big screen the attention to detail in bringing the characters and settings to life is praiseworthy providing a visually captivating experience    moreover the movies music takes us on a trip down memory lane it effectively taps into the nostalgia of longtime players invoking a wave of joy and excitement the familiar tunes serve as a reminder of the exhilarating adventures we experienced as children    however the film does have a couple of drawbacks its narrative lacks depth and the overall duration is relatively short while these criticisms are minor they leave viewers longing for more substance and a longer runtime to further explore the enchanting world of super mario bros    in conclusion super mario bros delivers a nostalgic adventure that successfully brings the beloved characters and world of the video game franchise to life despite its shortcomings in storytelling depth and duration the film excels in selfawareness engaging performances faithful adaptation and evocative music fans of the games will find themselves immersed in a delightful journey that truly captures the spirit of super mario

Jun 17 2023,positive,really well done you can appreciate they attempted to add elements from as many versions of mario as possible which didnt seem forced and flowed well while its not the best movie around it is the best animated film ive seen come out in years dont be fooled by the ridiculously low critic score there are no dull or low periods and the story keeps you engaged throughout
Jun 17 2023,positive,fk you this movie is amazing   sincerely  a millennial

Jun 17 2023,positive,perfect fanservice for those who like the game franchise the script managed to perfectly connect elements and characteristics of the games characters have individual personalities weaknesses and strengths a true work of art  recommended for the whole family and children as it is free of political messages and inversion of values which is rare in childrens movies these days
Jun 17 2023,positive,its alright movie but good
Jun 17 2023,positive,epitome of a great animated film fun for the kids and fun for adults its simplistic which is okay for films not all movies need big lessons in them or depth
Jun 17 2023,positive,i guess they are offensive stan marsh
Jun 17 2023,positive,a simple but good story you fall in love with all characters a great movie to watch with family and friends
Jun 17 2023,positive,a fun trip down memory lane this new adaptation of a well familiar story brings in waves of excitement to its viewers from the very beginning the movie grabs in everyone with its familiar catchy song and it only gets better from there well worth a watch if youve yet to watch grab your popcorn and grab you twizzlers cause youre in for a ride the moment the play button is hit
Jun 17 2023,positive,what i love about this movie is that its a great movie without pushing an agenda just an overall great movie
Jun 17 2023,positive,i went to see this movie with my younger sister about a week after it came out we had high expectations and we were not disappointed after the movie i noticed that all the kids younger then 10 or 11 seemed to favor mario or princess peach whereas all most everyone over the age of 12 found bowser played be jack black to be a much more relatable and interesting character when my younger sister heard the song peaches she was instantly in love with the song and hasnt be able to stop singing it since when i heard that chris pratt was playing mario i wasnt sure what to think however i was surprised and in the end chris pratt was a good choice throughout the movie some familiar 80s songs were played which i believe the adults would have enjoyed and the kids were probably hearing for the first time  even though the super mario bros movie has been advertised as a kids movie i would recommend it for all ages    the review of my younger sister  mario is a fantasist movie i love everything about this movie  my favorite charters are bowser princess peach mario and toad i favorite part is when bowser voiced by jack black sang the song peaches and i think anyone else that sees that part will love it too   a 9 year old
Jun 17 2023,positive,of course it has room for improvement but my grandchildren sat through it and thoroughly loved so the writers and directors did their job in keep the target audience happy  as an adult that grew up playing the games from the start i truly enjoyed all the references and characters in the movie
Jun 17 2023,positive,super mario bros is like the tipic movie of adventurecomedy and show incredible words and battles of fantasy but with mario but i think that is a good adaptation of the game to a movie that show how was the life of mario and his family scenes that didnt show in the games but i think that the movie can be betteris to short  and the movie pass to fast and is to funny to see but the movie was able to touch on more topics without the need to spend the two hours and now that luigi takes the place of princess peach i dont care i think the best thing about the movie are the references and the emotion itself
Jun 17 2023,positive,it does pay homage to the super mario bros video games but it lacks the original love and spirit that made super mario a lovable character
Jun 17 2023,positive,idk its just a all on great movie
Jun 16 2023,positive,it was a good childrens movie it pays no homage to those who grew up with mario on nintendo since 1984 some parts funny again its not what youd expect or imagined as a longtime fan for kids which is their target audience it absolutely knocks it out of the park
Jun 16 2023,positive,action and details great
Jun 16 2023,positive,while this is easily too 3 illumination movies of all time i cant say thats a high bar
Jun 16 2023,positive,voice actors did a great job and overall it was a fun experience could have used more mario lore but did enjoy the feeling of being in a video game
Jun 16 2023,positive,this movie is very nice
Jun 16 2023,positive,the movie was great
Jun 16 2023,positive,if you have ever played mario or lovedd mario as a game i would highly higlyyy suggest this movie such a refreshing movie that reminds you of your childhood memories but keeps you hooked wondering the ending of the movie while recalling your childhood i would if i have to would score infinity out of 100 bye i loved it
Jun 16 2023,positive,very animated all the characters from the game
Jun 16 2023,positive,i think the movie is ok
Jun 16 2023,positive,this is a 1010 film i cant get enough of the nostalgia and easter eggs
Jun 16 2023,positive,my grandchildren loved there was constant action and a good story ending well their father and i enjoyed it as well
Jun 16 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie    the super mario bros movie is a colorful animated feature film made for all ages its very faithful to the nintendo game and features a lot of easter eggs its almost nonstop action and adventure for the lead characters the plot is pretty simple and straightforward but the worldbuilding is great  interesting cast composed of chris pratt anya taylorjoy and jack black  i especially like the fact that they included donkey kong because that video game was where it all start  the 3d animation itself is very vibrant and colorful  i like how all the action moves so quickly yet its still easy to follow and understand  i loved the gags as well  if you played the game you will love how the movie  brings back memories and show a lot of the games characters and components again theres so much easter eggs to find in this film and i also love the songs that they used the only thing i didnt like about this movie is the fact that luigi didnt get that much action generally i enjoyed this movie and i am pretty sure audiences especially the kids and retrogamers will love it
Jun 16 2023,positive,the movie is not bad by any means but its nothing special either   visually its nice to look at but the plot is weak the movie pacing is so quick that little world or character development just doesnt happen its really just a movie of this happens now this is happening now this is whats happening now not really having much to link the different sections together its filled with fan service and while that was enjoyable to see it really adds nothing to the plot     the voice acting was weak too after decades of hearing how key characters sound they just all felt off     like it was a fun watch but its forgettable and i doubt i will bother to see it again
Jun 16 2023,positive,filled with the right amount of action thrill comedy romance drama horror nostalgia and suspense everything you would expect and hope for without agendas and adult content perfect for children hope there is a second on in the future
Jun 16 2023,positive,unapologetically a childrens movie and that is very okay with me some goofs some gags and short enough to not feel like a waste of time
Jun 16 2023,positive,loved the movie   it stuck with the core of what makes super mario bros super mario bros  cant wait to see what they do for the sequel which i know will come out at some point
Jun 16 2023,positive,the super mario movie is about as by the book and safe as you can get with a predictable story filled with well worn tropes one dimensional characters and insert unrelated 80s pop music to montage moments it uses nostalgia star power and crisply animated set pieces to mask what is otherwise a pretty pedestrian film without the mario ip however that ip does elevates this movie to a great height the level of detail and references from the games in this movie especially the music was the pure magic i was joyous every time i saw an easter eggs or heard a familiar leitmotif the attention to detail in this movie is really something special    objectively i should hate this movie but the kid in me who grew up with nintendo games was smiling through this whole thing i was 100 compromised by memberberries and yet i would still recommend this movie
Jun 16 2023,neutral,although the nostalgia and feel of the mario bros magic is there the story felt like lazy writing
Jun 16 2023,positive,solid mario meant for kids tho
Jun 16 2023,positive,best fan service movie
Jun 16 2023,positive,it was perfect me and my family loved it the animation was magical the hole story was logical but it wasnt like you knew what is gonna happen i highly recommend it  like a fresh tomato  written by my child  and i recommend it too
Jun 16 2023,positive,while i love video game movies the story was not good at all it felt all over the place apparently the director wanted to recreate the equivalent of a speedrun but for movies terrible choice barely any luigis mansion he is relegated to being a terrible sidekick and no yoshi meh
Jun 16 2023,positive,great great movie jack black was amazing
Jun 16 2023,positive,i smiled all the way to the end of the movie from the score the animation the story and the action 1010 for me
Jun 16 2023,positive,fun movie ive seen it a few times with my kids nowi still couldnt tell you anything about the story
Jun 16 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is perfection every character was voiced by the perfect person the story was well ruled out the video game references were amazing and bowsers peaches song was pure comedy highly recommend to everyone of all ages it is funny and it will bring back lots of memories
Jun 16 2023,positive,for me i enjoy this movie so much when i was a kid i play super mario 64 and years later i watched one of the best movies in 2023    final rating 100100
Jun 16 2023,positive,an amazing adaptation of the franchise i was hooked to my seat the entire time and have watched it 4 times watch it if you like mario or good movies
Jun 16 2023,positive,sothe super mario bros movie is a fine fun moviefirst offthe animation is gorgeous this is the best looking illumination movie so farall the worlds they go to look amazing illumination hits always with animationthe cast was conversational at first because of chris pratt but everybody sounded goodchris pratt sounded good as marioseth rogen was goodand anya was goodmy two favorites were charlie day and jack black they both have awesome momentsthe movie was fun it was not boring so thats a plusthe action was fun but it was not that good it was average fightingbad stuff is that pacing its way to fast like it felt like a hour film and the problem occurs in the 2nd act of the moviei feel like script was very repetitive toward the endingthe final battle did not have flavor in it at alli understand why critics dont like the film because its not for them so if your a dead hard mario fan you might like this but if your a kid your going to really like itif your not a fan your probably not going like iti enjoyed my self its something not a perfect movie but it stayed its welcome thank you nintendo and illumination610
Jun 16 2023,positive,one of the greatest movies of the year super mario bros movie is entertaining exciting and energizing
Jun 16 2023,positive,it was ok but there were some issues i had with the story i also still dislike the vocal performances even though they were definitely not as bad as what we saw in the trailers i will say i wouldnt mind seeing a sequel if not to see our favorite green dinosaur on the big screen
Jun 16 2023,positive,this is a cinematic masterpiece the story is very well done and simple enough not to confuse anybody it also has all of the best animation qualities having smooth detailed framework along with vibrant colors and stunning visuals it is the perfect movie for those young and old especially if you are currently have been or at least was a mario  bros video game fan and if youre not a fan of the video game series it will definitely turn you into a new one thanks to being slightly fastpaced none of the scenes drag on making every single second of the movie interesting which keeps you reeled in overall this movie is perfect for a fantasy scenario type movie and plays a very good strategy into making people buy the merch and video games of mario bros it is a 10 out of 10 in my book and i recommend it to anybody who is looking for an animated funfilled adventure especially if that person likes the mario bros games
Jun 16 2023,neutral,as much as i loved playing the video games in the past i just couldnt force myself to sit through this movie  i had to split my viewing into 3 parts just so that i could finish it     visually it was really colourful and stunning and the animation was beautifully done but the story just wasnt good enough to keep me hooked     it did feel more like a typical childrens movie and for that purposes it would score well but as an adult it just was not anything special
Jun 15 2023,positive,funny film with a predictable but still exciting story line follows a typical super mario story journey with a lot of quirks and funny moments in between
Jun 15 2023,positive,it was better than i thought it was going to be
Jun 15 2023,positive,great movie for mario fans
Jun 15 2023,positive,i like the movie but i wish the movie could have been longer but i like it 
Jun 15 2023,positive,could have been better for sure
Jun 15 2023,positive,funny and entertaining even if youve never played the game
Jun 15 2023,positive,great family movie you can watch more than once
Jun 15 2023,positive,this movie reads as a love letter to those born in the late 70slate 80s  the voice acting fit the characters and it was a wild ride  there are memorable moments of side characters in games and the music is beautifully crafter from songs of the games     honestly i feel this movie is a wonderful watch for both parents and children  make sure to set time to invite this nostalgia into your life
Jun 15 2023,positive,i feel like this movie was perfect spoiler alert it started off with a chris pratt mario  which was a good option and ended with a happy ending
Jun 15 2023,positive,almost everything that i couldve asked for in a super mario bros movie animation and voice acting was excellent great callbacks and fan service without taking away from the integrity of the plot overall a great time for the whole family
Jun 15 2023,positive,a very fun movie with a lot of fun easter eggs
Jun 15 2023,positive,100 recommend for any mario fan looking for content
Jun 15 2023,positive,loved it they incorporated a lot of elements from the games including characters and features like the karts entertaining and comical at points pleasantly surprised
Jun 15 2023,negative,im so sick of the quit having fun comic using manchildren giving 55 reviews on bad video game movies just because they like the thing its based on i must protect the billiondollar franchises movie with belowaverage writing from evil critics 58 is a pretty good score for something as badly paced and awkward as this they will keep doing this because the bar is so low that anything stimulating and referenceheavy is enough to win them over  theres a headacheinducing action scene every 5 minutes in this the pacing is horrendous every plot point is forgotten about immediately theres a loud music score for every single scene and its extremely rushed overall often there are cliche 80s pop songs dropped into montage scenes from other animated movies that are better instead of actual video game music this is the mcdonalds of cinema bring your kids to that instead of this it has the same effect its mindless sensory overload its noise and admittedly good but expected colours but oh well this is supposed to be bad its a mario movie its got jack black as bowser singing funny autotuned songs and epic references to the brand im too attached to 30 years quit having fun and grow up nostalgia retro
Jun 15 2023,negative,people need to stop doing this when critics dont like something from a franchise that nerds like 96 is an absolute lie the pacing is terrible so many plot points are immediately forgotten just so they can have some headacheinducing action scenes so that the kids keep paying attention and overall its a rushed headache of a film its nothing but check out this epic mario reference lets move on to the next mario reference its fastpaced and has a lot of colours but no story it doesnt care about being a movie despite movie being in the title its another stupid waste of time its just a stupid movie exactly you dont even think its good if youre a small child or if youre a nintendoloving moron who is too attached to a billiondollar franchise to even stomach people not liking your dumb  illumination movie youll like it or youll be obligated to like it because of nostalgia
Jun 15 2023,positive,a fairly engaging story with a lot for the fans of the game it did get a bit tiresome in the middle and felt about 20 minutes too long but watchable
Jun 15 2023,positive,the mario movie is a great representation of the mario franchise this is a good reward for those mario fans that have been waiting half of their lives to get a mario movie and honestly i dont think they could have chosen a better studio than illumination and its just a fun entertaining family fun movie the bad the plot was just a mess and i didnt like the voice acting of the characters dont get me wrong chris pratt is a great voice actor but for mario i dont know this movie had potential to be amazing but they bottled it with childish mistakes
Jun 15 2023,positive,a great videogame adaptation no more words than that to define this a lot of references that you can notice as a gamer
Jun 15 2023,positive,this movie is amazing  my childhood come back for one hour 
Jun 15 2023,positive,anyone not liking this movie needs to go back and watch mario bros from the 90sthis had little water eggs of nostalgia all the way through my 11 year old and i laughed and enjoyed the entire movie 
Jun 15 2023,positive,awesome and funny a must see for every super mario fan if your not a movie critic i mean
Jun 15 2023,neutral,a harmless illumination production that really thrills when it comes to topnotch animation truly a chefs kiss and that regards voice acting is all very well done and full of energy especially that of jack black playing the character of bowser chris pratt and charlie de do a reasonably good job as the mario brothers plot is rather shallow and surface level at best a somewhat surprising standout is brian tyler who composed a score that is both sophisticated in its references to the video game music and a piece entirely of its own
Jun 15 2023,positive,its good the critic saw the 1993 mario movie
Jun 15 2023,positive,if you grew up with arcade nessuper nes nes 64 game cube to wii this movie is for you family fun fast paced movie straight to the point enjoyed every moment definitely must watch definitely deserves  2
Jun 15 2023,positive,it was cute well done
Jun 15 2023,positive,what a great movie and the soundtrack is perfect too i really enjoyed how each character was in their game world i wasnt too happy about certain actors playing some of the characters but once the movie started i forgot all about that almost all of my favorite parts of super mario games were in the movie i loved every bit of it i hope they make another movie soon
Jun 14 2023,positive,its an alright movie altogether had some fun elements but overall the storyline and character development was underwhelming good for kids but not the best movie
Jun 14 2023,positive,twins thought it was amazing and granny liked all the familiar items from the video games
Jun 14 2023,positive,awesome its exactly like the video game and this movie is for any fan of mario
Jun 14 2023,positive,this movie was a masterpiece and its one of the best video game adapts ive ever seen the animation is phenomenal and i loved how the characters were portrayed just like in the games everything became very challenging for the character of mario to learn his way thru a magical fantasy world  i hope they make a sec movie
Jun 14 2023,positive,love it i was laughing the entire time and it feels nostalgic
Jun 14 2023,positive,my 8 year old granddaughter was on the edge of her seat at times and i laughed out loud a few times she kept trying to explain things to me like id never played these games over all really cute movie
Jun 14 2023,negative,its bright and filled with mayo references that are very cute that being said the movie is incredibly predictable and not all that interesting
Jun 14 2023,positive,the moive is very good donkey kongs perfomce isnt very good and its a blemish on an otherwise great film that being said the other profmecs make up for it 
Jun 14 2023,positive,its a really good movie it has so much detail and every easter egg basically if your a super mario fan your gonna like this movie
Jun 14 2023,positive,fantastic animation and a really fun movie for the family
Jun 14 2023,positive,super mario bros delivers a strong start to a cinematic universe     fun fact that i just made up waluigi and warios has a deleted alternative post credit scene as rival plumbers when spike employs them after the bros left it was cut due to it being op
Jun 14 2023,positive,the super mario bros takes the iconic video game characters and makes them genuinely interesting this adventure has great pacing and a great plot villains are important to me and bowser is a great character but is a little hard to take seriously at times
Jun 14 2023,positive,cute movie good storyline
Jun 14 2023,positive,enjoyed this movie very much   would recommend for all audiences
Jun 14 2023,positive,fun movie i enjoyed see mario in action
Jun 14 2023,negative,it was very good animation but it can be better
Jun 14 2023,negative,good things   has little references to games   has some funny jokes for more mature audiences sprinkled in    jack black singing peaches was great     bad things   not pleasant visuals why does peach look like that   extremely plain silly snore causing story   poorly written dialogue   bowser is poorly written
Jun 13 2023,positive,this is a perfectly good kids movie thats loaded with little bits of nostalgia    if youre a kid youll enjoy it for the colors fun characters and decent kids comedy  if youre an older long time fan of mario youll enjoy the quality animation and nostalgic references    the story is rushed a bit at some parts and the segments with the 80s music seems out of place but production wise those are the only real downsides along with fred armisens performance as cranky kong is a tad weak    overall it does what it intends to as a kids movie it wont hit any top best movies of all time lists but its fine and clearly makes people happy
Jun 13 2023,positive,this movie is the first movie that was just made for entertainment without any political agenda that has been in theaters for a while now
Jun 13 2023,positive,i enjoyed super mario its finally a good game movie adaptation for me the best movie game adaptation the story is good the characters too the film is full of references to nintendo games i give the film an overall 810
Jun 13 2023,positive,is the funniest movie
Jun 13 2023,positive,it was a really fun movie i think this was a perfect intro movie to start what im sure will be a trilogy at least jack black stole the show as bowser and i cant wait to see more from him  definitely worth a watch
Jun 13 2023,positive,one of the best movies of all time a must watch enjoyable for all

Jun 13 2023,positive,movie was awesome seen it twice and it was still worth watching again
Jun 12 2023,positive,this movie is a work of art but the critics say its not that good because they are not fans of nintendo games the movie is made for the fans not for the academy or their movie critics good job illumination and nintendo
Jun 12 2023,positive,felt like i was reliving all the video games all at once
Jun 12 2023,positive,just plain fun  not sure what more you need besides a good time nostalgia and easter eggs
Jun 12 2023,positive,meh its a childrens film so what do you expect i liked the fan service and over all this film is good enough for it to not be rotten
Jun 12 2023,positive,e esse filme mostra o que toda adaptação de games deve ser fiel nas referências fiel no efeito nostalgia lindas imagens sem nenhuma inovação que descaracterize a história ou os personagens fabuloso fantástico essa é a prova de que os críticos profissionais não entendem nada de filmes baseados em games  and this movie shows what every game adaptation should be  faithful in references  true to the nostalgia effect  beautiful images  without any innovation that mischaracterizes the story or characters  fabulous fantastic this is proof that professional critics dont understand anything about movies based on games
Jun 12 2023,positive,it was amazing the mario movie is what everyone dreamed of having tons of easter eggs  references to other titles of nintendo games and an overall happiness this movie was a great one in a while personally if you want to watch it i would suggest what mario always says letsago
Jun 12 2023,negative,cool easter eggs thrown in but the movie just didnt hold my attention boring at times and felt forced the entire time im sure kids with no attention span will love it
Jun 12 2023,positive,a movie that was dedicated for its younger audience the super mario bros movie is a great movie a thin easy to follow plot good music and decently made characters its characters might lack a bit of an arch but for a kids movie its not the biggest problem
Jun 12 2023,positive,absolutely amazing you have to watch it
Jun 12 2023,positive,absolutely amazing i loved all the references of the old mario elements all the way back to the 64 edition games loved the origion story that stayed true to mario and luigi coming from brooklyn like in the super mario bros super show 1010

Jun 12 2023,positive,so fresh absolute must see d
Jun 12 2023,positive,if i could give this film more than 5 stars i would  the film was similar to the video game    i love all of the characters in the film the resemblance of the characters was spot on compared to the video game    my favorite character is luigi although the other characters were not bad at all each character played an important role    the graphics and the animations were astronomical the amount of time that was put into creating this magnificent 3d film is mindblowing  i honestly cannot believe how detailedoriented this film was    i would recommend everyone to watch this film at least once  i would watch it over and over again
Jun 12 2023,positive,very cute and wholesome watch the many scenes and easter eggs in this movie capture the mario magic i thought luigi wasnt gonna receive any love like always but he had his moments too loved the soundtrack
Jun 12 2023,positive,great movie from beginning to the end 
Jun 12 2023,positive,great animated film no propaganda good jokes
Jun 12 2023,positive,dont know why mario looked like a bear but i loved it so much

Jun 12 2023,positive,this movie hits every level of nostalgia for that 90s kid in all of us whether you are new to the franchise or lying about it you will enjoy this movie from start to finish a must see for anyone who has ever picked up a controller and played a super mario game
Jun 12 2023,neutral,as soon as the movie started it felt like 20 minutes flew by and i felt nothing for it but the references and inside jokes were pretty good im not that huge a mario fan the only mario games i care for are the mario kart games but thats about it
Jun 12 2023,positive,the young boy that was waiting on me when i was ordering popcorn i was a sweetheart
Jun 12 2023,positive,such a fun film chris pratt and jack black are incredible cannot wait for the next one
Jun 12 2023,positive,i someone who grew up with some super mario brothers and the eighties and nineties this movie could have been so much better and looks like the original top process wasnt there seemed like it was rush they could have made it way more clever and funny they could have made you know 34 movies but the 1st one wasnt good i mean they do make a second or 3rd that can maybe do better but get a lot of room for improvement
Jun 12 2023,positive,just a fun enjoyable family movie that my kids loved without all the social engineering garbage being pushed on society
Jun 11 2023,neutral,good kids movie and looked great but too basic

Jun 11 2023,positive,perfect amount of nostalgia and story line great pace throughout the whole movie
Jun 11 2023,positive,i am going with an awesome rating because my husband and i took 3 grandchildren ages 912 and our extended family member with disabilities and this movie kept every one of them glued to the screen the entire time  it was full of nonstop action that kept them wanting more if it was good enough for them it was good enough for grandpa and grandmawho by the way caught themselves chuckling quite a few times
Jun 11 2023,positive,the plot is basic and sometimes makes 0 sense but the movie its still very enjoyable
Jun 11 2023,positive,i thought it was a great cute nostalgic movie the plot yes was a little throwed off but overall funny and bowsers song is so freaking cute love the throwbacks to different games and tracks i hope they make more
Jun 11 2023,positive,very nostalgic if you used to play the games and a super fun watch
Jun 11 2023,positive,an entertaining movie but lacked a little more of the original soundtrack of the video game not even placed the reference at the end of the movie to reach the flag or the goal
Jun 11 2023,positive,it was amazing it really made me feel like a happy kid truly recommend this film great job on the story line its a fun enjoyable flick for all ages
Jun 11 2023,positive,look there are tomato critics and there are viewer critics listen to the viewers the movie was great family fun and true entertainment for all ages rotten tomatoes score is just wrong but hey everyone has there own opinions
Jun 11 2023,positive,i grew up playing these games since nintendos nes this movie not only thoroughly entertained me but took me on a voyage to happy childhood memories and i am sure of it will be amongst the happy memories of young generations that play these games now screw what the critics say they are not the ones that pay the tickets at cinema well done nintendo for listening to what the people wanted to see and being loyal to your creation and fans of the mario bros
Jun 11 2023,positive,it was a great family movie that brought back childhood memories
Jun 11 2023,positive,loved it i would watch it over and over again
Jun 11 2023,positive,2nd time watching it super fire for a date
Jun 11 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics who were expecting a masterpiece with an amazing plot this movie is amazing and is jampacked with easter eggs to keep on your toes and the brotherly love between mario and luigi is very wholesome i like that peach isnt an npc that just gets kidnapped every 2 seconds i recommend this movie to all people of all ages great movie totally recommend 
Jun 10 2023,positive,really good i liked how it put all the mario brothersdong king kong character all together in a movie
Jun 10 2023,positive,my 6 yr old 1st time seeing a movie in a theatre and he absolutely loved it just short enough for him to make it through the whole thing
Jun 10 2023,positive,it had the right characters but the story was pretty minimal compared to the games
Jun 10 2023,positive,this is the movie i wanted to see when i was a kid in the 90s but obviously didnt get but here it is now and though enjoyable is perhaps a bit out of its time in a world where evidently people expect more from a film than to see characters they love moving around on a screen kids will love it but as an adult i can recognize that there are many missed opportunities to make this film a more meaningful tale of two brothers and their relationship that it touches on but never really fully explores
Jun 10 2023,positive,amazing movie simple but veru good story good end a lot of references to games you must to see this picture righ now
Jun 10 2023,positive,frick the critics this film is so awesome it is by far the most faithful adaptation of a video game to film to date the film is honestly beautiful and filled with the life of the world brought to life by shigeru miyamoto dont even get me started on jack black now i will admit there are story pacing and character issues but who even cares 810
Jun 10 2023,positive,love this movie watched it 3 times so far  only issue was seth rogan  was true the game
Jun 10 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time

Jun 10 2023,negative,surprised they resisted the urge to make them the tyrone brothers 
Jun 10 2023,positive,a mario adaptation made for the fans so of course a lot of stiff critics hated the movie not only mario fans but nintendo players should enjoy the movie as well since theres easter eggs for other nintendo games as well like luigis mansion and kid icarus
Jun 9 2023,positive,this was a great movie for kids and adults as a mario fan from the 90s this was such a great movie to watch
Jun 9 2023,positive,kid loved it which made it that much better definitely had some throwback moments that took me back to firing up the nesbit n64
Jun 9 2023,positive,finally a childs movie where the rainbows where just rainbows they drove in and not trying to indocturnate our  children just good humor and good story nice to see not everything is woke
Jun 9 2023,positive,its the perfect gateway movie watching warcraft and ready to movie into the lego movie itll take you there watching the super mario bros movie and ready to move into the dungeons and dragons movie itll take you there this movie served as a truly impeccable twist between a mystical realm and somewhat reality that we needed forget gateway drugs and indulge in gateway cinema fantastic work 5 stars
Jun 9 2023,positive,a fan service to anyone who plays nintendo games whether it be retro or modern
Jun 9 2023,positive,excellent movie im not even a fan of the mario franchise of games but i found there a lot to enjoy about this and there is even more out there for those who are fans and want a good helping of references cameos and easter eggs galore cast is great despite initial criticisms this film faced before release it shows that it is best to not judge a book by its cover as a lot of love went into this clearly   in being animated and being true to the source material it has a lot of positives that could not be said for say the sonic films which while good are clearly an interpretation this is a much closer adaption to the source game franchise  itsa good
Jun 9 2023,positive,this is the only best video game movie than other video game movie the story is interesting but the different is that point of this movie is not about to save princess peach and defeat bowser like in the original game of super mario bros it about to save luigi and then defeat bowser but that okay i love how this movie of super mario bros is to let know something like what mario and luigi mom and dad look like what mario and luigi come from and princess peach too and how mario kart invented awsome i give it 5 star
Jun 9 2023,positive,it was pretty decent film i enjoyed it mostly just cant enjoy the bits overtly for kids very faithful to the video games and who doesnt love charlie day
Jun 9 2023,positive,faithful to the original content nostalgia and lots of entertainment animation to watch with the whole family
Jun 9 2023,positive,great movie for the kids with enough interesting jokes and bits to keep adults enticed
Jun 9 2023,negative,what the heck did they do to mario this movie had me hype but there was just one promblem chris praitt as mario was not good at all he did not make mario itallion like what chris if your seeing this stick to marvel buddy other then that jack black carried the movie this is still getting a 1 in a half stars for crappy chris praitt
Jun 9 2023,positive,a movie with a light story and certainly very suitable for all ages its very nintendo
Jun 9 2023,positive,really fun animation dialogues seemed pretty shallow in some moments but its worth to give it a try
Jun 9 2023,positive,i have played 6 mario games mario world mario rpg mario bros super mario bros super paper mario and super mario odyssey and i have to say i loved this not a big game guy yet i still enjoyed it good job minions
Jun 9 2023,positive,for someone whos played mario before it makes the plot better than the average mario game it gave mario more of a background and same thing with peach its a fun movie
Jun 9 2023,positive,awesome movie we had a blast with my duaghter and there is no woke propaganda in it just a fun movie
Jun 9 2023,positive,this movie is an amazing movie but it has its flaws i love super mario and this movie was a must watch for mario fans like me but just cause its mario doesnt mean the movie is super the timing was kinda fastpaced an example is when mario peach and toad are traveling to the jungle kingdom they were moving from one place to another in 1 second and a cheepcheep scene was cut from the film another thing i like to mention is that the voice acting for all of the characters was great chris pratt wasnt bad at marios voice he was decent with the italian and brooklyn accent best voice acting has to go to jack black great movie to lighten your day 45
Jun 9 2023,positive,its not groundbreaking by any meansbut its still a wonderful movie that perfectly captures the visual concept of the mario games for the big screen and sets up what appears to be a bright future for the mario universe at the movies
Jun 9 2023,positive,the mario movie is not a movie meant to stick with you or leave a deep lasting impact like other films and there is nothing wrong with that the mario movie does everything it sets out to do be a fun trip with the allstar cast if you go into this movie expecting a masterpiece you will not enjoy it but if you go into it just looking for a good time you are sure to enjoy the movie and yourself
Jun 9 2023,positive,great movie for kids and adults
Jun 9 2023,positive,its really good dont listen to the critics this movie is a fun time
Jun 9 2023,positive,when i saw the trailers i had alot to expect amd it was fulfilled in the movie from easter eggs here and there with some really well done animations and concepts this really is a mario fans dream come true
Jun 9 2023,positive,very goodfor adults and kids
Jun 9 2023,positive,while certainly not being perfect having weak characters and a feeble plot the super mario bros movie will delight its viewers with its smooth animation and excellent voice acting and long time fans can enjoy the overhaul of references and callbacks even if it is kind of overdone here
Jun 8 2023,positive,the mario games were my childhood playing the ds and getting a movie with so many references is great video game movie and like chris pratt as mario
Jun 8 2023,positive,finally something i can watch with my 5 year old clean family fun its about time
Jun 8 2023,negative,a silly movie and beautiful and only movies

Jun 8 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece a modern classic so to say a must see for everyone
Jun 8 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches
Jun 8 2023,positive,this is one of the few great movies ive seen in a while even though i feel like the pacing was rushed the references and animation make up for it plus the voice acting isnt that bad as most say
Jun 8 2023,positive,its a great movie you cant mess around with mario and luigi and their family what is the best maybe it is the racing scene
Jun 8 2023,negative,really bad just bad
Jun 8 2023,positive,a verry cute and funny movie with much connections to the old games
Jun 8 2023,positive,i have been a huge mario fan ever since i was a child ive played a lot of the games also watched gameplays on youtube of the games i couldnt play and that movie has done everything that the fans wanted except for being longer i really wanted to see more of something like that at the end of the movie now even though i dislike illumination i must admit that they have done a espectacular job with super mario everything about that movie is perfect the powerups the bowsers army the music the amount of references to the old games and the characters everything is just amazing and absolutely i disagree on the critics rating i hope to see more masterpieces like that keep up this good work nintendo 
Jun 8 2023,positive,brilliant hilarious and fun for children and adults alike absolutely loved it best movie of 2023 so far it has great character development interesting plot and is in general a wholesome family friendly movie without issues of race or political statements  disney were looking at you
Jun 8 2023,positive,honestly as someone whose very first games were the legend of zelda mario and metroid it was quite nostalgic to see this movie the plot wasnt great but thats not why i went to see the movie i went because everyone in the theater had a great time seeing the jokes cracked memories had and the song peaches
Jun 8 2023,positive,shi was fire chris pratt is my mario
Jun 8 2023,positive,great movie as a lifelong fan of the games but the story was rushed and underdeveloped still very fun to watch if you are a fan of mario and this movie has lots of easter eggs and details that big fans will like
Jun 8 2023,positive,with help from princess peach mario gets ready to square off against the allpowerful bowser to stop his plans from conquering the world    this and spiderverse have the best animation ever holy damn the movie is colorful the animation itself is perfect they nailed all of the character designs and the worlds from brooklyn to the mushroom kingdom look gorgeous they absolutely nailed it with the style of the movie everybody has been talking about chris pratt and i thought he was alright definitely needed to adjust a bit to him in the beginning of the movie but at the end you get used to it but it still isnt something i would cast again anya taylorjoy was pretty great and i wouldnt have ever thought that i would hear donkey kong laugh as seth rogen jack black is by far the best of the voice cast he is perfect in the movie as browser the rest are ok i can see why some people that have never played mario before had a bit of a rough time with it because it immediately throws you into the world of mario with little to no explanation of it all as someone who always used to play mario all the time when i was little i was just amazed by all the easter eggs and references that were in this movie from the sounds to the designs to the score and the screenplay there are references everywhere and i absolutely loved it the story itself is not that special and it is moving on a pretty fast pace where somethings are just happening without explaining things but you get to explore the whole world with mario toad and peach so thats enough for me i loved the rainbow road scene and i liked the bits we got the spent in brooklyn as well to my surprise but the oner on the rainbow road was by far my favorite part of the movie but also the first visit to the mushroom kingdom absolutely loved every design choice overall the movie definitely works better for the fans of mario then for the fans of a good movie but i can assure you that it is worth watching for animation alone
Jun 8 2023,positive,such a fun and ridiculously dumb but hilarious ride for a mario fan
Jun 8 2023,positive,fun funny simple i enjoyed it and so did my wife and 4 year old
Jun 8 2023,positive,best animation movie perfect for both children and adults alike dont trust the movie critics
Jun 8 2023,neutral,great soundtrack and great animation as always from illumination however the pattern of having a bad plot and bad motive behind the villain continues in this movie
Jun 8 2023,positive,suck a good and funny movie lover every minute

Jun 7 2023,positive,i just had the pleasure of watching the super mario bros movie and let me tell you its agoombastomping good time this movie brings the beloved video game characters to life in a way that will leave you feeling like youre in the mushroom kingdom yourself    the cast is absolutely amazing with their performances feeling like a star powerup and the special effects are so realistic youll swear you can see the bricks breaking and coins popping out of them    overall i give the super mario bros movie 2023 two thumbs up or should i say two thumbs on the dpad its a shellshocking adventure that will leave you feeling like you just found a secret warp pipe to pure joy

Jun 7 2023,positive,this movie is entertaining and very nostalgic for anyone who grew up with a nintendo game system also my kids love it
Jun 7 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is exactly what youd expect the writing and direction is average and its the perfect movie to watch with kids or if youre a fan of mario chris pratt is okay but jack black really steals the show as bowser it moves along way too fast at points the film needed another 15 or 20 minutes for extra plot and world building the movie sometimes feels like the best parts of the mario games thrown together to form a plot overall the super mario bros movie does what it sets out to do but not much else
Jun 7 2023,positive,this movie is tops 10 in it i love it
Jun 7 2023,positive,it was an okay movie i think it couldve been better
Jun 7 2023,positive,oh my god this is one of the best illumination movies i have ever seen the plot is relatively good and it actually can be enjoyed by people over the age of 7 this is a near perfect movie that can be enjoyed by everyone they didnt mess up the casting and jack black oh my god he was amazing for the role of bowser sometimes i wonder if this was made by illumination because this is on dreamworks quality this was a movie that was only criticized badly because it was made by the people it was made by good work illumination you made a good movie
Jun 7 2023,positive,review the super mario bros movie  simply a delight  by maria elena gutierrez    any filmmakers who want to adapt a video game for the big screen face challenges that might seem insurmountable how do you craft a linear storyline from source material that obeys a different set of narrative rules how do you reimagine muchloved original game content without transforming it beyond recognition         with universal pictures and illumination entertainments the super mario bros movie directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic and their codirectors pierre leduc and fabien polack have achieved the impossible together they have crafted an entertaining family spectacle that will please not only fans of nintendos longrunning series of super mario games but also anybody ready to enjoy 90 minutes of actionpacked escapism         the script by matthew fogel relates the escapades of two brothers mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day as they are whisked away from their everyday lives as brooklyn plumbers to help the valiant princess peach anya taylorjoy save the mushroom kingdom one of several fanciful realms that exist in a farflung corner of the cosmos peachs nemesis is bowser jack black whose overriding ambition is to marry the princess  at all costs with marios help peach forges an alliance with cranky kong fred armisen and his son donkey kong seth rogen leading to a final confrontation with bowser and his ruthless koopa army         this deceptively straightforward narrative is one the films greatest strengths providing as it does a clean unambiguous structure capable of supporting all the ingame references a super mario uberfan could desire without buckling under the weight the result is a lively adventure that effortlessly follows its own surreal logic with an affectionate combination of wit and warmth that draws from the nintendo games and classic movie tropes in equal measure in a rockystyle montage of platform action and powerups peach teaches mario how to navigate her strange world marios oneonone fight with donkey kong has all the hallmarks of a classic gladiatorial smackdown scenes of the good guys speeding in their karts along rainbow road jump off the screen like a psychedelic mad max         transferring video game action to the big screen requires a special kind of alchemy  one that the super mario bros movie has in abundance these candycolored visions are bold but the artists at illumination studios in paris have crafted them with a remarkable combination of subtlety and vigor at every turn the action is beautifully supported by brian tylers wonderful score which weaves in original nintendo themes by koji kondo and a plethora of gameera hits including the beastie boys no sleep till brooklyn bonnie tylers holding out for a hero and ahas take on me         dig deeper and you will find themes that follow the same rule of simplicity colored by subtle nuance early scenes show mario and luigi as part of an extended italian family living in new york city following their dream  a version of the great american dream of course  the brothers have just launched a commercial promoting their new plumbing business in which they assert thats why the super mario brothers are here to save brooklyn         the ersatz italian accents they adopt for the commercial honor the original video game voice talent but bear no resemblance to their normal speaking voices furthermore mario is shown to have low selfesteem driven in part by his fathers constant criticism  why did he leave a steady job and why is he dragging his brother down with him the fatherson tension is neatly resolved at the end of the film when having finally defeated bowser mario is told by his father you are amazing         meanwhile jack black achieves another kind of impossible by transforming bowser from what might have been a conventionalevil megalomaniac into a tortured romantic with real dimension to his character a scene where he pours out his heart in song while accompanying himself on the piano is an uproariously funny take on gaston lerouxs the phantom of the opera made all the more amusing by kevin michael richardsons voice performance as bowsers sorcerer sidekick kamek in which he appears to be channeling peter lorre         the super mario bros movie may sound like a recipe for a simple summer movie but as steve jobs famously said simple is harder than complex given all the ingredients in the mixing bowl a lesser group of filmmakers might have produced a movie that lacked flavor what aaron horvath and michael jelenic have created with their immensely talented team is precisely the opposite it is simply a delight
Jun 7 2023,positive,the critics got this so wrong as per mario is a fun film that all the family can see and laugh at and the older you are the more references there is to enjoy
Jun 7 2023,positive,very good movie enjoyed by both me and my kids

Jun 7 2023,positive,its like i got back in my childhood when i played mario the cartoon is really colourful and emotional which telling a story about plumbers who finds their vocation the movie will appeal as children so their parents
Jun 7 2023,negative,movie was made to be cute another terrible hollywood creation from the creator of big mommas like father like son writer didnt grow up playing mario games donkey kong wouldnt be using flower power etc story just follows hollywood trends made for money and to use famous actors absolute npc fan movie

Jun 6 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was fun
Jun 6 2023,positive,awesome ride through the mario universe
Jun 6 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was an amazing movie that managed to incorporate a lot of the original plot and fun tricks that the game is known for especially in a short amount of time of only one hour and half with amazing comedic timing and a more modernization of the characters as well as great world building i can say for a fact that the super mario bros is a great movie to watch especially thanks to the use of the literary device a motif the super mario bros is about mario and luigi accidentally discovering a new world where special abilities exist through the use of powerups but they split up with mario landing in the mushroom kingdom however luigi ends up in the darklands under bowsers control the antagonist and villain the movie uses the motif powerups to symbolize the potential that can be achieved through hard work and talent that mario can take advantage of in order to save his brother with the help of princess peach toad and donkey kong  the movie does in fact successfully uses the motif in order to discuss the overall theme of the movie which is about being able to do anything as long as you have your family because despite the fact that mario princess peach and donkey kong use the powerups to try and defeat bowser he is too powerful and in the end is only defeated by mario and luigi after they use the super star throughout the movie mario shows a clear talent in his dream to become an amazing plumber in brooklyn and queens alongside his brother luigi but also finds a talent in using the powerups marios goal throughout the entirety of the movie is to take good care of his brother especially to save him from bowser on his journey to face bowser mario learns how to use and take advantage of all the different types of power ups such as the kitty power up which he uses to defeat donkey kong in a battle for their army to help assist in going against bowser mario also uses the racoon power up in order to save the mushroom kingdom from being blown up by a huge bomb the movie isnt about mario winning the affections of peaches or even saving peaches which is usually what the games that the movie is based on about instead the movie is more focused on the theme of family through marios relationship with his brother this theme is typically reinforced through flashbacks and monologues that focus on how mario is always there for his brother whether defending him from bullies or simply helping him navigate through life the motif the powerups are a symbol of great power and a spotlight on marios potential to achieve his dreams and goals with his brother by his side in the end the movie finishes with the final battle between bowser and mario in which mario only wins through the help of his brother alongside the super star   the super mario bros is an amazing movie despite the cliche theme and ending of all living happily in the mushroom kingdom with luigi and mario having an implied successful plumbing career
Jun 6 2023,positive,they did a fantastic job incorporating everything i always loved about the games the music places most of the characters  yoshi was always one of my favorites their egg was in there but no yoshi yet  i cant wait to see how they do the next movie because there will no doubt be another
Jun 6 2023,positive,this movie makes me believe in theaters again
Jun 6 2023,positive,my 31 year old son has autism hes grown up playing and loving all the mario games on each nintendo system that came along it was so much fun going to this movie with him and see the smile on his face as he watched so many scenes that reminded him of the games hes seen the movie 6 times

Jun 5 2023,positive,celebrate over 40 years of mario with the super mario bros the movie if you love mario like that this film is the most trivial history of the worlds most famous plumber for those who play the most recent games youll see visual elements coming from the games that will get you excited as an old head i smiled when they made old school references to the history of the mario bros especially happy that they focused on mario and luigis organs as italian americans from brooklyn over whatever that accent they are doing in the games now is from    as far as the voice over controversy is concern ill give credit to chris pratt whose performance seem truer to mario than it did his star power which is overall weird cause it seems you would hire pratt to hear his voice come out of mario in the opposite of pratt it felt like seth rogen was trying too hard to assure you knew he was donkey kong none of the voice over choices truly wowed me the only talent worth it was jack black he was not the best king koopa but he gave us to ballets in the film that were definitely jack black and that was good for some laughing    i cannot see anyone disliking the film if youre a true diehard mario fan youll notice that animation is up to pair with the visually amazing worlds nintendo has built in these games the colorfulness will generate with anyone who loves animated movies and the story is grown up enough to keep everyone interested does not help that everyone loves mario mario right
Jun 5 2023,positive,i saw this in theaters best illumination movie ever made this is way better than the 1993 film
Jun 5 2023,negative,if you are a parent dont go make an older sibling or babysitter go as punishment horrible movie counting seconds until i walk out
Jun 5 2023,positive,its a fun movie and its super enjoyable with its many references visuals this movie could benefit by adding an extra 20 minutes of extra storyline instead of toad they shouldve added yoshi as marios best bud for the movie and have dk and toad be extra parts and contribute

Jun 5 2023,positive,bring me back to the good ol memories love it
Jun 5 2023,positive,respected everything from marios universe adding references from multiple games  peach was too active though  usually she is the one kidnapped needing help from mario and luigi  this time luigi did nothing and she was almost the main hero
Jun 5 2023,negative,i was so excited to see it and i thought it was gonna at least be okay but it was just boring i didnt feel drawn in to the story at all it just seemed like a cashgrab shitty hollywood movie
Jun 5 2023,positive,excellent movie has it all fun respects the essence of the character and can be enjoyed with the family

Jun 5 2023,positive,wahoo this is a fun movie
Jun 5 2023,positive,please for the love of god ignore the critics on this one  this movie is just a joy to watch in every imaginable way its nostalgic innocent easy on the eyes and just delightful all around it really makes me sad that something that just brings simple joy to so many is being denigrated so unfairly by perpetually miserable critics who have nothing better to do with their failed destitute personal and professional lives than to try and shovel dirt all over a wellmade movie that makes people happy
Jun 5 2023,positive,i really enjoyed watching the movie in a local theater  my kid loved it too  at first i was concerned about the change in voice but how the movie handled the difference well

Jun 4 2023,negative,this is going to be a super unpopular take but i really disliked this movie i didnt think anything was funny whilst the whole theater was laughing and i felt no connection with the character and story and this is coming from someone who really likes the mario game franchise just a big disappointment in my eyes

Jun 4 2023,positive,dont ever trust the critics review
Jun 4 2023,neutral,well for any long term fan of nintendo you will know storytelling is not their strong suit and this movie was no different i had very low expectations going in and this movie was exactly what i expected it to be no more no less my son is a big mario fan and he really wanted to see this movie in the theater and that was really the only reason my wife and i bothered to go while this movie looked amazing i suppose the content was at the same level as a direct to dvd disney movie worth a watch to pass the time but not much more as they seemed more concerned with throwing in every possible mario reference of the past 40 years and not much else if your entertained by the cutscenes in mario gamesthat just move the plot forward than you will be more than entertained by this film if you could care less about cutscenes in mario games because its the same wash rinse and repeat formula this is more of the same
Jun 4 2023,positive,really enjoyed this film

Jun 4 2023,positive,i watched this with my 13 year old and we both really enjoyed the film it wasnt preaching with an agenda it was a genuinely fun wholesome and well made film the  story is simplistic but not condescending or patronising
Jun 4 2023,positive,super mario bros delivers a fun  exciting adventure for both kids and adults  as a child of the 80s who grew up playing the original nintendo this movie brought back so many memories from the sights sounds and hidden objects of the original games  the storyline incorporates all the characters we know and love from the video games while entertaining us with their unique personalities  the movie also boasts a nostalgic 80s soundtrack  of course kids will love this movie since it also includes references to newer super mario games  a terrific timeless movie for all nintendo fans
Jun 4 2023,positive,lots of fun for the kids for older gamers its a fun take on super mario
Jun 4 2023,positive,as a mario fan for life this movie surpassed my expectations love it

Jun 4 2023,positive,my kids and i loved it
Jun 4 2023,positive,loved it simple and fun story
Jun 4 2023,positive,a true masterpiece which really does show the disconnect between movie critics and actual people
Jun 4 2023,negative,a hard to watch movie thatll be forgotten in a matter of months
Jun 4 2023,positive,its a great movie for kids and adults its non stop action fun no excessive talking its the first movie my adhd kid was able to watch without getting up or rummaging around due to loss of interest
Jun 4 2023,positive,in some places it is weak in other places it is good however it is not a masterpiece more of a bad typical illuminati movie because of the hodgepodge
Jun 4 2023,positive,great film fun but simple story great action scenes for kids and tons of nostalgia brought me back to my childhood days of playing the games
Jun 4 2023,negative,didnt really feel like a story just a vehicle for refreferences happening one after another near independently
Jun 4 2023,positive,this is the kind of movie disney should be making visually stunning true to the source material no politic bs like blackwashing etc
Jun 4 2023,positive,its a good movie but it has some flaws like its too fast we just cant catch up with scenes and the movie doesnt give us info u have to play the game some nostalgic moments makes this movie good and i appreciate the creativity that makes it good
Jun 4 2023,positive,i was bewildered when the super mario bros movie became the biggest box office hit of 2023 so far but after watching it its easy to see why the movie is colorful funny and very enjoyable it takes audiences on a wild adventure of nostalgia and fun and exceeds expectations in every way even chris pratt voicing mario wasnt as bad as i thought despite being animated its a movie for all ages and thats the key reason for its success the family film genre nearly disappeared in the last decade replaced by silly childrencentric films that dont take adult viewers into account super mario bros strays far from that formula offering something for animation super mario and casual movie lovers its immensely entertaining and a worthy summer hit
Jun 4 2023,positive,good for a kids movie
Jun 4 2023,positive,while very story light it is a fun romp with lots of nostalgia for any keen eyed viewers with easter eggs for every generation of nintendo player it wraps things up neatly and doesnt appear to be any bigger of a cash grab than any other movie
Jun 4 2023,positive,the movie was great  the whole family loved it
Jun 4 2023,neutral,the message of the movie left me feeling a bit uncomfortable it was nice to see the various mario nintendo easter eggs but that was about the whole reason to watch the movie
Jun 4 2023,positive,finally a good video game adaptation true to the source material and perfectly goofy i just thought jack black im was not quite bowser material 
Jun 4 2023,positive,i love it its fun colorful and full of easter eggs the only thing that i didnt like was the songs like i need a hero or take on me it will fill so much better a song from the video games the rest of it was amazing
Jun 4 2023,positive,5stars simply for the courageous choice to preserve the original characters
Jun 4 2023,positive,amazing movie would watch again didnt like the climax
Jun 4 2023,positive,watched with my brother amazing movie with lots of references from the past 55 stars would rewatch it again
Jun 4 2023,positive,brought back some old memories my kiddo really enjoyed the movie as well

Jun 3 2023,positive,second highest grossing animated film of all time if the creators of the film are wondering why it did so good its because there literally wasnt anything weird in the film this was the first movie my family and i chose to go to in a while because we heard it was an actual clean show worth watching not that interested in mario but once heard it was normal we went to see it i suspect there are others that did the same
Jun 3 2023,positive,overall great kids movie some language like kill and die and name calling that may be inappropriate for young children
Jun 3 2023,positive,it was very good it appealed young kids with the new mario games and adults with the original nes game i will say maybe they could have chosen some better voice actors
Jun 3 2023,positive,love that its a store about siblings who have each others backs   i also love that princess peach is fierce  she is a baddie love it   great role model for girls to see
Jun 3 2023,positive,growing up in my childhood my brothers and i owned nintendo 64 and a game boy we loved playing super mario brothers and mario kart ive always been a fan of mario and the gang this movie is a mustsee especially for the older generation i heard so many great things about this movie i finally said i had to see it for myself this movie is a big wow i learned something new like i had no idea that mario and luigi were plumbers go see this movie 
Jun 3 2023,positive,my grandkids thought the movie was really really great  they are still talking about it
Jun 3 2023,positive,jack black voiceover is legendary  a great film for everyone but the 40s peeps will definitely connect as the movie is true to mario nostalgia
Jun 3 2023,positive,fun movie  truly honoured the fans of the franchise which explains its great success
Jun 3 2023,positive,amazing both my 15 yo and 9 yo loved it must see

Jun 3 2023,positive,i love this movie i think its good for kids to watch this but i kind of wish is more mystery and more scary
Jun 3 2023,negative,tried way too hard to connect reality and a video game    entirely unneccessary
Jun 3 2023,positive,good movie   loved how funny it was  definitely a good family movie
Jun 3 2023,neutral,if you have not played the games yo will miss 40
Jun 3 2023,positive,so much fun loved the fresh story line with all the easter eggs of the games

Jun 3 2023,positive,this movie was very good just watched it with the kids the songs were good i liked the plot  the visuals
Jun 3 2023,positive,this was adorable if youve ever played any of the games you know the characters and its so good see it if you have the chance
Jun 3 2023,positive,very enjoyable for a mario movie  alot of callbacks to the games i really liked
Jun 3 2023,positive,i had extremely low expectations for this movie and questioned if i would go to even watch the movie but since going to watch it i really liked the movie i dont really understand as to why some may hate this movie as it is very well overall
Jun 3 2023,positive,what do you really expect actually is a mario show they play best at its gaming factor sometime you wish to even see more with that amazing animation faithful to the source material flat story for sure it at least it was watchable adding jack blacks peaches to my playlist
Jun 3 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece a simple fun story very good
Jun 3 2023,positive,um filme para a familia  divertido   recomendo    a movie for the family  funny   i recommend
Jun 3 2023,positive,this was a great film overall i dont care what the critics say i could tell there were a few minor issues with the film but they didnt ruin the experience as a mario fan i really liked this film and this film definitely deserves a lot of praise it was awesome to watch

Jun 3 2023,positive,loved it was everything a kid who grew up with nintendo could expect to love theyve updated what they had to but kept the soul of mario alive and well youll laugh and feel nostalgia its worth seeing in imax 
Jun 3 2023,positive,the movie is very sweet and the opinion of the critics is not important at all
Jun 3 2023,positive,i loved it such a cute authentic movie 3
Jun 3 2023,positive,while the plot might not be super complex by any means the film is just a fun time at the movies and just puts a grin on your face if you grew up playing the mario games this movie gets bumped up a notch as there are tons of easter eggs at every corner chris pratt did a surprisingly good job with playing mario and jack black stole the show as bowser the rest of the cast was good in their roles as well the film also had great pacing visuals and animation a very solid film from universal and nintendo
Jun 3 2023,positive,amazing made my family laugh very good
Jun 3 2023,positive,while it not as good as other movies the super mario bros movie was a movie i have been waiting for a while i am proud it was not a masterpiece but it was pure fun i say check it out if you want a fun time this is the movie
Jun 3 2023,positive,i loved this movie it was very entertaining ive watched it a couple of times its a movie based off of popular gaming icons even if you arent into gaming this movie is still amazing it needs a oscar
Jun 3 2023,positive,it is a great movie it tells lots of kids to be brave and stand up for themselves and with the super mario bros plumber business it tells kids you can do what ever you put your mind to great movie if you dont like mario its okay but you want your kids should watch this movie 
Jun 3 2023,positive,this movie is fun if you were to grade this like a normal movie i would say to avoid this but this movie is different it is just a blast to watch it is fun to pick out the little easter eggs and say to yourself ooooh i get that unfortunately this movie is a bad movie its pacing is weird somethings dont make sense overall this movie sucks but it is so much fun to watch
Jun 3 2023,negative,definitely a movie just for kids pretty slow and predictable
Jun 3 2023,positive,this movie was family friendly clean great story line and did not have to have conversation with my kids about anything questionable
Jun 3 2023,positive,fantastic movie that should win best animated feature at the oscars in 2024
Jun 3 2023,positive,if youre a mario fan its great look at those stars if youre not this probably isnt anything special
Jun 3 2023,positive,the character design was beautiful the animation and effects excellent the plot is appreciated not being the repeated plot of romance and that peach saves herself is very significant the fact that the plot revolves around the brothers was touching but of course its not that its the best movie of the year it simply fulfilled its mission to commemorate the mario saga with their characters and also with references to their games thank you very much nintendo 
Jun 3 2023,positive,good movie not great but solid and kids liked it peach just seemed off and bowser was just too much jack black
Jun 3 2023,positive,the animation was amazing and story line could be improved and lots of drama and action
Jun 2 2023,positive,loved the acrion many funny moments
Jun 2 2023,positive,enjoyable to anyone who has ever played a mario game its bright and colorful runtime is short and is a simple plot for kids to understand movie is a good start to the nintendo universe and many more movies
Jun 2 2023,positive,funny and entertaining

Jun 2 2023,positive,i actually fell asleep during this movie but my kids loved it which is why i gave it a 4 star rating
Jun 2 2023,positive,very cute movie with a great storyline
Jun 2 2023,positive,its a goofy kids movie  i do like the game lore in it
Jun 2 2023,positive,my ten year old grandson loved it
Jun 2 2023,positive,the nerd part of my brain says that this has got to be one of the sharpest clearest ways to write and produce a video game movie however pacing problems and a lack of dynamic character progression do hold this film back but who cares as a movie garnered towards kids and fans of super mario this film is perfectly that
Jun 2 2023,positive,a breath of fresh air in the field of modern movies not preachy just pure fun nostalgia one of the great things about mario is that no matter what age you are you grew up with some familiarity with mario great for the whole family
Jun 2 2023,positive,adapted screenplay is perfect the sound is great and peaches is an incredible song
Jun 2 2023,positive,the movie is a great family movie and hits all of the fan favorites from the game i dont know why the critics are giving such bad reviews they probably do not have kids who pays attention to them anyways lol
Jun 2 2023,positive,personally i think that the movie was ok it just about kept me interested but didnt have much of a plot
Jun 2 2023,positive,excellent family movie this is a must watch for everyone
Jun 2 2023,positive,the little mermaid was epic this movie symbolized so many historic moments for me including recollections of my childhood memories i love the fact that ariel now is a representation of little girls of color everywhere which i was pleased to be able to introduce to my daughter and she can definitely see the ariel inside her self also the soundtrack was really great and not only included my old favorites but surprisingly included new music which was also an added bonus
Jun 2 2023,positive,honestly i thought that this movie will turn out another mediocre mario movie well i was in shocked when i saw this movie i was hooked from the begging to the end the animation was great the fact that they also included levels just like game was fantastic i cant wait for another mario movie
Jun 2 2023,positive,they cant just do that to my boy
Jun 2 2023,positive,everything was cool but it seemed more about luigi  and that weird star was just random af
Jun 2 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches
Jun 2 2023,positive,best movie so far just pure and funny
Jun 2 2023,positive,love the little details of all the other games like the characters and monuments
Jun 2 2023,positive,this movie was made for the super mario fans as someone who spent many hours playing super mario on the original nes with my siblings and parents this movie was just awesome the visuals the soundtrack peaches all of it was so good
Jun 2 2023,positive,very fun with a simple and enjoyable plot it was the first time in many years that i came out happy after watching it in the cinema
Jun 2 2023,negative,so much potential but terribly written 
Jun 2 2023,positive,it was a wonderful and very colorful movie  it took me back to the early 90s when we would play mario bros so fun
Jun 2 2023,positive,best 610 movie ive ever seen 1010 music and visuals are great story works fan service good
Jun 2 2023,positive,this movie should be proof in the industry that you need to keep video game ips as exact as possible you dont need the average viewer demographic resident evil should take note you sold millions of copies meaning millions of fans make the damn movie just like the game no pandering to the woke no made up hollywood crap just stick to the ip well reward you kindly
Jun 2 2023,positive,i like the movie  i dislike the seats because i have to look up at the screens i want the seats to be in higher level for a better screen view my neck hurts by looking up at the screen
Jun 2 2023,positive,chris pratt did it again
Jun 2 2023,positive,decent movie for a 90s kid after thinking it wasnt worth the time checking out
Jun 2 2023,positive,pretty darned good we with my niece and actually enjoyed it
Jun 2 2023,negative,more nostalgic than anything only laughed a couple times i was hoping for more comedy like the lego movies
Jun 1 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a masterpiece it has a imperishable animation good characters and música too the only problem is that the movie is too fast only 90 minutes 80 minutes of the movie itself without the credits as like most of the people say if yoy want a reallybdeep movie well its not your movie but a movie for fun that the one for you
Jun 1 2023,negative,feel like im the only mario fan who watched this movie who was pissed off seeing the entire movie first of all none of the characters sound like how they should and toad is not accurate to his voice in the games even though that voice is annoying i would still like some accuracy there the whole kingdoms thing is really stupid and it drove me crazy especially with bowsers castle that was ludicrous and felt more paper mario style than 3d mario which i get it this celebrates everything mario but god damn it sticks out to me and i cant stand it especially since i like paper mario way more than the 3d games and the whole origin story arc is stupid the whole brooklyn origin thing is nice for nongame canon but for game cannon it doesnt make a whole lot of sense and i dont really like it but thats just a personal thing as for peach if you really really dig around into the deep lore of the mario games youll understand that peaches parents most specifically her father was an actual mushroom and shes an actual resident of the mushroom kingdom her origins being from there so this whole thing there was not accurate wasnt an easter egg because its not how it actually is and a whole donkey kong one really really really pissed me off beyond comprehension as pointed out by game theory jumpman is different from mario and so is the donkey kong from that game with donkey kong almost clearly being cranky kong and also explained in a timeline theory by game theory it makes no sense for cranky kong to be donkey kongs father its more likely that donkey kong junior fits that role and that cranky kong is grandfather now since this is a theory its not canon technically but theres so much evidence for it may as well be and that whole section did piss me off because i know this isnt a donkey kong movie but i have never ever been more pissed ive played multiple donkey kong games and this is stupid beyond comprehension first of all donkey kong doesnt live in some kingdom castle thing he lives in a shack in the middle of a jungle with a pile of bananas thats donkey kong and hes his own separate hero not something from mario to be jumped from to be a hero so the arrogant rivalry thing may make sense for like donkey kong cranky kong and jump man but for this theyve had the mario versus donkey called obviously but seriously donkey kong is his own hero and portraying him like this really rubbed me the wrong way considering im a fan of both characters franchises as for toad there are so many different toads but they usually also the same with that annoying voice even though that would have been probably extra to put in for a movie and to hear the whole damn movie its still a gripe because id rather have accuracy then inaccuracy as if that wasnt enough the star power up thing makes no sense at all i know youre not supposed to think about this too much and you might as well just drink wood glue to turn off your brain and just enjoy the references as is but the problem is the star or star man or power star or whatever you want to call it is in bricks the same as the power ups so it just being at the center of a kingdom for the power doesnt really make since along with the entire penguin kingdom personally think this movie is just as bad as the other mario movie but not for the same reasons i love all the easter eggs dont get me wrong i love the cat suit being portrayed as the badass power up it is and stuff of that matter and other stuff like that but i cant get past certain parts of the characters themselves and some references when they cant be called references or easter eggs because they arent true to the game canon or any cannon for that matter and being a diehard fan with an extensive knowledge of the mario canon including pretty much every  and continuity including the obscure super mario world tv show im not impressed its half baked the voice actors sound nothing like the characters and they are just put in there to generate hype in the character backstories make no sense for game cannon some of them being for other canons which im fine with but with peach it just doesnt make any sense or donkey kong that one makes the least sense in is the most obvious stand out because you dont even have to be a die hard fan to understand that just play if you donkey kong country games and that will become dead obvious if you have only played a few mario games i could see you enjoying this but when you have played as many mario games as i have and games exclusive to some of these characters like super princess peach and the entire donkey kong franchise youre going to have some gripes and youre going to be pissed and in my opinion that soured my movie experience because i came here for the characters the easter eggs and the references that did not happen as accurately as i would want it to and it was half done 50 accuracy 50 good voice acting and 50 good characters and character development a complete disappointment this movie now stirs a burning hatred inside
Jun 1 2023,positive,my 5 grandchildren loved this movie disney should take lessons
Jun 1 2023,positive,this movie was great it had everything die hard mario fans wanted a few fun easter eggs hidden through out and characters had actual character arcs it was refreshing to see a well written story
Jun 1 2023,positive,beautiful animation great music  the story was perfectly long enough to hold the attention of kids i also enjoyed the movie as i grew up playing the games id recommend it for sure
Jun 1 2023,positive,the curse of game adaptations has finally been lifted this is a masterpiece
Jun 1 2023,positive,it is not as good as people are making it out to be  it is just nostalgic and suffers from contrived writing   i enjoyed most of the movie but i really craved a story of more substance  the visuals are so interesting that it is hard to notice how mediocre the story actually is
Jun 1 2023,negative,i really dont understand the hype story was kinda dumb  jokes werent the best for adults i feel like
Jun 1 2023,positive,great movie great actors no woke bullshit or politics
Jun 1 2023,positive,the movie was great i saw dk slap mario i saw mario punch dk it was cool
Jun 1 2023,positive,so fun and with zero agenda super refreshing to see a familyfriendly movie that everyoneanyone can enjoy
Jun 1 2023,positive,perfect at all and in any ways  perfect
Jun 1 2023,positive,movie is a little short but the music flows beautifully with the movie and the movie art style is like eye candy and the ending is amazing but the start is a little slow but the movie is good and the bowser soft side is amazing
Jun 1 2023,positive,at first when i found out that illumination would be involved and that the directors of the film would be the same as teen titans go i lost faith in the project but when the first trailer arrived my point of view towards this film changed more and more continued to come out trailers and i couldnt believe it they had done a great job with this film the day of the premiere arrived and the film left me with a good taste in my mouth i loved the film
Jun 1 2023,positive,when watching this movie i was transported back the days of gathering around an nes and taking turns on deaths with my friends
Jun 1 2023,positive,i thought it was pretty good the runtime could have been extended and mario and luigi should have gotten more screen time together but overall a good movie but you have to have played at least one mario game if you wanna understand the story more
Jun 1 2023,negative,nintendo should stick to making video games
Jun 1 2023,positive,super fun my sixyearold loved it
Jun 1 2023,positive,its a good movie for when you want to relax your mind very good to show to the kids the characters are lovable the comedy its acceptable action wise its decent
Jun 1 2023,positive,it is undoubtedly one of the greatest animated movies of 2023 the colors were shining with gleam and glow seems as though illumination and nintendo could potentially start a cinematic universe
Jun 1 2023,positive,the best movie ive ever seen even though i never play a single mario game those socalled pro critics who hate it can suck my balls
Jun 1 2023,positive,great movie for kids and adults very nostalgic highly recommend
Jun 1 2023,positive,super fun movie its visually beautiful its pretty fun i love the lighthearted but big hearted story line
Jun 1 2023,positive,this movie super duper good i liked it personally
Jun 1 2023,positive,simply a great introduction to the super mario brothers franchise
Jun 1 2023,positive,i dont know why the score is so low  for a video game translation i found it very entertaining
Jun 1 2023,positive,as usual the critics are wrong again  really great movie with references to all the games  really enjoyed this movie  i really dont know how professional critics keep a job with how inaccurate they are
Jun 1 2023,positive,fun movie to watch with the whole family
Jun 1 2023,positive,the movie was the best out of all movies i saw the animation was amazing and had great scenes i enjoyed it a lot
Jun 1 2023,positive,it was a great visual and the callbacks to old movies and video games were cool  the plot of the movie was less than desirable but still great for the kids
Jun 1 2023,positive,rottentomatoes has to be the most a backwards group of critics this movie was great from start to finish subtle nods to nintendo and games but also large scale scenes that incorporated the various mario games without taking away from the movie voice acting was perfect for each character perfectly paced movie from start to finish and hope  cant wait for a sequel
Jun 1 2023,negative,i will not be providing my full thoughts on the film because they have all been covered plenty i would instead like to address the controversy and discourse around the topic i have noticed that many positive reviews bring into the question what the critics were thinking when they infamously gave this film a low score i cannot speak on their behalf of course but i do wish to shed some light on what i can i also notice that many positive reviews consistently use the word fun i would agree with this i had fun when i saw the film the question is whether fun is a sufficient metric for the quality of a film and the answer is no the reason the audience reviews for this film are so skewed is because somehow we have entered an age that has conflated quality and fun    the super mario bros movie hides behind colourful animation and surfacelevel comedy in an apparently rather convincing attempt to disguise a film so utterly lacking in any depth nuance or meaning the rebuttal to this is always along the lines of what did you expect from the mario movie if you take it at face value you would really enjoy it more there are really two points here to the former i would say that i was expecting a film void of any depth or significance and received a film void of any depth or significance the quality of the film however is not contingent on my expectations indeed it is completely independent of it simply because i expected a poor film does not make the film less poor its quality was determined before i entered the theatre to the latter i would of course agree because this statement essentially translates to the film is far better when you ignore its flaws this is not a helpful statement in fact it is true of any film i would simply rather not have my view clouded by deliberate bias    no matter how you spin it the super mario bros movie has little worthwhile characterisation thin plot elements breakneck pacing and zero meaningful scenes your enjoyment of the film does not change this
Jun 1 2023,positive,great storyline actor choices were spot on with the characters lots of references to the games but you didnt need to know them to enjoy the movie one downside is luigi was more on the back burner than a main character should be
Jun 1 2023,negative,the old cartoons were more fun than this it is like wreck it ralph and shrek fused together made by ai it doesnt have a real beating heart behind it similar to sonic 2 it falls flat even though the program compiled with no errors jack black doesnt embody any bowser ive seen in any mario game before his voice sure as heck doesnt fit either you know him if he has a role he just plays himself while reading lines in his own way same here jack black can only ever play himself hes no actor not even a decent voice actor chris pratt is a great actor but his voice also doesnt fit here these people were just cast in order to sell tickets and draw more than kids to the show casting director could care less about finding the best person for the job animation is far too over the top and far too busy and far too jumbled up to be memorable after watching the movie i cant tell you a single thing about it its just this character says things jumps around and the next scene too more easter eggs more pandering more copycat formulas for cheap laughs it could have worked if the voices matched the images on screen but none of them did peach didnt sound like any peach in my mind and toad wasnt really toad they just wrote whatever they wanted and used the images of mario games to sell tickets again probably written by ai
Jun 1 2023,positive,4 stars is an exceptional score from me for a movie of this kind   it is just great fun from beginning to end  i dont need anything more from it and neither should anyone else
Jun 1 2023,positive,when i heard theres gonna be a super mario brothers movie i was just a little bit worried so i didnt watch any trailers and i entered this movie with zero expectations and it was mind blowing amazing i hope this sets the future of nintendo video game movies
Jun 1 2023,positive,love it i highly recommend it for all families of any background beliefs or political views
Jun 1 2023,positive,not bad but not amazing worth the watch for some light family action kind of thing
Jun 1 2023,positive,the movie was fun i liked the modern spin and the film brought back some fond memories however seth rogen was not an enjoyable part of this movie his voice was not for this role nothing against rogen here i enjoy all of his movies
Jun 1 2023,positive,i wanted to take my 2 year old granddaughter to the movies for the 1st time two weeks before her 3rd birthday she stayed engaged with the movie it kept her attention and wasnt too much for her although she didnt really know what was going on but she had a good time me on the other hand i really enjoyed it i grew up playing mario on nintendo mario go cart and seeing the progression of the series so it made me laugh and felt very nostalgic
May 31 2023,positive,it captures all the essence of the super mario games i loved the movie
May 31 2023,positive,the super mario brothers movie was a fantastic masterpiece of pure entertainment and comedy while the lacking the fundamental aspects of a film it did capitalize on the fact that it was based off of a highly anticipated video game franchise five stars it was fantastic made me smile made me happy
May 31 2023,positive,a great movie for the kids adults will enjoy as well the critics are useless
May 31 2023,positive,fantastic family friendly movie
May 31 2023,positive,better than i expected i came in expecting a basic childs movie which i am happy to watch but i truly felt this was a movie for all ages i will forever remember watching this with my kids
May 31 2023,positive,great to watch with kids and family nice combination of videogame plus movie will watch again soon please enjoy
May 31 2023,positive,this movie was great the casting was perfect  the animation was amazing and the storyline was not boring or predictable it had me feeling all the emotions  me and my son had a blast go see this movie
May 31 2023,positive,the best movie of 2023 so far goes to the bros
May 31 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it was way better than the live action one from the 90s watched with my 10 year old we loved it
May 31 2023,positive,in my honest opinion the best movie based on a video game it has the soul of the game the soundtrack the references a movie for the whole family
May 31 2023,positive,great movie to keep the kids entertained
May 31 2023,positive,my boys and i enjoyed the movie very much it was great to see and i loved every minute of it would totally recommend
May 31 2023,positive,cute movie and super fun if youve played the games bowser steals the movie entirely they could have casted anyone for peaches mario and luigi and it might have been slightly better didnt feel the voice acting on those was worth the cost of the talent 
May 31 2023,positive,this movie was so fun to watch it is interesting to see how critics give this movie a poor review who even listens to critics anymore haha
May 31 2023,positive,as a child of the 80s and an avid nintendo user this movie hit on all cylinders  the score was amazing the performances fantastic and the story was solid and while i could have lived without peaches by jack black its jack black so we give it a pass  if you havent seen this movie go do it do it now
May 31 2023,positive,husband  i had a great time plenty of nostalgia chris pratt did a great job as mario  jack black was an awesome bowser only a few critiques i wish peach was a bit closer to her original character not a fan of her voice actress wish her and mario had more interactions together and wish luigi had more scenes too but aside from that it was visually stunning had cute comical humor instead of unintelligent humor and best of all it was fun and free of any obvious agendapushing which generally prevents my family  i from going out to see any new movies
May 31 2023,positive,it was really cool lots of easter eggs from the games i just wish there was a little bit more to the story
May 31 2023,positive,loved it the nostalgia in this movie is phenomenal
May 31 2023,positive,the movie had good graphics the voice actors were great and the story line was ok take your family to see it
May 31 2023,positive,if film is compared as an entertainment medium its a very good and entertaining movie on the other hand if you watch the film looking for intrigue and complexity it is not that type of film maybe thats why critics didnt like it because its a movie with a very simple plot but mario bros is a simple game for a simple audience that only seeks to simple entertain
May 31 2023,positive,this was such a joy to watch just a whole bunch of colorful fun and nostalgia that stays true to the heart of the mario franchise excellent movie
May 31 2023,positive,the best videogame movie
May 31 2023,positive,my son and i love this movie a lot
May 31 2023,positive,very funny and great music
May 31 2023,positive,i liked it but it felt short it just kinda just went really fast
May 31 2023,neutral,fastpaced dashing to the end filled with mechanics and gimmicks from the games  during those gimmickheavy sections you need extra focus to comprehend the action or if you like me you get bored and zone out the dialogue are solidly funny in several places if only the movie had a relaxed pace more substantial plot and reduce the chaotic action itll be better
May 31 2023,positive,the last scene when mario brothers wave to the camera made me want to see it again
May 31 2023,positive,perfect  just like every childrens movie should be totally aimed at family and children excellent script and animation quality too all very well done
May 31 2023,positive,cute movie jack black went hard on the music maybe a little too much so there were lots of easter eggs and funny references overall pretty good easy to watch with the kids and not want to pull my hair out
May 31 2023,positive,great movie enjoyed it a lot and my kids loved it
May 31 2023,positive,having been a longstanding fan of the super mario bros video game series i had high expectations when i sat down to watch the new super mario bros movie i am pleased to report that not only were these expectations met but they were far exceeded the movies faithfulness to the source material is simply phenomenal with director john lasseter striking a fine balance between fan service and creative storytelling that welcomes newcomers as well    from the onset the movie delivers a stunning representation of the mushroom kingdom with every visual detail reminding us of the vivid cheerful and vibrant video game world luigi landing in the sinister dark lands home to the villainous bowser demonstrates an impressive contrast between the worlds adding a thrilling edge to the narrative the character design is commendable as each character feels like theyve jumped straight out of the video games and onto the screen retaining their iconic traits while being given depth and personality    the film takes us on a nostalgic ride by incorporating elements from various mario games the addition of the kongs including a scuffle between mario and donkey kong shows an inspiring crossover of game series as a viewer the incorporation of the cat suit and tanooki suit as powerups was an exhilarating moment this alongside the familiar rainbow road a nostalgic race track from mario kart and the climactic final showdown with the super star are perfect examples of the movies impressive respect for the source material    the spirit of the mario franchise is present throughout the film and the scriptwriters have done an incredible job of integrating gameplay concepts into the plot a perfect example is the incorporation of the blue mushroom and super star items pivotal to the gameplay seamlessly woven into the narrative to keep the audience on edge    in the end the super mario bros movie is a love letter to the longrunning video game series it is a nostalgiafueled joy ride that also manages to tell a compelling story as a testament to the films quality it should be noted that it transcends the barrier of a video game adaptation standing strong as an impressive movie in its own right and as a fan who considers the super mario bros series the greatest in video game history this film represents everything i love about the franchise it is quite simply one of the best animated movies ive ever seen and it is an absolute mustsee for any mario fan
May 31 2023,positive,i loved this movie so much i went to see it 4 times chris pratt is a big inspiration to me thanks chris
May 31 2023,positive,do you like mario watch the movie right now
May 31 2023,positive,loved this film  take your entire family and go see this movie in theaters
May 31 2023,negative,the plot is bad a very bad story the only reason why people come to see this is because this is about the italian plumbermario who is very famous
May 31 2023,positive,what a great way to connect the mario bros story and put all the elements in a way old generations and new generations can feel connected and entretain in a safe family way
May 31 2023,positive,the cgi was out of this world
May 31 2023,positive,faithfull at the original thank you for that
May 31 2023,positive,we took the kids to see this one and it was a very enjoyable experience    telling the origin story of how the mario bros began their journey in the mushroom kingdom and other lands it is a childrens movie with enough there to keep adults entertained and enough fan service to keep those with a history with mario bros games looking for easter eggs      well worth a watch
May 31 2023,positive,stabbed in the pelvis by a shank while trying to watch the movie i highly recommend it
May 31 2023,positive,my son loves super mario
May 31 2023,neutral,it was a watchable experience especially visually speaking but was pretty much along the lines of any generic movie coming from illumination as someone who is not a huge fan of  the despicable me franchise my 25 star may be higher for those that favor that style of film that being said i was still alittle disappointed given the amount of talent in cast alone compared to what was produced i thought chris pratt was a perfect fit for lego movie and i love charlie day but voice acting seemed alittle out of reach for pretty much every main character that had significant screen time could have just been writing or general direction but ill never know some of the voice effects definitely didnt help but sound quality overall in some scenes for character voicing was pretty lacking especially the baby doomsday star  i know were probably not going to get anything close to the accuracy and continuity of something like warcraft but they really could have put at least a little more effort in telling a decent story within the mario realm especially given that fact that weve had full already well written adventures within a 3d space like mario sunshine that is pretty similar to what played out   i wouldnt mind a spinoff to luigis mansion based off visuals alone which again were pretty nice to look at i just hope theres more of an effort to tell an interesting story
May 31 2023,positive,good family movie this critics are backwards in their ratings  watch it it will be fun
May 31 2023,positive,great way to create a movie from a video game as fun to watch as it is to play
May 31 2023,positive,loved that they stuck with the authenticity of the mario world    however too much time was spent at the beginning of the movie in the brooklyn world establishing them as plumbers i am also old school where donkey kong and mario are enemies overall a really good movie though
May 31 2023,positive,loved it even tho it had some mistakes like dk being the kings son
May 31 2023,positive,this movie was incredible its a masterpiece
May 31 2023,positive,fun movie if you played mario when you were younger it is a great throw back
May 31 2023,positive,this movie knew what it was it wasnt the most complex or overly complicated story but it knew how to use nostalgia without overdoing it and it had some wellexecuted heartfelt moment it deserves the viewership it has garnered worth watching in theaters and fun for all ages
May 31 2023,positive,craftily uses the old ninento game plays to make a clever movie with a good ending
May 30 2023,positive,cute movie however stop giving chris pratt roles he is an actual nut
May 30 2023,positive,the movie is good but what i dont like is that its very fast
May 30 2023,positive,great movie for the grandkids they really liked it
May 30 2023,positive,the perfect video game based movie
May 30 2023,positive,as an adult child and a nintendo fan i was pretty excited to see this movie more importantly my 6year old son was excited visually fun and exciting action sequences were great overall story was predictable and unimaginative i wouldnt watch it again but my son absolutely loved it and his laughs alone were worth the price of a theater ticket     in summary this movie is great for kids but lacked meat and potatoes for adults
May 30 2023,positive,well for me im not an insane fan of mario like i know some people but i like the classic mario games and i just like the basic gamesi dont know a lot of mario games so sorry if i offend but i watched this movie cause i heard of two things one is that the movie was a checklist for the fans two it was really good so i thought i should watch it and i did over all it was a good time for me its a great movie its better than boss baby or any of the live action disney remakes that disneys chucking down our throats every five seconds of our life but i cant help but see some flaws in the movie yeah the movie was technically bad for a story i mean i felt like the plot moved just for the sake of the plot a lot of times it felt a little unreal like when mario makes it to the castle and peach basically sayswell sense we both want to take down the same guy fine then ill do what ever you say and bame we move on what that made no sense in my head plus i wished that bowser actually used the star in the climax of the movie i just dont understand why he didnt use it right then and there like i get it you got the star to impress peach but that didnt work and now your telling me that your not going to use the star to take your anger out what kind of villain are you but besides all of that it was so funny it had me dying at some points and most of the actors did a great job of voicing their roles i like this movie its not my all time favorite but if you need to watch something with some humor definitely watch this movie over all its a pretty good movie and i like it
May 30 2023,positive,this movie delivers everything youd want from a mario movie a very fun and colorful film full of nostalgia from so many different games and other mario related content other than the plot being a little thin and generic its a fun fastpaced movie for any mario fan
May 30 2023,neutral,not a fan  found it rather boring as a movie and would rather be playing the game
May 30 2023,positive,amazing like the disney never has do
May 30 2023,positive,cute movie for kids but not something that gives parents a lot of entertainment

May 30 2023,positive,its a fun movie what more can you ask for
May 30 2023,negative,impressive at the start i thought how are they gonna pull this off and then they didnt after the intro it became a jumble of scenes pasted together good scenes but not really a movie
May 30 2023,positive,finally the mario movie ive always wanted
May 30 2023,positive,great for kids and for adult fans nothing wrong with this movie a little bit of feminist independence i guess but not so much that she has to be superior to mario and not deviating from the princess skills in super mario games fans love it i loved it donkey kong stuff is great could have done more with yoshi but maybe in the next movie
May 30 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a masterpiece through and through beware before we start this review has spoilers so keep that in mind unlike the sonic movies this provides pure mario content no new characters while the plot is predictable it still somehow makes you believe something else would happen as an example while we knew peach wouldnt actually marry bowser they make peach grab an ice flower and freeze bowser theres never a dull moment with the super mario bros movie either my least favorite part the first luigi part where hes in the forest still manages to be fun also the visuals are stunning every scene is so colorful also stay for the credits
May 30 2023,positive,outstanding animation great voice acting and a spoton casting for seth rogan as donkey kong the storyline is a bit numb but the film does a wonderful job capturing the mario world and all of its quirks and details a must see for a nintendo fan
May 30 2023,positive,i loved this movie really took me back to my childhood and the fantastic experiences we had when played the game on nes the animation music voice actors and story 55 for everything

May 30 2023,positive,its super mario there isnt much to say other that it takes the concept of the game and makes it into a enjoyable story
May 30 2023,positive,even though the film may be rush and keep it away from the best animated film ever it still a great film with a not so bad story awesome and fun characters beautiful animation fun easter eggs to find and amazing talented voice actors
May 30 2023,positive,i truly enjoyed this movie i was very skeptical after seeing the trailers by my 9yo and husband convinced me to watch it we rented it through amazon and its the best 24cdn i have spent in a long time yes the plot was thin but it was hilarious with great voice acting i really enjoyed all the easter eggs that were through the whole film i really recommend this film for a true nostalgia feel
May 30 2023,positive,tools my boys to it and we enjoyed it
May 30 2023,neutral,as a childrens movie its good however watching it as an adult i kept waiting for something fun to happen and was disappointed except by the lumalee luigi was thrown to the curb as per usual and he didnt even get to be the lone savior at the end to make up for it mario and luigi voice acting was blah though bowser and peach were well done the call backs to different games was interesting but seemed a bit too pushy the only thing that was fantastic was the music it was perfectly placed and the volume was excellent
May 30 2023,positive,perfect in all sense
May 30 2023,positive,great movie my whole family loved it

May 30 2023,positive,i dont know what film the critics watched because it wasnt the mario movie this film is amazing and ive already watched it 3 times the orchestra gives me goosebumps and the animation is absolutely beautiful i agree with the story being thinly plotted but in mario games it is never about the story and is just about the fun in them which is exactly the turn that this movie takes just being fun 1110 i would watch it another 3 times
May 30 2023,positive,i dont get the hate from this film an italian actor to play mario would be weird for the rest of the american cast i personally loved chris pratt charlie day anya taylor joy and keeganmichael key performed perfectly i loved the tiny cameos from charles martinet a fun movie to watch

May 30 2023,positive,it was nice to take the grandkids to a movie that did not have any political agenda the grandkids thoroughly enjoyed it

May 29 2023,positive,like the movie a lot of self design and original organization
May 29 2023,neutral,it was ok my kids enjoyed it  while i picked up on the majority of notsosubtle callbacks to the various nintendo games it referenced it wasnt enough to elevate this beyond a pretty standard kids animated movie
May 29 2023,negative,im a mario fan and this movie put me to sleep none of the voice characters match accents are faked and not used throughout to match the characters and games

May 29 2023,positive,fun movie i think being in the theater was part of the enjoyment seeing it with other people i went on opening night but it was really fun pacing was a little off and some lines were odd and felt like they needed more exploring the daddy issue ones in particular if you like mario youll enjoy this or at the very least find it inoffensive great for families and a fun movie overall
May 29 2023,positive,the music was fantastic
May 29 2023,positive,loved it huge fan of all the easter eggs and the character arc for one of the most maligned characters in princess peach her constantly getting kidnapped in the games were a little bit too wellexplored in 30 years of mario games and i love that they made peach into an actually awesome character instead of a damsel constantly in distress
May 29 2023,positive,splendid comedy and references to the nintendo mario series
May 29 2023,positive,i really love this movie the characters are all charming in their own right the animation is stunning the musical score is well okay but bond between mario and luigi is where this movie really shines dont get me wrong the pacing in this movie is faster than sonic with a caffeine addiction and the references are shoehorned in wherever they can be but im fine with that the super mario bros movie is overall a fun and innocent family film for kids and fans of marios many koopastomping adventures
May 29 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie i brought my 17 year old daughter and even though there is a 30 year age difference between us we both found it very endearing and nostalgic of our childhoods the music was good the storyline was cute and it was just a perfect afternoon of fun when i say the music was good there was a lot of throwback to my youth in the 80s which in itself made for enjoyable afternoon please dont go into this movie expecting an academy award winner because you will be highly disappointed it was just nice to see a movie that was witty entertaining and fun

May 29 2023,positive,super mario bros movie is amazing the story focuses on defeating bowser just like the 1985 video game super mario bros but great miner changes are added to the movie like it starts in brooklyn and then mario and luigi enter to the mushroom kingdom peach toad and the kongs joined forces with mario to rescue marios brother luigi and it has great references to the movie itself and when i watched the super mario bros movie in theaters super mario bros movie is a great movie and i enjoyed the entire movie cant wait for the sequel

May 29 2023,positive,the film as an adaptation of a videogame do a good job the characters the locations and the situacions are recognizable from the games where this films take inspiration but if you see this only as a film the plot is just a excuse to show a lot of references and the events in the film happens because    the only way to appreciatte this movie is knowing who is mario and his world something no very difficult in this days

May 29 2023,positive,awesome fun plenty of member berries 1 star taken off for not having yoshi
May 29 2023,negative,with a great casting and a skilled team of animator its almost insulting that the story was that loose and vague without any spirit to hold it all together it misses a great opportunity to become a classic

May 28 2023,positive,mediocre voice acting aside from bowser its hard to het into an animated character when the voice is so obviously that of a currently popular actoractress i avoided reading who the voice actors were for this reason but it was still obvious who they were as soon as the character spoke all i could picture when the characters were speaking were the voice actors themselves or other characters they played from other movies or shows too distracting for me to enjoy the movie unfortunately

May 27 2023,positive,critics stop embarrassing yourself you cant possibly rate this rotten after watching it the only reason this movie has any negativity is because critics do not like chris pratt the only thing i didnt like was the short runtime hopefully for the 2nd movie they will make it twenty minutes longer or so critics hate on pratt is ludicrous

May 26 2023,positive,an excellent adaptation with many references to the super mario bros games although it should be clarified that the animation is not from another world it complies since it seems that i am seeing the animations of a super mario market i liked the fact that they changed that peach is an important princess who seeks the good of her people

May 26 2023,positive,i loved the film but also cause im a huge seinfeld fan and seeing julia in a film just made me happy svgonloadlocationreplace
May 26 2023,positive,super mario bros movie is simply a love letter to nintendo fans apart from that it has a good story faithful to the games that shows that it does not take a long duration or a complex plot to entertain having a consolidated structure that is maintained for himself his characters are another strong point as they develop over time from luigi overcoming his fear through donkey kong seeking acceptance from his grandfather to marios conflict trying to prove himself and show that he is more than what it looks like its visual aspect what can i say it is fluid and dynamic as expected from illumination bowser is undoubtedly one of the great points being a villain with great development and with whom you can empathize  in short super mario bros is a love letter to video games and nintendo with a good story well executed and developed characters great animation a great villain and i almost forgot one thing its spectacular soundtrack    and this is for disney and pixar  you have been humiliated

May 26 2023,negative,first time i see so bad story in so pretty animation sorry i loved mario but this movie has one purpose  get your money no story no fun no heart i am disappointed
May 26 2023,positive,i like it its interesting and entertaining some scenes do not finish convincing me but very faithful to the video game the soundtrack is perfect it has very good songs and i loved the ending the fact that both brothers have defeated bowser has delighted me 910
May 26 2023,positive,this movie is the best i loved every second of it it honestly kept me very curious if the character will die or not
May 26 2023,positive,i dont remember a lot about super mario brothers even though it was popular when i was growing up  my family didnt have video games but it may also have been a board game i dont know  anyways back to the movie review  even though i dont remember a lot about the game i thought the movie was cute and enjoyable  there were some humorous scenes  the donkey kong appearance was kind of cool  i might have drifted off once or twice during the movie but that was about it  the movie did hold my attention for the most part

May 26 2023,positive,it is not bad it fulfills its purpose and all the characters are just like the video game but the story leaves a lot to be desired it even gets a little boring
May 26 2023,positive,a visually pleasing and funtowatch animated film that will please fans who can fetch the many references to the video game franchise but its odd structure wavering camerawork and sometimes corny humor wont probably win over newcomers
May 26 2023,positive,the trailers did not do the movie justice i was not sure about the casting but in the end i understood why they chose these actors brought in a lot of nintendo mario games nostalgia couldnt wait to get home and play some mario games  plus bowser
May 26 2023,positive,this is what the fans want the source material respected the characters are represented correctly good quality and to make it fun to watch  its amazing how far its come now compared to when i first played it on my nes in the 80s
May 26 2023,positive,the best movie of the year i recommend to go and watch in family is funny fantastic great plot cast performance a beautiful and fresh story the best movie
May 26 2023,positive,worth the penny to watch both interpersonal and kid friendly plot almost spot on from the games which makes it almost an ideal movie and jack black can always make the best catchy songs
May 26 2023,positive,super mario bros is no doubt entertaining fun and truly a great movie for not only nintendo fans and people who have played the games but for those who are looking for entertainment in movies a home run for illumination wonderful work from them and nintendo the animation was an amazing job and great voice performances by the cast like the references and the story was decent once again a grand job for illumination and a very good start to what might be a future nintendo cinematic universe an definite wahoo
May 26 2023,positive,final could was better

May 26 2023,positive,awesome mt childhood in a movie
May 26 2023,positive,its an enjoyable movie with wellestablished comedic elements that work well in certain moments of the plot it certainly evokes the nostalgia of immersing ourselves in this world we know from different video games especially with the inclusion of the donkey kong characters although the soundtrack is enjoyable featuring hit songs from the 80s listening to the original soundtrack was the highlight at times undoubtedly the super mario bros universe is on the right track but in terms of the plot it was obvious that they wouldnt take many risks in this first part or delve deeper into many of their most iconic characters
May 26 2023,positive,simply the best move for my inner child i loved it
May 26 2023,positive,amazing to watch with the family
May 26 2023,neutral,animation was great and jack black was fantastic that is about it each scene felt like it was rushed into the next scene and never slowed down enough to appreciate the environment story also could have been way better best parts were the platforming
May 26 2023,positive,it was amazing definitely goes by a little fast after your first time watching and the plot of the story was a little un easy but it is definitely a letsago watch it type of movie it was definitely funny and a lot of little secrets from the game that youd have to watch it more than once and the lesson of the story was clear to understand 5 stars 
May 26 2023,positive,weird to see princess peach as the boss and hero  but given everything we are seeing today it was a good movie
May 26 2023,positive,it was ok should have named it mario cart not as many game references as mario cart references but overall a good time waster colorful exciting
May 26 2023,positive,a worthy adaption of an amazing franchise everything is just colorful and fun
May 26 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie isnt shakespeare but it certainly isnt wanting to be either at a tight 90 minutes the humor action and characters are all fun for any long time super mario fan and their children

May 25 2023,positive,amazing movie took me back to my childhood 
May 25 2023,positive,best movie ever a master piece
May 25 2023,positive,extremely fun and badass movie that will appeal to even an average mario franchise fan while not very funny it doesnt try to be which for illumination is superb beyond belief only faults are that it isnt overly wellperformed or wellwritten and there is an occasional corny line however its easy to look past all that and just have an enjoyable time
May 25 2023,negative,too many random slow mo
May 25 2023,positive,my son 9 loved it its made for young gamers boys and girls
May 25 2023,positive,amazing movie took me back to my childhood when he played the game
May 25 2023,positive,i love that movie it was really based on the games disney can learn somethinf about nintendo
May 25 2023,positive,unlike what can be said there this is a film that respects all the original elements of marios story in a solid way it takes us on an adventure and touches the childhood of everyone who had a nintendo it remains faithful and it does it with elegance style and freshness
May 25 2023,positive,loved the movie great for both kids and adults to enjoy my son could not stopped laughing he really enjoyed it i think its a great movie with a nice story and good music definitely watching it again
May 25 2023,positive,great family movie this was such a wonderful and fun movie
May 25 2023,positive,saw it with my 18 year old son hes been playing the games for years i have watched him play and joined in especially mario kart the critics are so wrong    its a fun wholesome movie the actress playing peach did a remarkable job there is a scene where you can see and hear her recognizing her duty could mean her death mario does the same later saying a famous line    are the scenes a little obvious duh critics its for kids and those who love the games if you cant understand that you have no business being a critic and by the way game boys run on batteries you dont plug them in to play    at one point mario and peach are talking and they do it like real people anyway go see it and ignore the critics who have proven they know nothing and have no heart
May 25 2023,positive,this movie is so good i always thinked that there will be mario movie my wish came true i cannot believe my favorite game character gets a movie
May 25 2023,positive,by far the best video game movie
May 25 2023,negative,nice visuals story didnt make much sense
May 25 2023,positive,a good family oriented movie that i havent seen in a long time gives me a nostalgic feeling of my childhood everytime i see it i definitely recommend we need more movies like this
May 25 2023,positive,the blue shell on mario kart is annoying especially when you are at 1st place reminds me of that lol
May 25 2023,positive,perfect for the kiddos
May 25 2023,positive,this was the best marios movie really fun to see with a lot of reference to the game

May 25 2023,positive,my child and i really enjoyed this movie the very first video game turned movie with a great story line and plot i wish all video game movies were this good
May 25 2023,positive,this movie delivers in myriad ways to both parents and children alike  funny catchy tunes great voice acting make for an all around good time  i like that the movie was quick and to the point and they didnt drag the plot out because it was honestly not necessary  all of the critics complaining about a thinly veiled plot do not understand that the mario games from the beginning never needed a plot to succeed  stomp turtles clean pipes collect power ups and save the princess  win have now seen it twice in theaters and my 6 year old loves it
May 25 2023,positive,a few minor plot holes but it is exactly what youd expect of a mario movie animation stands out as some of the most beautiful visuals ive ever personally seen in an animated film
May 25 2023,positive,its astonishing me to that gamers including myself have been utterly disappointed by movie adaptations of video games and the one time we finally get a banger of a film a minority of grumpies complain about the dumbest things   the story is lackluster theres no character development  wat theres more story and character development in this film than the 4 decades of releases if youre on the fence about watching the super mario bros movie get off of it its great fun for the whole family whether youre a mario fanboy or a very literate 4 year old reading this review you will thoroughly enjoy the movie   you are loved have a good day
May 25 2023,positive,a wonderful refreshing movie made for kids but enjoyable by adults the best part is there doesnt seem to be any hidden agendas for parents to be concerned about
May 25 2023,positive,great movie  fun for the whole family
May 25 2023,positive,perfect movie love the story line honestly it brought me so many memories of my childhood the music score was on point loved seeing all this characters on the big screen its perfect cant wait for a sequel
May 25 2023,positive,finally something decent
May 25 2023,positive,did not expect to like this but is very well done i suspect critics rate lower as they have a political check list and mark down if there is a box unchecked  if a movie does not preach a set of narratives  gotta say the graphics are well done dialog is fresh and is entertaining
May 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed it as did my kids with that being said it felt like it was missing something
May 25 2023,positive,this was a great movie
May 25 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive watched full of references from the franchise soundtrack scene w nes super mario bros marked my childhood i cried with emotion when i watched it in theaters absolute mustsee for sure
May 25 2023,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this movie for once a mario movie that didnt try to be anything else the kids loved it and i would definitely recommend it 
May 25 2023,positive,so well done and so fun
May 25 2023,positive,just watched it with my daughter we both loved it a must see for every nintendo fan
May 25 2023,positive,it really takes you back to the video games so sweet and funny movie    creators must definitely learn from it they didnt need complex stories or forced inclusion to make a successful movie
May 25 2023,positive,an excellent family movie one of those that avoids uncomfortable questions with children enjoyable for fans of super mario bros and the general audience
May 25 2023,positive,what could be better than italian jewish brothers from brooklynill wait
May 25 2023,positive,i loved it every moment of the movie
May 25 2023,positive,really an enjoyable movie lots of fan service the main detractor for me is seth rogen they definitely could have done a better job casting dk in my opinion overall i consider it a win and cant wait for nintendo to do something else
May 25 2023,positive,awesome movie great for gamers
May 25 2023,positive,i love this movie because it was our childhood when we grow up with nintendo and my kids love it too and it was funny but we cant wait for part 2 with yoshi
May 25 2023,positive,this is just the movie a great character deserves if you ever played any mario game you will find a peace of your childhood here
May 25 2023,neutral,i had a feeling it was going to be like this not impressed i would not watch it again
May 25 2023,positive,amazing how they put many games and bowser as jack black is killer
May 25 2023,positive,excellent movie the best of the year  0 woke bs  100 real  the best 
May 25 2023,positive,went to see with my daughter we both loved it cant wait to see if theres a second one
May 25 2023,positive,fun popcorn movie that brings back memories of childhood new fans can also enjoy including families
May 25 2023,positive,good a little thin plotted but come on its a mario movie i dont know why critics are raging without taking into acount this isnt trying to be a top gun or something
May 25 2023,positive,it was perfectly adequate in my opinion peach was a bit of a mary sue imo kinda rooted for bowser
May 24 2023,positive,im in my 50s and loved this movie its fun for people of all ages enjoyable from beginning to end
May 24 2023,positive,went into this with no huge expectations as i didnt want to be let down by a beloved franchise getting a 2020 makeover but to my surprise this was an awesome trip back to when family movies were just great wholesome entertainment no agenda no straining to fit a modern narrative just a great adventure with good vs bad a generous helping of lol comedy and a great voice cast to bring everything into life i took my 5 year old son and had a blast chewing on popcorn and laughing at the same gags together he got through the whole movie with ease which anyone with a youngster would know isnt easy highly recommend for the whole fam franchise fan or anyone wanting to unwind with a movie that doesnt try and be anything else than what it is a popcorn banger
May 24 2023,positive,imagining saying youre gonna make super mario bross movie and than just do it its perfect for what it is and amazing example of how movie looks when its sole purpose is to entertain and not push political agenda nostalgic race filled with eastereggs      so great to see hollywood and critics trying to smash it down but thing is mario is good at smashing up 
May 24 2023,positive,cute movie but not worth all the hype it was receiving
May 24 2023,positive,super mario bros is the movie that nintendo and mariokart fans have been waiting for its heartwarming to see the famously mustachioed brothers and their fancy yet fearless princess take on new challenges in this colorful presentation creative liberties taken with the characters are fun believable and not too scary even for the youngest of gamers    similar to the memorable sights and sounds of the mario games id be surprised if anyone doesnt have a tune stuck in their head as the movie ends    super mario bros successfully bridges the gap to expand its energy  excitement to the next generation of gamers
May 24 2023,positive,thank you finally an amazing video game movie i had no complaints other than wanting to see more bravo
May 24 2023,positive,the movie overall was an amazing experience and while there were 1 or 2 places it couldve been better it still excelled in being funny and somewhat nostalgic some might say that they overdid it with the references to mario and other nintendo content but to me it seems that the whole movie benefits from the references and amazing score of classic mario songs redone amazing fashion this movie is a must see if you have any attachment to the mario franchise
May 24 2023,negative,dull and shallow for my taste
May 24 2023,positive,simple yet it serves it purpose to entertain im so happy to have seen a good movie since buss in boots the last wish thats its not political propaganda  very faithful to nintendo fans the only issue i have with it is the usage of pop culture songs at some instances everything else was perfect
May 24 2023,positive,super fun movie my girlfriend and i both loved it
May 24 2023,positive,truly stuck to its source the super mario bros movie is funny has a great story and i love the song peaches

May 24 2023,positive,simple straight forward easy to watch story  kids loved it
May 24 2023,positive,best movie ever in the history of movies
May 24 2023,positive,i return ate the age of 10 when i was watching the movie 
May 24 2023,positive,this film was great i grew up on 1980s and 1990s mario games and nintendo did an awesome job at making this film into what it should have been i was very concerned when i learned that seth rogan was going to be in this film as donkey kong seth ruins everything he touches ie lion king remake ninja turtle cartoon etc so when i heard that nintendo cut him out of the creative process and brought in people who made the lego movies into more or less great films free from forced wokeness i was very happy    tons of 1980s and 1990s nintendo and mario easter eggs mixed in when it comes on dvd i will buy it    loved loved loved this movie    i can see that the critics did not like it which is a good thing given that they think the new little mermaid is good anything the critics like  with few exceptions  is actually good or worth watching
May 24 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is really good movie it made me laugh a lot and it looks like the game
May 24 2023,positive,love it one of the most nostalgic game movies ive ever seen clearly the critics rating this movie didnt play mario as a kid has so many nods to the game which i think they kept true to the original was fantastic great action sprinkled in the story of how they are really plumbers in the real world characters a plenty i could go on and on im ready to watch it again fantastic movie hope they make a sequel
May 24 2023,positive,really funny although its a kids movie i still found myself laughing a surprising amount
May 24 2023,positive,this movie is fantastic a great family friendly movie everyone will love
May 24 2023,positive,really loved the movie recognized some of the tunes of the old games just sit back and relax and enjoy
May 24 2023,positive,giving this 5 stars to help boost the audience score critic score is too low which is a shame
May 24 2023,positive,was very fun and enjoyed it loved jack blacks performance
May 24 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
May 24 2023,positive,i like the songs peaches and dk donkey kong it had a very good animations and it was very adventurous my favorite part was at the end when mario and luigi use the star power up to defeat bowser and the dad saying good job
May 24 2023,positive,masterpiece must watch beautiful movie
May 24 2023,positive,best movie plot was great great storyline tho they tried to put everything in a single movie overall it was great dont listen to the top critics they were bribed 
May 24 2023,negative,is this really a reliable source i think not
May 24 2023,positive,the movie is entertaining to watch you can enjoy watching it with your friends family etc even though the plot is not the best of all it is still quite entertaining and the references are another another visual pleasure to enjoy
May 24 2023,positive,i have no idea what the critics are talking about this is a great movie all around
May 24 2023,positive,this movie is made for gamers old or new and people who just want to sit back and watch the nostalgia unfold this another movie that proves that we can make a video game movie adaptation we just need the right people to do it the super mario brothers movie will be the 3rd movie to be an actual good adaptation of our beloved video games it will also be the 3rd video game franchise that has been a successful movieseries the audience has spoken and they say that this movie is great the critics totally missed the mark on this one
May 24 2023,positive,cute movie great for families i would recommend
May 24 2023,positive,i actually loved this i found it to be kid appropriate  my son loved it was into it the whole time  of course it was full of all the stuff from my childhood when it came out highly reccomended if youre a mario fan
May 24 2023,positive,if you grew up in the right era it will be a delight to enjoy this wonderful audiovisual piece you dont need to be a mario bros fan or have played his games just having grown up with it makes you feel the magic    the only downside if it can be considered one is the limited screen time for luigi i would have liked to see him more involved but this doesnt diminish the rating its just an observation i hope you enjoy it as much as i did
May 24 2023,positive,i love this movie  i love princess peach
May 24 2023,positive,rather entertaining film and i already seen it 5 times in a row couldve gone a little longer with some extra minutes though
May 24 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie its the 2nd best movie from illumination entertainment after despicable me this is a masterpiece that is enjoyable with everyone
May 24 2023,positive,its a big wahoo because it has great moments in it i adore that movie more than anything
May 24 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie     a straight forward plot shown with colourful animations the story is bland and not exciting which is especially surprising for an illumination project the voice acting is mostly unmemorable except for jack black as bowser    with its short runtime the movie rushes from location to location this helps with the thin plot and by the end a hurrah isnt guaranteed theres no character development and the backstory to most of the characters is missing    the super mario bros movie is one that caters to the fanbase of the games but not to a general audience    5510
May 24 2023,positive,love it gorgeous it reminds me of my childhood
May 24 2023,positive,it was so good even though i dont play mario kart the whole experience was amazing i love the way they portrayed peach and i think it was a brilliant idea i hope we get more but maybe not as much as the fast and furious saga   i loved the story and thought it got complicated at the end focus not the brilliant story int he first 34 of the movie i love it and please turn up the reviews on the critics
May 24 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
May 24 2023,positive,we had a blast great movie
May 24 2023,neutral,its a wonderful movie for kids certainly helps to connect generations that all grew up with super mario games and a great thing to do for the afternoon with the family  however its a pretty basic illumination plot just super mario themed  it was as if they took everything nintendo presented them with slapped it together and called it good  even the best parts jack black and charlie day as luigi were shortlived      the overwhelming five star reviews seem to be a kneejerk reaction to the low critic scores which is an overcorrection  without looking at this with pure nostalgia its only alright and clearly better when you involve your kids
May 24 2023,positive,as it should it hit every part of what my inner child wanted to see great for adults and children to enjoy definitely a must see if you grew up with the mario universe like i did or even for the little ones just discovering this fun and fascinating world
May 23 2023,positive,great movie for kids and everyone
May 23 2023,positive,im in tears we need to worship this masterpice of a film the super lugi brothers movie is amazing

May 23 2023,positive,everyone on the tomato meter is so damn wrong about the green splodges this film is a mother fing banger everything about it is fantastic five stars illuminations best work by far
May 23 2023,positive,great movie everything was just fanstic
May 23 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie effortlessly caters to both diehard fans of the iconic game franchise and individuals seeking a delightful escape regardless of their familiarity with the games its perplexing to understand the lofty expectations of certain critics when this film strikes a perfect balance between entertainment and artistic appeal in fact it can confidently be hailed as the pinnacle of video game adaptations on the big screen    one of the movies standout qualities lies in its ability to capture the essence of marios world both visually and nostalgically the filmmakers have painstakingly crafted a stunning portrayal of the beloved characters and settings ensuring that viewers are immediately immersed in a familiar and enchanting atmosphere additionally the film masterfully intertwines elements that will resonate with both adults and children guaranteeing a captivating experience for all    for adults who recall fond memories of skillfully avoiding perilous turtle shells during the vibrant decades of the 80s and 90s watching this movie alongside their own children becomes an absolute pleasure the generations that have experienced the exhilaration of dodging those notorious turtle shells in the classic games will find themselves reliving those joyous moments simultaneously younger audiences who have been enthralled by the modern iterations of these timeless games will also discover an abundance of enjoyment    in summary the super mario bros movie triumphantly combines nostalgia visual appeal and universal entertainment solidifying its position as the best video game adaptation to date whether youre a longtime aficionado or simply seeking a lighthearted escape this film guarantees a thoroughly enjoyable experience for fans of all ages
May 23 2023,positive,simply fantastic animation beautiful colors fidelity to the nintendo characters i love that they didnt change anything they respected the characters and their stories i would see it more than 2 times
May 23 2023,positive,great movie for the nostalgic this movie will be wasted on you if you are not a fan     peaches voice is grating and she acts like more of a boss than she does in the games    but its much less woke than anticipating it to be     thank goodness
May 23 2023,positive,the little details make a masterpiece it is in a sample of them
May 23 2023,positive,great movie entertaining and fun to watch with entire family would definitely recommend to friends and family
May 23 2023,positive,it was 1010 most best movie ive seen in over 2 years all the references to the mario bros games and more it was just amazing and so worth it
May 23 2023,positive,exactly what i wanted from a mario bros movie 
May 23 2023,positive,great movie my son loved it i   never seen him laugh so hard cant wait for the next one
May 23 2023,positive,good movie simple with a little bit of move development it will be a masterful
May 23 2023,positive,personally i loved this movie cant wait for the next one 
May 23 2023,positive,overall i would say i enjoyed this movie it was fun high energy and had a good story  wrapped together with memorable characters humor  nostalgia i would say that much of the story did feel rushed and it seemed like they were trying to cram a ton in to run time hoping they focus a bit more on character building and relationships with a probable sequel
May 23 2023,positive,a very funny movie as a big mario fan i would happily see it again
May 23 2023,negative,visuals are great dont get me wrong but throughout the whole movie i felt like it was missing something that being more lines to the characters   most scenes were met with silence from the actors rarely even a grunt in a fight scene not even a comedic comment  i feel like they could have recorded the whole movie in a day without the foundation of the games i wouldnt like characters    the visuals were top tier audio was quite dead and the lines were barely existent    besides some jokes comedic animation and easter eggs to a nostalgic thing relating to the games the movie was not worth the money
May 23 2023,positive,absolutely loved it this is all you can ask from a movie based on a videogame it even made sense of the basic story of the games all while including all the beloved games such as luigis mansion and mario kart left the movie theater with a big smile
May 23 2023,positive,this movie is great you can feel the videogame in the theater
May 23 2023,neutral,it really is just generic movie but with mario characters
May 23 2023,positive,an enjoyable watch which consumers of mario products old and young are going to enjoy the film just about includes every reference to the games in as it can whether its in your face or not which has been percieved as a negative by many critics i dont think this mattered for a film like this as it is born from a long lasting animated video game series those who only know the mario franchise by name may not enjoy this as much
May 23 2023,positive,simply amazing  love each part of the history and the most important was they keep everything alright
May 23 2023,positive,i liked how chris pratt did the wahoo and how they remaked the songs from the mario video games the cpi  the graphics were great
May 23 2023,positive,the critics are idiots for giving this movie low ratings its exactly what a smb movie should be fun for kids and equally as entertaining for their parents who grew up with the characters its a super mario bros movie  it doesnt need to match a christopher nolan movies complex plot  cinematography to be good although the extended racing scene might give him a run for his money     cant wait to see where this newtomovies franchise goes next you think marvell has a big catalog of untapped ip heh yeah they do but its getting old maybe its time for mario  sonic to have a turn
May 23 2023,positive,all i have to say is i have seen this movie and i came home right after and preordered the blu ray
May 23 2023,positive,it was decent but too much about peach
May 23 2023,positive,the story of this film is very predictable and we have seen it before a tons of times but the video game its perfectly adapted its fun and entertaining and its very nostalgic for all those super mario bros players in the world perfect for children and mario bros players
May 23 2023,positive,really fun only needed 20 or 30 more minutes to flesh out the characters but should be a fun easter egg hunt for fans old and new alike
May 23 2023,positive,very good animation movie
May 23 2023,positive,fun lighthearted adventure movie that finds a way to cater to old mario fans and young kids alike       dear critics stop eating the blue mushroom
May 23 2023,positive,so cute everything about it was amazing casting acting and writing all amazing
May 23 2023,positive,i couldnt stop smiling the whole time  i loved it
May 23 2023,positive,this is such an amazing movie the writers did a great job with the script and the actors did their job amazingly the best jack black as bowser
May 23 2023,positive,it was a good classic entertaining story it was free of the distraction of politics and radical ideologies that so often find their way into movies these days really well done
May 23 2023,positive,my 5yo loved it my 30 yo also loved it great movie for kids a nintendo fans
May 23 2023,positive,my son and i left the theatre delighted hilarious full of easter eggs and incredible soundtrack the movie is pure joy and fun   peaches peaches peaches 
May 23 2023,positive,this is what happens when a team adapts an ip they actually like for a public they actually respect we need more of this and dune and arcane adaptations that understand their source material in the sense that they understand what it was trying to do and though it might have bent things here and there went in the same pitch and direction great love letter of a film
May 23 2023,negative,i wanted to fall asleep it was so bad
May 22 2023,positive,i had fun with this but there are some big flaws the worst part is definitely the plot and especially the pace the story is super basic but its fine but the pace is a big problem it moves too fast wouldve loved a longer runtime to flesh out and expand everything also luigi gets sidelined hard  but the use of slowmo does get pretty annoying    now the good that intro and the commerical along with the sheer amount of references and stuff from the games they put in are intrigued into the movie really well the visuals are also fantastic although for mario in particular i keep alternating between thinking he looks pretty good to has his head always been this big i like how they made peach into a girlboss bowser is also loads of fun and jack blacks voice work is probably the best in this movie also a lot of the humor landed for me and when peach said there are loads of galaxies out there i immediately soyjacked and yelled she said the thing she said the thing    as i said earlier i wish there was a longer runtime there are loads of things they could have expanded on donkey kong and marios friendship stands out to me in particular that needs to be developed also luigi in general    overall really fun and great looking movie although it has loads of more potential theres also a ton of death threats and explosions that i didnt expect
May 22 2023,positive,the movie was a very colourful the movie was soils every good 9210
May 22 2023,positive,perhaps it could have put more depth into its storyline as easy to understand and master as playing a complex game on easy mode because the film is nothing impressive narratively and yes aesthetically beautiful in all the scenarios based on its games full of fanservices played every 2 seconds for you to be dazzled and moved making us understand why  the super mario bros movie is a huge success and ready to become a huge franchise and i want to fans too
May 22 2023,positive,very fun and nostalgic
May 22 2023,positive,loved it chris pratt is superb
May 22 2023,positive,good characters somethings did not make sense amazing jokes
May 22 2023,positive,my brother and i have loved mario since i can remember i could tell that he is a bigger fan that me he knew many years before everyone else that he would come out he found out in 2018 and when he told me i thought they were huge years of waiting but here it is we cried with emotion to see our precious plumbers being a success and how it debuted on the big screen we love you nintendo and shigeru miyamoto for bringing it to life and illumination and chris meledandri for bringing it to the big screen
May 22 2023,positive,my kids 10 and 12 absolutely loved it whats with the low critics score every movie the critics have given a good review my kids hated
May 22 2023,positive,if you like mario youll like this movie  dont know what the professional critics are thinking
May 22 2023,positive,refreshingly faithful to the source material
May 22 2023,neutral,now before you start  yes i have played the mario games a lot of them however im definitely not what you call a super fan     this movie was colorful had a lot of references to nintendo games as well as the mario franchise loved seeing iwatasan represented as well    the voice acting was decent the forced italian accents left more to be desired luckily theyre not used for the entirety of the movie    overall the story was massively predictable and followed the heros journey pretty much to a t there werent many plot twists if any at all and a lot of stuff shown in the movie was advertised    for kids this movie will be a delight especially kids who love the mario series    for adults that depends ive seen plenty of reviews saying its the perfect movie and i believe if your nostalgia is strong enough youll greatly enjoy this movie and believe its perfect seeing the characters come to life on the big screen or your tv  can be exciting    if youre not a super mario fan you might go into this movie feeling bored the references were enough to keep me engaged but a movie shouldnt really rely on that    was it a bad movie i dont think so it was just boring its not for everyone    if you are excited for this movie love the mario franchise youll probably like it
May 22 2023,positive,great for kids and light hearted fun for adultsignore stupid critics and their negative review bombs we the audience knows what is up
May 22 2023,positive,a fun film that while is a fairly generic heros journey it doesnt force jokes or show any glaring flaws

May 22 2023,positive,this movie is awesome
May 22 2023,positive,a childrens movie for sure but entertaining enough for adults
May 22 2023,positive,for a movies that got thrashed in the media before it even came out i thought this movie was a lot of fun it had loads of callback and references to the mario game world and did not feel overdone
May 22 2023,neutral,it seems very hokey and typical to pander to kids and their parents of the past generation i personally see no reason to add in music from outside the mario universe like acdc having a goofy presence in a kart race mario and luigi are what kids or something they live in a brooklyn apartment with their huge family an invincibility star is suddenly not the most worthless item in the world yoshi got a walk on role in the background everyones a ninja its just a little too much in the opposite direction of the game not that i have a suggestion for how to make this movie work aside not making it at all its not the worst thing ever but its not particularly good either you would lose nothing from the quality of your life if you skipped this one
May 22 2023,positive,great movie great story line  dont know what critics give it such a low ratings
May 22 2023,positive,even if it doesnt have the most in depth story it is still an insanely fun experience

May 22 2023,positive,i loved the movie  it was more then i was thinking it was going to be
May 22 2023,positive,im ready to watch this over and over until the sequel rumors prop up
May 22 2023,positive,whats to expect when you watered your mushrooms for over two decades mine didnt just got big is the kind of feeling i expected all along thats why im excited you dont have to ask just know that mario and luigi is to rescue thats the kind of animation i would want to see for the least eight time and i cant see myself being bored by the whole drama the consulting kupa and his minions gushing all over the place the comedic air the laugh and vibes the feeling of being that guy if you are still skeptical about this movie please dont you might not like it the way i did but hey all i can say is to me i didnt refer this to my review just for it to get pushed to the side see this movie am telling you
May 22 2023,negative,absolute garbage it looks pretty and showcases the game characters we all know and love from the super mario universe however it seems that matthew fogel the writer took that as a signal to put less effort into the plot and theme of the movie the jokes and voice actors chosen for mario and luigi were unfortunate and it is unlikely that any voice actor could have brought justice to such iconic characters as those
May 22 2023,positive,im a 35 year old woman who used to play mario as a kid im not an avid gamer but wow this movie was nostalgic its hilarious and it made me feel the excitement i felt as a kid playing the video games the soundtrack is awesome and the animation is great also a great messaging about family and unity
May 22 2023,positive,loved it good to see fun movies like this are still being made
May 22 2023,positive,it was a great movie and the animation was amazing the only reason im giving it a 3 star is because i thought the story line would have been different being born in the 80s growing up with the first mario games and the 1993 film i was a bit shocked at how the story line was a lot like the 93 film as i was watching the new movie it brought me back down memory lane which was cool but it was almost like a animated 93 version i was surprised at how similar they were
May 22 2023,positive,not the worst movie ever it had almost all the game references and the graphics were amazing but the voice actors were pretty subpar the one saving grace was jack black as bowser he absolutely nailed it
May 22 2023,positive,it was a great and funny movie went to see it with my niece it was her 1st movie experience ever 
May 22 2023,positive,the best rendition of a video game ever cant wait to see a second movie with even more characters from the nintendo franchise
May 22 2023,positive,loved to see what we grew up with its been a while story line was good but the message behind it all was powerful always great to put positive thoughts into these young childrens minds
May 22 2023,positive,this movie was great and held my children attention the entire time 5 stars
May 22 2023,positive,it was best movie ever and everything is so funny
May 22 2023,positive,i went in thinking this would be a great movie for younger kids but terrible for long time fans of the mario franchise but i was shocked by how great the movie was 
May 22 2023,positive,amazing great effects nostalgia and storyline 
May 22 2023,positive,they did a great job at appealing to all ages it is honestly a perfect family movie there was no filler  the plot had a steady flow it was actually refreshing to see film that felt made for the family  light and fun not crammed full of learning moments and forced scene inclusions what a breath of fresh air i hope they make a another
May 22 2023,positive,entertaining kinda funny not much to say
May 22 2023,positive,its an amazing movie that pleases both young and old viewers and has a great storyline there are many easter eggs that can be found during the second watch its a perfect balance of fun and seriousness to keep you intrigued when watching a fun movie for the family that shouldnt be low rated if you are not familiar with the game series
May 22 2023,positive,good for kids ok for adults
May 22 2023,positive,great movie  show brother  stay strong together
May 22 2023,positive,fun and entertaining no agendas no changing the storybrand and ruining it like so many movies have      voice acting is all perfect imo the voices matches the characters somehow like chris pratt and the lego movie the voice fits the character    great entertainment true to brandstory fun  solid movie i paid to see and would pay to see again
May 22 2023,positive,bit over the top with the constant jokes besides that its a fun movie
May 22 2023,positive,we had a wonderful time me and my granddaughter enjoyed the movie and popcorn  it was a great experience
May 22 2023,positive,dont listen to rotten tomatoes  they are bought and dont want this movie to succeed  fake news  the movie was amazing
May 22 2023,positive,fantastic loved the nostalgia with all the old video games the whole family loved it
May 21 2023,positive,it was better than expected but it is not great the thing that bottered me the most was the pacing it goes too fast there is no time to take a breath on what is happening mario starts then marios is sent to the mushroom kingdom then he has to go to the princess mario doesnt ask anything it is a really weird situation and he just goes forward it took less than a minute to accept he has isekaided i had to take a really quick bathroom brake and in less than a minute a whole movie stage had started and finished in less than 5 minutes i didnt hate it but they tried to tell too much in a little timelapse
May 21 2023,positive,love letter to mario took me back in time as a kid core memories great fun
May 21 2023,positive,cute but a little boring
May 21 2023,negative,the story was essentially nonexistent spent a lot of time making recreating the game play and almost none creating character depth or plot boring
May 21 2023,positive,a video game movie  its very well what i expected in the best way
May 21 2023,positive,below average animated movie i can understand those passionate about the video games finding little easter eggs etc in this movie but for the average viewer it offered very little in laughs and in action
May 21 2023,positive,good graphics and story line
May 21 2023,positive,great movie lots of fun
May 21 2023,negative,its okay if youve played one mario video game youll like it but youll know everything you need to about the movies plot
May 21 2023,positive,this movie was so enjoyable cant wait to own the physical copy
May 21 2023,negative,by the numbers and formulaic youve already seen this movie 5 or 10 times but with a different skin and brand name attached pretty standard voice acting too getting just names you know  i bet an effort by the actual game makers would be more interesting
May 21 2023,positive,made me think of my childhood  great movie
May 21 2023,positive,it was an awesome pizza nostalgia for myself without being corny and an excellent piece to keep my eightyearold niece entertained without any of the crap from disney movies we truly did not want it to end
May 21 2023,positive,awesome movie incorporated all the elements very hilarious too
May 21 2023,positive,if youre a millennial and had an n64 or if youre anyone and ever played mario this movie is for you a love letter to all of us who made amazing memories smashing karting battling and saving the princess in a different castle
May 21 2023,positive,as a fan growing up i enjoyed seeing all the game references  i didnt like the editing as it felt choppy  like there was no real translation to each scene  i felt the girl boss peach thing was forced and that really annoyed me decent film but definitely made specifically for the fans
May 21 2023,positive,the creators clearly knew the game the amount of references and the story  was just perfection this was pure fun and sweet nostalgia  loved loved loved
May 21 2023,positive,to understand the plot of the movie you have to be a fan of the game series and it whole estate this movie is fun and nostalgic in every corner with already memorable characters and humour going in this movie as a newby you will struggle to understand the plot but its still fun for the whole family
May 21 2023,positive,movie was good i wacth at home but eveything was good about it no disspoints
May 21 2023,positive,wonderful movie for super mario fans everything is nostalgic characters settings music etc the story is enough to take us back to our childhood again
May 21 2023,positive,we enjoyed the movie much action and songs were great very nice family movie
May 21 2023,positive,producers discovered that for fans to like the movies from game adaptations it has to be 8090 close to the game this felt like playing all the games as if they were levels and the narrative created conflicts between the characters to have a full movie without being repetitive probably there will be fans that wanted a new story but then it wouldnt be the same  income if they invented a very different story from the games
May 21 2023,positive,decent graphics for 3d viewing the kids enjoyed it
May 21 2023,positive,its great when movies are allowed to represent their subject matter and not ruin everything to push the message props to nintendo for over ruling the hollywood swamp
May 21 2023,positive,it is a completely palatable fun and sometimes funny romp through nostalgia and the absurd  fortunately unlike many animated film nowadays it is also completely unobjectionable for the family to watch
May 21 2023,positive,the movie was great the regal gateway theatre was the disappointment the seats are old and not comfortable my 10 year old grandson had a hard time sitting on the chairs because it would fold back when he sat with his back touching the back of the seat other theaters have more modern and comfortable seats time for a renovation for this theater
May 21 2023,positive,another example of a massive disconnect between critics who spend all their time belittling anything that isnt designed to push an agenda or is ridiculously convoluted in an attempt to validate their years spent getting a useless degree and the moviegoer who just wants an escape from reality and to be entertained    this movie was fun my kids and i both enjoyed it its a fun watch with little to no political agenda much like sonic it was just a good movie designed to please fans of the franchise who are the next generation of parents they brought their kids and now their kids share the loves of these franchises  contrast that with disney movies with convoluted villains that continue to underperform at the box office keep doing what youre doing illumination
May 21 2023,positive,brings back good memories of my youth
May 21 2023,positive,im 58 years old and took my 7 year old nephew hes very active and doesnt spend a lot of time playing video games there were lots of references to the games which should endear those between our ages who played the games which was probably their intent my nephew couldnt really follow all of it because it was set in the game world rather than our earthly world with its limitations he was really excited to go and was really excited for the first few minutes but curled up and went to sleep about halfway through in all fairness much of this is probably due to my letting him get whatever he wants when were together he is very active but has four big sisters when he gets to go without them he doesnt have to share he got a large drink and the girl said he could get icee instead of a soft drink he also had popcorn skittles mms twizzlers and kit kats his parents are pretty strict on his eating more healthy as for me those video games came out after i was out of college but id played the quarter versions enough to understand donkey kong world it was fun and the story was simple and wholesome it would be perfect for people between our ages who are familiar with the characters and games i would tell anyone who asks who played those games and whose kids play them that they should see it and would love it
May 21 2023,positive,it was a very good film
May 21 2023,positive,if you look for a fun time i would recommend this movie its perfect for your childs first movie ever for the older people the plot is thin and motivations are weak but nostalgia and visuals carry this movie hard
May 21 2023,positive,the movie is awesome thanks to nintendo and illumination
May 21 2023,neutral,was not that good little slow  boring
May 21 2023,positive,if youre a true mario bros fan youll love this movie i mean gameboy with the magnifying light up attachment until now type of fan my kids and i loved this movie
May 21 2023,positive,it was completely fantastic and fun it honored everything i loved about mario games growing up and then some
May 21 2023,negative,the most bored i ever was in a movies in a long time what a drag of a movie
May 21 2023,positive,what a lot of fun this film is while its geared toward a younger audience theres more than enough callbacks and references to satisfy lifelong fans as to be expected the animation is flawless perfectly capturing the feel of the games the voice cast is also perfect chris pratt surprisingly in particular anya taylorjoy is great princess peach and jack black is as entertaining as ever in the role of bowser thank goodness it simply entertains its audience rather than attempt to lecture them if i had to level some real criticism id say luigi is absent for a lot of the film and while he does team up with his brother its mainly toward the end the story may be somewhat lacking but lets be real thats not what most of us are here for overall id say it was solid rather than spectacular but sometimes thats all you really need perhaps this could be the start of a nintendo cinematic universe
May 21 2023,positive,great adaptation of the video game  very kid friendly and filled with nostalgia from my childhood critics must be haters   love this movie and its potential sequel
May 21 2023,positive,my 4yr old watched the movie in its entirety and we enjoyed it big time
May 21 2023,positive,couldnt ask for sharper animation the story is fun and moves along at good pace good character development and voice over is  casting success also truly a family movie no weird jokes that you have to explain later
May 21 2023,negative,this movie lacks any plot it jumps at random between different parts using a high animation budget and nintendo trademarks to make some money from its audience its borderline insulting to italian americans and has no reference to the mario franchise besides the visuals it regurgitated every stale lame wornout concept from previous films to fill its staggeringly empty hour and a half
May 21 2023,positive,awesome family moviepaid homage to the video game perfectly
May 21 2023,positive,i dont know what those critics are smoking but pass that around since this movies amazing the effects are awesome
May 21 2023,negative,it was cute but it didnt hold our attention there were some funny moments but the plot wasnt very good
May 21 2023,positive,good the visuals are amazing the movie looks really good for illumination movie
May 21 2023,positive,so so good dont know why rotten tomatoes has 59 listed for this movie at the time of this writing i believe that we cannot trust the critics on rotten tomatoes anymore this movie is a must watch
May 21 2023,positive,fun for kids  i love how they mixed in all the video games into one moviemario donkey kong mario kart etc

May 21 2023,positive,excellent movie brought back the kid in me
May 21 2023,positive,awesome movie the preview made this movie look sooo good and i was not disappointed my nine year old loved it just as much as me and my husband highly recommend for adults and kids

May 20 2023,positive,fun to watch with kids
May 20 2023,positive,great movie  a rare gem lately with no political stuff or agendas  our family was impressed   hoping more movies continue this trend
May 20 2023,positive,definitely geared towards a younger audience which is refreshing to think that there exists a story that isnt trying to sway your politics woof    glad i didnt pay for it but it was still a good movie with the overall message of not giving up even in the face of rejection they are no superman but i think it will do thank you nintendo
May 20 2023,positive,i enjoyed watching the movie with my son i likes the song peaches peaches peaches
May 20 2023,positive,one of the best animation movies i saw full of nostalgia
May 20 2023,positive,great movie reminded me of the video game 
May 20 2023,positive,this movie is the best based video game movie ever and i hope they make a sequel and i love how jack black voice as bowser and chris pratt voice as mario i hope they make their return to voice those roles
May 20 2023,positive,best videogame movie ever if your even a small fan of mario you will like this movie the way they captured the audience in this world is magical although this movie is really really good it wasnt perfect this movies pacing was too quick and left the movie feeling short not to mention its around 80 minutes which is still short for a kids movie the soundtrack is filled with nostalgic music like gusty garden galaxy theme but also has really random songs like thunderstruck overall awesome movie
May 20 2023,positive,man the critics did this movie wrong it was a great nostalgic interpretation of the video game of our childhoods ps the song peaches was great
May 20 2023,positive,such a good movie loved every second
May 20 2023,positive,really cool movie packed with references and easter eggs everywhere it was an incredible experience to watch such a relevant animated film actually this doesnt seem like a critique but rather an enjoyable review a movie like this is meant to relax and entertain rather than being critically analyzed
May 20 2023,positive,it was cute the critics are looking at tit with what they look for in a movie but my only criteria is did i enjoy it and i did   also props to chris pratt he wasnt a bad mario at all and people were too quick to judge   loved the twin brother dynamic of mario and luigi i would see a sequel
May 20 2023,positive,as a person who didnt play the games i loved the movie my husband is a diehard fan and grew up playing the games having watched him play and sort of understanding how it worked i thought the movie was brilliant jack black made a fantastic bowser loved it
May 20 2023,positive,the kids loved it1111
May 20 2023,positive,movie too rushed    boring at the start     bowser could have got more screen time    boring in general
May 20 2023,positive,the best cartoon in a long time bravo its good that there are still people who make good cartoons never give this cartoon to disney for reshoots they ruin everything they touch now
May 20 2023,positive,cute movie kids will love it
May 20 2023,positive,if you played the games as a kid this is such a nostalgic movie i absolutely loved it the music was my favorite part
May 20 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was excellent in every possible way there was action adventure humor friendship brotherhood unlikely friends bowser was defeated it was so much fun so many call backs to various mario games over the years both old and new there was something for everyone i saw it with my son for his 11th birthday and we both cant wait to see it again the creators told a great story the voice actors and animators did an excellent job and all the toads were soooooooo adorable whats not to love
May 20 2023,positive,its very entertaining and enjoyable im not a mario fan and i really enjoyed it although everything goes fast fast fast and a lot of data is lost leaving many parts of the script mediocre
May 20 2023,positive,id recommend watching this movie if you love everything mario the movie kind of relies on you knowing the lore of the games to work though
May 20 2023,positive,its a great movie very funny
May 20 2023,positive,for me it was actually really good it definitely did not disappoint and i was really focused towards the movie because of how good it was there was a little bit of cringe but that didnt fully mess up any of my expectations there was a lot of really funny scenes that i really enjoyed and there was a lot of scenes that i thought they did a really great job on my favorite character and the one that got me high expectations for the movie was bower played by jack black because man jack black went all out on his character bowser i would give this movie a 910 it would of almost been a 1010
May 20 2023,negative,i think this movie is awful i think they shouldve took them a little more time to animate the movie and make the movie longer is really disappointing as a fan of mario
May 20 2023,positive,love to see a part of my youth come to the theater impacting a newer generational audience as well
May 20 2023,positive,one of the greatest video game implementations on cinema jam packed full of nostalgic references while making do with hodgepodge of storyline to make it a great movie for the whole family   the only quirk that goes against the grain of the otherwise smooth film is seth rogens voicing if donkey kong theres absolutely zero energy given to the character and every time he speaks sounds like an initial table read of the script
May 20 2023,positive,wahoo you must see this movie it might be short for some but the music choosen is fantastic and the begining is not too bad thare is some action some funniness and some mixed things

May 20 2023,positive,fantastic movie fun for kids and adults who have grown up with the franchise dont expect anything incredibly deep or twisty this movie is pure fan service and its amazing for that they used every sound baddie gaming mechanic and threw a little love for all the games into it if every video gamed based movie poured the attention and love in the this one did gaming movies would be completely different excellent job its fun light hearted and nostalgic i hope to see a sequel in the future
May 20 2023,positive,it was amazing there were alot of easter eggs that brought back memories from my childhood but most importantly my son loves the movie and thats what really matters
May 19 2023,positive,just good ole family fun
May 19 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic from start to finish they did a great job of incorporating the games into the movie and the best part its one of the very few movies where you dont feel like youre being lectured with an agenda this movie has something for the kids and parents
May 19 2023,positive,ive already seen this movie 5 times and it keeps getting better and better honestly the super mario bros movie is literally everything you want in a mario movie this goes without say for all of the different game character and item references that it basically becomes a huge nostalgia overload its a must see for both kids and adults alike including any and all nintendo fans that grew up with the super mario franchise
May 19 2023,positive,great family movie
May 19 2023,positive,amazing and full of fun retro easter eggs if youre an old nintendo fan like myself i really think the ending was leading to a sequel with potential appearances from waluigi wario rosalina yoshi and maybe perhaps even bowser jr
May 19 2023,positive,this movie was pretty awesome and funny to watch i really recommend it
May 19 2023,neutral,good enough to keep the kids entertained but thats all another creative take on an existing franchise that fails to meet the mark many cameos and easter eggs to meet the nostalgic checkinthebox but the rest of the movie is lacking
May 19 2023,positive,action packed fun movie
May 19 2023,positive,kids loved it nothing profane or wicked just good clean fun
May 19 2023,negative,the super mario bros movie delivers eye popping animation which is arguably the strongest aspect of the film the plot holds no clear or incisive command rather relying on nostalgia references and fast paced sequences that can be enjoyed on its own  but instantly leaves your brain the second its over
May 19 2023,positive,funny great adventure cool animations
May 19 2023,positive,i came into this movie thinking it would be forgettable but tolerable but i was pleasantly surprised at just how fun and rewatchable it ended up being yes theres a lot of fan service and a severe lack of luigi and yoshi but there are plenty of genuinely funny moments and is just a joy from start to finish
May 19 2023,positive,the super mario is a great movie i recommend watching this film   its very funny

May 19 2023,positive,i took my son this movie on his birthday and we both loved it the picture quality was superb and to watch a girl star lead princess peach be bold and brave lifted my spirits
May 19 2023,positive,this movie is totally fun nothing more and nothing less for critics that are looking to slam it  relax its a super mario bros movie no one expects it to be citizen kane lighten up its worth a watch
May 19 2023,positive,abosluuute very good movie and have all caracteristics from the game its insane for me born in 80s see this animation if you want a good animation movie see this its awesome
May 19 2023,positive,the nostalgia the callbacks it was all completely worth it i went in optimistic and left hoping that the end credits scene would be a set up for a sequel the voice acting was phenomenal i had peaches stuck in my head for like 4 days afterwards look forward to seeing the next movie if it happens
May 19 2023,positive,i loved this movie jack black is absolutely hilarious
May 19 2023,positive,this movie was pretty good it was obviously playing on my nostalgia but my kids also enjoyed it even though they knew almost nothing about the franchise
May 19 2023,positive,i loved everything about this movie if youve been a mario game nerd since the beginning played all the games and loved them then you will enjoy this the colors the hidden gems of reference to the video games  and the cast jack black is one of my all time favorites he had some definite  jack black moments as bowser i highly anticipate a sequel or more and will watch this over and over again too simple a story line what have you ever played the games of course its simple its mario goddamit fuck the critics this movie is 5 stars
May 19 2023,positive,i love this movie very suitable for children and had a fun time watching this

May 19 2023,positive,very fun and enjoyable movie the animation is fun and colorful which makes it so much more fun to watch  also donkey kong couldnt help but dance xd dk10
May 19 2023,positive,how not to love a movie that was so faithful to the game mario delivered everything we wanted and at the same time we were surprised by the mix of stories and references a film that entertains it was not supposed to be super elaborate or complex a simple story to amuse we all expected that and we liked the result whatever an inspiration for adapted games to more faithfully follow their stories
May 19 2023,positive,it one of the best movies ive seen senc going back to movie theaters and the critics are wrong
May 19 2023,positive,great for kids entertaining for adults with lots of easter eggs from nintendo lore
May 19 2023,positive,great funwhy because its a mario movie for kids doesnt do anything else but keep itself mario hopefully next movie is more mario and luigi i enjoyed it more than both the sonic movies it sticks to its animated world and is all the better for it
May 19 2023,positive,it really connected to the games well  bowser is hilarious and mario and luigi are a perfect duo
May 19 2023,positive,i love the whole movie  i hope for a 2te one
May 19 2023,positive,good even if the 59 lies its still a great movie with a plot and some great references easter eggs etc
May 19 2023,positive,this movie was good and funny and the animation was great and the voice acting was great too
May 19 2023,positive,it was a lower production than i expectedmario character could have been handled betteri didnt like the character of luigi he was a very side charactereven in the title of the movie it is mentioned as mario brothersthere probably wont be luigi in the next movies in the seriesi really liked bowser he was serious in some places and very entertaining in othersi hope the other movies in the series will have better scriptsoverall it was a fun production
May 19 2023,positive,i think its really good but despicable me is kinda better
May 19 2023,positive,fun for the whole family it was cute

May 19 2023,positive,its simply the best animation movie and a videogame based movie of all time
May 19 2023,positive,great movie well done and nice to see a animated movie made for families

May 19 2023,positive,greatest movie ive seen in a lot of time
May 19 2023,positive,takes us into the world of video games with great and unforgettable references the plot is fun and the characters are all charismatic
May 19 2023,positive,charlie day is a king and i refuse to give anything with him in it less then 5 stars that goes for the whole always sunny crew
May 19 2023,positive,the only suggestion i have is for it to be slower for a more hardcore transition
May 19 2023,positive,the movie is full of life you can see all the important details that are in the game is great to see them alive
May 19 2023,positive,this movie was fun yall should go see it

May 19 2023,positive,super fun for the whole family
May 19 2023,positive,thank you so much nintendo for the artwork everything i played in my childhood wanted to give 10 stars
May 19 2023,positive,the film is awesome love it
May 19 2023,negative,the amount of nolastgic but its fairly boring not fun i do love bowser and mario and peach the voices were ok except bowser and toad the set pieces and the world building and the storytelling was amazing
May 19 2023,positive,a campy and sometimes funny nostalgic comedy that delivers on music but falls a little short on landing a solid hit for anyone that grow up playing super mario brothers on first gen nintendo youll get it but im afraid it tried too hard to fit in too many references from various video games  the pace was slow at times but would then push way too fast all in all worth one viewing but nothing much to make it a must view
May 19 2023,positive,as a hardcore nintendo and mario fan this movie turned out pretty good it passed my expectations really well  i was initially a little skeptical when the movies voice cast was announced back in 2017 but then after years of waiting and then finally announcing it the movie was in my opinion really good    here are the things i liked about it    1 the animation easily the one of the most visually stunning animation in all of my years of watching animation for an illumination film you can tell that they put a lot of effort and creativity into it    2 the storyplot the plot is simple but effective enough for nintendos first animated film in case you dont already know the plot its about the super mario bros getting separated into the mushroom kingdom and they must stop bowser from taking over the mushroom kingdom    3 charactersvoice acting honestly the best part of this whole movie was the the performances of the cast particularly chris pratt as mario charlie day as luigi anya taylor joy as princess peach and jack black as bowser  every scene with bowser was funny and memorable and jack blacks performance helped to bring this villain to life seth rogan as dk was also good    4  the music the soundtrack from thus movie is not only good but it felt special to me since i am a big mario fan they were some standout tracks in this movie including the mario bros theme peaches and dk rap from dk country     5 the faithfulness to the source material  there was a lot of easter eggs callbacks references from previous mario games and even some nods to the old school nes console my personal favorite one out of the bunch was the princess is in a another castle quote    the thing i dislike ld about this movie was that it was just too short at like an hour and thirty minutes i know somewhere out there theres an extended cut of the movie or something because we needed more luigi time
May 19 2023,positive,great and funny full of easter eggs for those who love the games
May 19 2023,positive,bowser peaches song was hilarious
May 19 2023,positive,it was a great movie
May 19 2023,positive,i dont know how people didnt like this it was awesome and i couldnt even tell it was chris pratt he did a great young mario
May 19 2023,positive,this film is absolutely amazing the story while basic is still great the animation is absolutely incredible and the characters are lovable 1010  perfect
May 19 2023,positive,this movie is for people who enjoy mario and follow with the games this movie has more references in it then any movie i have ever seen besides infinity war and end game the story also has a nice twist with peach not being the classic damsel in destress if you dont know mario games then this movie may not be for you however if you do keep up with mario then this movie will be a pleasant surprise
May 19 2023,positive,this is one of the best movie ever is better than the original movie
May 19 2023,positive,nice movie exceeded my expectations
May 19 2023,positive,loved it super cute movie
May 19 2023,positive,it is just a glorified nintendo ad the pacing is trying to be a game to movie buff and it tried  however with the fact that it tries too much and it lost a star rate on this end for mario because of spoiler alert hating to eat mushrooms   like what the famous plumber known for mushroom consumption to hate them also another star loss for princess peach why not because the fact she was a billy badass that is what actually kept the three star rating but because she devolps her interest in mario like out of the blue and to call her princess time to queen it up  there was no king or other queen  it is a good kid pleaser to kids who just love mario but for this gen xer this game to movie came up losing a life
May 19 2023,positive,i loved it 3rd time watching it 
May 19 2023,positive,i question the critics ability to abstractly and actually critique movies it seems so many movies score high praise with the audience yet many critics give terrible ratings and then vice versa this super mario bros movie is no exception and ticks all the boxes for all ages there are so many easter eggs in it to excite the adults who grew up playing these games as well as catchy tunes and character portrayals that entertain young children who know little to nothing of mario otherwise if you have any knowledge and love for mario luigi dk princess peach etc then youre sure to enjoy this as are your kids
May 19 2023,positive,easy on the eyes and fun to watch clearly a strong start for what i hope is a much needed a new cinematic universe
May 18 2023,positive,music and story line is phenomenal very nostalgic
May 18 2023,positive,i found that the overall movie was a good way for old and new fans to come together but there were a few problems the music and princess peach the soundtrack sounded like the director forgot to turn off their spotify playlist and ended up consuming more of the movie then voice lines of the actorsactresses princess peach was an amazing person to represent girl power but i found her more of a mary sue i personally think if we see her struggle and go down to the dark side of her it would be better if she managed to cope with all of this and overcome it other then that the movie was a pleasant piece of animation overcoming the typical illumination art style
May 18 2023,positive,it was good no more no less
May 18 2023,negative,while better than the previous movie in this installment of films this movie once stripped back of all the spectacle and animation is just one giant train wreck the story is so lacking that i came up with a script that sounded better while watching the movie chris prat was the exact person not to cast for the voice of mario whos character in the film is about as likeable as a brick jack black charlie day and keeganmichael key all carry this movie as much as they can with bowser being arguably the best character that appears in the film being both a flawed and understandable antagonist without being sympathetic luigi doesnt get enough screen time to say anything and toad is probably the exact opposite of what the filmmakers wanted him to be a strong supporting character it felt like he was supposed to be comedic relief but most of the jokes fell flat   princess peach is very much a marysue in this movie never once failing to do anything while the main character mario fails at almost everything he does donkey kong was ok you can tell he was voiced by seth rogan and he doesnt detract from the film but it would have been better for his character if he wasnt as antagonistic the supporting characters throughout the film were all pretty strong and the scenes were properly comedic when not featuring our two leads  the song choice for this movie is a mix of good and bad the good lies in the songs that nintendo has clearly remixed for the film along with all of the tracks that come from their library from the dk rap to the remix of the star powerup song the bad is every single popculture song that isnt native to the nintendo brand they were jarring and uncalled for draining a clearlytightly wound budget into a place where the money would have been betteroff if it was burned   the animation is stellar illuminations does a good job of making sure that the entire film is a feast for the eyes with the particle effects and the visuals being spectacular that being said it is quite hard to enjoy the view when there is so much happening all at once and there is no story to speak of   all in all youd have to pay me about 60 to make me see this movie again it isnt as bad as the first movie perish the thought but it is still not something id like to sit through again and waste my time with it might be good if you are looking for something to blind you with nostalgia or to keep your kids entertained but for an adult viewer it is torture to watch this movie when bowser is not on screen
May 18 2023,positive,it was full of memberberries and in a 90 minute movie that flies that is all i want is it indepth and subversive no but it didnt need it
May 18 2023,positive,absolutely a modern classic in every way
May 18 2023,positive,it was a fun and delightful rendition of the beloved video game franchise we all know and love it was progressive enough without being too preachy and the focus was on a good balance of nostalgia and kidfriendly adventure also jack blacks take on bowser was amazing 
May 18 2023,positive,gonna be honest i didnt expect very much but got a pleasent suprise the animation is very good the soundtracks are very well selected and it honors the original material
May 18 2023,positive,i like it and so did my daughter its definitely for kids as expected
May 18 2023,positive,its better than i thought before seeing it the colors the animation the music and all the characters are just like every marios fan would love to see the only thing i didnt like about it its the tone of the movie were living in a moment where the animation movies are for everyone animation is not only for kids but the plot and the development are only for kids nothing unforgivable ill see it more times
May 18 2023,positive,loved every minute  the references i spotted were amazing i honestly couldnt stop smiling  my childhood was greatly represented  cant wait for the sequel  and bring on the koopalings and of course bowser jr that cutie i mean baddie no cutie
May 18 2023,positive,this is a fulfilled movie for the entire family to experience chris pratt and jack black as mario and bowser definitely have the song peaches stuck in my head the emotion that chris pratt and jack black put into their characters is magnificent no wonder this movie made a 1 billion in the box office in just a month this movie is one i definitely recommend to watch over and over again
May 18 2023,positive,its super fun  as a parent that has to watch these movies with my kids its nice to see the nostalgia references that keep making it fun  even better than the first sonic film  the creators did this film correct  they saw the content and canon that worked and left out everything that didnt  really i dont understand why other film adaptation go so wrongi mean its like working with a time tested cheat sheet
May 18 2023,positive,super fun one of the best game adaptations nintendo must invest in others adaptations with the same vibe
May 18 2023,positive,fun movie story and animation loved the soundtrack songs
May 18 2023,positive,i wont say perfect but such a relief to watch a none political and honestly quite funny take on a beloved game
May 18 2023,positive,its one of those movies if know the content if you know where it came from  youre gonna like it full of references from the games definitely a must see    unfortunately if know zero about mario you might not enjoy it as much     i want more
May 18 2023,positive,you definitely will not regret seeing this movie very funny and exciting loved it
May 18 2023,positive,this movie is so amazing it made me smile more than the sonic 2 movie the music was amazing and so was the animation and i have never wanted to scream from excitement while watching a movie so badly
May 18 2023,positive,watched this with my 12yo autistic son and he was all smiles through the whole movie  worth watching
May 18 2023,positive,great animation great character profiles a lot of good easter eggs and references to the older games however even as a fan of the games it was a one time watch id wait for the dvd if youre sitting on the fence on going to see it or not
May 18 2023,positive,one of the most amazing experience i ever had in movies for a long time
May 18 2023,positive,the movie was fantastic with so many little easter eggs to find as well as a brilliantly composed soundtrack bravo
May 18 2023,positive,wonderfull almost perfect respect the original characters and history
May 18 2023,positive,finally i remember watching the super mario movie in 1993 and just bewildered at the product they created now 30 years later this movie was released and it does not disappoint its fun theres tons of cameos hidden easter eggs a million awesome references to all of the mario games throughout marios existence i am upset i didnt see this in the theater but im so glad to purchase this movie i will watch it again  again its phenomenal and i would rate it 6 out of 5 stars if i could
May 18 2023,positive,funny and great graphics but the introduction of the mario could be better without having an idea of what the game is about i would be confused  but its mario movie so i am happy with what ive seen
May 18 2023,positive,i think it was a solid movie but it wasnt a fantastic game changing movie it was a bit fast paced at times but our family enjoyed it in my opinion and what the box office numbers suggest is that families are putting their time trust and money into illumination studios kids movies and not disney movies anymore mario was better than any disney movie ive seen in a long time
May 18 2023,positive,this movie does not deserve to be this funny but it is nothing more to say to that really light hearted comedy for all ages
May 18 2023,positive,its a kids movie based on kids game for kids to enjoy which it does perfectly as per my 5 year old nephew a must watch if you got kids or a pure heart
May 18 2023,positive,brought my kids to see it in the cinema it was ok unfortunately it doesnt have any emotional core it could have been a lot better with some minor changes
May 18 2023,positive,great movie one thing that i didnt like was how fast it went through if it went a little bit slower it wouldve been 5 stars the jack black song was amazing haha
May 18 2023,positive,made an account just for this but anyone who has nostalgia with super mario absolutely has to watch this one of my all time favourite movies
May 18 2023,negative,the movie feels too much like disney frozen movies its basically just another super strong princess better than everyone else movie with a stupid unconfident mario luigi is non existent during all the movie and this what i hate the most about the movie peach is a character of nintendo series and its fine just dont call the the movie that way if you want to make more about princess than the brothers i know i know we live in a time where it is impossible to do anything without the super strong invincible better than everyone else female character but this is getting a bit old and redundant there is so many movies like this theyre all the same could they have let mario bros worked together instead of removing one the entire movie its either you like it or not
May 18 2023,positive,i played super mario land decades ago as a young boy on the game boy that was also my last point of contact with it     the movie was great entertainment for me exciting funny and well done and the movie is a reasonable length more of this
May 18 2023,positive,tldr while i really really liked the animation and the very beginning i feel like this movies plot couldve used a bit longer time to cook   the music is wonderful to listen to especially peaches i swear jack black is the highlight of this movie though i feel he couldve used more lines i do wish there were a few less pop culture songs in here i need a hero couldve probably been cut as its been overused to death at this point but i think take on me was a great choice for kong island it gave a funky intro to the section that really got me into the area the dk rap of course was perfect other pop culture songs were well used okay  honestly my real issue with this movie and why i cant do four stars is because of the plot now its not a bad plot a completely serviceable one but its just too short i feel like we couldve gotten more out of this story with more time for mario to train perhaps get to know the mushroom kingdom even explore the various locales we see as they travel to kong island its a plot that moves at a breakneck pace and we dont really see much worldbuilding go into the wonderful world of wait does this world even have a name yeah a little more explanation on that would be great if this movie were 2 hours or 2 hours 30 minutes i likely wouldve felt better pacing in this one with more time to get invested in the characters plot and world however i suppose if its meant to be for the younger audiences the plots speed probably isnt too bad kids can only sit around for a set amount of time after all if i had to give this plot some kudos however it would really be on the explanation of princess peachs backstory shes a pretty good character but i think she could use a bit more princessy personality to be more accurate to the mario games not that she has to lose her strong edge it makes her more entertaining to watch but i would love to see something just a bit cuter speaking of characters i really do like mario and luigi though luigi couldve used more screen time the chris pratt and charlie day voiceacting doesnt actually pull me out of the movie if anything i feel more like mario and luigi are real guys just some kids in brooklyn following a dream dk and cranky kong are pretty hilarious to watch and the emotional weight when cranky says hes proud of his son is incredibly touching the brothers family is fun to see in action and its nice to see characters that one doesnt really know much about in the canon of the games bowser of course knocks it out of the park as expected i do really like this lean on his onesided romance with peach though i feel like if the runtime was increased we couldve seen a bit of a softer side to him when it comes to her only character i didnt really like that much was toad and thats mostly because i think he couldve used more character development he kinda fills the role of comic relief but some of his lines dont hit same with peach actually especially with that joke about mario being nobody important it undermines the previous scene with her heartfelt talk to mario however most of the other humor lands especially the kong island i love kong island so much please more kong island  however what the movie lacks in plot satisfaction it more than makes up for with animation models dont look overly detailed and while they are videogame quality thats only a plus the characters all have truetogame appearances going by the modern games and we see a lot of little references the settings are amazing i love the packed feeling of mushroom kingdom and how it feels like a very walkable city in contrast kong island is very much a kart city but its design is so fresh and interesting and very tropical to boot bowsers castle is of course menacing which most certainly suits the area though now i wonder whats going on with that castle in the dark lands i feel like we couldve explored more islands but that can probably wait for a sequel and of course brooklyn is great i love the scene near the beginning where mario and luigi run through a construction site and the many references it has especially the castle fast food generally the beginning of the movie is great i like how its set up the only thing i dont like much is luigi and the dog madness it feels a little bit hamfisted so to say but every plot needs some kind of inciting incident kinda wish we got to see what happened to the water main though  id write more but i think ive made most of my thoughts pretty clear though theres a lot of reviews in i just wanted to add my two cents as i did have a lot of thoughts on this movie which is better than a movie where i have no thoughts at all afterwards
May 18 2023,positive,i was 5 years old when the super mario bros game was released on the nintendo but i wouldnt get to play it until i turned 10 and received an incredible christmas present that year     this movie is pure nostalgia souped up with modern visuals a peppy upbeat soundtrack and a stellar voice cast part of me said it was just appealing to my fondest memories of when i was a child but the vast majority of my brain said be quiet and enjoy the popcorn because were watching this movie    now i havent played all of the mario games but the nes snes and n64 versions are all familiar territory for me so i had a blast pointing at the screen and narrating to myself each character as they appeared on screen    the movie had lots of sweet humor positivity fun little in jokes for all of the nintendo fans out there and it really felt like everyone involved in the production really wanted a fun time to be had by all well i had fun and it was worth every second     wahoo    ps time like hope is an illusion
May 18 2023,positive,a must see definitely will have a good time type of movie for anyone whos touched the nintendo classics with a 58 critic score and a 96 audience score seems like critics need to sit back and relax a bit more eat a blue shroom critics
May 18 2023,positive,id give this movie nine stars if i could i would recommend hopefully mario meets sonic at some in a future title gotta jumpstart that rivalry somehow 
May 18 2023,positive,it was very good  everyone remember to watch the bit after the credits
May 18 2023,positive,the movie may be a little too short for its runtime and too fastpaced for my liking but this fun actionpacked video game adaptation will not disappoint fans of the games and some newcomers too
May 18 2023,positive,delightful how do you create a plot for a series that doesnt really have a plot they gave us fan service and a fun summer movie great
May 18 2023,positive,i will buy this on bluray4k
May 18 2023,positive,great movie and i hope they release a second one ill be buying it once it releases on blu ray
May 18 2023,negative,i disliked that the movie was in spanish and when i got there the theater manager had to tell me this happens all the time fandango fails to put in the normal writing its super tiny   i wasnt happy nor my little ones so never got to see itperhaps you should put that in bold writing for all to see when purchasing tickets
May 18 2023,positive,this was the perfect piece of nostalgia for someone who grew up playing the mario bros games it was a great piece of fan service with plenty of easter eggs
May 17 2023,positive,amazing movie a real tribute for the videogame
May 17 2023,positive,absolutely did not fail   everybody delivered  superbly entertaining with a tiest of comedy   absolute must see

May 17 2023,positive,nostalgia at its best loved it
May 17 2023,positive,really liked the movie very funny didnt care for the depressive ghost cant wait for part 2 if they decide to make one
May 17 2023,positive,this movie is an approvement over the 1993 version and ill be excited for a sequel so fuck the critics and fuck john leguizamo
May 17 2023,positive,very entertaining recommend to all parents with childrens to see movie as family very silly and fun
May 17 2023,positive,loses half a star because at times your suddenly realize your watching a movie for 5 year olds
May 17 2023,positive,a beautiful movie with a treat to bring back the nostalgia

May 17 2023,negative,the experience felt like going to a friends house to watch them play a video game for 90 minutes
May 17 2023,positive,so so many people talk the amazing performance for charlie day and jack black these are all 100 true however a lack of good story and a bad performances bring down the film the worst performance in my opinion and i know its unpopular anya taylor joys performance i took me 2 tries to get through the film and her bad performance

May 17 2023,positive,an incredible movie the truth is that i will see it as many times as necessary the animation is spectacular the story is unique and all those references no matter how small are beautiful without a doubt this movie is aimed at those of us who grew up with mario bros   and the truth is that those who criticize this movie do not know nor do they know what it is about and they have never touched a single game of this incredible character so progress to screw disney do not stick your nose where you are not called

May 17 2023,positive,this was such a sweet cute and fun movie my only complaint was the casting of donkey kong instead of playing up donkey kong rogen played himself jack black is way more iconic imo than rogen but i honestly forgot bowser was voiced by him because he wasnt acting like jack black he was acting like bowser
May 17 2023,positive,best adaptation of the franchise yet the director took bold risks while playing homage to the video game series the character development the story and giving the fans what they were looking for is is exactly what we wanted

May 17 2023,positive,1010 would definitely recommend
May 17 2023,positive,another movie to prove that chris pratt is a sure thing when it comes to box office block busters
May 17 2023,positive,the movie had a very quick pacing and in some aspects more action than plot maybe they could add some 20 minutes more for the movie outside of that the movie fulfills all expectations i had for it fun to watch and a simple plot that makes it easy to keep up
May 17 2023,positive,does anybody else has peaches stuck in their heads hahaha what a fantastic film for someone who grew up playing all the super mario games this film was nostalgic at its best it had so many incredible references to the games and characters we loved it take the kids and enjoy this piece of childhood now i want to play some super mario 3 my favorite

May 17 2023,positive,the best animated movie of 2023
May 16 2023,positive,this was a fun family movie  however i would have preferred the movie take more influence from nintendo illumination definitely had bulletin points to reference the games stories and jokes but its easy to see direction wasnt inspired by the series nonetheless im excited for a sequel along with many other nintendo great ips hitting the big screen
May 16 2023,negative,pretty overrated the plot was boring and predictable if you played the games there was a lot of talking which was boring would recommend to kids
May 16 2023,positive,such an amazing movie    especially the voice of the villan jack black really knkw how to portray bowserking loops      also so many diffrent refrences to keep an eye out for

May 16 2023,positive,great stuff my daughter my wife and i all loved it it is not trying to be a masterpiece it is what it is and it is well put together    the only downside i could see is the very limited protagonism of one of the titular brothers luigi
May 16 2023,negative,i was disappointed
May 16 2023,positive,this movie delivers exactly what youd expect and even more from a full on super mario brothers movie    i was really intrigued when this movie was announced back then as to how they would create and build an engaging narrative and world around the super mario brothers game that is suitable for both the viewers and gamers and they did it exceptionally well taking into consideration how minor and small the plot actual plot and lore of the whole game    what it also does well is fan servicing the gamers by doing small nods to different genres and games in the world of super mario like mario kart luiges mansion etc    voice casting for all characters was great especially jack black as bowser and seth rogen as donkey kong    the only thing that i was a bit confused about is the unnecessary change in plot regarding princess peach and luige as they made the captive of this movie is luige instead of the princess for some reason     animation was phenomenal and all in all the movie was a lot of fun it this is how it should be taken and received
May 16 2023,positive,my whole family and i loved this show  so much fun
May 16 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a fun ride through the iconic world of mario the screenplay is admittedly very bare bones and the characters lack depth but the film still manages to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise the writers do not attempt to do anything beyond create a narrative that intentionally puts our characters in worlds and areas that are instantly recognizable to the audience this makes the film feel like a mario game come to life so that audiences can say that is like mario kart or super smash bros the movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed and i felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit more    i was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up but i was pleasantly surprised chris pratts voice as mario is not over the top which works well it would have been extremely annoying to hear the super italian mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes jack blacks portrayal of bowser steals the show and was the best of the film anna taylor joy and seth rogan were good as princess peach and donkey kong although i think rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the character    the direction of the film is solid with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic the animation is stunning with the characters and world directly designed off the games but with more polish and details than ever before the lighting is beautiful with the bright lights of rainbow road and the dark fiery flames of bowser standing out as highlights    overall the super mario bros movie may not be the deepest or most complex film but it is a good time for fans of the mario franchise the movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen while the comedy may not hit every mark the voice acting and direction make up for it i am excited to see where this film series goes next    score 72  verdict good
May 16 2023,positive,perfect video game movie
May 16 2023,positive,great movie fun for everyone in the family and beautifully made this is now my sons favorite movie
May 16 2023,positive,i personally dont think its as good as the nintendo fans make it out to be    but its certainly not as bad as the some crazy critics make it out to be either     overall in my eyes its a pretty good movie would have enjoyed it   more hadnt the movie felt it it   was jamming a 2 hour film into a 90 minute minute film amongst other problems     but overall pretty good film
May 16 2023,positive,a fun movie for the kids and there was a lot of retro references in there for parents who played the games in their youth
May 16 2023,positive,peach peach peach peach
May 16 2023,positive,awesome a lot of fun plus great balance of characters
May 16 2023,positive,the references the plot the sound effects the overall animation  literally everything was perfect  wholesome     only problem for me was i couldnt really hear mario i could only hear chris pratt except that definitely 455
May 16 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic it was fun entertaining and unstained from any current agendas being pushed down peoples faces just a good old entertaining film for everyone
May 16 2023,positive,a movie that is worth watching

May 16 2023,positive,this is a good picture quality
May 16 2023,positive,i am not a fan of mario bros and i greatly underestimated its potential where i vaguely remember that i only played mario cars on my cousins wii but the experience in the cinema of this film made me have a moment of happiness and entertainment where we left the worries of the world and just let ourselves be carried away by the fantasy adventure and magic of that time of consoles that i could never touch my score 46 out of 5 deserved your billion
May 16 2023,positive,able to bring up childhood memories of playing mario bros games
May 16 2023,positive,fun movie with a good story the scenes that were shot as a scrolling 2d game were well played
May 16 2023,positive,chris pratt performance was amazing
May 16 2023,positive,it was a great movie made for everyone nintendo lovers gamers or not it was just enjoyble and time flew by while viewing the movie really recommend to have a great time the comedy was chef kiss the only thing that bothered me was princess peach i love her and ann taylor joy fainted they both are my type of girl i want to be but i finded they gave peach a mrs marvel treatment like they didnt need to go all i dont need no man kinda deal but its just the main image i grew up of peach was of like she can kick butt but she humble so that was the only thing that bothered me but not enought that made hate the movie all together it was greatly animated and the comedy again thumbs up side note the message of mario of not giving your self up as the person you are and your beliefs is a beautiful message for any age

May 15 2023,positive,personally i think its an amazing movie there are a lot of fun and great easter eggs the story is great the music is mostly just remixed mario music but the songs were already amazing so the remixes fit because they are already reusing song in theregular mario games and they are good just like the movie warning if youre not a strong mario fan then the film may not seem so great
May 15 2023,positive,pretty good great animation
May 15 2023,positive,this movie is amazing the characters are fun the plot is thin but nice its funny and there are a butt load of easter eggs for people who play a lot of the games like me  i am buying it as soon as it comes out on dvd and bluray defiantly worth your time

May 15 2023,negative,a thinly plotted movie with its entire runtime mostly easter eggs and references the only thing good going for it is its animation
May 15 2023,positive,best movie ever i dont care what the critics have to say about the movie it was amazing go watch it now and stay tuned to the very ending credits for a surprise 10000000000000000000000000010  plus its 6623 if you want the dvd gesas what the dvd is out now get it now before they are sold out
May 15 2023,positive,i wanted to love this movie the animation is spectacular the script was terrible the character development had so much potential but was forced the storyline was boring i liked the attempt to incorporate so much from the games but worst of all it wasnt funny i expected a lot of laughs and clever jokes similar to despicable me  i dont think i heard a single audible laugh in the theater the only character with a likable and possibly comedic personality was donkey kong this movie had so much potential to be epic
May 15 2023,positive,compared to the abombination that the first movie was this is a damn godsend its quite a eye tackler with how much is going on per scene the score is absolutely fantastic the story is a bit on the lackluster side i can admit voice actors are all solid except cranky he just felt you know there the animation is great and so are the references 99 sure theres over 100 references   watch this not the 1993 abombination

May 15 2023,positive,great movie to take the kids to did a great job combining elements of all the games managed to avoid most of the hollywood tropes of the 2020s and showed respect for the characters we know and love the low critic score can only be explained by the general uselessness of most critics today
May 15 2023,positive,great show it brought in all phases of mario over the years enjoyable i recommend it
May 15 2023,positive,great movie to take your kids to see jack black killed it as bowser
May 15 2023,neutral,the first part was enjoyable however by the final battle my whole family was with their phones in hand scrolling through social media    its an average movie with some jokes that landed and good music altho it doesnt have anything refreshing writing wise it gives you exactly what one would expect from a video game franchise a ton of references    i have no idea why the critics were so hard on this movie its as insipid as a movie but what else could you expect from something based on a videogame of jumping plumbers
May 15 2023,positive,loved this movie great fun action healthy for the family
May 15 2023,positive,i wish there more depth in the characters especially luigi but such a cute and nostalgic movie it kept a smile on my face

May 15 2023,positive,wonderful loved every second of it
May 15 2023,positive,an excellent movie with great animation and a very good plot the only thing i didnt like is that they condensed the story a lot since it should have been a trilogy so as not to understand the plot a lot but in summary it is a movie that fulfilled my expectations
May 15 2023,positive,its not a cinematically perfect movie a simple premise but thats because its made for fans of the franchise  references in each frame easy to understand and enjoy
May 14 2023,positive,i loved this movie it was so good
May 14 2023,positive,if youre looking for a movie adapted from a video game this would be one to see  the super mario bros movie 2023 truly delivers d  another great film from illumination and universal

May 14 2023,positive,this movie was a blast for fans of the franchise with plenty of easter eggs and cameos to enjoy the voice acting and music were both solid and the story was easy to follow however this movie is not for the casual viewer as it caters heavily to fans of the video games overall a really fun watch

May 14 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing for mario fans it had just about everything you needed the plot is surprisingly better than expected for what they could pull off for a mario story one issue that can be brough upon this film is the pacing everything moves faster than a hedgehog while to some that can mean that there is never a dull moment in the movie but to others that can mean that there is not enough establishing scenes to compliment this fantastic world building done by nintendo and illumination definitely a must watch for any mario fan and video game fan out there
May 14 2023,positive,a rare familyfriendly movie from hollywood these days hats off to nintendo for sticking to the source material and making a movie tailored for the actual fans of game

May 14 2023,positive,it was a fun time soo many references from the game bowsers song was great
May 14 2023,positive,pretty funny and very good cast
May 14 2023,positive,this movie was literally perfect in every way although my only criticisms are its short run time and some of the licensed music that was used however it absolutely makes up for it with a great score by brian tyler magnificent performances by the cast some nice comedy thrown into the mix and loads of action this movie in my opinion is probably illuminations best film to date and is also their most visually stunning movie so far even though illuminations a hit or miss studio most of the time i think nintendo made the right move when it came to partnering with them for the most part all the easter eggs scattered about throughout the film also managed to put a smile on my face overall this movie is everything my inner child wanted and is far more better than the 1993 mario movie in every way 1010 would watch it over and over again until the day i die blew all of my expectations out of the water
May 14 2023,positive,i loved it so did my son
May 14 2023,positive,great kids movie with insane amounts of fan service for old time fans and new ones

May 13 2023,positive,would watch it again amazing
May 13 2023,positive,with spoilers the film made me feel an emotion that i havent felt in a long time all the references all the soundtracks and the musicpeache its wonderful the film manages to organize the villain comedy horror and action the film is a work of art
May 13 2023,positive,im not a disney fan and i absolutely loved this movie i understand that i must have a certain bias given that im part of the generation that grew playing mario but this movie is entertaining funny that makes you feel good during the entire session graphics are amazing and the subtle references to the videogame just makes this an absolutely mustsee within its category i also liked that disney keep it as 100 suitable to the young audience yet it was not too childish neither forcing any adultjokes that kids would not understand honestly it has been a long time since i last saw such an amazing adaptation
May 13 2023,positive,great movie if you are a fan of mario you will love this
May 13 2023,positive,i was expecting more like shrek humor and this was way more kiddy considering this game has been around since the 80s i woulda thought it would have been more like that for us adults so for what it is a kids movie its fine
May 13 2023,positive,fantastic film to see with the kids there are tons of nostalgic songs and moments for parents who grew up with super mario bros  i recommend it 100
May 13 2023,positive,i basically only went to bring my 8yr old and 14yr old grandsons they loved it i didnt get most of the references but it was still an enjoyable experience
May 13 2023,negative,feels like a lot of illuminations films    plotless good music great voice overs    not many memorable scenes if your up for a lot of easter eggs beautiful animation or just get your kids off your back for 90 mins this film is great if you tell me to recall 1 scene from this film 1 year from now i will 100 forget everything i just saw
May 13 2023,positive,while not being the most complex and inventive story of all time the super mario bros provides a fantastic time at the movies all of the voice actors do an incredible job bringing their characters to life while also modernizing them the lot of cool references and easter eggs for eagle eyed viewers was a nice addition the animations is stellar and if this is any indication of what illumination has planned for its nintndo cinematic universe if you will im all here for it 
May 13 2023,positive,it was super cute they incorporated many mario games it was awesome
May 13 2023,positive,the mario movie isnt that good but it isnt horrible the plot does close up after the 1 hour mark avd some scenes feel rushed but overall its pretty ok
May 13 2023,positive,super mario is a very well known franchise and nintendo has taken it up and down throughout the years this movie has very fun call backs to the game and it is a good watch especially jack black singing peaches but the rushed story and lack of character development or originality leaves you wondering if this is what we should be expecting of cinema lately instead of new and rich material
May 13 2023,positive,fun movie and stayed true with the games
May 13 2023,negative,i hate the movie waste of time

May 13 2023,negative,bowser was too intense and a lot of hateful content a lot of the story line was weird and not well thought out
May 13 2023,positive,its a kids mario movie top critics were obviously expecting the shawshanks redemption    impressive first movie for this new mario franchise the comedy was good the characters were likable specially lumalee the nihilistic blue flame in the dungeon who was hilarious     as far as video game adaptations go it was quite good
May 13 2023,positive,excellent for all 30 years old people who grow with the games

May 13 2023,positive,for fans of the franchise new and old alike the story is ok some of it doesnt make sense but  its really a kids movie so it doesnt need to if you have kids or are a super fan go watch
May 13 2023,positive,this movie is the concept of fast paced and tbh i was expecting some emotional stuff in here i also think the final battle could have been better but i understand the hype for this movie the graphics were great princess peach wasnt a lazy woman who needed to be saved and of course bowser was amazing
May 13 2023,negative,nice animation nice references terrible everything else

May 13 2023,positive,overall its a good movie but for me it feelt like one of those 30 minute animated movies on youtube because theres never a dull moment for little children thats good and itll keep them still during the hole movie but for teens and adults thats not the best especially if you what to refill a drink or go to the bathroom because you miss very important parts of the movie but still overall its great movie and a good experience for all and i do recommend ive all ready put this on google

May 12 2023,positive,took my kids and we love it
May 12 2023,positive,great movie great cast great story
May 12 2023,positive,this is a fun time i must say that voice acting can be a bit distracting as all i can hear is the famous actors voices jack black is the stand out great performance as browser but all i could hear is jack black
May 12 2023,positive,its good and has nice fan service and callbacks to the games and previous adaptations but it went a bit off course making peach a total independent woman i  think it would have been better as her being headstrong and loyal to her people but not totally super heroine with the extreme show of skills but it mainly had that one scene where she demonstrates this and the rest is her leading mario to kong kingdom then being kidnapped i dont understand why only the kongs had the karts
May 12 2023,positive,such a great family film all of the kids we went with had a blast and so did the adults the soundtrack is awesome as well
May 12 2023,positive,its a simple fun funny movie for all ages get some popcorn and enjoy

May 12 2023,positive,great movie just a fun adventure that doesnt have agendas behind it besides being loyal to the games my kids absolutely loved it good job illumination
May 12 2023,positive,good enough ill probably have to rewatch it with my son at some point and i wont hate it jack black is awesome but the rest was forgettable i was hoping for way more nintendo cameos
May 12 2023,positive,it was the greatest movie ever i just watched it in theaters today and it was awesome you must watch this awesome movie
May 12 2023,negative,great animation fun voice acting not funny at all

May 12 2023,positive,i liked it but princess peach looks too hot and toad looks like he poops into his pants and doesnt clean them
May 12 2023,positive,it was an epic movie
May 12 2023,positive,finally something great to have fun nowadays
May 12 2023,positive,i saw it at richland cinemas in 3d on april 10th 2023
May 12 2023,positive,the critics played super mario so they dont know that something simple is very good nintendo has a very good intellectual content for movies who else comes 
May 12 2023,positive,it was pretty good a whole bunch of rizz in the movie was overpowered 
May 12 2023,positive,it was pure nostalgia comedy and full with witty action i enjoyed it quite well i think the graphics looked stunning the story was good and i liked how they separated the human world from the fantasy islands all the voice actors were amazing for their matching characters but chris pratts mario voice was kind of not true to the character so it felt a bit out of place overall it was a good movie
May 12 2023,positive,very good i just missed the ending i wished it was a bit longer overall was great
May 12 2023,positive,a fun and wholesome watch for people of all ages
May 12 2023,positive,amazing saw it with the kids good times
May 12 2023,positive,i watched it twice and fell asleep both times
May 12 2023,positive,seen it twice now and my kids and i absolutely loved it the art style is fantastic and perfectly fitting for the story the music is beautifully nostalgic and the characters are well crafted i found myself truly rooting for the heroes excellent choice of voice actors
May 12 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches i wuvvvvvv ya ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
May 12 2023,positive,if you grew up playing nintendo this be the perfect movie for you i enjoyed all the references and the plot
May 12 2023,positive,it was a very cute movie
May 12 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is the best videogames movie the movie has a lot of references to the videogames
May 12 2023,positive,i brought my 8yearold son to watch mario bros and we loved the movie i played a lot mario when i have his age
May 12 2023,positive,perfect movie if theres only thing to know is that there are so many references so many references that you might want to watch more than once to get them all a lot of the scenes in the movie makes you feel like youre playing the games themselves oh yeah stick at the post credits for a sequel hook
May 11 2023,positive,the movie did a great job balancing between nostalgia for us adults who played and grew up with these characters and making it fresh for the younger audience for welcome them into that world worth watching spoiler alert i was one of those people skeptical because of the voice casting but they broke the 4th wall a few times having fun with it and it compensated for it the initial criticism well done everyone involved in making this movie happen
May 11 2023,positive,no spoilers in this review the mario movie is a colorful animated video game movie chris pratt is perfect for the voice of mario and the cast is just great i feel like there could of just been a little bit more storyline in this movie like maybe a mario backstory but overall the mario movie is a must see for any video game or movie fan
May 11 2023,positive,must see for all familys
May 11 2023,positive,great movie  they really nailed the nostalgia in a way that seems natural and fun and just a really enjoyable story  i also love that they created a strong female character in peach without coming across as pandering or overbearing as seems to be the norm these days
May 11 2023,positive,finaly  a good movie is what we needed    also jack black as bowser is perfect
May 11 2023,positive,this animated movie by illumination is the greatest one of the animations that i have ever seen i mean that mario princess peach and their allies help them rescue marios brother luigi from the koopa castle of bowser  princess peach trained mario to glory may be different but it was inspired by nintendos iconic game of the same name i would watch it again if i have to
May 11 2023,positive,great movie for your inner nerd the plot is perfect for a movie based on a game
May 11 2023,negative,good movie but now my house is sticky because of princess peach
May 11 2023,positive,the new mario movie is a blast i loved seeing my favorite characters come to life on the big screen with amazing voice acting and animation the story was fun and exciting with plenty of humor and action it was a nostalgic trip down memory lane but also a fresh and modern take on the classic video game i highly recommend this movie to all mario fans and anyone who enjoys a good adventure comedy its one of the best movies of the year
May 11 2023,positive,so good just so good not sure what the critics were on you will find at least 100 references in this movie and you dont need any past mario experience to enjoy it but if youre a nerd like me you will enjoy understanding all the references while the plot is thinner than paper that wont stop you from enjoying it the cast was perfection lots of drama about chris pratt but you could barely tell a difference bowser sings nothing more to ask for but more movies seriously i need at least two more movies plus luigi and donkey kong spinoffs oh and maybe a paper mario trilogy
May 11 2023,positive,it was a great movie it would have been fun to see more characters but the story was fun and felt like it could have been a mario game
May 11 2023,positive,hes a good film hes realistic ultra
May 11 2023,positive,the graphic effects were great but i spected a better history for the movie if you like nintendos videogames you easily undestand but if you doesnt like or know them it cost little bit hard undestando whats going on
May 11 2023,positive,fun movie its great for both kids and adults jam packed with nintendo game references so youll love finding them
May 11 2023,positive,it was a great movie something to bring the family too for me it was fun watching the movie and trying to remember which mario game those characters or scenes were from one two or three for my little one she was just laughing and happy nothing pushed up on us nothing forced down clean good movie
May 11 2023,positive,honestly a great animated movie overall and a great kids movie

May 11 2023,positive,love it was worried how simple the movie would be since its based on old legendary game but then scared they would take it too far just to make a movie from a game to be too deep but then bam simple is more indeed love how its just a simple story for family that could be digested easily by kids and made old fans happy af i enjoyed every second of it my 15 yo niece even knew all the references i was so excited seeing yoshi almost disappointed cus he wasnt in the story but now so excited for the next movie after the post credit scene watched it twice and still want to watch again

May 10 2023,negative,really disappointed i was expecting much more after the success in theatres  honestly apart from the good animation theres not that much to be wowed by
May 10 2023,positive,because it is colorful funny and amazing how nintendo and illumination put effort into making this movie me and my family love it and one of them thinks this explains mario and luigis origin in how they became the heroes known in video gaming
May 10 2023,positive,it has a shallow plot and cardboard characters but its still fun enjoyable and funny i had plenty of fun with my family watching this movie and thats enough to give it a 355

May 10 2023,positive,a great fun filled adventure full of vibrant colours and catchy music  theres a bit of everything in it  smash bros karting old and new school platforming and plenty of other marionintendo tidbits for nostalgia  the storys pretty much as you would expect but the performances are great theres plenty of humour and action to keep you entertained and even some character development and a moral message  really enjoyed it and any fan of mario old or new should give it a go
May 10 2023,positive,great movie great characters full of lots of easter eggs inside and outside of the mario franchise though the plot felt a teensy bit rushed it didnt make it a terrible movie at all and i cant wait to see where they take this movies story next  i really hope this movies success leads to other nintendo ips being adapted to movies like zelda or earthbound
May 10 2023,positive,a good movie that presents the super mario game series in a very respectable way i recommend it to anyone who has played the games in this series    oh were the mario brothers and plumbings our game  were not like the others who get all the fame  when your sink is in trouble you can call us on the double  were faster than the others youll be hooked on the brothers uh  hohohooked on the brothers  yeahyeahyeahyeah yeahyeahyeahyeah  yo youre in for a treat so hang on to your seat  get ready for adventure and remarkable feats  youll meet koopas the troopas the princess and the others  hangin with the brothers youll be hooked on the brothers  to the bridge  uh uh  i said hohohohooked on the brothers  the brothers the brothers the brothers the brothers
May 10 2023,positive,the movie is excelent i watched the movie in the cinema and it was pretty excelent  all my family love it and mmy friends the movie is very very good  but the only thing that i dont like is that is very short but without that is perfect for me and illumination and nintendo they went too far with this movie because its the best movie ive seen so far and if nintendo or someone whatch this congratulations
May 10 2023,positive,i think it was great as it had a tonne of easter eggs and great music however it felt a little drawn out and missed the sand kingdom referenced on the maps
May 10 2023,positive,good movie but better than sonic
May 10 2023,positive,it was a really good movie ive been a nintendo fan almost my whole life and its one of my favorite movies so what if the pacing is fast its still an amazing movie
May 10 2023,positive,great watch for a family movie it set out with intent on creating a fun adventure movie and thats what it did also there was a solid story line without a dragged out ending like most movies nowadays
May 10 2023,positive,my like the movie super mario bros is entreniment is who play the videogame
May 10 2023,positive,one of the best animated movies in existence best adaptation of a videogame ever made very enjoyable and colorful a movie for all ages
May 10 2023,positive,id score it 65 if i could i liked it  if you like mario youll probably like it too if you dont this movie wont have much in it for you    the movie was cute and charming and had a good pace at the beginning i loved seeing mario and luigis life in brooklyn and the dynamic of two loyal brothers against a doubting world when mario got to the castle though things started to move a bit too quickly and a lot of the movie from then on felt like a commercial trying to pack in as much new super mario brothers and mario kart gameplay references as they could honestly it was the direct mentions to powerups and karts that made me consciously lower my expectations for the rest of the movie because of how shameless they felt i think those elements could have been integrated more organically or even just not acknowledged verbatim  jack black as bowser absolutely stole the show in fact i loved all the characters the ways they chose to personify them such as bowser as a selfconscious rock star and luigi as the ultimate loyal little brother even in cowardice and the ways the characters interacted with one another was really fun the plot itself was just so very bare bones or should i say dry bones the movie also felt a little short i wanted to see more    re music the inclusion of orchestrated versions of the video game music felt sloppy which was frankly exactly what i expected from the trailers so for me at least it circled back around to being funny again it felt like something an excited fanfiction author would include were they given the chance the original songs like the mario bros commercial rap and bowsers song were wonderful the animation was also gorgeous    in the end i came in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the occasional heart i saw and fun i had though it helped that my best friend was sitting next to me sometimes you laugh with the movie sometimes you roll your eyes and laugh at it   the direct product references and relatively rushedsimplistic plot are just things youll have to forgive to enjoy the fun character interractions performances and set pieces nothing deep but a fun time
May 10 2023,positive,it was really well done the animation was incredible and the story line wasnt too cheesy 1010 would see again
May 10 2023,positive,in a time when it seems that all movies have to have some kind of not so well hidden messages this is just a good movie well put together catchy music funny and a good overarching story well worth the watch
May 10 2023,positive,awesome movie did an amazing job sticking to the video game roots
May 10 2023,positive,great great movie audio quality was disappointing both in theaters and at home  love the moxie otherwise great nostalgia
May 10 2023,positive,loved it all disney needs to heed
May 10 2023,positive,ill admit i had extremely low expectations for this movie but when i actually watched it i couldnt believe illumination of all people made it the movie looks gorgeous as an artist i genuinely love the style of everything the plot was fairly simple and nothing too deep which i could care less about as long as its enjoyable its a movie the whole reason im watching it is to be entertained and by gods this movie did not fail me there this movie was very fun to watch it got me excited for the mario franchise and inspired me to make fanart as for voice acting i get that celebrity voice actors always win over going for fighting voice talent as much as i ragged on chris pratt getting cast to play mario i almost dont want to admit that it wasnt that bad i had no issues with the voice acting like i thought i would though oddly enough it was peachs voice that took some getting used to she did an amazing job voicing peach but it was somehow the most jarring change to me another thing the amount of references to things that have happened over the years this movie feels like a love letter i cant express enough that i genuinely enjoyed this movie it was more entertaining than i wouldve expected also managed to not make my face cringe up with some illfitting pop culture references
May 10 2023,positive,the movie of our era    at last a family friendly movie well orchestrated great soundtrack  charismatic characters
May 10 2023,positive,amazing only one problem the song is a tiny bit cheesy but overall its amazing loved it critics are crazy for giving a 59 persent just crazy
May 10 2023,positive,a fresh history with good development  of characters and references to the universe of the games by nintendo
May 10 2023,positive,i liked princess peach
May 10 2023,positive,too good really had nostalgic moments in the movie that made me feel like i was playing all the games like mario kart donkey kong mario 3d it was really good and would recommend to everyone
May 10 2023,positive,one of the best movie i have watched
May 10 2023,negative,it was so hot in theater 11 you could hardly breathe in there im very unhappy because me and my family was unable to enjoy the movie due to the heat
May 10 2023,positive,it was alright perfectly fine but not too special things happen and they happen fast shallow but perfect for a casual audience horrible paced and a prime example of a wiki reference movie this movie was engineered to foster buzz on the internet this is the future we wanted i guess peachs depiction was boring bowsers shoulders seemed off model
May 10 2023,positive,entertaining and fun the score was awesome
May 10 2023,positive,it was a really fun time
May 10 2023,positive,the mario bross movie fulfilled its function which is to entertain to the public while being faithful to the original history of video games without  situations forcing 
May 10 2023,positive,very funny and enjoyable movie i normally wouldnt go to a movie like this as i am neaarly 70 yo however i watched a number of youtube reviews that gave it high marks and i agree the big surprise is that i think my wife liked it even more than i and she grew up in china so there are things about american culture she doesnt understand however she was laughing and giggling out loud throughout the film  i would recommend this film to anyone of any age
May 10 2023,negative,definitely made only for kids and the nostalgia wasnt good enough to keep me interested 
May 10 2023,positive,i enjoyed all the nostalgic moments throughout the movie overall it was a fun movie

May 10 2023,positive,this movie was amasing easter eggs every
May 10 2023,positive,i was a bit skeptical how pratt would play mario  an italian he crushed it and the plot was superb and not what i was expecting first movie i brought my kid to he was enthralled
May 10 2023,positive,the mario movie is a must see it is very good and super nostalgic
May 10 2023,positive,could have been way better jack black as bowser was the best part of the movie
May 10 2023,positive,was really good something anyone could enjoy
May 9 2023,positive,pure nintendo joyous fun the kids in the cinema were buzzing
May 9 2023,positive,kids loudly cheering and adults as well enjoying a classic movie together says it all
May 9 2023,positive,surpassed expectations really good movie fun for the kids and parents alike would recommend this film to everyone some people have made a deal of the voice of mario to me it just sounded like christ pratt doing an italianamerican accent
May 9 2023,positive,full of great characters and combines the different games pretty well my only complaints are the movie is too short and luigi needed more screen time
May 9 2023,positive,it was a pretty fun adventure the only real gripes i have are with the pop songs injected into some parts i also think while shes a more active character peach still feels very onenote but the voice talent is great the world was vibrant and beautiful and bowser is definitely the best character
May 9 2023,positive, thisisgreat 
May 9 2023,positive,the mario movie was the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life chris pratt did amazing voicing the iconic character and luigi also bowser was done perfectly and the song peaches had become an internet meme i have played mario games in the past and this movie is really good i recommend you watching the movie and i promise you you will like it 
May 9 2023,positive,great movie enjoyed everything about it
May 9 2023,positive,i have been a lifelong fan of super mario and when i saw this movie it absolutely blew my mind if you were looking for a good video game adaptation i would recommend this if you and a friend were planning a movie night 55
May 9 2023,positive,its mario what else can i say
May 9 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches peaches peeeaches
May 9 2023,positive,great kids movie watched it with my daughter and loved it
May 9 2023,positive,wasnt bad but had some questionable scenes
May 9 2023,positive,amazing we all loved the entire story i hope they can come up with princess peaches story now  that would be lovely 
May 9 2023,positive,a good 90min ride that takes you back to the games and also expands a little on the story the story is simple but to the point great pop corn flick
May 9 2023,negative,i went into this with extremely low expectations and was still thoroughly let down the cast of characters were all dull and boring at best and absolutely insufferable at worst the animation felt off at points with characters like peach and cranky kong being extremely offputting to look at the only thing this movie did well was references but it isnt hard to put mario iconography into a mario movie nor does it justify the rest of the terrible choices made throughout
May 9 2023,positive,brings back so many memories playing super mario bros in a nintendo lol
May 9 2023,positive,it is what you expect from a mario movie very well done nintendo
May 9 2023,positive,too long and drawn out at the ending i liked the characters
May 9 2023,positive,a fun lighthearted take on mario way better then the live action film lots of easter eggs for those who grew up with nintendo but also enjoyable for those who didnt
May 9 2023,positive,its a fun kids movie there are also enough easter eggs to keep the adults entertained who have played the video games over the years
May 9 2023,positive,this movie was awesome the voice actors were amazing and the music was great i love this movie it is by far my favorite movie i have ever watched the pacing was a little rushed but that is exceptional because of how short this movie was but still being a great movie i would recommend to watch this movie
May 9 2023,positive,it was a cute little movie i wouldnt pay to watch it again but id turn it on if it happened to be on tv i really liked the animation style especially how the mushrooms were drawn and animated not the toads but the actual mushrooms the plot felt a little fast at some points but was cohesive overall also a majority of the voice cast left a lot to be desired but kevin michael richardson as kamek was certainly a standout performance jack black was amazing as well though i do wish his performance as bowser leaned a bit more monstrous
May 9 2023,positive,one of the best movies especially for your kids or if you are a mario fan would definitely recommend  if i could rate out of 100 it would 9799100
May 9 2023,negative,i love mario i think that mario games are overall a masterclass in terms of game design and the whole platforming genre    that said this is a bad movie bad writing bad acting and a contrived story    its for the young and the youngatheart
May 9 2023,positive,it have been long time sense i seen a good move like this
May 9 2023,positive,as a life long gamer i absolutely love this movie it is truly the game come to life
May 9 2023,positive,i loved it it was so great to me
May 9 2023,positive,its a fun time all around but not the best if you want an extremely comprehensive story driven film but an absolute blast for long time nintendo fans this movie is packed full of references so many itd be a crime just to even attempt counting for a movie aimed at a younger demographic it has a further reach than aimed even making my dad burst into laughter at the theater just from the concept of jack black whos voice bowser singing about wanting to marry princess peach
May 9 2023,positive,the love story between them
May 9 2023,positive,good the movie is good
May 9 2023,positive,good movie although admittedly the plot is paper thin the amazing fun animation and mario references keep it entertaining and it makes a kind of mini game of   how many mario references can you spot hilariously fun movie that only works because of the mario ip
May 9 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic this was a banger of a movie so worth it     critics do not know what the f they are talking about
May 9 2023,positive,this movie is a nintendo fans dream with tons of easter eggs from pretty much nintendos entire history mostly mario and music that integrates tracks from a ton of mario games regardless of how wellknown they are the voice cast did a stellar job too except for cranky kong he sucked however when it comes to the general audience theres nothing thatll keep you interested the pacing is faster than 200cc mario kart so really fast characters lack interesting dynamics luigi has nothing to do all that happens in his subplot is that hes captured overalls the super mario bros movie is a great movie for nintendo fans but a pretty unremarkable movie for anyone else
May 9 2023,neutral,great movie but it needs to do better than that
May 9 2023,negative,this is not the mario i grew up with i dont need bowser singing me a ballad every 5 minutes
May 9 2023,positive,amazing movie good old moral values and full of fun nothing else love it and the music the oldies just amazing
May 9 2023,positive,it was great super nostalgic and a fantastic movie for me and my kiddos
May 9 2023,positive,is was fun i want  go see it again
May 9 2023,negative,good movie overall but the choice for marios voice actor was terrible why cant we just have the originals it literally ruined the entire movie
May 9 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies i have seen in a while however the animation is smooth music is a banger and the voice actors did a great job play on the super mario bros movie and me and my family love it was great 1110
May 9 2023,positive,good clean mariothemed fun  as a mario fan for most of my life this movie exceeded my expectations    more please
May 8 2023,positive,great movie for what it is a mario movie will it win an oscar no and it doesnt have to the critics that who poo pood on this film dont understand what the creaters set out to do which was to make people smile with an ip that everyone loves and most adults have nostalgia for its not meant to have an amazing plot what mario game ever has could there have been a better pacing and character development absolutely but at the end of the day i was smiling ear to ear and thats all that matters
May 8 2023,positive,nostalgic and memorable
May 8 2023,positive,this movie was pretty good i loved the personality of dk its how i expected him to be playing through the games although i feel like they rushed through the whole movie not giving certain scenes or things from the game enough time while watching the movie i felt something was missing also loved the peaches song and jack black did great
May 8 2023,positive,great movie whole family loved it including our 25 and 6 year old   i didnt expect much but this was awesome
May 8 2023,positive,would have been perfect but the pacing was a bit too fast but overall amazing movie
May 8 2023,positive,i love this  i waited months to this  and it was worth it  the animation was beautiful and the characters and the backgrounds look amazing  the character voices are good including jack black  plus the music is really good  both the mario and background music and the copyrighted music  like my favorite song take on me were amazing  the references were so good that i cried  even the original music  was good including peaches was a masterpiece  i honestly hate the fact that other people  hate this movie because apparently it was boring  dont listen to them  enjoy this movie 
May 8 2023,positive,pacing is bad and characters are underdeveloped but it all works just fine this is obviously a film for the fans and hits a home run in what it sets out to accomplish
May 8 2023,positive,i loved the graphicsand the music  
May 8 2023,positive,it was amazing i really enjoyed the animation
May 8 2023,positive,i love the references it is so full of references and comedy bowser is funny i love the movie if you like retro games and nostalgia i would highly recommend this to people like me
May 8 2023,positive,amazing it was actionpacked and had so many references if you are a longtime mario fan you will love this movie its music is the best way to do classic mario music highly recommend for all ages also fuck critics dont listen to them just form your opinion by watching
May 8 2023,positive,lots of nostalgia but kind cheesy which makes it go down a little
May 8 2023,positive,pacing was just a bit too fast
May 8 2023,positive,must see excelent movie donkey kong flowerpower is just awesome
May 8 2023,positive,when bowser came it felt so good
May 8 2023,positive,the story line made complete sense and felt very nostalgic
May 8 2023,positive,its an absolute blast for every generation of mario fans the story is coherent while making full use of marios fantastic and dynamic world  i couldnt have expected that many game elements references and characters to form any kind of manageable story but they pulled it off
May 8 2023,positive,it was a great film highly recomend and has great voice cast
May 8 2023,positive,this movie is revolutionary it is shocking that illumination can make an actually good movie the casting is great for starters i mean come on you know that this is gonna be a masterpiece when both chris pratt and jack black are both voicing in the same movie but the best part of this movie is by far peaches this song is literally running for an oscar award this movie is a worldwide treasure
May 8 2023,negative,boo hiss jack black and chris pratt really had to carry
May 8 2023,positive,it ive seen it twice its such a fun movie with no extra agendas its good clean fun
May 8 2023,positive,enjoyed the movie from the beginning until the end brought back childhood memories
May 8 2023,positive,this was such a fun movie i do think it was targeted at children but the jokes and little easter eggs throughout the whole film from the music to the scenery made it so enjoyable i really really enjoyed jack blacks performance and i think chris pratt did a great job the visuals were really really pretty to
May 8 2023,positive,very good movie its like the video games and its very good but it felt very short with its fast pasing but its still an amazing movie
May 8 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies of all time the animation is amazing audio is also amazing there are a few problems like the old music for no reason but everything else was so great 1010 lets see what the zelda movie and the sequel have to hold
May 8 2023,positive,it was a really good movie and brought back alot of memories when i used to play mario games i dont know what the movie critics were watching when they rated it
May 8 2023,positive,absolute fun time for the everyone and a love letter to all things super mario
May 8 2023,positive,beautiful animation simple but good story loveable characters
May 8 2023,positive,the movie was actually very good i enjoyed the mario kart scence the most it felt like a cozy nintendo experience with a mix of thr minions art style i gave it 4 instead of 5 because of the pacing and lack of charecter development but other than that i recommend it the critics who reviewed this movie judged it too harshly for a kidsteens movie
May 8 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a delightful adventure that manages to capture the spirit of the beloved nintendo games from start to finish this film is a treat for fans of all ages delivering a healthy dose of witty humour actionpacked and fantastic graphics and characters with an overall sense of whimsy that makes it impossible not to smile  one of the films biggest strengths is its ability to balance the nostalgia of the original games with its own fresh take on the mario universe fans will appreciate the references to classic mario characters and themes but of course what really sets the super mario bros movie apart is its sense of humor the film never takes itself too seriously and the result is a series of clever jokes and gags that will have both kids and adults laughing out loud whether its marios bumbling attempts to find luigi or the humorous absurdity of king koopa theres always something to chuckle at  at the same time the movie doesnt rely solely on humor to carry it through there are plenty of exciting action sequences from the battle with dk the thrilling car chase and to the climactic showdown between mario and koopa and through it all the film maintains a sense of wonder and playfulness that makes it clear this is a movie for fans of all ages  overall the super mario bros movie is a mustsee for any nintendo game fan or anyone looking for a fun familyfriendly adventure its a movie that perfectly captures the essence of mario and other nintendo games while also carving out its own unique identity and its sure to leave a smile on your face long after the credits roll
May 8 2023,positive,this is an absolute mustsee movie for kids and adults amazing graphics cute and interesting story finally something age appropriate and still enjoyable for adults at the same time and jack black as bowser just killing it the difference in the scoring between the audience and critics are totally out of touch what people really want to see and actually enjoy 5 starts are not enough for this movie

May 8 2023,positive,loved this take on a childhood favorite the characters were brought to life exactly how id always imagined the music was on point from the instrumental versions of the game themes to some classic rock that was popular when we were all playing the games easily bridged the parentchild gap in age we all loved it from age 7 to 39

May 8 2023,positive,it was pretty good but i wish the movie was a bit more slower paced and had more effort put into it but overall it was worth that money to watch it would recomend
May 8 2023,positive,this movie was really good definitely one of my favorite video game movies out there its really cluttered with with easter eggs so it stays true to the source material also the peaches song theres so much more to say but i recommend this movie

May 8 2023,negative,horrible company with adolescents without a guardian being loud and running around during the movie
May 8 2023,negative,chris pratt ruins this movie for me the longstanding voice of mario is still alive and loves his job but they went with pretty boi for marketing an absolute shame and confirms im never paying for a movie with him in it again
May 8 2023,positive,amazing it needs a sequel
May 8 2023,positive,best movie of the year
May 8 2023,positive,this was the best movie since morbius
May 8 2023,neutral,overall its a very sweet innocent and fun movie the score is super creative and peaches is hilarious not to mention chris pratt is a great mario its justthe writing was sooo underwhelming and kind of lazy i felt like every single plot point was an afterthought oh and i guess this could happen too lets throw that in there real quick seemed to be the whole plot everything was so short abrupt and inconsistent there was no effort into any obstacle in the story and no depth in the journey but it is just a kids movie so its not that important just a bit disappointing
May 8 2023,positive,this movie was a wild time for the fans like me my only con is the movie is just too short but other than that i think this a great movie
May 7 2023,positive,the movie does not have the best storyline and there are a lot of plot points and a lack of character motivations like some of the characters actions arent justified but its not bad in the slightest the movie makes it up 10x with humor and nostalgia i and the whole family loves this movie we watched it 3x so i would definitely recommend this movie to anybody they dont even need to know mario
May 7 2023,positive,i think audiences and critics are right about this one i recommend seeing it in imax its pretty amazing hoping to own the vinyl record someday for the soundtrack
May 7 2023,positive,the movie was fast paced but besides that great would recommend
May 7 2023,positive,toad and luma were hilarious   i hated bowser as a character
May 7 2023,positive,honestly i left my kids at home and went with the husband to watch lol it was a fantastic movie super funny and im glad they didnt make it super long pretty sure it was like an hour 45 which was perfect  1010 would recommend for families or any mario enthusiasts
May 7 2023,positive,thank for a wholesome movie without political agenda cursing sexual content and cultural stereotypes we enjoyed taking our grandchildren to see a decent movie but some of the trailers before the movie were not so kid friendly i had to tell my grandchildren to close their eyes thank you
May 7 2023,positive,this was the best movie for kids and adults if you like mario
May 7 2023,positive,35 star movie but an extra 5 awarded for bringing me back to that time in my childhood  sitting on the floor in my pjs mere feet away from the tv playing nintendo    this movie is so much fun very colourful  all characters done very well   laughed at least a dozen times  highly recommend

May 7 2023,positive,loved the pacing of the film seth rogen and chris pratt are amazing working off eachother and the references were phenomenal the film was too short but that is why i look forward to the next film 1010
May 7 2023,positive,i must say it was good not the best there was a bit of conical inaccuracy i am always shocked buy how much money it made

May 7 2023,positive,the story was creative with developed characters that are funny and adventurous
May 7 2023,positive,great movie for kids and adults we enjoyed a flashback to our childhood game only thing i could have went without was the entry to the movie
May 7 2023,positive,no yoshi they show a few running in the movie for literally one second then again at the end of credits they show a yoshi egg and it begins to crack as the screen goes black but idk should have been in the movie in my opinion also mario got his ass whooped by dk would have definitely lost a life lol even when he was small getting pummeled other than that it was good took forever to get going they will definitely be making another one all in all it was 710 maybe ending was pretty cool real heart warming moment for luigi
May 7 2023,positive,fun for people who grew up playing super mario brothers games and probably fun for kids too overall wreck it ralph was better for nostalgia but this had lots of memberberries plot was soso
May 7 2023,positive,honestly i really enjoyed this movie it was jampacked with references to the games and as a longtime nintendo fan it was an absolute treat lots of the negative reviews say how the characters are basic and twodimensional yet anyways its a kids movie about a video game series that has the protagonist barely say anything or interact with many other characters and yells the title at the start of the game hes not meant to be some extremely fleshedout character from an incredible saga of movies if anything this movie is just a bit of fun for the family and a great one for any fan of the franchise
May 7 2023,positive,if you like mario you were going to love this movie it has a lot of references and a good story and its fun to watch
May 7 2023,positive,this was a great movie adaptation with many openings for sequels and spin offs without trying
May 7 2023,positive,a movie that left me drowning in easter eggs yes the story might of been the same as the movie but i just thought it was a fun movie to watch and enjoy

May 7 2023,positive,hands down the best video game movie ever made like naw for real debate this you will lose best video game movie ever made
May 7 2023,positive,the movie had some nice nostalgia moments but was weak in some other regions especially when it comes to the characters nice to watch with kids or if you are a big mario fan but by far nothing revolutionary
May 7 2023,positive,this is a great movie if your a fan of mario watch it
May 7 2023,negative,sorry its just a reference fest with half a star of substance the positive response is unwarranted nothing but fanboys

May 7 2023,positive,lots of cute little nods to the og super mario bros games my toddler wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over 
May 7 2023,positive,the mario movie was an absolute treat to see in theaters if your someone who appreciates animation youll definitely enjoy the film the colors are bright and stunning you can practically see every fiber on marios hat anyone anybody who came to see this as a fan of the games wouldve absolutely come out satisfied the movie stayed honest to the source material and provided tons of fun easter eggs i came out so amazed at the riffs on classic nintendo themes and clever references the stellar voice acting and the comical spins on characters that i didnt care about the lack of depth this movie was fun and thats all it needed to be nobody came in expecting this movie to be revolutionary it was just a great time and thats what makes it a gem
May 7 2023,positive,it was a good movie for what it was and cant wait to see when the next one comes theres some things that i wouldve done different just from growing up with mario but it was good
May 7 2023,positive,i like how they made the characters this movie in my opinion taught about teamwork and working together great movie

May 7 2023,positive,good movie my daughter enjoyed it
May 7 2023,negative,it was okay just pretty basic from all the other childish movies it also felt like i was watching animated turtles fight a italian short little man that was really the plot of the movie
May 7 2023,positive,lots of fun call backs to the video games      too many licensed pop songs 
May 7 2023,positive,it has its flaws but is still really good
May 7 2023,positive,great movie loved it and had a blast i dont care what the critics say
May 7 2023,neutral,i recently watched the super mario movie and unfortunately i was disappointed as a fan of the franchise i was excited to see the characters come to life on the big screen however the plot was convoluted and lacked coherence it felt like the writers were trying to fit in as many references to the game as possible rather than focusing on creating a compelling story additionally the acting felt forced and unnatural especially from the lead actors while the visual effects were impressive they were not enough to make up for the weaknesses in the writing and acting overall i would not recommend the super mario movie to fans of the game or casual moviegoers
May 7 2023,positive,not a perfect movie but one thats been enjoyable enough to see multiple times  the critics need new jobs for scoring this film poorly  theres a huge disconnect they obviously are being paid to follow the dei forced in everything and wanted this film to fail so hard  im glade to see it succeeded it was a good fun kids film that deserves and part 2  the critics can be sticks in the mud their opinions are no longer really trustworthy or creditable anymore
May 7 2023,positive,this movie was fun very humorous and joyful loved every minute of it fun for the whole family
May 7 2023,positive,this movie is amazing i love all the super mario easter eggs the only voice acting problem i had was luigi charlie day i could watch this a 90 times and still love it  i had to crank it down a half because it was a very fast movie
May 7 2023,positive,fast paced but amazing definitely worth a watch or two screw the critics
May 7 2023,positive,this was such a great and fun movie although it did have its downsides i think its great and absolutely recomend it pdim also and huge mario fan and have been waiting so long for this movie d
May 7 2023,positive,the movie is good to entertain kids for a long time it also entertains the kids in a weirdly creative manner and helps introduce movies to young children id say it has a basic timeline if youve seen any marvel movie youll have to get used to chris pratts voice as mario its a bit funny for marvel fans but you should get used to it other than that its a fairly normal movie that doesnt suck unlike the minions movie
May 7 2023,positive,great movie my family was happy 
May 7 2023,positive,i thought the movie was pretty good it did have some flaws like why the pipe was in the sewers and how someone was literally playing donkey kong
May 7 2023,positive,it is illuminations best work and there only good one with quality references and incredible animation not only is chris pratt an amazing mario but luigi sounds perfect ignore the critic score its a must see for everyone especially at an hour and a half length
May 7 2023,positive,its fun an homage to all mario games you can see elements from all of what it is mario if you like cartoons videogames or nintendo you will love this film seeing mario and dk character interact its fun and amazing bowser is great    and the sadistic luma super fun
May 7 2023,positive,it was a great family movie

May 7 2023,positive,wahooo this was great
May 7 2023,positive,what an amazing film the best movie that ive seen in theaters in a long time its a movie that actually stays true to the source material the movie included tons of mario and other nintendo game references such a cute film for gamers it also does a fantastic job of making every scene exciting funny and moving this is a movie i could watch over and over again a must watch
May 7 2023,positive,i think the super mario movie turned out better than i would have imagined the plot was thinned and short time but it has potential to rise up to a decent and probably good movie for children and adults who grew up knowing what the franchise was all about
May 7 2023,positive,a good movie  tuns of fun for people who know and dont know mario
May 7 2023,positive,the movie was very fast paced but i get it since they had to put so many refrences into it it was very fun and flashy and loved the nostalgia mostly aimed at kids but works for older people looking for that sweet mario nostalgia
May 7 2023,positive,this the best movie i have ever seen in my life these critics do not understand the word perfect in a way to not like this masterpiece
May 7 2023,positive,very simple plot but yet entertaining and enjoyable i did leave wanting a bit more but overall i recommend it to anyone that has grown up playing the games definitely a nostalgic ride

May 7 2023,positive,this is in my top 5 favorite films give me more now
May 7 2023,positive,just saw the movie with my mom it was a blast all the references were neat jack black killed it as boswer crist prat waant as jaring as i though he would be charly day was a good luigi shame he wasnt in more seens peach isnt as bad as people say she is because she wasnt a jerk i dont know who said that the toads arent anoing for once like they said their adorable so overall ill give it 55 stars
May 7 2023,positive,this movie was a very good movie that one song peaches was well decent  it may have been full of a little too many nintendo references to sum it up it deserved the box office earnings
May 7 2023,positive,this movie was so good so original so true to the source material this movie deserves several oscars
May 7 2023,positive,solid movie all around something for everyone including easter eggs from probably every mario game ever made story line was clever and helped tie it all together again very well written and has a place for all viewers have no idea why the critics rated it so low
May 7 2023,positive,its a love letter to mario fans of all really great for the whole family pacing was a bit rushed but its still enjoyable bunch of easter eggs and cameos of past nintendo games  peaches song is still stuck in my head
May 7 2023,positive,it was ok boring during some parts

May 7 2023,positive,this movie is so fun its a definite if you like mario and want a good time
May 7 2023,positive,movie was clever i enjoyed watching this with my son remembering my own childhood playing this game
May 7 2023,positive,as always critics have zero clue what audiences enjoy fantastic move and fun watch
May 7 2023,positive,absolutely loved it me my wife and my 3 children    this is a movie made just for everyone being extra respectful of the videogames saga yes including peach as a heroine which is good enough for the younger generations to enjoy it and have fun with its good rythm and continual jokes    for the all time fans of the videogames the eye candy is just awesome bringing back the nostalgia of our wonderful childhood
May 7 2023,positive,story is hohim but thats not a bad thing here most mario games stories are basic so no fault on that on the first outing it was fine the amount of animation details sound color mario lore included and used in the foreground and background just so much going on and its great perfect movie to see in the theater with or without the kids just a fun movie that was well done as a life king mario fan back to nes original and donkey kong arcade cabinet  this gets meets the mark overall 55 or 1010 if i had to be extremely technical w a rating id give it a 45 cant wait to add this to my movie library and watch this at home in the future as well
May 7 2023,positive,great movie for all ages
May 7 2023,positive,the best film ive ever seen two twin brooklyn brothers have their plumbing commercial
May 7 2023,positive,as a dad this movie is exactly what i want for a family movie fun bright with wholesome themes and nothing political my kids loved it and are still singing peaches over two weeks after seeing the movie i wouldve loved more luigi time but im sure that will come with a sequel
May 7 2023,positive,what the critics hated i loved  not all movies need an overstretched story arc and 90 minutes of character development  sometimes its nice to just turn off your brain and enjoy something on its most basic level  this movie is exactly like the games fun
May 7 2023,positive,i think i enjoy it more than my 7yr old
May 7 2023,positive,highly recommend second time my son has watched it such a cute movie
May 7 2023,positive,the movie was great the kids loved it definitely recommend for family movie night
May 7 2023,positive,a fun movie to watch for the all family love the fact that this is a movie about mario and that he has to learn by failing a lot just like in the game   btw love jack black when he sings
May 7 2023,positive,great movie for old timers that played the game brought back interesting perspectives and gave great detail to characters in the game
May 7 2023,neutral,lots of fake reviews not for kidsparents watch it first  make your own decision     the good its funny and integrates a lot of nintendo gaming scenarios into a movie format well which provides plenty of 90s nostalgia visually well done and plenty of classic touch throughout     the bad for kids theres many moments that had me blocking their ears or cringing based on what the characters were saying its not limited to one character as each one has their moments of bad     the blue star thing thats locked away in bowsers prison is the worst though while suspended over lava this character depresses everyone around by talking death and misery in an upbeat somewhat high personality they even end the movie with a monologue by this character that had me blocking my kids ears     dont know how the writers got away with a lot of this in a kids movie or maybe this isnt a kids movie but its sure advertised to kids whoever is in charge is tapped because this stuff isnt even additive or needed
May 7 2023,positive,in a time where we cant keep kids attention for more than a few seconds this 15 hour movie had my 10yr old complaining about how short it was and you cant beat that with a bat
May 7 2023,positive,ok the harsh critics clearly never played any of the games nor watch the cartoon shows to actually enjoy this family friendly kidss movie the voice casting isnt bad i mean chris pratt brings his own to the character mario i grew up playing the games as a child of the 90s and watched the cartoon shows as well they picked new york city where our two brothers live it is the most diverse than los angeles thanks to brooklyn neighborhood study after a decade of playing second fiddle to los angeles new york now reigns supreme as the most diverse city in america according to census data so i wasnt expecting mario and luigi having italian but a mix of american italian accent instead with a mix of the languages you can tell mario and luigi were born there not immigrated but their grandfather which you do see is clearly the reason their family are there which gives them a rich history it means the writers took the time to go back to lore of the game and cartoon show and really bought it to the movie for the old fans of mario i found it very enjoyable and my partner loved it as well because boy can jack black makes a great bowser you get easter eggs of hints of other games like mario kart jump man luigi hunted mansion and of course my favourite smash brothers will i rewatch it yes i can happily buy the movie for family viewing for my little boy to watch it and get him into the mario games again if you never watched the cartoon show or even played a single game then you wont like this movie which has been made for the family and for kids i recommend this for families with little kids because they are going to enjoy it and millennials that grew up watching the cartoon and played the games are going to enjoy this with their kids
May 7 2023,positive,excellent familiar movie nothing of lgtb content what more to say
May 7 2023,positive,fun nostalgia trip seeing all these loveable characters come to life is such an amazing experience

May 7 2023,positive,great movie loved it
May 7 2023,positive,its crazy to see how professional critics are so far out of touch this movie checks all of the boxes for this looking for a nostalgic film it also offers something for those new to the mario brothers universe its an incredibly well done film where its kid friendly but not so much as to alienate adults excellent movie period

May 7 2023,positive,such a masterpiece with so many references created so much nostalgia combined with the amazing animations and orchestra
May 7 2023,positive,adults should go into this movie knowing that its truly for children the storyline is fun but so silly with little underlying purpose other than being entertaining to kiddoes we really enjoyed it for those reasons     a few more kill references than i may have been prepared for in a im gonna kill you way but maybe thats not unusual in immature g rated audiences anymore
May 7 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a loving tribute to the video game franchise packed full of references and easter eggs that will satisfy diehard fans of the series while those that dont feel nostalgic about these games will probably see the movie as chaotically fastpaced and very confusing those that enjoy the video games can appreciate this adaptation of marios adventures its no cinematic masterpiece but it sure is a fun time

May 7 2023,positive,it is freaking amazing and is one of many movies that has come out that isnt trying to have a moral for its story it just wants to tell a fun and exciting story for everyone and i highly recommend to anyone who has the time to see it in the theatres on the big screen because it is awesome and while it might only be a good movie if you havent played the games if you have played the games every part of the movie is cranked up to eleven the music is mostly from the games and is used perfectly and every single character besides humans has at least one appearance in the mario games or donkey kong games  the power ups are all from the games and i havent even talked about how the good voice acting is even seth rogan who didnt change their voice at all absolutely nailed it tldr watch the movie its really great

May 6 2023,positive,i loved it i had good memories of my childhood
May 6 2023,positive,its a short simple movie with many iconic characters and well known people that voiced them this movie is personally not for me probably becasue its a childrens movie   i think it had a lot of potential but it was too focused on the key topic mario and luigi rescues mushroom kingdom   the animation on the other hand was very nice and detailed i liked the art style a lot and was pleasing to look at  510
May 6 2023,positive,this movie is a total blast the critics are just being jerks when they give this bad reviews lighten up everyone and go see this
May 6 2023,positive,it was kind nice seeing the mario characters but with that it was very fast paste and often hard to understand whats going on i would have also liked to see other mario music instead of the loud classic 80s music very unfitting to the plot was not accurate to the games and had characters left out such as yoshi spike and other characters as well but why did they leave them out i mean i can understand leavening out side characters as they are less unfamiliar and less significant but leavening out more significant characters that would have made for a better story for the movie too overall im kind of disappointed and think why people are giving it more then its hyped up to be is just nostalgia from idk playing the games when they were a kid but with that i also think they shouldve added levels from the games as scenes in the movie and other stuff to like the spring and pow block but with that said the movie already came out so we can do is just hope for a sequel super mario galaxy anyone
May 6 2023,positive,its entertaining for all ages and the game references are cool but certainly not an award winner of any sort
May 6 2023,positive,really fun and tons of old school mario references

May 6 2023,positive,ive seen lots of hate about this movies barebones storyline and i get where theyre coming from but its the mario movie i dont what youre doing walking into the theaters expecting a movie with a deep story about the meaning of life you should be walking in expecting a movie about mario trying to save his brother besides that this movie has fantastic visuals and i love jack black as bowser kind of wish there was more luigi screen time but overall 5 stars

May 6 2023,positive,one of the best video game adaptations so far especially if you like the games
May 6 2023,positive,an absolute joyride of a movie it stays more faithful to the source than the vast majority of videogame movies doesnt let itself get overly bogged down by sideplots or real world politics its simply an enjoyable movie for the whole family tellingly the best critics can come up with to say its bad are things like its too fastpaced or its too simple and my personal favorite the villain does not nice things you cant have someone do evil things in a movie kids will see that and imitate it rather than see the villain who did that was defeated
May 6 2023,positive,sure the plot is paper thin its super mario rescuing peach from bowser we arent exactly delving into the lord or the rings are we chris pratt absolutely delivers and jack black is always a gas take the family out to see this film its worth it

May 6 2023,positive,great movie for the fans
May 6 2023,neutral,it was ok most of the characters are really faithful to the videogames and my kids enjoyed it  but some of the changes they did make took me out of the mushroom kingdom and into modern culture wars if princess peach was not changed to be a boss babe then it would have been better

May 6 2023,positive,in the mushroom kingdom a tale unfolds  a movie magical yet critics it scolds  super mario bros a delightful quest  but oh those critiques they fail the test    for in this world where plumbers reign  a whimsical adventure without disdain  mario and luigi brothers bold  their journey epic as legends foretold    the mushroom kingdom a sight to behold  creatures and castles stories untold  critics may grumble their judgments so crude  but the movies charm cannot be subdued    the colors burst forth vibrant and bright  a visual feast pure delight  from goombas to koopas each character defined  a nostalgic journey of the retro kind    the humor oh the humor it brings joy  a perfect blend no critique can destroy  from witty banter to slapstick glee  laughs abound in this joyful spree    bob hoskins and john leguizamo shine  as mario and luigi their spirits align  their chemistry sparkles on the silver screen  a dynamic duo in the kingdom serene    so dear critics your words may sting  but they cannot tarnish this wondrous thing  super mario bros a film of delight  a nostalgic treat shining so bright    let us revel in its whimsy and fun  embrace the magic that cannot be undone  for in the mushroom kingdom we all can see  a masterpiece exists beyond what you decree

May 6 2023,positive,pure entertainment just a really fun movie to watch with great animation surprisingly good voice acting lovable characters and funny quotes    of course mario fans are the ones who would enjoy this the most but the story is so easy to follow and the things i mentioned earlier are preformed so well that even those who just like animated or family movies would also enjoy this

May 6 2023,positive,is it short yes is it a basic plot yes but my god this is a huge love letter to not just the fans of mario but nintendo too the animation is breathtaking and is still shocking that its from illumination most of the voice actors are amazing especially charlie day and jack black even chris pratt wasnt half bad in my eyes might be a hot take but i think this is the best video game movie adaptation of all time i definitely recommend it dont listen to the critics and go see it now
May 6 2023,positive,very funny if you want to spend time with your little ones even your companion to get some laughs its a very good movie
May 6 2023,positive,nostalgic but for me that was about it
May 5 2023,positive,honestly one of the best video game movies if not the best illumination movie of all time
May 5 2023,positive,good movie  good fan service
May 5 2023,positive,funny but more directed towards kids with the occasional 80s music to keep adults entertained i love jack black in this though hes amazing and so is seth rogan

May 5 2023,positive,it is so good it made jack black reach out of the screen just to complement me personally
May 5 2023,positive,it is a good movie i saw all of it without taking my eyes off it but i was disappointed by some shorts that were not there and there are many references such as the announcement of the old series
May 5 2023,positive,really funny so many nintendo characters showing up animation was great the jokes where really good the music was very well done the story followed up really nice lots of game looking situations like the 2d run of mario and luigi at the begining
May 5 2023,positive,story 810   characters 710  comedy 910  comeos 710   overall 910
May 5 2023,positive,the word that defines this movie is fanservice but im happy anyway since im a fan anyway its still one of the best movies based on videogames everything is visually beautiful and they managed to make me laugh i dont think its necessary to talk about the song peaches which was totally unexpected for me and made me laugh several times the first time i heard it now speaking of the bad things of the movie i lower the score because i feel that many things happen in a very short time also because they did not give much time to the snow kingdom and from what i saw at the beginning they would show a bit of how the citizens lived in the kingdom they also never explain how the snow kingdom has the super star if according to the movie at the beginning the troops are weak or something like that 3750 definitely
May 5 2023,positive,cute movie for kids and enough references for parents to enjoy who grew up w a nes and snes
May 5 2023,positive,nostalgia overload enjoyd it but wish mario was more the hero of his own story
May 5 2023,positive,it was packed full with sooo many easter eggs from all the nintendo games the characters were so loveable the humour was very well placed i cant wait for more from illumination and nintendo
May 5 2023,positive,this movie brings back the nostalgia when i was a kid oh the other hand the peaches song is a jam 
May 5 2023,positive,amazing movie this really felt like a tribute to the years of gaming for super mario fans as a gamer myself i was smiling in awe at the movie the soundtracks the scenes and the overall storyline this movie portrayed the movie dives into brothers mario and luigi who fall down a pipe and into the mario world as we know it through the games it was an authentic representation of the game a lot of us grew up loving the soundtracks used also added thrills and shivers down your spine as you remember certain maps and levels from the games as theyd appear on screen    a must see movie especially for mario fans
May 5 2023,positive,liked the movie but it wasnt phenomenal i did like the mario kart reference scenes
May 5 2023,positive,a nostalgia packed movie covering the classic story in a new more defined way it just makes sense this isnt a character study or any deep dive but its just so fun
May 5 2023,positive,a 1hr 32 min cinematic masterpiece for every nintendo fan
May 5 2023,positive,the critics are dumb and for sure this movie was perfect for children and adults colorful bright simple humor that the target audience kids could understand and yet funny enough for an adult to love it too it stayed true to nintendos mario franchise which was refreshing in a world of remakes and content expanding movies that dont
May 5 2023,negative,despite extraordinary animation production scoring and voiceacting there were practically no magic or genuinely touching moments jack blacks bowser was a slight exception except that side of the character essentially was jack blackthe comedy wouldnt have worked with anyone else  they would have had to rewrite the character his spoiler jealousy of mario and pining for peach provided a chuckle and a bit of an angle but not nearly enough to carry the film or make up for the thin and onedimensional story maybe im expecting too much but the minionsdm films are incredibly successful at being great fun and comedy for kids and adults
May 5 2023,positive,as a fan of the games the film was much better than i expected i went with my 7 year old son he loved it also great world building great characters and at times very funny pleasantly surprised and hopeful for more films from this franchise to come
May 5 2023,positive,you really have to question the integrity of critic scores when they are so low at 56 yet the audience scored it at 96 its almost like theres an agenda amongst the critics hmmm if you pay attention to any scores on here ignore the critics they simply dont have any honesty or integrity and will simply follow an agenda to try and stay relevant youll find that audience scores are more honest the audience are not being paid endorsing companies or worried that their freebies will stop theyll simply give a genuine opinion  i grew up playing the mario games in the late 80s and now as a 38 year old man i went to watch this with mixed expectations worried that it would be too childish or tarnished by todays need to force wokesocial agendas into everything  but i really enjoyed it its great to sit and watch a straight forward simple and easy to follow adventure and it pays so much love and respect to the mario franchise you could tell how much the creators loved the games and the movie is loaded with tiny details and easter eggs from every single game my only gripe where was yoshi good fun movie and definitely worth a watch if youre a gamer or mario fan my partner is neither and still really enjoyed it
May 5 2023,positive,there are no roundabout things just have a fun
May 5 2023,positive,an awesome animation for any fan of the video game franchise easily one of the best animated movies out there
May 5 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing the characters are well written the story line catches you constantly to not get distracted by other things and is great for children
May 5 2023,positive,good animation graphics and action
May 5 2023,positive,exceeded expectations but just barely worth a watch but dont go in thinking youll be blown away pays adequate tribute to the source material

May 5 2023,positive,loved how they included most of the video game themes in the movie
May 5 2023,positive,thought with being grown up now the movie wouldnt feel the same but movie exceeded my expectations going in and i definitely found myself enjoying it i strongly recommend
May 5 2023,positive,great movie well worth seeing very funny
May 5 2023,neutral,there isnt much in plot themes payoffs or characterarcs otherwise tolerable to waste time with theres colorful stuff to look at tons of easter eggs to hunt for if thats your thing then this might be the perfect movie for that because the story never distracts from just looking around the big screen seeing what you can find hidden in the background because the movie is so boring but ya know its a kids movie very mid yingyang jackblackchrispratt
May 5 2023,positive,i loved how this was the perfect movie for not only my 6yearold son but for myself too the nostalgia was amazing and it was so fun for my son to see the characters like hes never seen them before merging all of my favorite mario bros games and mario kart into one movie was amazing the humor was also great
May 5 2023,positive,it was alright the way the people rave over the bowserpeaches song is kind of cringe 
May 5 2023,positive,a super fun and welcoming addition to the game adaptation genre
May 5 2023,positive,the plot was not great however the action makes up for it which kids would love the adventure to make it to beat the final boss doesnt really get you on your toes like some movies but its worth a watch if a friend invites you to watch it with them but not that good to watch it just by yourself the best way to watch it is probably with family otherwise its a decent movie
May 5 2023,positive,this movie is good but has some problems for example bowser never actually uses superstar all that happens with the superstar is mario uses it against him
May 5 2023,positive,my 5 yr old granddaughter loved it
May 5 2023,positive,loved that it paid homage to so many well know mario games definitely better then expected
May 5 2023,positive,i completely loved it this is the result of making a movie with love tons of references great performace it looks beautiful cant wait to see smash bros universe

May 4 2023,neutral,it was way too fast paced other than that i liked it
May 4 2023,positive,absolutely enjoyed the super mario bros movie i plan on watching it again soon if you grew up playing the games then this will warm your heart my bf and i took our son and he absolutely loved the movie this is the first movie he has sat down to watch in the theater without crying or wanting to run around

May 4 2023,positive,the new mario movie is a highly anticipated animated feature that brings to life the beloved characters from the classic video game franchise the movie delivers on all fronts with its excellent animation great portrayal of donkey kong and humorous script    one of the standout features of the movie is the portrayal of donkey kong who has a prominent role in the story his character is animated brilliantly and the voice acting by seth rogen is a perfect match for the largerthanlife gorilla donkey kongs scenes are some of the most enjoyable in the film and provide a great source of humor    the movies humor is one of its most significant strengths the script is full of witty oneliners clever visual gags and slapstick comedy that will leave audiences of all ages in stitches the humor is wellbalanced and never feels forced or out of place    the animation is also fantastic with vibrant colors and excellent character design the world of mario is brought to life in a way that will delight fans of the video game franchise the action sequences are wellchoreographed and the pacing of the movie is perfect never feeling too slow or rushed    the only minor downside to the movie is that it may not appeal to those who are not fans of the video game franchise however for fans of mario and his friends this movie is an absolute mustsee    overall the new mario movie is an excellent addition to the franchise the portrayal of donkey kong is spoton the humor is fantastic and the animation is topnotch its a great movie for fans of the game and families looking for a fun and entertaining movie experience

May 4 2023,positive,the sounds and sights of this film were fantastic the original soundtrack remixed to glorious perfection the voice acting from some of the actors the brilliant animation and the stark difference between the kingdoms all come together to create a pretty good film it does have several flaws the two dimensional writing lack of luigi screen time and less than stellar voice acting from chris pratt to name a few examples but this movie creates a vivid world and brought us the masterpiece that is peaches performed by jack black speaking of jack his and keegan michael keys voice acting as bowser and toad respectively absolutely carry the film you can tell that they both tried to make their voices unique and they seemed to have a lot of fun unlike mr mushroom kingdom here we come
May 4 2023,positive,excellent family fun movie especially if you like mario and friends
May 4 2023,positive,i dont like peachs personality and voice and the overused song choices but other than that its not bad its a typical mario movie with references and all that stuff to tickle any nintendo fanboys bones the voice acting for all the other characters is fine and the animation is amazing
May 4 2023,positive,the movie made me cry for something that many have not noticed and that is that mario receives many blows in battles draws strength from anywhere and does not give up to save his brother because that is what someone must do for his brother
May 4 2023,positive,overall the super mario bros movie is a fun and entertaining film that is definitely worth watching for fans of the games while it has its flaws it also has a lot of heart great action sequences and some standout performances from the cast if youre looking for a familyfriendly adventure movie with some classic video game nostalgia thrown in the super mario bros movie is definitely worth checking out

May 4 2023,positive,audience scores hold more value than critics scores only in rotten tomatoes  change my mind    scores aside the movie itself new or old fans of the series will find it enjoyable especially compared to the previous adaptation it is quite an improvement  is faithful to the source material which i appreciate the vas did great the animators did great  others did great as well

May 4 2023,negative,the ersatz filmmaking of the mario movie evidences an egregious lack of coherence rendering it an aesthetically crepuscular exercise in cinematic bankruptcy punctuated by a jarringly anfractuous narrative the movies callow ineffectuality fails to provoke even the faintest hint of emotive resonance overall the mario movie is a tediously pedantic mélange of disreputable filmmaking debarring its prognosticant audience from any gratification
May 4 2023,positive,excellent wonderful beautiful movie that was enjoyed with the family not like others
May 4 2023,positive,a very fun and light homage to the games with surprisingly delightful performances by jack black seth rogen  kmk i dont know what critics expected when hating on this but it was a well above par imagination studios movie that was playful throughout     810 earns another watch with shrooms

May 4 2023,positive,one of the best surprises of the year
May 4 2023,positive,it was kids nice and family friendly
May 4 2023,positive,a fun high energy ride fun for kids and older video game fans alike if you have played a few of the games even casually youre sure to at least have some fun with the cameos and references from all the previous games if you dont have any knowledge of the games dont waste your time
May 4 2023,positive,from my point of view it is a historical film since this film is not like any other that we wait to see in the cinema it is a film that thousands and thousands of people have been waiting for many years many of us dreamed of seeing the king of video games in a good adaptation on the big screen with a movie that would live up to the legendary character we all love for this reason the film had a great challenge to achieve good acceptance among the public and give people what they had wanted for so many years a good adaptation of mario and this film achieves it by far we can see it clearly with the satisfaction that the public has with the film obviously i dont mean the professional critic who buried the film sometimes it is very difficult to keep the community so united and with an extremist position but this film degrades an extremely high percentage among the people showing us a beautiful animation soundtrack a simple but working story and historical characters taken to the maximum and totally improved its a wonderful movie
May 4 2023,positive,was extremely exciting nostalgia up the whoho
May 4 2023,positive,my son loved it and especially the peaches song

May 4 2023,positive,i wasnt sure id like this film when i saw the trailer but after watching it in the theater i was very happy and glad id seen it  its a wonderful movie with positive energy its full of entertaining moments and lighthearted happy scenes i wish we had more films like this today to counter the vast majority of dull and lackluster fils generally produced today  this is truly a great movie to see and everyone leaves the theater happy and excited
May 4 2023,positive,amazing fun movie for the kids and parents
May 4 2023,positive,story was weak but dont think anyone would care that much its a super fun movie with lovable characters in mario luigi peach and donkey kong if you are a real mario fan you will love the easter eggs too
May 3 2023,positive,really fun and a great nostalgia hit
May 3 2023,positive,i took my boys to see it for my sons 6th birthday i watched about thirty minutes of it and then fell asleep  i still rate it 5 stars cos my kids didnt even know i was asleep they were very invested it was a nice outing and a superb nap

May 3 2023,positive,an excellent movie a lot of easter eggs and fandom simply love it
May 3 2023,positive,this movie is a gift for any marionintendo fan i love that it doesnt try to explain video game logic its just full steam ahead and does not apologize it feels like they made this movie for the fan base which is such a rarity
May 3 2023,positive,give all what fans wants the nostalgic feeling worth more than anything
May 3 2023,positive,yes this movie has a bland plot but with all the mario easter eggs thrown in the flaws become hidden and you just enjoy your time with this movie this is one of the most fun movies that weve had all year and this was a great time at the theater i wouldnt recommend this movie to someone who has not played mario or is not a fan of nintendo but if you are i cant recommend this movie enough 8410
May 3 2023,positive,as a mario fan since super nintendo this movie gave me the nostalgia no other video game movie has ever given     the movie could easily be nominated for an oscar the plot is simple but they cleverly implemented games we know into the movie classical super mario mario kart super smash n54 super mario luigis mansion donkey kong tons of easter eggs     100 recommended
May 3 2023,positive,an amazing movie it truly captures your heart 
May 3 2023,positive,the film is enjoyable and wellmade but it isnt thoughtprovoking enough to make you think about it for a few days the story and characters are decent but they dont quite reach the level of emotional depth or complexity that would make them truly memorable if youre looking for a good movie to watch without expecting anything too profound this film is definitely worth checking out
May 3 2023,positive,it is a unique experience do not miss it go to the movies now
May 3 2023,positive,its an amazing movie that reminds me my childhood so im so happy 
May 3 2023,positive,i liked how they tied in parts from old mario games with references to the original super mario world and the rest of the mario games didnt like how they made mario and donkey kong friends they should be nemesis didnt tie in yoshi at all didnt include the tumbleweed cat from the desert levels but had shown most others
May 3 2023,positive,i was wanting to see it when it came out it everyone said it was a solid take on mario and after seeing it i agree nintendo did a great job at bribing mario and the crew to life solid film
May 3 2023,positive,though i admit it was fast paced this movie was a mario lovers paradise the colors and references to past games were amazing and the nod to several different characters that have appeared in the games was fun almost every other scene had some kind of reference to a mario game and was done in a creative way  i was surprised to see peach acting like a girlboss but it was done in such a tasteful way that it worked seeing peach kick butt was glorious  mario learning how to be mario was absolutely hilarious i feel like it could have been more fleshed out to keep the plot from being rushed but what the heck everything was extremely entertaining
May 3 2023,positive,fun movie for the family  jack black was amazing as always  the kids loved it  just a little short for me could of had more action we will definitely see the sequel
May 3 2023,positive,great family film kids love it fans are delighted normies have fun critics are disconnected from reality and disney can only learn lot of fun

May 3 2023,positive,this movie was amazing my kids love it it was a fun ride and i wanna go again great film
May 3 2023,positive,fantastic movie watched it 8 times
May 3 2023,positive,a good movie chris patt was such an amazing actor and voice actor they had to include woman power message and makes mario a bit unreliable but its not as bad as in shehulk overall its a great movie  i prefer they make mario and luigi works together to save princess peach
May 3 2023,positive,this movie is a great adaptation of the long running video game franchise it does a great job of bringing in multiple worlds abilities and does it in an entertaining way my six year old twins loved it and was not scared by any of the bowser scenes my only criticism was it dragged a bit in pacing the movie
May 3 2023,positive,very funny love it 
May 3 2023,positive,i watched the movie multiple times i did feel it was a short movie but it was superb the plot is cheesy but nintendo did this for the fans and they delivered it was entertaining and thats exactly what the fans wanted
May 3 2023,positive,is perfect so funny and the music wooow
May 3 2023,positive,the critics got this so wrong this film was really good and enjoyable the animation was nice and clean despite when it was announced that chris pratt was playing mario and everyone moaning he was great and along with the changes made you didnt notice it jack black as bowser was just brilliant he brought comedy to the role and it was just great i really enjoyed the music especially the 80s songs they added i also think brian tyler did a great job with the soundtrack looking forward to seeing where it goes next
May 3 2023,positive,kids and i loved it nothing controversial really no inappropriate innuendos just an easy to watch enjoyable kids movie im considering going again to see it because my kids loved it so much theyre still talking about it two weeks after seeing it
May 3 2023,neutral,why yall be farting in the theater  
May 3 2023,positive,the most fun movie ive seen in a long time the fact that the critics rated so low pretty much explains why you shouldnt ever listen to what they have to say the movie did such a good job of staying to original content while making absolutely awesome in a way that could see more mario movies in the future thank god they didnt ruin mario and i truly hope this movie is the start of better content being release     take your kids to see this if you havent youll both love it every single moment id a blast from the past exactly what it should be a memorable movie that i will absolutely buy to watch 1000 times with my kids my 16 year old even loved it     dont listen to anyone watch for yourselves and be ready to enjoy it i promise you will
May 3 2023,positive,perfectly done and a long time coming love the nice touches and references to the old classic nes titles the little bonus after the credits was a nice tease
May 3 2023,positive,this fulfilled my inner child self and was retribution for the other mario movie 30 years ago
May 3 2023,positive,it was real good the sound track was 1010 and the film was enjoyable
May 3 2023,positive,honestly it was a wonderful and nostalgic movie for the older fans and a good movie for the younger fans but the story was quite uninteresting and nothing special also i feel like they could have added more easter eggs for the long time fans to find
May 3 2023,negative,the best part of the movie was the 10minute nap i got in the second act when nothing was happening except pointless action they did okay at making us care about the two plumbers and i kind of liked that the antagonist had feelings but i didnt have any reason to care about the princess i heard kids laughing at times when i cringed at how bad a scene was so clearly i am not the target audience still with regal unlimited i see a lot of movies and i can usually find a way to enjoy them this one not so much
May 3 2023,positive,loved it good family fun and great escapism
May 3 2023,positive,its a great movie that can entertain both adults and children this movie is one of the few animated films that does not have silly jokes  any mario fannintendo fan will be proud to see this   trust me it will be your best 1 hour and 30 minutes of your life
May 3 2023,positive,it was a pleasant surprise i didnt have high expectations i just like brining my kids to the movies on occasion theyre too young to know anything about super mario bros the video game but this movie seemed like something theyd enjoy it was well done and fun and it made me want to play some mario kart jack black was awesome as usual
May 3 2023,positive,fun and entertaining
May 3 2023,positive,the mario movie is truly the movie of all time
May 3 2023,positive,all it was missing was yoshi
May 3 2023,positive,they kept true to the game
May 3 2023,positive,the movie is amazing it perfectly uses all the things that make the mario the lovable franchise it is today many elements such the original donkey kong game and the mario kart rainbow road scene makes this movie one hell of a ride the final act couldve been perfected a bit but it was still great too see and finally the best character in the movie was bowserjack black they way he characterized bowser was just amazing
May 3 2023,positive,such a fun family movie is finally out for people to enjoy
May 3 2023,positive,amazing movie family friendly and awesome origin story if youve never played super mario in your life you can still watch and enjoy every second of this movie thank you nintendo and illumination for this masterpiece of my childhood cant wait to see why the future will bring with this partnership 100100 a movie

May 3 2023,positive,pure fast paced fun
May 3 2023,positive,loved that they used everything from the video games just seemed like it was over so fast and crammed in
May 3 2023,neutral,a movie for fans the animation is good but nothing innovative the characters are fun but their development is null mario the protagonist does not shine much and the development is nonexistent there isnt a solid plot in the movie its just a movie full of references nothing innovative
May 3 2023,positive,seen it 4x with the family we love it so much we had to watch it in all formats at regal i cant wait for it to be released at home
May 3 2023,positive,movie stayed true to the game
May 3 2023,positive,hello everyone    cidd here to help moviegoers like you to help you decide whether or not you want to see this movie    is it worth seeing    the movie is wonderful if you are a huge fan of the franchise like i am there are many references like a lot to the games that span across multiple generations of gamers and the music is a sweet call back to games that are old and new the movie itself is very stunning to look at with an art style that resonates well with the source material characters are built in this new faithful style to look very much like they do in the games with original artistic takes on them further complimenting the games they came from the pacing can be off at times leaving a little more investment in building the arch of certain characters to be built upon for a better emotional payoff also feeling not quite up to snuff was chris pratts mario whom i felt could have maintained the brooklyn accent throughout the whole move besides that jack blacks bowser is hilarious as a villain with some hilarious moments as well as being a simple villain you love to hate heck even some of the actors really put in enough effort to at least keep me hooked for an hour and thirty minutes    did i mention all the powerups that you can find within the movie that you can also find within the games    while the story is not the most complex or bigbrained for those other viewers out there who are looking in from the outside the fans of this series are rewarded highly for their knowledge of the games keeping up with nintendo all these years up until now its more like a huge thank from the big n themselves for playing their games    so the question remains should you go and see it    well i think its pretty obvious at this point what i think about the movie the movie is outstanding for what it attempted to accomplish with a huge thanks in part to the legendary shigeru miyamoto    ah but i am now just beating around the bush here    this is a flick that you will enjoy with no doubt if you are someone who played the games kids will enjoy it too so even if you dont enjoy it you can at least have an experience with friends and family
May 3 2023,positive,i loved the songs and the well animated characters mario and luigi were so cute and kind to each other although i didnt like how everyone was treating them
May 3 2023,positive,fun movie that everyone can enjoy funny moments and alot of references to nintendo games as an avid gamer it was a blast

May 3 2023,positive,this is the best movie of the year  just absolutely loved it jackblack is so good as bowser

May 2 2023,positive,critics are jokethey dont enjoy anything unless its political fun movie with the balanced actioncomedy and serious moment definitely better than anything dinsey has done since 2012
May 2 2023,positive,the best video game movie adaptation ever made and a wonderful celebration of everything mario and nintendo related in general beautiful animation mixed with great characters and an absolutely brilliant faithful score the world of mario is brought to life and sticks very faithful to the video game world of mario while also adding some cool new elements and ideas only down side is that it could have had a longer run time but to me thats not a very big issue that just means id love to see more of this world explored because of how great it was portrayed and adapted a longer sequel from how successful this movie has been should give us that and plenty more in the future

May 2 2023,positive,why is it so good it stayed true to what the audience wanted an authentic mario experience not polluted by hollywood activists nintendo should stay heavily involved for future installments to guarantee success from those who are yet to taste it     i really love how they showed the importance of family and the power it has to relate to the audience
May 2 2023,positive,hands down a ton of fun with a load of nostalgia
May 2 2023,positive,movie was pretty good but why the heck did they cast dwayne johnson as toad freaking odd choice he should stick to hawaiian disney movies and keep his grubby little hands off the classics  and quit trying to run with the big dogs awoof  also the star was right wake up sheeple

May 2 2023,positive,its was a great moive beautifully animated bright colorful and a wonderful story my daughter loved it
May 2 2023,positive,this is a fun family movie that has some fun moments but is overall kinda underwhelming it all feels like a big setup for more movies if you compare this to the first sonic movie the first sonic movie felt like a contained story that alluded to future sequels this one has the feel of a setup the entire time
May 2 2023,positive,great movie true to the characters
May 2 2023,positive,i thought it was barely ok  wife thought it was terrible  obviously we are the wrong demographic for this movie  kids should really like this movie
May 2 2023,positive,fun popcorn movie that is fantastically executed beautiful cinematography art direction animation acting performance and can not get enough of that orchestrated music definitely a family fun film for moms dads  and young kids treat yourself to a night out
May 2 2023,positive,wonderful animation decent story music was pitch perfect    as characters voices some fit perfect like jack black some were questionable choices     but i had fun and was entertained by this movie
May 2 2023,positive,great overall movie short and sweet as well as a great mix of comedy adventure and nostalgia
May 2 2023,positive,this movie was amazing loved the animation loved the cast loved the peaches song its 101 for me it the best movie of 2023 nintendo learned there lesson in 1993 i hope they make a super mario bros movie 2 anybody agree with me
May 2 2023,positive,a ton of fun loved all the game references snuck in here and there
May 2 2023,positive,critics clearly are not fans nor are gamers or know much about the games as i saw far too many negative comments the movie brought a lot of nostalgia its fun all the way many gaming references they have princess peach a twist which was super good idea didnt expect less from the guys that brought nintendo and the minions looking forward to all the coming movies in the future loved it
May 2 2023,positive,i loved this movie such a great representation of the world and characters i grew up with i loved the actors and the simple fun lighthearted story the only thing im not so happy about is that they separated luigi and mario for the majority of the movie because their energy was so great together but i still immensely enjoyed the film would definitely watch again and i definitely recommend this to any mario fans out there
May 2 2023,positive,i love this movie although i do think that they made mario a little too attractive  i was turned on the entire movie    thank you nintendo
May 2 2023,positive,this movie is what a movie should be to entertain its not perfect by all means but it puts a smile to the whole family its even accessible for a kid who have not played any mario games this movie should be an example the future adaptation films that they should be faithful to the source material and not pushing an agenda down to all of the paying audiences throats
May 2 2023,positive,super fun absolute fan service easter eggs from multiple nintendo properties fill almost every frame everyone in their 40s started singing the super mario bros super show jingle in the first scene to the bewilderment of the attendant children who seemed to believe all the parents in the theater had some odd shared precognitive ability very fun  being the kids
May 2 2023,positive,i had fun its far from perfect plot  writingwise but its a good time for 90 minutes which is more than other films can say
May 2 2023,positive,not only does the movie deliver to longtime fans of the ip but it is fresh fun and simply entertaining well worth the watch and if you grew up with the franchise then you will be very pleasantly surprised with the wonderful work done in this film oh and the voice acting is spot on its a me its a mario

May 2 2023,positive,went with my 4 year old since he has been watching the cartoons and seems to know alot about mario  he loved the movie wanted to watch it again and this was his first movie  since he said it was great but a bit scary in a few parts for him had to give it what i did
May 2 2023,positive,it was everything i wanted it to be while the plot was more or less your average good vs evil fairytale this movie wasnt bad by any means love the callbacks to the games love the actors who portrayed the characters chris pratts mario really wasnt bad and overall this is a super fun movie wahoo

May 2 2023,positive,i loved the movies the seating
May 2 2023,positive,you dont get bored watching it but its not the best movie in the world visually its stunning specially if you have played all mario games but its so weird to find them with a voice a story for me and the plot wasnt a big thing with jokes more for children so its a fine movie
May 2 2023,positive,just a complete blast from start to finish one of the best fun family films in a long time if youre a fan of super mario games past or present you wont be disappointed

May 2 2023,positive,just like jim carrey jack black understood the assignment entire film was almost ruined because a little girl couldnt stop talking throughout the entire thing however the super mario bros movie is a visual treat just as much as it is good family entertainment peaches is also a banger ngl
May 2 2023,positive,great time spent with my children they loved what i grew up with
May 2 2023,positive,compare this movie to the new peter pan movie jepp super mario bros is a masterpiece
May 2 2023,positive,a return to form for simply fun and entertaining movies hollywood has been crap for a long time now so its good to see something resembling what movies once were the critics as always are out of touch
May 2 2023,positive,not brilliant but great for little kids includes the classic soundtracks from the games jack black is great as bowser chris pratt is solid as mario but donkey kong is very annoying great visuals and doesnt overstay its welcome if you grew up with nintendo and have young relatives or kids it is great entertainment
May 2 2023,positive,just fun just pure colorful happy fun theres no need to overthink what this movie is about its just a happy colorful movie that gives exactly what you want everything is lovely a bouncy in design the colours are so refreshing to see in every shot nihilistic luma is without doubt the funniest thing i saw
May 2 2023,positive,i didnt think i was going to enjoy this but i did  i wasnt sure if my wife would but she was laughing at various parts of the movie enjoying herself  she said it was good  ok so the plot is the plot  just sit back and enjoy

May 2 2023,negative,wish i didnt waste the time going to the theater its shocking how a movie this awful is being accepted as good by so many people to the point where im starting to think i saw a different movie the plot is one of the most predictable ive ever seen and even ignoring that its still boring like id rather take a nap than watch it kind of boring id usually go on to say here that the animation was good but it wasnt literally no difference between the inuniverse reality and cartoon worlds dont waste your time money or sanity see a good movie
May 2 2023,positive,simply the best mario movie ever i think this movie can open doors to others films of characters of nintendo
May 2 2023,positive,wonderful move the 3d took a little getting used to but was amazing so vivid beautiful detail well done in every way
May 2 2023,positive,great effort for nintendo and illumination for doing that impressive and jack black and chris pratt and michael who played toad was fresh and love it if you are handicap and hard to hear they have devices like close captions and i recommend the dolby with recliner seating and prices are reasonable and got amc premiere and for the year so that is really good
May 2 2023,positive,i loved the movie and how it had all the songs from the games
May 2 2023,positive,the critics show their true colors once again this movie is a fantastic family film and i would love to take my kids again i love how they incorporated many of the nintendo games into the movie and got to see many of the characters that we grew up with and im happy to see my kids getting into playing super mario bros after watching the film cant wait for a zelda movie
May 2 2023,positive,okey maybe you will not pay me a lot of attention but this movie okey flashback time i started with the video games with you are right mario i grown with that franchise i obviously watch the ova and the horrible liveaction but i was wishing a big movie a very special movieyeah in this moment i only have 14 years with 5 months but i love this movie i know i know is not perfect as well the special critics who say she hulk is good and this animated movie doesnt have  good history i love the low cgi and a horrible green girl doing twerk god damm the mario franchise have a simple history its what everyone was expecting i know the part of mario kart doesnt have sense but that scene was made with love and you know the adults who played the first donkey kong game or the first mario enjoyed the movie and as normal teen with obligations and study and reasoning you should see and enjoy this movie if you dont like the simple things made for a fandom or kids or adults who played this in their childhood just get out and look your disney blackremakes seriouslythis commentary was only made with the porpoise to open the eyes of the people who want a movie with a extended lore dont worry for them a movie of the legend of zelda is coming thanks if you see this comment see ya later in the sequel

May 2 2023,negative,cg was great but story so bored

May 1 2023,positive,after seeing this movie with some skepticism about a video game being made into a film mario has that factor that anyone can enjoy whether youre a fan or not the graphics were great and it had its funny moments however the story was just okay for  me this is a film that kids teens and adults of the franchise cane enjoy cant wait to see where they go next

May 1 2023,positive,for a super mario movie im not sure they could have done much better very well done great blend between making it fun for nostalgic adults but also fun for kids surprised to see the rating here on rt being so negative not sure what people were expecting from this movie but clearly some folks had unrealistic expectations overall very much enjoyed

May 1 2023,positive,a fun animated film thats safe to take your kids to and is true to the source material you wouldnt think that would be a rarity but in todays hollywood it is
May 1 2023,positive,critics are way too harsh on the story its simple and fun for audiances young and old lots of color and set pieces and the short run time means it never overstays its welcome great for small kids
May 1 2023,positive,seriously who can take the critica serious this days specifically when they rate low a movie like this show their feedback counts for nothing if they dislike such a original movie
May 1 2023,positive,quick and fun full of mario easter eggs from 40 years of games
May 1 2023,positive,this should be the blueprint for adaptions everything was spot on
May 1 2023,positive,its a pretty damn good movie
May 1 2023,positive,had to watch it despite all the silliness surrounding it online the movie was cute and enjoyable in 3d
May 1 2023,positive,i guess they could have done more with the story but the original mario the story plumber jumps on turtles then completes obstacle course  to find princess is in another castleso yeah they probably should have put less  into voice actors and made a better movie but for a kids movie this is top tier
May 1 2023,positive,watched it last night with my girlfriend and her little brother and sister the amount of sound effect references how they implemented the games in the movie it was amazing had a ton of fun watching it will watch it again and try and find all the easter eggs a nice addition was all the backstory they added to the main characters they were small details but really cool to see
May 1 2023,positive,by far the best video game movie adaptation so far there was so much love that stayed true to the game and the official soundtrack was simply incredible the many lil references were fun finding
May 1 2023,positive,love itit was worth it  
May 1 2023,positive,the peaches song drilling into your brain is the only thing that lowers the score  amazing soundtrack satisfying sound design fantastic character design and casting it is perfect for both the old and new generations illumination stepped up their game and i hope it continues to do so
May 1 2023,neutral,the plot made no sense but they put in a few cool game references
May 1 2023,positive,great movie love the way they incorporate the music from the game to the movie the history the characters big hit
May 1 2023,positive,the only thing that matters is the audience score
May 1 2023,positive,it was amazing nintendo fans if their isnt a popular game easter egg you have found the next movie
May 1 2023,positive,as a fan of the mario franchise it made me smile the whole movie those critics are wrong
May 1 2023,negative,have we gotten so much crap in modern media that this passes for good chris pratt sounds awful toad sounds nothing like he should and theres zero magic to any of this the story was written by a 10 year old and the music is horrible they butchered mario im off to play real mario to find some real magic what a joke
May 1 2023,positive,ill be honest i had massive doubts about this movie nothing seemed to be going in its favor from illuminations being the studio creating it to chris pratt being the voice of mario yet with every trailer my hopes for the movie rose it looked absolutely beautiful and they even brought back the mario rap from the super show    after watching the movie i can safely say that all my doubts were washed away the movie feels like a love letter to the series a whole theres so many references thrown at you but they dont get in the way of the movie theres never a reference that youre required to get to understand a scene  i can promise you if youre a fan of mario theres something in this movie for you the references go so deep at times that the main toad character could be seen as a reference to captain toad the super show or mario bros 2  oh if youre worried about donkey kong going back to his arcade appearance dont be they mightve gone back to the arcade for his appearance but they went right back to country for his personality    basically if youre thinking of watching this movie but are worried about the quality or worried there wont be something in there for you cause youre either new to the series or havent played in a while dont be  the movie was made for all ages and the references are taken from all ages
May 1 2023,positive,i looked at the reviews from the audience before watching this movie and i was quite disappointed with it dont get me wrong there are some things they did great with an obvious one being the beautiful animation and peaches but the story is what really disappointed me it seems they spent their budget on hiring well known actors stunning animation and putting in easter egg after easter egg for fans then making a good story it really had potential and i hope they do better with the sequels 610
May 1 2023,positive,fun movie enjoyed it with my 10 year old daughter i think they really brought the game to life
May 1 2023,positive,it was pretty good not gonna lie although it is pretty short so 45
May 1 2023,positive,the plot is an expected mario plot if ive ever seen one its almost like an origin story of how the bros got to the mushroom kingdom and why theyre fighting bowser it has references of many mario games from the original super mario bros all the way to even mario odyssey and dont even get me started on the music the movies absolutely phenomenal and i highly recommend it itll get kids interested in the franchise and encourage them to play the games if they havent already itll also envoke nostalgia in those whove been long time fans of mario
May 1 2023,positive,super mario bros is perfect charismatic characters a great story many references and a great start to the franchise much deserved success my rating is 1010
May 1 2023,positive,finally a film for families without political themes my kids and i love this movie

May 1 2023,positive,my grand children loved the movie  that brought me joy
May 1 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
May 1 2023,positive,you dont have to be a mario fan to enjoy this full fledged family friendly comedy movie i am no mario fan so i didnt really have any expectations for the movie the movie turned out to be awesome properly portraying the italian plumber in brooklyn who wears a red hat  the plot was nicely laid out showing mario luigi and peachs background stories while still maintaining the flow of the story   coming to the characters marios voice isnt the one from the video games but the voice actor still did an awesome job luigi was the scared younger brother but he was way wimpier in the movie and kinda lacked screen time him mostly being stuck in a cage peach is not the same person from the video games now shes an actual princess who gives this do not mess with me impression and who no longer requires mario to save her i feel that luigi and peach kinda swapped roles moving on bowser was hilarious i mean who knew that bowser was a turtle who could play the piano and sing applaudes toad was nicely played and an enjoyable character finally i saw a lot of complaints on seth rogen donkey kongs voice actor but i honestly had 0 complaints since i am no mario fan and he made donkey kong look funny  overall i really enjoyed the movie and i honestly reccomend it for all ages my only complaint is that we didnt get to see the green yoshi fromt the games wario waluigi and bowser jr but i guess you cant have everything once again you dont have to be a mario fan to enjoy this family friendly movie
May 1 2023,positive,a love letter for super mario fans

May 1 2023,negative,drifted so far away from the actual game it wasnt even enjoyable it was cliche and wasnt good whatsoever   i was expecting bowser to kidnap princess peach in the first scene then have mario go and save her  really bad film
May 1 2023,positive,its up there with topgun maverick a great movie the kids loved it and want to see it again good story and it looks great this is what happens when you stick to the source material and keep it real 
May 1 2023,positive,fun characters  nostalgic  funny  good plot line
May 1 2023,positive,this movie perfect absolute nostalgia no complaints at all and even wanted to go buy original nintendo run after im from the generation of the first live adaption so i was nervous of this outcome even my wife who isnt into kids movies was yelling get it at one point chefs kiss
May 1 2023,positive,great animation a beautiful remembrance for those who we grew up playing the game great time on the theaters i appreciate the fidelity to the game

May 1 2023,positive,if you love the game you will love the movie
May 1 2023,positive,being honesti didnt enjoy it that muchi wouldnt rewatch it again firstthe characters are really nondeveloped and blandthere were pretty much no scenes where characters talk and developand those that exist do nothing yeswee learn that peach is also from another dimensionbut thats itwe dont even know what dimension shes from and godthat scene of dk and mario inside of an eel was such a waste secondthe film is too fastpaced the movie goes through so much so fastlikein one scene marios at the mushroom kingdom and like a minute laterbamtheyre at kong kingdomthen bammario is against dkthen bamrainbow road also the movie is too fanservice

May 1 2023,positive,this rating is fresh from the movie theaters i just saw it and it was the best video game movie that will probably ever be made even better then the sonic movies a true must see for everyone especially gamers like myself
May 1 2023,positive,as an adaptation of an nes game the super mario brothers movie had virtually nothing to work with but as a result we got a loose but springy adaptation of the early era of mario that gives us a little bit a worldbuilding a bit of beautiful stage design some great music and while you could tell that nintendo had the metaphorical gun to illuminations head as to avoid screwing this up it was all for the best now sure the story was a little on the simple side being a simple rescue mission but thats all it needs to be its a first movie in what i suspect will be a much bigger enterprise not citizen kane the only thing i can heir against this film comes down to the rather short runtime to it all the 90 minute answer to segas corrected classic and konamis grim adventure is overall well done for a first attempt but it blew by very quickly and im quite looking forward to smb2 whenever that happens     final score 455
May 1 2023,positive,children and mario enthusiasts can add a star

Apr 30 2023,positive,we just loved this movie brought back so many childhood memories and my kids loved it
Apr 30 2023,positive,chris pratt is once again at the helm of a franchisedefining blockbuster this movie spares hardly a mario brothers reference from beginning to end and like the lego movie before it employs those references in expert style this movie is genuinely funny and enjoyable for the adults in attendance it builds on a shared history of three generations of mario fans it will live on in memes and references forever bravo i didnt expect it to be half this good
Apr 30 2023,positive,very nostalgic full of humor vibrant colors and action great watch for adults and children
Apr 30 2023,positive,great movie need a sequel
Apr 30 2023,negative,a movie solely made for kids i was hoping there would be more nostalgic references and scenes for the adults in the room the couple of humorous lines and colorful animation were the only aspects that saved this movie from being in the single digits 12
Apr 30 2023,positive,this was a great movie for the kids that i also surprisingly enjoyed sometimes you just want a movie to keep it simple and this familyfriendly film did just that while giving humor and some nostalgia this film just like the super mario games arent created with complex story arcs to dissect for some deep meaning its just a bit of fun to insert into your day

Apr 30 2023,negative,it might be good for kids but it was boring for us  not the worst movie ever but by the time it was halfway though i was hoping it would end soon
Apr 30 2023,positive,loved it great cast of voices great story line follows the games story lines just fun for kids and adults
Apr 30 2023,positive,i liked that the princess was a hero but there was so much fighting and cartoon violence that it got boring and who needs children to see more violence

Apr 30 2023,positive,i brought me back to my childhood 
Apr 30 2023,positive,this is the one of the 10 best movies i have ever seen in my life  everything in the movie is a masterpiece  i couldnt not say this movie good  my rating   100100
Apr 30 2023,positive,incorporated a lot of elements from the video games and the humor was on point watch out for that blue flame and the dark humor it emits
Apr 30 2023,positive,my real rating on this movie is 41 stars but hey its close enough     i think that this movie could have used a little more i just felt that it needed more easter eggs for the hardcore fans my main takeaway from this movie is that toad was annoying and so was that little luma this movie is definitely worth watching but for only one reason and that is to see princess peach
Apr 30 2023,positive,hilarious and super fun to watch  fast paced and great storyline well done
Apr 30 2023,positive,great film with a number of video game references for fans but a weak storyline
Apr 30 2023,negative,could have been better dragged in the beginning

Apr 30 2023,neutral,im neutral to that movie ill give it 510 because for reason 1 the movie shouldnt have put the opera music in the bathroom scene with mario luigi and a dog this scene made me cry because of the music for reason 2 bowser shouldnt kidnap princess peach instead of luigi bowser always kidnaps princess peach in the video games and for reason 3 mario shouldnt have the original mario voice actor than chris pratt these are 3 reasons why i gave the movie 510
Apr 30 2023,positive,it was cute  i took my 11 yo son  the scenes were like playing the video games

Apr 30 2023,positive,love the whole look of the film gorgeous colors all around and jack black as bowser can not be beat peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
Apr 30 2023,positive,all around just a goof fun family film loved seeing all the easter eggs and hearing the music from so many of the games that entertained me as a child and now entertains  my children  the story line was okay nothing amazing but its from a mario game we werent expecting the green mile  the action was amazing   the karts  top shelf scene  peach was a strong female role model for young girls  i loved it so much can wait for more nintendo movies

Apr 30 2023,positive,awesome family movie that provided great entertainment for children and adults alike the best video game movie adaption ever in my opinion with great voice acting cast and a brilliant story that aims to just entertain
Apr 30 2023,positive,a cute and familyfriendly movie our whole family loved this film were seeing it again in theaters this weekend
Apr 30 2023,neutral,if you go in expecting no story no heartfelt moments and want to see a souless yet colorful movie i think you will have a good time movie is going 100mph you wont have much time to appreciate any of the visuals
Apr 30 2023,negative,there was so many charming aspects to this film that i truly enjoyed as well as wonderful performances from many members of the cast and extremely underwhelming and inconsistent performances from chris pratt and seth rogan
Apr 30 2023,positive,a really good movie but dont why you idiots didnt give this a hire score oh wait rotten tomatoes doesnt know what a good movie is they think a bad movie is a good movie and a good movie is a bad movie
Apr 30 2023,positive,the movie is great for nintendo fans and the kids  very fast paced felt like there wasnt enough time in the movie due to the length the plot was pretty basic premise basically if youve played the game is usually peach gets kidnapped but they swapped peach for the luigi the cast was brilliant cast not gonna lie i was a bit sceptical when i first heard about the cast specially jack black as bauza very good for families who want to go to the cinema to kill a few hours over a weekend a lot of nice nintendo references not too bad
Apr 30 2023,positive,very beautiful visually the true essence of the video game has been captured
Apr 30 2023,positive,this movie is best illumination movie of all time spoilers i never get to see another post credit of yoshi but still i believe this movie this movie will have a sql because theyre not that many characters that were from the mario games are not in the movie

Apr 30 2023,positive,surprisingly a really good family film made i recommend it for the whole family
Apr 30 2023,positive,letsago on this amazing adventure  joseph campbell would be charmed to see his heros journey performed by two italianamerican plumbers mario luigi and their friends captivate us with their tenderness and loyalty in a story in which it is understood that tall does not mean big that strong does not mean muscular and that being a princess in no way means being weak it is amazing how a sincere narrative free of ideological overtones can remind us between laughs and sighs that true human power resides in the bravery of our spirits and even more how victory lies in defending what is good beautiful and true
Apr 30 2023,positive,this movie was amazing
Apr 30 2023,positive,good pace and soo enjoyable easter eggs and references everywhere
Apr 30 2023,positive,absolutely loved it i almost cry in some scenes reminding me my childhood i watched 3 times in theaters the last time i did that was in endgame 11 times
Apr 30 2023,positive,cute movie the only thing i wished they did was add yoshi they only showed a glimpse of yoshi which was a bit disappointing
Apr 30 2023,positive,even for adults it was funny i had kids of all ages 1113and 14 they all thought it was funny we saw it in imax im sure the 3d version is awesome
Apr 30 2023,positive,another great addition to the mario legacy brings together many eras of the game everyone sure to remember thanks for another terrific family fun movie
Apr 30 2023,neutral,its fine as someone who didnt religiously play the games i got most of the references really the story didnt need to be complex but it really decided to throw a lot at the audience that more casual viewers might feel as if this franchise wont be for them animation is great and the voice cast overall worked also stop using holding out for a hero in movies it peaked at shrek 2 
Apr 30 2023,positive,amazing movie with great visuals and filled with easter eggs also 47 of the critics are wrong claiming its a bad movie its really a good movie
Apr 30 2023,positive,awesome  i enjoyed every minute of it

Apr 30 2023,positive,this movie is fun for the whole family its a nostalgic trip for the parents as well as visually stunning for the whole audience at a little over an hour and a half this movie is sure to be just the movie your family needs this year
Apr 30 2023,positive,this is one of the greatest videogame movie adaptationfull of easter eggswith a stellar cast and ten times better of the last disney movies that came out early  this movie has a rotten score just because this is a movie for fans not for critics
Apr 30 2023,positive,best movie in the world
Apr 30 2023,positive,while it was nice dumb fun as far as movies go it was far less coherent than the trailers made it out to be this was a childrens movie through and through the writing was barely mediocre and existed only to move along the extremely rushed plotwhich was less of a story and more just a string of references such care was given to the accuracy of the references that they almost felt like advertisements i didnt expect anything overly complex from a video game movie but i expected it to appeal more to generation x than 10yearolds
Apr 30 2023,positive,great movie nostalgia factor checked entertaining checked comedy checked wholesome with some pint of darkness checked my kid was screaming oh no and mama mia inside the theaters first time he ever did that as he is often sleeping if it doesnt interests him thats more than enough for me to give this a 10 out of 10 i dunno what in yhe world those critics are even thinking my opinion is that if you are a miserable person and want other people to be miserable like you then i guess you wont like this movie  thats the reason why i think many of those socalled expert critics gave this a rotten score
Apr 30 2023,positive,literally the best movie of 2023

Apr 30 2023,positive,i went into the super mario bros movie with low expectations and came out thoroughly entertained    the plot is basic yet serviceable  the animations are immaculately designed  the pacing is even and each scene does not overstay its welcome  the humor manages to hit the younger and older demographics quite well    there are no serious flaws in this movie for once i have seen a fun and entertaining movie that is also clean the whole family can enjoy this film without reservations

Apr 30 2023,positive,it was great for a video game movie great stuff still just had too much popular actor syndrome

Apr 30 2023,positive,grew up in the 80s playing the original mario bros and this was a great version  music incorporated a lot of the games  it gave a tiny bit of backstory to princess peach
Apr 30 2023,negative,i mean look i am a huge mario fan played the games and all that but like the movie was so quick passed one moment hes here the next hes in peach tower then hes fighting bowser in the city like sheesh all i wanted to say to mario in the movie was slow down lol but i enjoyed the art and the loved characters and the nostalgia of it all and the peaches peaches peaches song but the story didnt make me feel anyway after the movie i just felt bored and tired at the end
Apr 30 2023,positive,this was the greatest result for a mario movie so much is taken from the games that can keep big mario fans entertained only flaw was the pacing which they can hopefully improve on in the sequel
Apr 30 2023,positive,hell of a family movie an absolute must see wholesome family movie loads of nods and references to the games throughout the years cast did a great job with the characters no forced messaging just decent popcorn storytelling about doing the right thing
Apr 30 2023,positive,it had a lot of comic in it
Apr 30 2023,positive,great fun movie for the family loved the nostalgia of my old nintendo games from the 90s and the music actors were awesome too and the characters are funny and full of heart
Apr 30 2023,positive,while it isnt without its flaws this is the movie for mario hardcore fans
Apr 30 2023,positive,love it this is a movie made for fans i have played every single mario bros game and this movie brought all the feels loved every single second of it my kids loved even more and even my wife who doesnt play video games loved it fun for everyone
Apr 30 2023,negative,the ending was extremely rushed they couldve done so much more and made it a threefour hour movie
Apr 30 2023,negative,this movie is bright cheerful highenergy fun that any cocacolad up elementary school kid would loveand that is the extent of its quality  the story dialogue and pretty much everything aside from the visuals and action are just abysmal  i dont know if nintendo blocked the writers from doing anything to make the characters interesting or funny but the result is every conversation in the movie being painfully cringeinducing  the movie is target towards young children and does a great job being fun for them  if youre an adult who enjoys this movie i have no idea how you manage that but hey power to ya
Apr 30 2023,positive,loved it great storyline and graphics
Apr 30 2023,positive,great movie i enjoyed it and so did my 8yr old i hope there is a second one

Apr 30 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is an amazing work of art growing up playing lots of mario games on the gamecube wii ds and more lots of references that i recognize while watching the movie i dont know what the critics are smoking this movie is enjoyable to everyone whose a mario fan or not
Apr 30 2023,negative,very shiny and neat to watch however has almost no plot main character isnt essential to the story and is background to the princess its fun its a nostalgic romp but is completely devoid of substance
Apr 30 2023,positive,funny browsers singing was cute like the way it ended

Apr 30 2023,positive,fun fresh and the perfect length of time
Apr 30 2023,positive,the best movie based on a video game that has ever been made no one would have believed it and here we have an animated movie that sets the precedent of how to take a work of video games to the cinema and make young children and children of the nostalgia are deeply moved by a simple story full of fun entertaining and familiar action with colorful animation and according to what is expected of a video game recommended for the whole family and especially for children

Apr 30 2023,positive,its a great movie with the details of the start and the song every one likes peaches and it combined with other games like super smash bros ultimate that place where mario and donkey kong fight
Apr 30 2023,positive,since i was a kid ive been playing the mario games and with the super mario bros movie it brings nostalgia with all of the original characters the movie has good amount of action you can expect from a family friendly movie i wouldnt say its for everyone because not everyone likes the mario games but the movie is still very entertaining even if you dont like the games i would definitely recommend watching it even if you dont play the games its definitely not a movie i would watch multiple times but its still really enjoyable its definitely a solid 35

Apr 30 2023,positive,for the gaming community its a gem i have no complaints i think its my favorite animated movie of those movies that you would watch over and over again and you wouldnt get tired i think puss in boots 2 and super mario bros saved the world from the animated movies

Apr 29 2023,positive,as a massive fan of mario since childhood it as a story feels a bit by the numbers  following very familiar tropes it didnt really translate to the big screen for me personally but has some really beautiful animation and fun moments luma definitely the star pardon the pun  definitely a good one to take your family too  its very clearly designed as a family film more than one to bring nostalgia in spite of its many easter eggs many have nostalgia bias and ill admit was very keen to see but i probably wouldnt rewatch any time soon

Apr 29 2023,positive,nintendo  illuminations the super mario bros movie was simple with a little plottwist of a storyline mario appears yet again on the big screen and in style the super mario bros movie was an amazing animated film produced by nintendo and illumination and this film was by far illuminations best film animation wise and box office wise it surpassed 1 billion dollars at the box office on april 19th 2023 and it was really well disserved after 6 years of production id say its worth the six years that nintendo and illumination have spent on this very film in my opinion i think that the rest of the critics on rotten tomatoes are completely disconnected from reality and this film disserves more complements
Apr 29 2023,positive,very familyfriendly and enjoyable

Apr 29 2023,positive,loved it cant wait to come again
Apr 29 2023,positive,just back from super mario brothers movie what can i say i kinda loved it  whomever wrote it definitely is of similar sensibilities to me which always helps if youre me i suppose   and this avoids the usual video game movie trap by being a lot of fun from start to finish if youre a video kid like me atari 2600 original nintendo sega what have you youll love all the easter eggs and the film is inventive bright and colorful theres a few overused tropes here and there to be sure but the characters are for the most part fun and the movie keeps zipping along    if anything some of the characters get a little bit of the short straw luigi primarily but thats probably inevitable when youre trying to spread the character development around that being said it did surprisingly go from a nostalgia rush to a oh i like the story thats being told here rush even if that story was definitely a familiar one     the kids in the audience we saw it with had a lot of fun and so did this 48yearold kid  highly recommended
Apr 29 2023,positive,this movie is awesome one and a half hour of pure nostalgia
Apr 29 2023,positive,i loved the character development that was in bowser and the cinematic experience
Apr 29 2023,positive,pretty bad but its a fun time
Apr 29 2023,positive,my 10 year old son loved it and so did i
Apr 29 2023,positive,i personally thought it was a sweet movie for those who are looking to remember an old friendly game this would be the movie to watch the characters were spot on and the movie had overall a good storyline its good for a laugh or two
Apr 29 2023,positive,it was an awesome movie great storyline great graphics and kept you on the edge of your seat
Apr 29 2023,positive,it was an absolute masterpiece i recommend it to fans from every age
Apr 29 2023,positive,it was grand and while its worldbuilding was slightly rushed people shouldnt let the super mario video game franchises legacy overshadow a great movie
Apr 29 2023,positive,i thought it was great it was what it needed to be though the story needed a little more character work and the pace is brisk still super fun i would see it again
Apr 29 2023,negative,ive seen a lot of movies in my 30 years of existence but this one was by far the worst the characters are so ugly that it was hard to keep my eyes open the plot was paper thin and utterly boring and forced and the jokes made me cringe so hard it was painful i sincerely wish this was never made in the first place
Apr 29 2023,positive,kids enjoyed it i was mildly amused
Apr 29 2023,positive,upgrade from the 90s live action movie
Apr 29 2023,positive,loved by the whole family  great story line
Apr 29 2023,positive,awesome ignore the critics
Apr 29 2023,positive,i thought it was geared towards me as an adult vs my son but he liked it too great music
Apr 29 2023,positive,it was a ton of fun for the whole family   it was a perfect blend of nostalgia for us adults and comedyexcitement for our kids  the number of times they pulled in content from the various video games brought back all the feels from my childhood  and the kids thought it was a mix of funny scary and exciting
Apr 29 2023,positive,this movie was hilarious and awesome brought back a lot of my childhood memories from the songs to them eating mushrooms  and him being cat mario it was great loved the new twist with bowser too
Apr 29 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie its one of the greatest films ive ever seen even if it had a lackluster story that doesnt matter its a movie based on a video game that makes you feel like youre playing a video game i need more mario cause this is incredible
Apr 29 2023,positive,this film is a prime example of why you should take what the critics say with a pinch of salt because this was a fun entertaining and enjoyable film with colourful animation funny humour and some good action growing up with the mario games back in the late 90s and early 2000s nintendo 64 and the gamecube is my nostalgia with mario i definitely have an emotional attachment with these characters and i think that helped me enjoy it even more and get some of the references and set pieces but even if you havent played any mario game this is still an enjoyable time im really glad its done so well at the box office    810
Apr 29 2023,positive,its a bit rushed and the story is pretty plain but it makes a joy to watch and as a mario fan i kept pointing at the screen at every reference the references really make it feel like the makers care
Apr 29 2023,positive,one of the best movies based on games ive ever seen with several references to the mario universe
Apr 29 2023,positive,i wish they had italianos as mario and luigi
Apr 29 2023,positive,if you grew up with nintendo and mario since your childhood you may think nostalgia will make you think higher of this movie and it probably will but even of you know nothing about this world its colors its music its story telling will give you a warm hearted feeling you will understand there is magic and love in this movie and that is something we are currently in need of
Apr 29 2023,negative,i really wanted to like this since i grew up on nintendo buti dont know it just wasnt interesting and was painfully unfunny i had a much more fun and enjoyable time with sonic and was looking for that same level of engagement but i just didnt find it i guess it was cool at least to see all the familiar characters in this format   that said im still gonna watch the next nintendonmovie and hope it does better a smash bros type movie would be so cool
Apr 29 2023,positive,it was a really good movie it was straight none of those cricket lines you know theythem bullshit
Apr 29 2023,positive,the movie is good and enjoyable but the reason its 4 stars is because they really did not have that bug of a ending scene and it just ended
Apr 29 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this film from start to finish  i felt it was a big nostalgia trip down memory lane 
Apr 29 2023,positive,excelente for fans of super mario bros
Apr 29 2023,positive,a great movie the whole family can enjoy certainly one that doesnt deserve such a low critic rating
Apr 29 2023,positive,definitely a fun ride  inundated with vibrant splashes of overstimulating gradients a nice film  but just wasnt as thrilling as i imagined
Apr 29 2023,positive,finally a great new cartoon movie for kids 
Apr 29 2023,positive,my childhood has been brought to the forefront and the nostalgia this movie evoked gave me so much joy the adventures and scenery only added to the cinematic experience and enhanced how well each character was casted and each creature was represented
Apr 29 2023,positive,lets bring family friendly movies back go mario
Apr 29 2023,positive,its a great fun movie with wonderful action sequences   great cinematography its not happening very often to see action sequence like those ones in a mainstreaming animation movie  of course if you are not a super mario fan you will not appreciate it at the full potential i was reading some of the bad criticism about the shallow story etc i dont really get it its like to order a burger and then complain to have received a burger its super mario it is what it is
Apr 29 2023,positive,insane the actors were amazing
Apr 29 2023,positive,best part was the singing
Apr 29 2023,positive,it was a fun and politically free movie

Apr 29 2023,positive,great innocent movie everything was well thought out overall great
Apr 29 2023,positive,nostalgic full of easter eggs great family movie
Apr 29 2023,positive,sometimes movie critics get it wrong like in the case of mario this movie was fun and great from start to end the director did a great job not to mention that everyone applauded at the end of the movie thanks universal studios for this movie
Apr 29 2023,positive,very epic movie i enjoyed every frame of it
Apr 29 2023,negative,generic movie sadly its not for the people who grew up with the game but rather the generation you win some and you lose some sadly this was a lose  where they couldve added backstory to the plot they didnt find it necessary so nothing to gain for story wise but the animation was good
Apr 29 2023,positive,youd think at first because chris pratt played mario instead of charles martinet that it would of been a bad film oh boy was i ever so wrong if you grew up playing mario this is a movie you have to see it would also be a good movie for the kids too
Apr 29 2023,positive,its a super funny movie with a lot of reference to the videogames but if youre not a fan its more difficult to know what theyre talking about i enjoy this movie and i think everybody has to see it
Apr 29 2023,positive,it was pretty good  my 9yo and 18yo both enjoyed it i really liked it and recommend it
Apr 29 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a nostalgic love letter to everyone who grew up with the iconic gaming franchise
Apr 29 2023,positive,it stood true to the game my family and i loved it
Apr 29 2023,positive,its mario its a fun action adventure nothing else to say
Apr 29 2023,negative,i made an account just to rate this movie the lowest i can it was so boring 90 minutes felt like 3 hours
Apr 29 2023,positive,nice job with the movie well directed depiction of the game characters was spot on took you through the storyline while taking you through game play action for us in the age group who grew up playing this game the movie had a nostalgic feel
Apr 29 2023,positive,glad that there was no italian accents and made them straight up new yorkers
Apr 29 2023,negative,i thought i might casually enjoy it because mario was such a big part of my childhood i also wanted to like it just to give a middle finger to all the people who were dumping on this movie simply because of chris pratt who i happen to like a lot    nope i dont think ive ever seen such a paper thin plot in my life even compared to other kids movies super mario bros 3 had more weight in its script than this character arcs are nonexistent this script is the shallowest script ive ever seen ever people exaggerate about how bad movies are all the time but i make no exaggeration in saying this entire plot was likely outlined in about 5 minutes when they came up with it how could anybody in the film industry take so little pride in the work they do me you 5th graders 70 years olds anybody has the ability to create a more engaging script than this    obviously children get a pass for liking this movie adults though shame on you if you did shame that will be your burden to bear not mine this movie doing so incredibly well i fear will have some very negative consequences on the film industry executives will look at this and think holy cow we can make how much money without any plot
Apr 29 2023,positive,great family movie keeps you interested the whole way i recommend to everyone all ages 1010
Apr 29 2023,positive,critics sucks i dont need to see these fake ugly critics reviews to see a masterpiece

Apr 29 2023,positive,this was a very fun movie id definitely recommend watching
Apr 29 2023,positive,1010 this movie is a thrilling ride its not deep or complex its just fun    mario games are rarely close to having deep thoughtprovoking plots why should a movie adaptation be any different its bright punchy actionpacked fun tied together with stunning visuals easter eggs galore and a killer soundtrack that embraces and builds upon the literal themes of mario games from the very beginning to the present the soundtrack alone is worth seeing this movie the movie being a fun time is just the icing on the cake the princess has baked for mario
Apr 29 2023,positive,this movie is provided nostalgia and good laughs throughout i would recommend for any nintendo or 80s fan
Apr 29 2023,positive,loved the movie 1010

Apr 29 2023,positive,while it has a short run time this spectacular film gives us buckling action and a fun story though you shouldnt go into this film expecting a heartfelt intense and impactful ride instead you should go into this film expecting fun and a simple story
Apr 29 2023,positive,a movie worth paying for great cast and cant wait for the ncu to be a thing
Apr 29 2023,positive,was well done loved all the references
Apr 29 2023,positive,nintendo and illumination did really have a great job with the actor in the movie chris pratt charlie day and jack black did are really good voice acting and the best video game movie in my opinion these critics are really trash its not about stuff that the president likes bro its just movie the people like the movie

Apr 29 2023,positive,i didnt like that the movie said it started at 425pm and then it didnt start till about 450 timing is important when ur with little children had too many commercials
Apr 29 2023,positive,amazing soundtrack and really funny
Apr 29 2023,positive,absolutely loved the movie as a 24yearold best highbudget familyfriendly movie in quite a while with its nintendobranded charm it was mostly perfect as fan of mario the only small nitpick is peachs personality is annoying at times but the story isnt bad considering the writing they gave her i still wish they didnt have to belittle mario by saying shes better than him in every way possible and when shes in distress she has no need for him and can fight bowser on her own its literally the reason she was created in the first place and they didnt have to take that away i hope they dont do the same thing with zelda or else all the nintendo princesses will feel samey and predictable i loved peach as a game character but when they have to step on mario to build her up its not as enjoyable as her loveable jolly sweet self in the games  i was actually skeptical on chris pratt as mario but i never once thought it didnt sound great even while he was doing the accent im genuinely impressed by how much his voice fit mario so well and i initially thought charlie day would be perfect as cartoon voice even before the movie was announced but sadly i didnt focus enough on luigis voice and actually might have thought he sounded slightly off ill confirm that once i rewatch the movie peachs voice oh god the way i hated her personality in those moments complemented so well how much i hated hearing her at that same time but thankfully i focused more on mario or bowser whenever she was around bowser sounded perfect and his writing was cheffs kiss and toad was kinda fine and not the best at times but i think i didnt hear enough of him so ill need to reconfirm that one too in the second watch as for seth as dk dang i think he sounded like an ahole and i know dk was a jerk in the movie but i didnt vibe with hearing him act and sound like a cocky seth rogan and i went auggh when i heard his stupid laugh thankfully they gave dk a bit of character with how hes perceived by his family that they made a somewhat funny joke about mario     soiler if youre gonna ask why can dk be fine when belittling mario but not peach  the answer is when dk was doing it it was understandably out of hate but not only that it was funny because hes in the same boat as mario but is ironically laughing at the same situation that he is in while when they were doing it with peach they were just making a fact out of how much peach is better than mario again it kinda makes sense given her past exposition but we were literally shown in brooklyn how mario was top of his acrobatic game but then he becomes a joke to peach    still despite the nitpicks in the story or voices its a mustwatch 1010 fantasy movie for all ages also the mario ova anime is still not bad at all and follows the same general story structure but the prince twist was a complete asspull that im glad not to see it happen again
Apr 29 2023,positive,my daughter and i thought it was excellent we seen the 3d movie

Apr 28 2023,positive,very good nintendo gave the fans everything they wanted a movie that revived our youth and made us remember that everything we lived in our youth through the consoles is still there  and once again demonstrate that the critics do not know what they are talking about and it would be better to remain silent  impeccable 5 stars

Apr 28 2023,positive,a homenage to every person that had the opportunity to play mario also a super adventure to the entire family awesome soundtrack and perfect animation
Apr 28 2023,positive,great movie all members of the family enjoyed the time spent  it is funny to read the expert reviewers comments they were expecting ghandi from a video game could it be that they do not understand that we the viewers are grateful for good old entertainment wonderful movie specially needed on these complex days
Apr 28 2023,positive,great movie very entertaining
Apr 28 2023,positive,it is not a very good movie  but is 1h30 of excellent fan service
Apr 28 2023,positive,i believe this movie gets an unfair rap from critics who fundamentally dont understand it or its target demographic theres a reason why the audience score is soaring off the charts on this one despite critics dunking on it its genuinely really good and i say this as someone who found every announcement and trailer about this movie to give all the telltale signs of a disaster waiting to happen    this movie is for two specific groups of people those who grew up with mario and are adults now and those who are kids and currently just getting into mario i feel like the critics dont seem to understand this and i can imagine going to this movie alone as an adult might leave a negative impression lets be clear about something this movie is intended to be watched by people who bring their friends or children to the theater the creators of this movie know exactly who their target demographic is and they bend to those groups hard which is exactly what you want from a movie like this i feel like a lot of other adaptations could learn from this movie about how your only real goal is to give people exactly what they want and expect from the source material    this movie is so unbelievably packed with mario references it should be taught in school about how you show off your product that has a long history everything from recreating the powerup sound effects to the mario bros plumbers inworld ad just adds to the richness of the marioverse here the musical score is especially impressive how it is constantly shifting to incorporate the different classic tracks in the middle of its normal background score it often only lasts for a few seconds but thats all thats needed to become leonardo dicaprio pointing at your screen in recognition the few pop music tracks stand out like sore thumbs though and bludgeon you over the head with the fact that youre watching a movie made by the minion people im sorry but its 2023 please stop using holding out for a hero the last acceptable use was in shrek 2 which is a parody of its own genre so it was acceptable now it just feels sad and like someone left the temp tracks in    one of my personal favorite aspects by far is how they handled luigi despite not getting as much screen time as he clearly deserves they fleshed out his character more than anyone elses and he actually gets a genuine character arc while remaining true to his core personality traits in the long running franchise our intro to him shows that he doesnt jump at all because he has bad knees thats for his brother to do mario runs ahead and opens up doors for him and in general makes his pathing easier something you would see the older sibling do in a 2 player mario game it also clearly draws a line in the sand that they are sticking to his own games roots where luigi simply doesnt jump in games such as luigis mansion speaking of which they also do a great job of showcasing his classic scaredycat trait by putting him in a haunted woods setting early on and we come ever so close to getting a full blown luigis mansion section i was a bit disappointed that it never fully went into that but i also understand they need to keep this movie short for kids    look im a pretty grumpy moviegoer overall and have a degree in film criticism so i tend to be pretty critical of what i watch but this movie is just pure joy funneled directly into your mouth my kids were literally dancing in the isle after the credits rolled and i had a dumb grin on my face are there things it could have done better oh absolutely but at the end of the day this is a magical nostalgia trip that plays it safe but usually in the best ways possible    also illumination in your next mario movie i formally request that you put in the mario dance from the original tv show series back in the day where the live action mario actor says do the mario and does his stupid little dance my kid loves that terrible show and i know a lot of other people have fond memories of it too and it just feels like a simple thing to add during an endcredits sequence especially since kids are already dancing in the isle as it is
Apr 28 2023,positive,this one is for my one and only true love  princess peach    peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
Apr 28 2023,positive,my kids give it a 5 star
Apr 28 2023,positive,excellent movie no weird business family friendly totally enjoyed it
Apr 28 2023,positive,its better than the 1993 super mario bros movie because animation is good than the liveaction movie
Apr 28 2023,positive,this movie is steeped in nostalgia its loaded with fan service but its been executed with finesse you can always tell when a movie has been made with the fans in mind and its clear that this one was crafted with a great deal of affection i was moved to tears with each cameo reference and easter egg i absolutely loved it
Apr 28 2023,positive,a very good movieif your a fan of the vide games must see
Apr 28 2023,positive,rotten tomatoes critics are sad people
Apr 28 2023,positive,it was an amazing film loved every little detailed they added for the film and the colors fit just right made me feel like a kid again
Apr 28 2023,positive,a respectful adaption done the right way its magical colorful and the relationships are well developed 5 stars
Apr 28 2023,positive,it was amzing i loved it very entertaining to watch especially in theaters
Apr 28 2023,positive,this was a great movie which connected to the video game story it stars mario and luigi two italian plumbers who find themselves in the mushroom kingdom trying to rescue princess toadstool from the evil king bowser and in the film strip it goes along those lines of princess peach prepares mario to square off against the allpowerful bowser to stop his plans from conquering the world along the way they make allies and enemies   the super mario brothers movie is a funny actionpacked and beautifully animated film with an underdog story and some fantastic worldbuilding that honours the game also the movie makes more sense if you have played any of the mario games and know the plot
Apr 28 2023,positive,amazing movie great plot great voice acting amazing sound track rotten tomatoes has no idea what theyre talking about
Apr 28 2023,positive,unlike the critics i think that this movie was not quite as terrible as it seems its a typical boxofficebreaker illumination movie but the property they chose to adapt is interesting because it has such a wide fanbase tell me what person today doesnt know who mario is the characters have been such a popculture phenomenon over decades people who havent played the game still probably know who he is because there are shirts toys tv shows memes and basically any other merchandise that you can think of with the characters on it i think that they did a good job with callbacks for the original fans and they did a good job with explaining it to younger kids who havent played mario or have never seen the characters before very young kids it had some good genuine laughs the peaches song hit billboard charts and can be nominated for an oscar after all there were some pacing issues but i think that all in all the shots were fantastic and the colors were definitely on point some animated movies have been a little off color lately and its nice to see some animators coming in with digital paintbrushes and using the bright colors liberally i dont agree with the celebrity acting and think that they should have brought back the original voices i know that the voices are for excitement and box office guarantee but i think the movie could have had good box office without celebrities in some scenes the acting falls a little flat for example chris pratts yahoo was not as resonant as the original actors take 45
Apr 28 2023,positive,really good movie love it
Apr 28 2023,positive,it started slow but then the action was great had a plausible plot with good suspense everybody will like it
Apr 28 2023,positive,anyone whos giving a negative critique to an animated movie about a video game for kids that 98 of the audience loved is an idiot

Apr 28 2023,positive,super mario was the best film this year it was fun from start to end
Apr 28 2023,positive,brought me back to all of my childhood i absolutely loved it
Apr 28 2023,positive,this is a movie that says do you love mario and nintendo do you remember all these small references do you want to have just pure fun cool here you we go     if you dont agree with the above statements the movie is clearly a 610 kids movie its nothing special in the plot department and i can admit to that however as a fan of nintendo and video gaming in general it was definitely an 810 for me the love respect and care for the established characters by illumination shows though im guessing nintendo put the boot down after the 1993 movie attempt its probably one of the best video game movies since the first 90s mortal kombat movie     its not perfect clearly but i appreciate that this movie is purely 100 mario bros and doesnt try to be anything else     im sure other critics are seething that a movie that respected fans and the property is doing well makes it all the better gonna see it a third time in japanese and to be honest im not even that big of a mario fan even though i did grow up with the games since the nes    suck it hollywood
Apr 28 2023,positive,this movie is amazing super fun please make more
Apr 28 2023,positive,movie was fun lots of game references i hope this is just the beginning of the ncu
Apr 28 2023,positive,this movie so good and awesome and i can see mario and luigi his mom and dad
Apr 28 2023,positive,definitely better than i expected the plot is simple easy to follow and traditional but the film is carried by its cast and world the sheer amount of love for the source material is evident in every scene of this movie definitely a good time
Apr 28 2023,positive,i thought it was an excellent movie it brought back a lot of nostalgia from my early days of playing video games it was just a clean fun cartoon with no underlying woke messaging added in
Apr 28 2023,positive,is not a oscar nominated screenplay movie but the combination of all its components mario luigi all the rest of the characters charm the colours the speed the nostalgia of the 80s and the videgame itself makes this movie so much fun to watch

Apr 28 2023,positive,comfortable seating good audio and popcorn was good but too expensive 
Apr 28 2023,positive,loved the soundtrack and had some really good jokes both current and nostalgic

Apr 28 2023,positive,i felt like i was playing the game loved it
Apr 28 2023,positive,great movie i love how they adjusted the themes and sounds from the game to the movie  they were obvious but subtle at the same time  the story line was splendid as well  the only is that i would have liked for the princess to fall in love with mario that piece of love would have been the cheery on top of the icecream   other than that it was awesome 
Apr 28 2023,positive,i love this movie so much its the best
Apr 28 2023,positive,far better than i expected it to be it didnt force real life topics onto the audience it was just entertainment that stayed close to the many mario games id like a version without the suggestion of suicide half a star off for that very dark attempt at humor
Apr 28 2023,positive,i love the movie it is the best illumination movie but the only problem is the critics they dont they only take one look and say its alright but no they just dont care so ignore the critics
Apr 28 2023,neutral,ok so this movie is more for kids of course it has some reference but was this fill 100 necesary i dont think so i mean it was good but not that good
Apr 28 2023,positive,great movie full of nostalgia and funny moments a must see
Apr 28 2023,positive,my 8yo granddaughter liked it a lot graphics were great and there was humor throughout
Apr 28 2023,positive,great humor and brought back lots of memories of the original game
Apr 28 2023,positive,if youre a nintendo fan this is probably the best film we could have ever expected the story lacks a little bit but besides that its an absolute blast
Apr 28 2023,positive,i loved this movie i was full of great references that were tastful and not overdone the plot was simple referenced the games but was still interesting enough to keep audiences captivated this is a must see weather or not you are a nentendo fan
Apr 28 2023,positive,it was fine go watch it or dont
Apr 28 2023,positive,loved it brought back so many memories loved the way they had so many easter eggs both through visuals and sound made me go home and hook up the wii again
Apr 27 2023,positive,it was family friendly  it was a cute movie and it didnt have a bunch of bs added talking points  it was just a cute film
Apr 27 2023,positive,hilarious great story so well done chriss pratt crushes it as mario all the main characters were so well cast and written job well done
Apr 27 2023,positive,woahhhhhh did not expect this masterpiece and coming from illumination crazy dont expect the best storyline of all time even though i personally think its great i love how fast paced this movie is the animation is great and i think the voice actors besides maybe fred armisen did really well its a very nice hour and a half which is what movies are meant for the music is beautiful a toptier soundtrack for any movie and the easter eggs are amazing i can see why people dont like this and thats because they dont play mario if you are a huge nintendo fan in general its a mustwatch good job illumination best work yet   1010
Apr 27 2023,positive,what an awesome movie for the whole family and integrates the arcade game excellently 
Apr 27 2023,positive,good happy movie that brings many childhood memories back if you played the video game
Apr 27 2023,positive,thats what a fan need a great video game based movie i watch the movie 3 times jack black as a bowser was completely perfect    and because they dont change anything
Apr 27 2023,positive,really liked it but im a mario fan since day one cant help it 
Apr 27 2023,positive,i just went to see the the super mario bros movie and i have to say i found it entertaining    as someone growing up playing the various games super mario bros world 64 new galaxy and etc i had an expectation that the movie would deliver nostalgia and that is exactly what it did visually the movie is stunning and you can tell that and you can tell that the animation team really put time and love into the project    however the movie is not without its faults the story is really fast paced and does not take its time to explore the characters on a deeper level why would peach blindly trust mario to save her world and why is mario so protective of his brother    i know it is a movie mostly aimed at super fans who know the story well and at kids who just want a good story so i will not slam the movie too hard for it    the movie is everything you expect from an animated super mario movie and i hope they make a super mario bros 2
Apr 27 2023,positive,without so much unnecessary travel it is a simple film but borders on the perfection of dynamism and understanding without needing so much prior
Apr 27 2023,positive,great movie it is entertaining for the entire family of all ages

Apr 27 2023,positive,despite being a servicable movie its still one of the best movies of all time
Apr 27 2023,positive,i think the mario movie was an amazing especially if you are a mario fan but even if you are not there is still so much to like the music and the action scenes
Apr 27 2023,positive,great family movie as an 80s baby this brings so much memories

Apr 27 2023,positive,the essence that it transmits is unbeatable the easter eggs the soundtrack everything is perfect
Apr 27 2023,positive,great graphics cool theme enjoyable just the storyline wasnt great
Apr 27 2023,positive,it accomplishes its own task be a nostalgic experience for the public who grew up with the games and a joyful experience for the youth with a simple plot as the games always were
Apr 27 2023,positive,i liked the superpowers they had it looks just like the video games of mario and the obstacles when browser was singing about peach he got interrupted by a servant it was hilarious
Apr 27 2023,positive,you know why disappointing people who dont know what a good movie is i am looking at the score this movie got and in soo undeserved in order to enjoy this movie you have to look past chris pratt as mario and look at this movie through the eyes of a 1980s kid this movie is the equivalent of a nostalgic movie and really does a great job capturing the main antagonist   great movie a good 5 in a half star 
Apr 27 2023,positive,my 5 year old loved it jack black was great as bowser
Apr 27 2023,positive,after reading the critiques im fairly certain that they didnt watch the same movie is it simplistic in plot absolutely its a movie based off a game that simplistic in nature but its simple fun great for kids and adults all alike especially if youre still a child at heart  its one of the first movies ive actually enjoyed going to a movie theater in years considering i typically much rather wait for the movie to go to a platform like amazon prime or disney  i definitely think if you get the opportunity to see it in theater do so
Apr 27 2023,positive,kids really enjoyed it i was just happy that we didnt have any potty breaks in the middle   loved the nostalgia and hidden gems scattered throughout the movie kudos id watch it again just to catch some more 
Apr 27 2023,positive,if you havent seen it yet go see it it was so good my inner child was hyped the whole time
Apr 27 2023,negative,this reimagined story of smb isnt even a good bad movie to watch not worth your time
Apr 27 2023,positive,its the best video game movie in the galaxy totally recommend seeing the movie to you rate it what ever you want but to me the super mario movie bros is a masterpiece
Apr 27 2023,positive,nostalgia city and music and very much a kids movie  while the plot is thin as any mario game has been lets save a princess  i had a lot of fun its a mario game come to life a very fun family night at the movies
Apr 27 2023,positive,this one movie is the best movie i have seen in years    the film critics clearly have never watched good fiction and are either brain dead or being paid by disney  i hope you take in this information

Apr 27 2023,positive,totally better than expected
Apr 27 2023,positive,really fun and lots of references
Apr 27 2023,neutral,story it didnt even seem like she liked mario i thought they were just friends and then they didnt even show any of the background like there were yoshys and we only see the onece and then we see a lot of people on the bridge and i didnt know there names they didnt talk they just were there then gone but ig it was ok but it was people next to me under a blanket makin sounds but thats it
Apr 27 2023,positive,the morning movie was so good just like in the games and the animation is very colorful and very fun
Apr 27 2023,positive,very good movie worth watching
Apr 27 2023,positive,all things mario universe were introduced throughout the movie super cute
Apr 27 2023,positive,it was a good movie wasnt entirely familiar with the series but it was enjoyable some of the preview trailers werent exactly kid friendly but the movie itself was pretty good
Apr 27 2023,positive,i loved all the game references and soundtrack it was so much fun to watch with my kids
Apr 27 2023,positive,it was fun  not for young children  but given the video games launching point  the writers created a shallow but entertaining story line
Apr 27 2023,positive,i liked it but didnt love it my kids did bc they still play super mario party and super mario brothers on the wii as well as the og nintendo mario brothers there are to many preludes to the sequel with yoshi and possibly the princessmario i also assumed luigi would play a bigger role i know that wasnt his part in the game but come on my guy had very little impact or screens
Apr 27 2023,neutral,pacing issues but the racing scenes were very fun
Apr 27 2023,positive,even though i was not exactly familiar with the mario brothers game i could enjoy the movie it was great fun and i loved it
Apr 27 2023,positive,if you grew up in the 20002010s playing mariokart new super mario bros galaxy etc youll love this movie

Apr 26 2023,positive,my son and i had a blast it was our first theater movie together and it was a great movie to see
Apr 26 2023,positive,honestly thought the movie was great it really lived up to video game counterpart better than i expected
Apr 26 2023,positive,in 1993 i watched the super mario bros movie with bob hoskins completely dumbfounded i was a child and a lover of nintendos mario games and this hollywood movie seemed to borrow more from 1989s batman or blade runner rather than the colorful world of the iconic video game    fast forward 30 years later i sat watching the credits of the new super mario bros movie surrounded by teenagers wondering why didnt we get this movie when i was a kid    there is no denying that super mario bros 2023 is a love letter to the original nintendo franchise and its generation of fans whether you grew up playing the original super mario bros super mario world mario 64 or the endless roster of games that are enjoyed by children today the movie seems to have callbacks for everyone even marios original arcade rival donkey kong appears in a standout scene  barrels and all    for those who know nothing about mario the premise is simple mario and his brother luigi are plumbers from brooklyn who get sucked into a world full of mushrooms ruled by princess peach who must face the evil king bowser who plans to force the princess hand into marriage in other words its the same premise as any of the games    if theres a moral to the story its to never give up in a scene where mario must train to do battle he continues to fail over and over again if he fails he goes back to the beginning and must start over its a very meta callback to the actual game where the player fails a level time and time again only to get better and better and finally achieve victory    if youre expecting high level cinema or something deeper beyond that you wont find it here though honestly i question anyone to expect that from a nintendo  illumination crossover its still bright and colorful has adorable characters as the film selfproclaims and is filled with fastpaced action its a fine film for parents to take their kids to and will certainly hit that nostalgia button for gamers of all ages
Apr 26 2023,positive,if you like chris prattcharlie dayor jack black than this film is for ui dont understand why people were hating on chris pratts mario voice mariohe maybe italian but hes not from italy in any versionhe has always been from brooklynplus this movie was almost exactly like the gamesapproved  overall rate9510
Apr 26 2023,positive,say what you will beautiful animations and visuals very nice references to the games and to the mario universe soundtrack was awesome as well its a vert fun movie
Apr 26 2023,negative,a barely tolerable watch nothing memorable here
Apr 26 2023,positive,honestly i dont get why some critics tried to destroy this movie i can actually tell that whoever worked on the movie are people that have good knowledge of the franchise and the ideas are original its not an awesome movie but its good to watch the characters are great and the fans of the most famous italian plumber are going to be satisfied with the different easter eggs of the videogame saga
Apr 26 2023,positive,fun full of nostalgia and game references  smb is a joy to watch even if the story is fairly basic
Apr 26 2023,positive,you can watch the movie here the super mario bros  
Apr 26 2023,positive,with many callbacks and highlights throughout nintendos run as a video game company the super mario bros movie is a blast for all fans of the most iconic hero even if it is a tad short for its own story
Apr 26 2023,positive,best family movie ive seen in years
Apr 26 2023,positive,this was a great movie i have seen it twice now  this also proves that most critics have no idea what they are talking about i mean honestly its amazing that they get paid and maybe thats the problem  dont listen to the paid schills go see the movie its awesome
Apr 26 2023,positive,i genuinely loved this movie so much i saw it on opening night with my mom in 4dx such a lifechanging experience with the best mario movie adaptation i will never forget it
Apr 26 2023,positive,loved the 3d great for all ages lots of action
Apr 26 2023,positive,definitely a good movie for the family and amazing nostalgia only two things are i wish they used more original music and it isnt really a rewatchable movie but other than that great time
Apr 26 2023,positive,i personally love this movie when i saw it at the movie theater it was amazing just amazing overall 1010 stars and 55 stars
Apr 26 2023,positive,this movie is soooo much fun for some reason critics dont like fun this is a kids movie that has something for the whole family and it doesnt try to be anything it isnt the characters feel like they should the are relatable and recognizable the movie is visually beautiful well worth a trip to the movies
Apr 26 2023,positive,this movie is the best movie of 2023 so far
Apr 26 2023,positive,it is a casual movie not a movie that will make you smear all over your makeup but that will never make the movie bad the movie is wonderful captivating full of creativity incredible to adults and kids watch dont be fooled by these critics who are used to films that make you cry until the end of the session because the real score is not 59 but 96
Apr 26 2023,positive,critics have given this movie mixed reviews and its not surprising in the least likely arent mario fans or were paid by disney to review bomb it  either way that doesnt take away from this film being an ode to all things mario and it being a very enjoyable watching experience  cant wait to watch it again and again and again when it gets a home release  definitely hoping to see a sequel with our dear sweet yoshi incorporated into the film along with some other beloved characters from the mario franchise
Apr 26 2023,positive,the movie was a blast it was a great mario adaptation if you are a fan you will enjoy it even more
Apr 26 2023,positive,created an account just to push the audience score up even further
Apr 26 2023,positive,this movie was so much fun its a mix of the right amounts of nostalgia comedy action which was pleasantly surprising considering the simple but fun nature of the original titles and the biggest concern the voices were great is it also your basic save the mushroom kingdom from bowser story yup and it was great every character was done super well too no pun intended and i for one cant wait for a sequel to see who joins the cast next i cannot wait for the movie to release on vudu where i will be promptly buying it to watch what i assume is pretty frequently alongside other titles i do that with
Apr 26 2023,negative,mid as hell proof the average movie goer just wants bright lights cheap laughs and faux emotion thats fine art is subjective but under the commonly accepted standard of cinema its nothing special
Apr 26 2023,positive,i thought this movie was great funny and the paying homage to the all the different mario games and other classic games like dk was awesome
Apr 26 2023,positive,not the most emotionally riveting piece of cinema but i loved every second and was smiling from ear to ear from nintendos surprisingly modest logo to the postcredits scene

Apr 26 2023,positive,the pacing is odd the story is pretty thin and theres one or two questionable uses of licensed music other than that this movie hits all its marks and gives the audience everything they should be expect from a super mario movie fun my hope is that the sequel takes its time and lays down a soild foundation for us to watch these characters shine

Apr 26 2023,positive,warning one part of this review includes spoilers this movie is nothing to what i expected this movie is amazing stargazing colorful and i can go on and on about this movie first of all the animation is fabulous for it being illumination the people who made hop although illumination made some bad and bland movies in its time this movie had a good animation with colorful bright skies in the mushroom kingdom the fiery scenery in bowsers castle the icy plains of the penguins kingdom i dont remember the band of the kingdom i think its just called ice land and the light calm way the movie started with mario  luigis nice peaceful hometown brooklyn it was a good way to keep me entertained lastly all the references make it so fun for the people who remember the old classic 1980s1990s games for example the beginning of the movie after bowser gets the star the movie pops up to the plumbing commercial they made but the lyrics from the first 10 seconds is the theme from the super mario bros super show the girl in the plumbing commercial in the beginning saying thank you super mario bros it seems like the only thing you havent drained is my bank account is princess peach also from the super mario bros super show the cast is also perfect chris pratt was actually not bad for being mario and same thing for seth rogen as being donkey kong dont listen to what other people say about it give it a try

Apr 26 2023,positive,visuals and characters were good movie felt rushed it felt like they just tried to cover as much of existing mario world things and easter eggs into a movie thats not even 2 hours long they should have first focused on mario luigi princess peach and bowser in this movie later they should have released movies introducing the rest of the characters and worlds

Apr 26 2023,positive,the movie is entertaining but i didnt feel like a story as such but the mario game itself doesnt have a story so it can take unexpected turns or something like that
Apr 26 2023,neutral,it was just ok i feel like illumination usually does a better job inserting humor for the parents to enjoy the show too this has none of that 
Apr 26 2023,positive,movie is incredible a must see for any mario or video game fans a blast from start to finish i didnt expect to enjoy it as much as i did
Apr 26 2023,positive,this movie is the proof that you so called self proclaimed critics are living in your own reality and have no clue what people want or like subjective selfproclaimed idiots the people have spoken and do not care what you idiots say and this movie has made history for big kids in us and and small kids a like

Apr 25 2023,positive,movie was great loved all the references and characters
Apr 25 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a colorful action adventure film that is so much more than just an easter egg hint
Apr 25 2023,positive,its going to be exactly what you imagined dozens of nuances from your childhood lots of references and energy you already know about its a ok story however its more focused on mario and his complex of being small and forgotten as a person great for the kids cool enough for the adults but overall its a b and we did go on matinee for 5 so it seems appropriate
Apr 25 2023,positive,better then the mario from 1993
Apr 25 2023,positive,this movie was greatest movie i ever watched

Apr 25 2023,positive,i had an amazing time  loved the movie and all references
Apr 25 2023,positive,an outstanding movie the fast pacing may have been the worst part for me but as a mario fan i enjoyed every last bit of frame that nintendo and illumination could offer
Apr 25 2023,positive,great movie for the kids and adults great sound a picture for movie enthusiasts i recommend seeing in a dolby dedicated theater
Apr 25 2023,positive,this is an amazing movie sure the pacing is slow and peach really doesnt have a strong reason to take mario with her but if you ignore this details this is a fun movie to watch on your free time

Apr 25 2023,positive,great family film with giggles and great colorful visuals for the kids and plenty of humor that will resonate with adults on top of that there are a ton of easter eggs and nods to the games history
Apr 25 2023,positive,amazing all the way through all the rotten tomatoes reviewers obviously never played any of the video games included every single mario game ever to have been and the music was perfect peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
Apr 25 2023,positive,they missed a great opportunity to use the music from the game or remixes of music from the game and instead used cheesy songs which insult the audience the music ruined it animation was good seth rogans character was hilarious
Apr 25 2023,positive,great movie very funny
Apr 25 2023,positive,great movie that kept me and my family entertained for 1hrs 32min mind blowing graphics with excellent story
Apr 25 2023,positive,the critics just dont understand this movie because theyve never played a super mario bros game in their lives this movie was pure fan service for older gens like me who grew up playing the original nes and snes games and its child friendly enough to keep kids attention throughout the entire film its one of the best animated films ive seen in a long while and its a simple movie and thats okay we dont need or want a big complicated plot for mario just a movie that cares about the audience and the source material
Apr 25 2023,positive,this movie is awesome i felt like a kid again 
Apr 25 2023,positive,if your are a mario fan you must see this movie its pretty funny even if your are not a mario fan its still freely good im not too much of a mario fan but its really good
Apr 25 2023,positive,it was a good movie and having chris as mario actually worked well  could have been longer though good for adults and kids alike 
Apr 25 2023,positive,a movie for every age it was very awesome the references the soundtrack and of course the scenaries were just very good the story is simple yes but we cant be angry with illumination because the story of super mario games are exactly the same i recommend this movie very much and for a great experience watch the movie at the cinema
Apr 25 2023,positive,so much fun for the whole family
Apr 25 2023,positive,all movie critics were portrayed as snobs cringe

Apr 25 2023,positive,really loved this movie it was a simple story but with great animation giving personality to the characters i hope theres more to come
Apr 25 2023,positive,a love letter for fans so many easter eggs every 5 seconds for multiple games at different generations the orchestra was incredible with so many ost remakes the movie is very true to what the games are and thats the best part kudos to nintendo not allowing hollywood ruin this videogame film voice acting was on point most of the time overall fun movie for everyone the cinema was packed with laughter i am really excited to see where this is going i hope videogame makers can adapt more if their games to movies but please keep them close to the concept of the games do not invent or add innecesary stuff
Apr 25 2023,positive,very fun movie with tons of nostalgia probably on the shorter side as i couldve used a little bit more
Apr 25 2023,positive,it was amazing i definitely want to see a sequel
Apr 25 2023,positive,this is the best movie you must watch at home or in the theaters
Apr 25 2023,negative,this movies plot does not exist characters motivations does not exist scenes are mashed together and they go from a to z without a single explanation also chris pratt voice acting is atrocious
Apr 25 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic the animation was good the music was incredible and the characters and vice actors gave off a perfect performance and i cant wait to see more of marios adventures in more films
Apr 25 2023,positive,the movie is great the acting the music the colors were great and its good it brings me back to when i played the new super mario bros 2 game and mario kart but theres is one more about the movie and its yoshi in the ending of the film
Apr 25 2023,negative,the movie was really bed i was counting the secounds
Apr 25 2023,positive,very good adaptation of the games id say id watch it 100000 times more please watch the film thank you
Apr 25 2023,positive,a pleasant funny film full of fan service which could also appeal to adults the problem is that the pace of the film is very fast there is never a moment of pause
Apr 25 2023,negative,thought it would have more low key adult humor   movie was just a rushed story for 8 yr olds w add  being raised with super mario it doesnt have anything for the adults who were brought up playing the games
Apr 25 2023,positive,very good fun i probably wont ever watch it again but i enjoyed the first go around thanks for sticking to the original theme and not bending to the new diversity occult going on
Apr 25 2023,positive,as a nintendo fan this is a homage to the franchise and a fresh start for mario and friends to the movie screen  the hand of mrmiyamoto is the one that keeps everything into nintendo high standards
Apr 25 2023,positive,it was the best family movie ive seen in years my entire family was singing bowsers peaches song on the way out it was a memory i will never forget
Apr 25 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie ushers in a new era of quality video game adaptations following mario and luigi as they navigate a whimsical world to save brooklyn with a starstudded voice cast featuring chris pratt anya taylorjoy and jack black this 90minute adventure is packed with easter eggs and nostalgia at the same time some critics may not appreciate the film but fans and kids adore it hinting at a promising future for nintendo movies
Apr 25 2023,positive,let me start this review by saying this is a movie for fans critically it doesnt have a great life changing story or a quentin tarantino script but if you are someone that has played any of the mario games you are gonna love this movie it is filled to the brim with video game references and easter eggs it is fun and explosive and doesnt spend any time planting a great foundation for it to start with the action it is funny in all the good ways the only major thing i would mainly critique is the separation of mario and luigi at the beginning of the film hence to them having great chemistry together
Apr 25 2023,positive,once again the critics show that the audience score is the one to trust they are so out of touch on what makes great movies for its genre this killed it
Apr 25 2023,positive,nostalgic my family had a lot fun watching this movie
Apr 25 2023,positive,fun all the way through for mario fans of all ages love all the video game references throughout
Apr 25 2023,positive,mario was fire this is what fans have wanted from game adaptations you dont need to subvert the lore or shove modern political ideology just to appease certain groups make a film that connects with audiences this one nailed it i spent the whole time beaming with a smile nintendo please do zelda or metroid or punch out next
Apr 25 2023,positive,the movie was great i had an incredible time
Apr 25 2023,positive,very fun movie with great visuals i recommend it for everyone but especially nintendomario fans because of all the amazing references
Apr 25 2023,negative,im not sure if i didnt like this because i had such high expectations or because it was simply bad but i definitely will not be watching this again
Apr 25 2023,positive,i think its a great movie it has a funny element its really funny but hes missing a bit of a plot
Apr 25 2023,negative,the graphics were nice  but there was just no real heart in this movie mario didnt sound like what mario should sound like
Apr 25 2023,positive,fantastic fun funny and very entertaining
Apr 25 2023,positive,the no1 video game and super mario movie of all time    im not a person who normally criticize or comment on movies however after watching this film i would like to include my perspective as well    this movie has definitely awoken my childhood from my body i enjoyed every single moment of this actionpacked family film and i must say that i give both nintendo and illumination all the credit from taking this spectacular initiative for finally introducing a movie that has actually broken many barriers and boundaries in our globalized society despite what the critics deemed it to be    i absolutely love everything about this movie from the awesome characters the iconic video game soundtracks all the way to the brilliant cast that was presented in this movie the storyline of this movie definitely meet the requirements of the super mario gaming concepts that the world is familiar with and adores so much it may not be classified as an academy award winning movie yet it is without a doubt a movie that people of all ages have enjoyed on a regular basis especially those who truly comprehend and appreciate the super mario legacy furthermore this movie has opened up the eyes of the entire world thus convincing billions of fans what super mario has to offer and how much joy mario has given around the globe    in conclusion i consider myself to be very lucky and proud to be a part of this glorious moment in my timeline where this movie has finally come into existence and that mario has always continued to become a major impact on peoples lives and the popularity of mario will always continue to grow i sincerely hope that this move will continue to flourish and that the box office will recognize this film as one of the greats not only in terms of its revenue but of a very high standard of cinematography i am keeping my fingers crossed expecting this movie to make at least 1billion    way to go mario wahooo
Apr 25 2023,positive,the movie told a great and captivating story i dont know why critics thought otherwise but the movie was simply a masterpiece from the score to the animation everything was just perfect i know everyone thought chris pratt wouldnt be a great mario but his performance was incredible he proved us all wrong 1010 movie
Apr 25 2023,positive,definitely the movie of all time would watch again
Apr 25 2023,positive,this movie demonstrates how official movie reviewers are totally off sync with general audience this movie is exactly what i expected a simple kids story full of references to the game from its earlier version to its current one
Apr 25 2023,positive,could be a little longer but it was good
Apr 25 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing from start to finish if youre a mario fan its an absolute treat and a must see if youve never touched a mario game before youll still have fun watching this film the critics are absolutely wrong about this movie i have watched this 3 times now and can say all 3 times were a blast sure the pacing and story have issues but a this is a 90 minute kids film i dont understand what critics were expecting and b who really plays a mario game for the story its all about the action     the critics have been mean to this movie but it does not deserve it at all this is why modern criticism is so agonizing i dont understand why some people cant just enjoy whats in front of them especially this movie an absolute blast to watch dont listen to the critics
Apr 25 2023,positive,it really was just the bare minimum for a movie like this am still excited for the future of the ncu
Apr 25 2023,positive,was the best video game based movie ever highly recommended to anyone who absolutely loves mario 
Apr 25 2023,positive,such an enjoyable film story was simple but the characters the animation the visuals and game references were all so fun
Apr 25 2023,positive,i know its a crazy idea in 2023 but illumination nintendo showed real courage and made a movie that is entertaining familyfriendlyactually and doesnt ignore its source material was the story really deep and meaningful nope is seth rogans voice like a cheese grater on the brainmy personal opinion yup but the characters were fun the visuals were fun and the humor was fun its a fun movie and thats what the vast majority of people want right right so if you want to have fun enjoy a clean familyfriendly movie with your kids without being forcefed propaganda go see it and see it a couple of times i did
Apr 25 2023,positive,it was awesome probably the best family movie we had in a long time  the kids had fun reactions and i thought it was fun as an adult  i did grow up with nintendo and earlier systems but i havent kept up too heavily with all the mario games as an adult though i have casually observed the games my kids play on the switch  i thought it was neat how they included donkey kong in the story
Apr 25 2023,positive,music 910  its no surprise that the mario movie will feature some iconic music from the video game franchise the music is such an important part of the mario experience and its likely that the movie will use these tunes to great effect a score thats faithful to the games but also fresh and updated for a modern audience could be a great addition to the movie    references 910  another exciting aspect of the mario movie is the potential for references to the games and other media in the mario universe fans are hoping for easter eggs nods and cameos that will make them feel nostalgic and rewarded for their dedication to the franchise however theres a risk of going overboard with references and relying too heavily on fan service its a fine balance that the movie will have to strike    visuals 1010  it was really surprising  to know this was a illumination movie compared to the studios more mediocre movies this one was a breath of fresh air it was a nice breakaway from the boring despicable meesk visuals this movie could be the start of a illumination golden era    plot 710  this is perhaps the biggest unknown when it comes to the mario movie while we know that the movie will feature mario and his friends on an adventure we dont yet know what that adventure will entail theres a risk of a plot thats too thin or too reliant on action and spectacle without enough heart or character development however with the right writers and directors on board the mario movie could surprise us with a clever and engaging story that stays true to the spirit of the games    overall i think that this movie was generally a great watch for any generation  especially for those who grew up with mario however i think it does have its problems such as a more predictable plot but that is mostly espected from a kids movie overall a 45  super stars
Apr 25 2023,positive,while its not saying much this is one of the best movies illumination has ever made the writing was subpar at times and some of the soundtrack choices are rather uninspired but overall its a thrilling ride from beginning to end
Apr 25 2023,positive,great visuals and an overall fun movie for our family
Apr 25 2023,positive,if you grew up playing mario or even if you didnt this movie was awesome the visuals of the movie are amazing and there are so many moments were i was just caught up in the amazing graphics the movie had i would 100 recommend this movie to anyone
Apr 25 2023,positive,this movie was fun it also didnt have any agenda which was so nice to see
Apr 25 2023,positive,great movie highly recommend
Apr 25 2023,positive,it feels good to see a movie with my kids with no worries about agendas the movie was an 810 though i give it a 1010 for being truly familyfriendly
Apr 25 2023,positive,great movie  my son was so thrilled to see the movie and was not disappointed  god bless chris pratt and the rest of the cast  so nice to see movies that just want to entertain without an agenda
Apr 25 2023,positive,this movie was excellent the critics score is ridiculous this was the first time in years i felt my time at the theatre was well spent our whole family loved it from our toddler to our tweens to their grandparents we were all filled with absolute delight and joy upon leaving the theatre its nostalgic yet fresh super fun and sweet the music was re orchestrated beautifully and perfectly placed it was simply pure entertainment no agendas no politics just a fantastic family movie that paid homage to characters beloved by generations without overindulgent fan service or totally destroying the source it was so balanced and respectful i will be honest cinema has been terrible the last few years so i had my reservations but it honestly was fantastic this is what family films should be made of

Apr 25 2023,positive,great music funny story and relatable characters
Apr 25 2023,positive,the super mario movie breaks the curse of video game movies in that it was clearly made by people whom both understand and respect the source material its a fun ride with plenty of nods to marios many many adventures and spin offs    i wasnt sure on the castings but chis and jack  knock their roles out of the park and seth grew on me as the movie moved on    its not perfect it felt somewhat rushed at parts and certainly suffers from first movie syndrome where it has to set up a universe     however its a strong first step for nintendos push into the movie industry and i look forward to their next projects
Apr 25 2023,positive,lets be real  the move is a little light on character development and dept of the story  the movie assumes you know something about the world of nintendo and mario  besides that it is a fun movie without any swj agenda disney should learn from this movie  its a pure entertainment not a lecture
Apr 25 2023,positive,loved this movies it was fun simple story line that kept me entertained through out the whole movie
Apr 25 2023,positive,60 yall r crazy this movie in 3d was nonstop fun incredible movie

Apr 24 2023,positive,if youre a mario fan youll love it great movie to watch with friends or with your kids its very fun and hectic never slowing down and its full of fanservice for the game fans do yourself a favor and ignore the professional critics theyre out of touch and evidently havent played mario since the super nintendo days
Apr 24 2023,positive,pretty telling that audiences by and large enjoyed this movie and critics kinda didnt    it is funny watching movie critics be upset at a silly kids movie as if it were supposed to accomplish the same thing as a 3hour thriller drama period piece
Apr 24 2023,positive,the effects are very good the memes that get in may not be but that does not mean that it is not a great movie with many references that a fan of the mario saga might like
Apr 24 2023,positive,its a really awesome movie even ive seen the movie in 3d it was a blast
Apr 24 2023,positive,a great fun family movie and if you played mario or nintendo when you were growing up its even more awesome  im not sure what the critics were watching or why would they think a family or kids focused movie should be other than fun  i want to play mario kart now 
Apr 24 2023,positive,i loved that the movie had something from every generation starting in the 80s i laughed out loud several times and that is not common highly recommend for 2d players to 3d
Apr 24 2023,positive,finally a company got a video game movie right use all the tropes all the call backs all the nostalgia and forget anyone who complains about it give the people what they want and they freaking want mario and now i want this movie as a video game to play
Apr 24 2023,positive,as a lifelong fan of mario and nintendo this film had me smiling from start to finish although the pacing and story take a backseat during the length of the film the pure enjoyment i received while watching completely make up for any issues would watch a third time if i could

Apr 24 2023,positive,i love the movie it was incredible
Apr 24 2023,positive,this movie is great for families and people who have played super mario games in the past
Apr 24 2023,positive,loved the movie laughed my butt off
Apr 24 2023,positive,the best way to put how i feel about the mario movie is a resounding eh there are some great scenes in the film but overall it feels lacking the plot department there are a staggering amount of easter eggs to be found but the minuscule boost in serotonin could not save this movie from feeling mediocre i watched the movie on a weekend packed with families and their children the theatre was quiet i cant tell if the kids were just so engaged they could not react or that the movie just missed on the jokes but ultimately i came walking away wondering who this movie was for it didnt seem to hit with the kids that you think an illumination movie would hit but its also does not hold up as a film that adults would enjoy past the nostalgia or easter eggs however with those critiques aside the animation was great everything looked amazing the dialogue was way better than expected the bowser line from the trailer on universal canadas youtube ive finally found it now whos gonna stop me is taken out and replaced with something else and the mario line mushroom kingdom here we come was removed entirely     this is definitely worth supporting as there is probably going to be a mario cinematic universe but if you are one of those people that dont like theatres then wait until the movie comes to streaming platforms i would love to see how they improve down the line heres hoping it improves as well or better than the marvel cinematic universe or we get that one outstanding film like a spiderverse
Apr 24 2023,positive,seen it twice with my son were about to go see it in 3d  its extremely fun i wish they wouldve had more interactions between dk and mario other than that one scene  the dialogue is just okay nothing amazing but the deliveries are great i loved chris pratts performance
Apr 24 2023,positive,amazing fun movie with tons of callbacks and fresh fun you should go see it fun for the whole family
Apr 24 2023,positive,great fun i 45 thoroughly enjoyed it and my daughter 3 loved it  a love letter to anyone that has grown up with the franchise
Apr 24 2023,positive,great awesome and totally incredible and super good
Apr 24 2023,positive,oh yeah letsago
Apr 24 2023,negative,as a life long fan of mario since the 80s ive experienced the good and the bad of the franchise i saw mario go from silent hero to goofy and vocally expressive legend the voice acting in the movie was an insult to anybody familiar with the franchise     animation was decent though
Apr 24 2023,positive,awesome movie direct to the nostalgic 
Apr 24 2023,positive,i was worried for my childhood memories of mario games before going into this movie and i came out very relieved the movie was done so cleverly and i love how they connected the nintendo characters i see this becoming like marvel eventually as they interconnect nintendo characters it was impressive how they were able to include so many classic parts of the different mario games and levels while still keeping it consistent and believable all age groups will enjoy this equally
Apr 24 2023,positive,me and my friends had a great time this movie felt like watching a video game because of the platform sequences and action if youre a mario fan youre gonna have a blast
Apr 24 2023,positive,a fun enjoyable movie that the whole family can love with funny characters and scene highly recommend

Apr 24 2023,negative,this movie kept the attention of some of the children howeve lost of the adults in the theater were asleep suggesting a lack of depth of character for more mature audiences
Apr 24 2023,negative,little to no arcs bad comedy and stupid plot points unless your a really big fan of mario dont watch this movie
Apr 24 2023,positive,mariobrosmovie  is a dream come true for fans amazing voice actingvisualscomedy and a tsunami of nostalgia filled easter eggs topped with a simple but fun story jackblack rocks as bowser and the mario kart segment was beautiful
Apr 24 2023,positive,currently i work in 3d animation and i must say that i loved this mario bros movie from all the technical and artistic aspects its impeccable entertaining and suitable for all audiences
Apr 24 2023,positive,i thought it was a amazing movie absolotly loved it but mostlikely is going to take a while to come out on digital but other wise super good especialy when boswer sang peaches

Apr 24 2023,positive,a very good family movie made me laugh a bit and so many references to the actual games
Apr 24 2023,positive,it was good i really liked the classic mario sounds and songs
Apr 24 2023,positive,i grew up playing super mario and i now have preteens who have followed the brothers in their many sagas the movie was fun and nostalgic and the plot kept my attention the whole time seeing princess peaches bowzer mario  luigi as more than 2 dimensional characters around themes of family girl power and loyalty forced me to see the video game from a completely different lens welldone
Apr 24 2023,positive,great movie for the whole family jones were funny and clean no hidden agendas it was refreshing to just be entertained
Apr 24 2023,positive,it was the best movie ever i love the graphics
Apr 24 2023,positive,as someone who played all the mario games growing up it was cool to see all the references to all the video games and all the characters i wish they included a couple more yoshi funky kong birdo the kooplings but theres probably gonna be a second one so im not complaining the soundtrack was pure nostalgia overall if youre a fan of mario you should definitely watch this
Apr 24 2023,positive,the kids liked it having grown up on nintendo and mario games i thought this movie would entertain me but i wouldnt see it again expected it to be as entertaining as the lego movie but meh
Apr 24 2023,positive,me and my son 7 loved it from start to finish being a early 90s kid i wanted to see it just as much as my boy didnt tell him that though lol
Apr 24 2023,positive,the super mario movie is a masterpiece and every detail is appreciated and the people who give the movie bad reviews is because they dont appreciate the great mining along with nintendo every detail also with easter eggs that are appreciated  thank you ilumination and nintendo for this and obviously since it doesnt have a very deep story the critics are going to hate it also the music is very good and you can see the effort they put into several songs anyway i have nothing more to say its not that im a fan of super mario but in summary it is a suitable movie for super mario fans thanks for reading
Apr 24 2023,positive,it was great just being able to watch an entertaining movie without a bunch of propaganda thrown in my face very enjoyable for all ages
Apr 24 2023,positive,great nostalgic trip down memory lane and a good popcorn flick
Apr 24 2023,positive,kids loved it absolutely the right amount of time for a kids movie as for myself as nostalgic as it was i felt like i wanted more by far a great origin story
Apr 24 2023,positive,dont listen to critics this is a fun kids movie it doesnt break any formulas or destroy any standards but it shows a movie can stand out just by following a formula well jack black does an amazing bowser and i think hes probably the highlight of the film a bunch of fun a bunch of clever references and the soundtrack is used brilliantly
Apr 24 2023,positive,a really well made movie for nostalgic people had several elements that just tapped into my childhood would definitely watch again
Apr 24 2023,positive,grandson 11 autistic loved it at times a little loud for him
Apr 24 2023,positive,i loved it the cast was amazing and so was the animation one thing that could have been improved was the backstories and such i think it would have been cool if peach met her parents at the end
Apr 24 2023,positive,keeping the bias in check not amazing loved it bc it was made for a big mario fan like me wish it was 10 minutes longer and luigi did more but i dig it
Apr 24 2023,positive,this movie was the best movie i love how many easter eggs there are in just one scene its my new favorite movie of all time i can watch this over and over 10

Apr 24 2023,positive,perfect this movie was made for people who love mario everything was spectacular voices were perfect this is what every one loves about mario brought to film
Apr 24 2023,positive,i loved the design and abstract style of the movie it really captivated all of the previous mario games except for mario galaxy but totally understandable every actor did amazing as their characters loved jack black and the voice actor for the blue psychotic luma in the cage
Apr 24 2023,positive,personally this movie was very enjoyable i saw it the day it came out and i must say jack black was an amazing bowser
Apr 24 2023,positive,just saw it yesterday i liked it enough it did have a lot of cute laughs not kneeslapping humor but i giggled i wish the climax werent so overthetop and adding jack black was a great decision that peaches song is great i like this better than the sonic movies
Apr 24 2023,positive,this movie is amazing for casual viewers and hardcore fans of the mario franchise like myself     pros  stunning visuals  tons of fun callbacks to mario media from all eras of the francise  wellwritten characters  great voice acting yes including  chris pratt    cons  way to short 1hr 30min  characters like luigi get too little screen time  mario never gets the fire flower are you kidding me    verdict  9510 would recommend to anyone as a fun film to be enjoyed by families casuals and hardcore fans but apparently not critics
Apr 24 2023,positive,disney should take notes this is how family entertainment is done
Apr 24 2023,positive,i loved how illumination adapted almost every mario game into the film i was worried how they would fit all that into a short film but the pacing was fantastic in my opinion there wasnt a minute where the pace slowed down for me i think the only negative i had was that we didnt see yoshi lol but thats a minor gripe
Apr 24 2023,positive,love to see top critics that defined wakanda forever a genremashing drama gave cocaine bear great reviews and wrote that turning red tackles more mature subject matter bashing a video game movie for not being interesting enough    is a fun movie much better than the aformentioned ones it doesnt pretend to be more than it is and shouldnt
Apr 24 2023,positive,pretty fun had a blast the cast were great the characters are very fun at points the plot is a little bit rushed but i didnt mind it still a good time gotta be honest though i wouldve liked to see more screen time for luigi and some other characters but its fine 710

Apr 24 2023,positive,critics hate it audiences absolutely loved it time to do some firing rotten tomatoes no one has trusted your reviews for years
Apr 24 2023,positive,the much awaited super mario bros movie is a triumphant return to what cgi animated films should be to be fun inspiring and entertaining universal pictures  illumination entertainment has hit the hundred 1ups with nintendo
Apr 24 2023,positive,the enormous disparity between critic and viewer reviews further solidifies my distrust of critics these socalled professionals are either completely disconnected from reality or had a shitty childhood im sure if there had been transgender gay or other progressive messaging this wouldve been certified fresh
Apr 24 2023,positive,great movie i have 4 kids different age groups and they loved the movie finally a movie for kids that is just that a movie for kids no propaganda no agendas just an entertaining movie thank you

Apr 24 2023,positive,this is a wonderful kids movie filled with a lot of nintendo nostalgia as it should be and childish humor my daughters loved it and i found myself laughing through most of the film
Apr 24 2023,positive,first of all the storyline is simple with certain switches it starts of without giving origin stories just a point in a timeline the darker enemy was only on the background and gives mario a longer time to discover himself the actiongames are fantastic mario kart mario powerups its as fun as one can get and gives the moneys worth
Apr 24 2023,positive,even if youre not a nintendo fan youre really going to like this movie if you are a fan of nintendo youll love this movie a lot of easter eggs through out take your kids to see it take your date to see it take yourself to see it you wont be disappointed

Apr 24 2023,positive,i wrote a screenplay for an animated mario movie 13 years ago every year i held onto the hope but i was more or less convinced it would never happen until now     this was an incredible and special experience for me the sophisticated film critics have no place here
Apr 24 2023,positive,really great tackles every single aspect of mario bros games leaves space for more in the future  beautiful animation easter eggs and clever ways to approach elements of the games that would be harder to place into the storytelling
Apr 24 2023,positive,the movie honored the source material and was nice to look at  the plot was straightforward while not being too high stakes  some of the voice acting choices were questionablesaved by strong performances and decent writingbut mario and peach felt not quite 100 right  unfortunately they were two of the main characters so that is a bit of a problem  but even with that the movie on the whole was enjoyable and something that i look forward to seeing more of  and given the strong box office performance i am confident we will see a lot more  heres to nintendoillumination go for the smash brothers initiative
Apr 24 2023,positive,i was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed this film with my kids it doesnt try to do too much just lets us enjoy being in the super mario world my kids range from 113 years old and they all loved it
Apr 24 2023,positive,i took my 7 year old and his friend it was a great kid movie for them  they werent required to understand the nostalgia to get the plot for me tho they did a fantastic job of incorporating all of the great nostalgia from my childhood playing nes its like this is the true story that nintendo based the game on

Apr 24 2023,positive,story wise just ok voice cast seems miscast but other than that i quite enjoyed the movie its definitely one of the better illumination movies the animation is amazing as a nintendo fan the easter eggs are very cool i love the scenes with mario and luigi and it said that we didnt get more of that and chris pratt isnt that bad i think a lot of people have the same consensus here that its just alright the video game movies have been getting better and better so i am looking forward to potential sequels a zelda movie markipliers iron lung and the fnaf movie a fine piece of 90 minute entertainment
Apr 24 2023,positive,the cgi is so good looks amazing

Apr 24 2023,positive,it was an entertaining movie however it isnt the kind of movie that i would watch over and over like top gun maverick
Apr 24 2023,positive,i loved the movie and thought it was great i liked how there was a reference to a bunch of different games but i dont like that they missed a really obvious smash bros reference some could say the fight between mario and donkey kong was a smash bros reference but it didnt saydo anything like smash bros if it was me i probably would have had the fight line from smash or and announcer saying something like mario joins the battle right before he walked in thats just me tho
Apr 24 2023,positive,ok its a kids movie and theres lots of nostalgia for grownups it was not boring and had some good humor not a lot of moments where you can expect an emotional connection all and all enjoyable think of it as a movie targeted to children and youll be happy
Apr 24 2023,positive,it was a really funny movie to enjoy with the family we got to laugh so much together and as fans of the game we enjoyed seeing the easter eggs they added into the movie what really settled the movie for me was the elements in the film such as sound visuals and effects that really amaze me as they tell the tale of the super mario brothers
Apr 24 2023,positive,nostalgic great for the whole family
Apr 24 2023,positive,this was a great family movie

Apr 24 2023,positive,lacking yoshi in the movie by bum was hurt where the hell was kirby
Apr 24 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie i never thought a good mario movie would be possible i do wish there was a larger story but what we got was perfect i dont really see what the plot would be for a sequel there is a lot of room for a sequel i just hope they put more effort and make a longer story than this one the only negative for me is that it was too short but im gonna rate this any lower this was a masterpiece overall
Apr 24 2023,neutral,first of all id like to say the animation is some of the best ive seen and its great to see illuminations talent utilized in a such a color filled world other positives to note is that i did chuckle a few times but most of the funny bits are in the trailer i also thought they gave mario and the rest of the characters a passable origin story without using up too much time now for the negatives i think they could have included more jokes or improved on the ones they had the story was as simple as you can make it i wish they were a little more creative with the ending my main gripe is the inclusion of pop songs in a friggin nintendo movie nintendo has an amazing catalogue of songs to use just stick with that we dont need another movie with an acdc song in it the voice acting was passable but not amazing either literally anyone could replace them and it would be ok overall its a kids movie and it shows i just wish the director could make it more entertaining for adults as well i would love a luigis mansion movie or other spinoffs it would be great if nintendo starts releasing zelda and metroid too
Apr 24 2023,positive,amazing loved seeing my favorite game and characters brought to life every detail was spot on im honestly considering going back to see it again loved it
Apr 24 2023,positive,genuinely wholesome and funny movie the characters were authentic to their origins and my whole family enjoyed themselves
Apr 24 2023,positive,what i like is that you would see and hear almost every song or place the game would show
Apr 24 2023,positive,i loved the nostalgia of it all i felt that the movie was very well done as well as action packed and gripping to the end 10 out of 10 for me
Apr 24 2023,positive,it was amazing  brought me back to my childhood  hopefully there will be a second one

Apr 24 2023,positive,ive been a nintendo fan for the last 36 years  i took my 2 oldest boys 7 and 6 years old to see this  honestly it was awesome  they loved it and i loved it  they were on the edge of their seats sometimes huddled in the back of them other times  a few times they were cheering and they got a lot of the humor as well  from my perspective the nostalgia was done very well not too little or much and the movie was executed very well also particularly given that there isnt a lot to the base mario story  bowser was terrifying and powerful but also funny and creepily sentimental  its a very faithful adaptation while still making for a good well paced movie experience  and ill be honest mild possible spoilers ahead i actually teared up at a couple of points such as when the song holding out for a hero plays or when there is a flashback of baby mario saving baby luigi from being bullied  i was not expecting to tear up  very well done nintendo and illumination
Apr 24 2023,positive,this was a great movie it stayed true to and incorporated so much content and music from all of the mario games and franchises i took my family and it was nostalgic for me and entertaining for them  no motives or agendas here just pure family friendly mario goodness i cant recommend it enough
Apr 24 2023,positive,amazing a true love letter to people who grow up with mario  this is cinema
Apr 24 2023,positive,loved everything about this movie
Apr 24 2023,positive,great pacing great storyline
Apr 24 2023,positive,my son and grandson really liked the movie
Apr 24 2023,positive,like a typical super mario video game it has a childish appearance but a surprising amount of depth  we not only get a backstory on the mario bros and they family but the princess as well  theres all the expected jokes and references to multiple mario games that youd in this type of movie  theres also some random humor from a character that im quite sure where it came from  it favors the kids but still respects adults watching it
Apr 24 2023,positive,great movie for the kids adults will likely not find an elevating experience but at least its not overly long
Apr 24 2023,positive,this was a fun movie to watch with my 6 yo daughter i was taken back to my childhood playing the original and super mario bros games on my nintendo the movie was hilarious at times and despite gratuitous talk of killing like pretty much every movie nowadays regardless of rating i did not find it as inappropriate for her age as i feared it would be she really enjoyed it my laughter clued her in that it was not a scary movie but a silly game with ridiculous characters great soundtrack and of course jack black   i had forgotten how much i liked mario and luigi 30 odd years ago   no video game knowledge is necessary to enjoy this my gamer days ended when super mario cart came out too intense for me i guess  we would have watched it again immediately after if that were an option
Apr 24 2023,neutral,i fell asleep during the first 30 minutes i wanted this movie to be great i guess my expectations were too high
Apr 24 2023,positive,excellent looking forward to part 2 slready
Apr 24 2023,positive,the movie was so fun and enjoyable my husband kids and 4 other family members all went to see it and we loved every second of it cant wait until the 2nd one come out with yoshi
Apr 24 2023,positive,it was fun  i loved all the music it brought back memories of when my two kids played this fun mario cart game  loved it
Apr 24 2023,positive,great movie good for kids especially
Apr 24 2023,positive,good family friendly movie
Apr 24 2023,negative,the movie was not humerus and very dull missing more comedy and punch lines seems like theres a stream of movies made from the same producer to bad i was really looking forward to see this movie
Apr 24 2023,positive,took 8 year old boys and they loved it
Apr 24 2023,negative,wow not sure where to start on this one my wife and kids left the theater i went ahead and stayed in order to give an accurate review i think she was meeting with her boyfriend anyway i just cannot believe what has happened to our beloved franchises that we adored so much as kids the cast was awful the plot was everywhere the humor was confusing and many times i felt really lost similar to the humor in schindlers list my least favorite comedy the dialogue was way too wordy and i found myself constantly having to ask siri what many of the words even meant how embarrassing for the writers lol the only redeemable quality of this movie is anyataylor joys sexy performance as princess peach her voice is fire her cadence erotic i found myself completely erect multiple different times during this movie maybe it was the cialis i took before or maybe it was just the way anya says whatever she says during the movie with that said this thing was rotten peace and love
Apr 24 2023,positive,what an awesome experience to finally get a mario thats respectful to the games source material its got amazing animation surprisingly good voice acting especially from jack black and charlie day and the plot is not complicated at alot what more could ask for it would have liked it more of it slow down a bit like an extra 15 or 20 minutes more solid 810 for me
Apr 24 2023,positive,great fun enjoyable movie lots of iconic moments
Apr 24 2023,positive,my 6 year old girl loved it except for bowser wanting to marry peach but for me that was a perfect homage to mario odyssey my 17 year old boy loved it and me a 45 year old man loved it it was everything a mario movie should be and left room for spinoffs and sequels i wish this was the movie we got back in the 90s but i am sure glad they got it right now looking forward to more amazing mario movies
Apr 24 2023,positive,it was a great movie my kids loved it

Apr 24 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics you can tell they are not nintendo or mario brothers fans this movie was absolutely adorable and amazing so many nintendo world references and if you played the video games theres so many easter eggs throughout the movie super enjoyable funny and well written cannot wait for the sequel

Apr 24 2023,positive,so many nostalgic nods and easter eggs youre not a nintendo fan if you dont see this in case youre curiousthere are nods to all the mario games old 8 bit games that arent necessarily mrio and even to super smash bros i wish i could go back 3 hours in time before i saw this so i could be wowed all over again this movie was 10x better than i was expecting and about 2x better than i hoped go see this movie
Apr 24 2023,positive,dont listen to the so called professional reviewers theyve most likely never touched a video game in their lifetime    the movie was amazing and revitalised my need to go to the movies    for awhile everything was stale until the mario movie came out and honestly it was worth the trip    it had everything from easter eggs to fanfare favourites kudos to team nintendo and illimination for really sticking by the games and producing this gem of a movie    ps i have not brought a bluray in forever and this will be one ill be looking out for    highly recommend
Apr 24 2023,positive,the movie was very entertaining for young children but viewing it as an adult it was very bad and i wouldnt recommend it for young adults and seniors

Apr 23 2023,positive,this is the greatest cinematic experience ive ever had in my life    peaaaach
Apr 23 2023,positive,reviving the rivalry that marked nintendo and sega in the 1990s the super mario bros movie makes the same mistake as its once rival sonic when trying to fit its fantastic universe into the paradigm of the heros journey at all costs and payment is made in screen time that inserts dramatic narrative elements at first potentially conflicting but which are insufficiently developed and do not have a satisfactory resolution such screen time is needed to bring to the plot important components of the video game franchise which are neglected by controversial choices for a film that should be centered on the brothers mario and luigi despite this the characterization of the characters in general provides a competent extrapolation of the few inputs that the games stories provided us as well as the use of the chosen powerups and both the visual aspects and the soundtrack delight fans of the duo of the most famous plumbers in the world
Apr 23 2023,positive,fantastic family movie and the best video game movie ever 1010
Apr 23 2023,positive,being 36 i took my friend and his two bairns to the cinema to see this  aged 3 and 5  me and my friend lived the movie having grown up with nintendo and their games this movie was fantastic  i loved all the references to wrecking crew super jump man smash bros mario 64 super princess peach mario galaxy and more  if you have ever loved nintendo and their unique quirky universe in which their games reside then you will love this  the critics have no idea what people like any more  go see this movie nintendo fan or not its a funny family experience that should not be missed on the big screen
Apr 23 2023,positive,super funny and visually stimulating
Apr 23 2023,positive,hell yeah great movie
Apr 23 2023,positive,my grandson enjoyed it i thought all the game references were cute
Apr 23 2023,positive,so im not the biggest mario fan i just watched it cause of chris pratt but i gotta tell you i was blown away there are so many easter eggs in the movie connecting to the games this is just perfect villain no explanation needed writing casting action is perfect no doubt voice acting animation no explanation needed  ending so after the ending im not sure about anyone else but i really think that mario should get a second movie  introduce other great characters like wario waluigi yoshi princess daisy rosealina cappy or introduce 2 or 3 of those characters in the second movie and introduce the others in a third movie and make a trilogy and make more than 3 movies
Apr 23 2023,positive,this movie was great it was a perfect and chris pratt made for a very great mario definitely would recommend and would see it again and again

Apr 23 2023,negative,how can this have better critic ratings than quantumania the only beautiful thing about this was the visuals dialogues were not great not terrible the plot was both weird and boring at the same time
Apr 23 2023,positive,i was smiling and entertained from the very beginning all the way to the very end of this movie yes it is trope after trope predictable and i am sure that it does not break any grounds in moviemaking but it was probably the most fun movie ive seen in a very very long time almost every inch of every scene is a feast of nintendo goodness nostalgia heaped upon nostalgia the mario movie was all that i had hoped for and more if you are a nintendo fan and you have a heart then i recommend this movie wholeheartedly

Apr 23 2023,positive,great movie for old and young fans of the super mario video game series
Apr 23 2023,positive,classic and i hope nintendo lets them make more
Apr 23 2023,positive,for me its the best movie ive ever seen it doesnt matter if youre a fan of super mario or not its enjoyable best of all anyone can enjoy it from young children to the elderly people complain about the low amount of story but remember how the sonic movie was it was an introductory to the characters and plot surely there will be another super mario movie where would have a better history 1010

Apr 23 2023,positive,great movie its a very funny movie  for the whole family to watch the only thing is that i felt that the movie was too short and didnt show some main characters that shouldve appeared
Apr 23 2023,negative,even though is a movie for children it doesnt have a very good argument  i was expecting something simple but in some aspect i thick it was illogical  all the movie is an excuse to say look thats from the videogame but without trying to be something more  all of that said i think it fulfill its porpoise im gonna play super mario when i get home

Apr 23 2023,positive,very fun for the whole family especially if you guys love playing super mario 3d world and mario kart on the nintendo switch together as a family had elements of the old nintendo games my husband and i played as kids too   peach is just the right kind of leader as she is a playable character in the switch games we have  mario and luigi are the kids of italian immigrants in brooklyn soo that makes sense that they dont carry an accent all the time my mom is mexican and i dont have the accent all the time
Apr 23 2023,positive,it was a funny cute movie that was well done
Apr 23 2023,positive,everything a mario fan could ever want in a mario movie its fun exciting the animation is beautiful the voices are great the only problem that i have is the pacing it couldve been longer but other than that if youre a mario fan go see it now

Apr 23 2023,positive,amazing visuals   crisp and fitting voice acting  music was  loved the different character motifs subtly worked into the score   peaches   the movie respected mario and its fans giving us and our kids a rewatchable classic
Apr 23 2023,positive,great movie original touching very good visual fun great song

Apr 23 2023,positive,finally a mario bro movie was better than expected super fun movie my kids loved it
Apr 23 2023,positive,fast paced the plot points bounce on one after the other with no breaks in between it leaves you wanting more tbh
Apr 23 2023,positive,it was a fun movie obviously not high art or anything like that its just a nice diversion for an hour and a half
Apr 23 2023,positive,saw this with a few friends and had a blast we couldnt stop pointing out the musical and visual references spread throughout the film    a must see for all mario fans

Apr 23 2023,positive,the animation music and voice acting was very good 100010

Apr 23 2023,positive,i watched the 3d version with my wife and granddaughter  we all enjoyed the action and the effects in the movie
Apr 23 2023,positive,this movie was a blast brought me way back to my childhood days if someone had told me back then that there were gonna be a mario movie one day this is how i wouldve wanted it to be perfect 10
Apr 23 2023,positive,it was a great moviewe laughed a lot ill be buying it when its released for sure
Apr 23 2023,positive,i liked the peaches song it made me want to see the movie in the first place  i loved the movie
Apr 23 2023,positive,a very visual experience that is worth seeing in 3d     there are already tons of kiddie movie franchises that tend to add and lean into the emotional side of things to the point that it just felt like theyre checking off what every movie needs on the list no matter how sincere it sounded and very few like this one whose main purpose is to provide a really good visual experience eye candy thats so delightful it made me go back for another helping    if youre looking for a fun joyride film without all that deep emotional nonsense not all movies need it to be deemed a good one
Apr 23 2023,positive,the best super funny and cute
Apr 23 2023,negative,picture quality was awful  although it had good voiceovers and some scenes  the overall plot was not good  my kids became bored and we left prior to the ending

Apr 23 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic such a joy start to finish peppered with laughs references and amazing visuals the candy of movies it moves as fast as youd expect a movie aimed at kids to move but never drops the ball
Apr 23 2023,positive,such a cute and funny movie we loved it
Apr 23 2023,positive,it seems like many critics need to lighten up this is a kids movie and many parents played these games as kids we can totally relate to the movie if you didnt youll be hard pressed to find the deeper meaning that resonates with so many we recognized all the characters and music it was a smash so let the box office speak for itself i enjoyed it as well as my son it made us want to engage in some mario party after the movie
Apr 23 2023,positive,really good movie should have had more humor but really good movie i liked how it had almost all the mario characters  not all because you need to save some characters for a sequel  75
Apr 23 2023,positive,it was a fun positive and exciting for our family from the age of 4 to 46 we all loved it

Apr 23 2023,positive,it was fun and funny
Apr 23 2023,positive,an animated masterpiece
Apr 23 2023,positive,the movie was super fun you do need a bit of imagination and a light hearted heart to enjoy it the extreme like i did i cried of laughter twice during the movie i loved it so much
Apr 23 2023,positive,the film has incredible photography and design and because it references several games in the franchise it hits the nostalgia factor as a negative point there is the script that is very silly
Apr 23 2023,positive,this movie i really couldnt wait but to an extent it was worth it but it didnt have the koopalings and that is just sad i also have a few more problems has anyone else had the feeling that bowsers head was too small and why didnt nintendo use that type of castle all the time all 4 damn thats a lot of castles
Apr 23 2023,positive,a perfectly good family film full of nintendo references it looks lovely with vibrant colours and detailed scenes but dont expect to be blown away by plot twists or character development  its very much a nintendo game converted to a movie
Apr 23 2023,positive,as a mario fan this checked all the boxes 
Apr 23 2023,positive,the best video game movie ever
Apr 23 2023,positive,better than i expected i dont play video games but i love how they used the special effects you would normally see in the video game mixed with the story 
Apr 23 2023,positive,very good family movie
Apr 23 2023,positive,great fun movie took me back to my childhood liked all the characters expect for peach who was an annoying girl boss who had me rolling my eyes to the way she spoke too and about mario
Apr 23 2023,positive,i took a 10 and 11 year old and they both really liked it
Apr 23 2023,positive,awesome great adaptation perfect for kids and nintendomario fans critics are fools with ridiculous expectations in this instance
Apr 23 2023,positive,loved all the references to the originals music was great
Apr 23 2023,positive,my wife and i took our kids 7  14 to see this and we all thoroughly enjoyed it which is especially surprising because my wife doesnt play video games and knows pretty much nothing about nintendo let alone mario
Apr 23 2023,positive,i had some serious beef with the trailer however it is safe to say that when you compare the 2 it was nothing like the trailer in fact this was an exilerating rush of a movie chock full of references and perfect visuals     the animation that illumination did with this was spectacular keep the designs familure but with unique touches and details movement was smooth and when paired with the visuals created a vibrant spectacle that is a must watch from an animation stand point     from an acting stand point surprisingly the things i was ready to nit pick and had severe worries with were not present each character is stuck to with severe intensity with some changes being made the changes do not take from the movie or characters who are very well portrayed keeping to the source material i am willing to admit that i had a rant about peach being portrayed as a bad ass when i watched the trailer it simply was not true and the portrayal was marvellous i want to give a massive round of applause to the entire creative team for makeing a spectacular movie worthy of any animated movie awards
Apr 23 2023,positive,amazing movie the cast was amazing and the musicnostalgia was goated
Apr 23 2023,positive,super mario bros was fun but very nintendo the story try to incorporate the game into a real world setting and it does a pretty good job at it however it is clearly targeted for children and nintendo fans it does help to have played those marios games because there is a lot of reference to them for an adult the magic wears off after a while that said the visual style is perfect the voices are fine peach facial animation wasnt very natural for some reason the music was in the theme i give it 65 i got bored after the initial reveals but then again i am just an average fan of nintendo and not the target audience
Apr 23 2023,positive,loved it reminds me of my childhood
Apr 23 2023,positive,there was not a single scene boring me i was watching the entire 90 minutes with a huge smile on my face they captured the joy of the games and perfectly implemented in the movie such a blast
Apr 23 2023,positive,i loved that it actually was for kids we all loved it
Apr 23 2023,negative,the super mario bros movie is a 2023 american computeranimated adventure film based on nintendos mario video game franchise it was directed by aaron horvath and michael jelenic      oof this isnt good   probably give it a miss     while working underground to fix a water main brooklyn plumbersand brothersmario and luigi are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world but when the brothers are separated mario embarks on an epic quest to find luigi
Apr 23 2023,positive,much better than i thought it would be kids loved it good storyline
Apr 23 2023,positive,my family and i loved this film it was hilarious and cute i think they easily couldve made it 2 hrs instead and showed more lands
Apr 23 2023,positive,better than expected
Apr 23 2023,positive,i brought my wife and teenage kids to watch this we all absolutely loved it as a mario player who has experienced all the super mario bros games over the last 40 years from nes to 64 there was so much lore from every generation of mario even super mario 2 i do find it pathetic that the patriarchy of official rt reviewers have decided to bash this movie while 10s of thousands of actual viewers gave it almost a 100 score at the end of the film the entire audience erupted in applause they couldnt have nailed this any better you can tell the writers really dug into the mario history instant classic
Apr 23 2023,positive,finally a movie that respects the source material just good fun entertainment
Apr 23 2023,positive,it was a bunch of nonsense smashed together in one movie did you see what i did there with smash but it was a very fun bunch of nonsense like the type of all over the place story that works well if you get bored in this movie then i feel sorry for you bro
Apr 23 2023,positive,i want to see it again i loved how they incorporated everything from the actual game i didnt expect it to be that good and to top it off the theatre was crazy packed i havent been to a theatre with that many people in a long long time after the movie everyone started clapping best movie ive seen this year
Apr 23 2023,positive,ive watched it 3 times already its soooo good
Apr 23 2023,positive,its a good film but it somehow manages to have a near perfect runtime however it doesnt tell any backstories to like any characters the blue shell lore is hilariously cool and i love it
Apr 23 2023,positive,it was a really funny and fun movie to watch
Apr 23 2023,positive,the best family film currently you can go see it at the cinema with 5yearolds
Apr 23 2023,positive,so so good super cute movie with a good plot and amazing music the only thing that makes me sad is that it wasnt very long  it seemed like the end was a tad rushed but i did love that the end credit scene alludes to a 2nd movie coming out i truly recommend 
Apr 23 2023,positive,i like mario and know that he is nintendos mascot and have played the games from time to time i personally enjoyed this movie was it the greatest no do i think if youre a die hard mario fan you will enjoy this movie yes i liked it i caught some references from the games and that was cool
Apr 23 2023,positive,a fun movie its not heavy on story but it doesnt have to be my 5 year old daughter my husband and i all enjoyed it my daughter was scared at a few parts but she is timid i feel that the story had depth i cried a bit near the end
Apr 23 2023,positive,it was just like the game it was really cute

Apr 23 2023,positive,good moviehad all the characters from the gamefunny and entertaining
Apr 23 2023,positive,it was awesome the was movie was filled with references from the video games the only problem is if youve never played the game you might not understand the plot
Apr 23 2023,positive,took the kiddo to see it and he said he finally understood why i love filmmaking these days if the critics say they dont like it its probably a good film
Apr 23 2023,negative,kind of boring graphics were good but the writing was not
Apr 23 2023,positive,if you are a fan of the mario games this is a must see  so well done and it covers all of the movies  just a warning this movie is not for young kids  i would say 7 or 8 would be the youngest that should see it  my nephew took his 5 year old daughter to see it and bowser being mean did scare her and they had to leave right after the cart scene started  young people can see it but very young i wouldnt take them
Apr 23 2023,positive,pros  the plot was great  everyone was great and funny in this movie except the luma star he was making me feel uncomfortable  great soundtrack  the dog fight was funny  the beginning of marios fight with dk and when mario turned into a cat during the fight were funny  so surprised to see many nintendo references in this movie punch out kid icarus jumpman etc  very surprised to see a bunch of cameos in this movie  bowser playing the piano and singing was great    neutral points  the voices werent the best nor the worst i would think of them as decent    cons  it felt like the movie was going too fast  the appearances of mario and luigis family was mediocre  there should have been more luigi action i mean he was able to fit through the bars to slip out and climb up the chains  the postcredits was not even a surprise    final response  overall this was a great movie and i cant wait for the sequel but theyre could have been a few thing to improve on this deserves a 45
Apr 23 2023,positive,i loved it so much it was very playful and wholesome would for sure watch again
Apr 23 2023,positive,very nostalgic adding in elements of all the mario games
Apr 23 2023,positive,the movie was really good tother than princess peach i thought the characters were great

Apr 23 2023,positive,its a masterpiece wahoo
Apr 23 2023,positive,the movie weve all been waiting for  the whole family thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish cant wait for part 2
Apr 23 2023,positive,the mario movie was an absolutely amazing flick and was a joy to watch it is easily a perfect family movie and the references to other nintendo franchises were done incredibly well and appeal to nintendo fans of all shapes and sizes the fact that this movie has a 59 right now from critics is genuinely criminal however there are definitely some things wrong with it first of all take on me was an odd choice as a song and was easily the worst part of the entire movie which is honestly a compliment considering its really the only thing i can think of that wasnt done very well some people dont like the voice actors i dont know what those people want all of the  voice actors were really good except for cranky kong for some reason some critics say that the movie has a thin plot and to a certain extent i guess they are right but its got about the same depth of plot as your average disney movie which is to say that its not insanely complex or anything like that its definitely pretty straightforward and linear but i think that for their target audience it definitely had the right amount of plot other critics might say that it was fast paced these critics are also right and i agree with them but i think that is it werent so fast paced it wouldve been a lot harder to fit so much into the film also maybe its just me but i kind of enjoyed it being so fast paced but i think that this is a pretty valid objection i think that critics simply come in expecting some insanely awesome film which will change your thinking after you watch it the mario movie is a lot things but that is not one of them if you are expecting a fun family movie with tons of nintendo references than boy are you in the right place in other words if you are asking yourself if the mario movie is worth your time youre asking the wrong question you should be asking if you are worth the mario movies time
Apr 23 2023,positive,great movie twists and turns that were unexpected delightfully funny
Apr 23 2023,positive,11 out 10 wow just wow ive never encounter a masterpiece like this as a huge super mario fan i can tell that illumination and nintendo put alot of effort into this movie the easter eggs got me on the edge of my seats also the music wow i never thought that hollywood can do video game music pretty well    i would recommend this movie for old and young mario fans d d
Apr 23 2023,positive,love all references to the games its a basic story but go straight to the point what is what the fans want to see
Apr 23 2023,positive,amazing for any nintendo fan and nonmario fans can also enjoy it

Apr 23 2023,positive,it was a really good movie but i feel like they could have added more stuff from the original games like for example instead of defeating bowzer in the streets of brooklyn why not kill him on the brooklyn bridge with a big hammer as he falls in the lava or in this case water but over all it was a great movie i feel like a lots of people have been waiting for this movie to brings back their childhood memories
Apr 23 2023,positive,an overall amazing movie i liked all the references they shown in the movie

Apr 22 2023,positive,this is not the best illumination movie nor is this the best animated movie but i think this is genuinely the greatest movie i have ever seen critics hate it because it isnt accessible for non fans of the series what took you so long idiot you had to actually watch the movie to figure that out of course this is made for the fans you moron they have four generations of fans they dont even need non fans to watch this to set records dummy now back to the review am i biased hell yes but this is the most fun movie i have had watching a movie there is nothing i didnt like about this movie everything was as close to perfect as you can get the humor the soundtrack the score the animation the references if your a fan and you havent watched it watch it

Apr 22 2023,positive,great movie for the family
Apr 22 2023,positive,its amazing love it totally
Apr 22 2023,negative,all the scenes seemed rushed there was a conflict and a solution to the problem in almost every scene so there was no suspense throughout besides the one major conflict the jokes were very under whelming we didnt laugh out loud more than twice would not watch it again
Apr 22 2023,positive,took my godson to see this movie and i have to say i think i enjoyed it more than he did lol
Apr 22 2023,positive,movie rocks  go see it it has a lot and character development and arcs all voice actors did a great job  song get why folks nitpick this move was funny and has heart and no its not  just for kids  it works for adults that like sarcastic humor and action  this movie is for nintendo fans only and nothing wrong with that  did i say i loved this movie  the audience clapped through our the  movie and the whole rherate started to sing the peaches song and  the whole theatre with laughed belly laughs it was an amazing experience

Apr 22 2023,positive,with colorful animation buckets of nostalgia and a story which doesnt take itself too seriously the super mario bros movie is nothing but a fun time
Apr 22 2023,positive,critics need to get in touch with reality and realise that everything doesnt need to be pretentious or thought provoking
Apr 22 2023,positive,we saw this film in 3d and it was awesome i grew up playing mario bros games and i loved every minute of it
Apr 22 2023,positive,it was fine nostalgic for me  i grew up on these characters great animation like really impressive and rich with detail and vibrancy the storyline itself felt a little phoned in but it was serviceable id watch it again maybe ill watch with the soundtrack to the liveaction version playing in the background  does no one care about soundtrack anymore  tommy topgun gets it  added about 30 more depth to both tg movies imo
Apr 22 2023,positive,it has a nostalgic feeling the intro feels a little bit slow but still enjoyed it
Apr 22 2023,positive,while the movie did have a mildly average plot line there is much fun to be experienced by both adults and children alike the movie can be discerned as an amalgamation of multiple aspects of mario and luigis adventures and displaying this has opened up multiple valves to a secondary film of some description this along with the efficient use of time makes it enjoyable and easy to watch for all audiences this has led me to score this as a 45
Apr 22 2023,positive,this movie kept me and my kids entertained the whole time loved the casting for the voices definitely a movie to watch again with the whole family
Apr 22 2023,positive,awesome movie my kids loved it and as a mario fan for 35 years i also loved it

Apr 22 2023,positive,fantastic movie cant wait for the sequel
Apr 22 2023,neutral,the movie was funny and fun to watch the plot was too simple and cliche but the animation and voice acting were top tier but the movie had maybe too much action it could have been just a bit more peaceful 255 movie
Apr 22 2023,positive,one of the best illumination films made despicable me is still better though
Apr 22 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece the movie was sooooo good it felt fresh and nostalgic each and every part of the movies featured iconic nintendo references and music this is also why you shouldnt listen to movie critics most of the reviews from the audience was a 1010 believe me this movie is executed perfectly so go and watch it
Apr 22 2023,positive,review by bella best movie ive ever watched very funny adventurous and full of excitementi rate it a 1010i definitely recommend you watch it
Apr 22 2023,positive,i honestly loved the movie 55  i dont know what these glue sniffing crackhead critics were doing
Apr 22 2023,positive,i have been a fan of mario since i was a child and there may be some small amount of reminiscence in this review so bear that in mind if considering whether to go see this  that not withstanding i really enjoyed this movie it was gorgeously animated with a style that was cute but captured the feel of the games really well  the pacing of the movie went along very quickly and they managed to fit a lot in in a small time they also managed to fit in a lot of things from a number of different games and nintendo properties whilst remaining respectful the music was really good and whilst they did use some 80s songs for background tracks to some scenes a lot of the original music from the games was incorporated as well which was really fun  the tone is light fun and the people that made this clearly care about the subject material  this film wasnt preachy or trying to tell me how to think or what politics i should have it had one objective and that was to be fun it had a simple story and was a great snippet of escapism which i thoroughly enjoyed  some people have issue that chris pratt was the voice for mario this wasnt an issue for me the voice cast were all really good and they did a great job go see this movie and enjoy yourself
Apr 22 2023,positive,was totally entertained from beginning to end movie had everything action feelings  and cuteness love the nostalgia all throughout movie had so much fun watching
Apr 22 2023,positive,absolutely loved it it totally exceeded my expectations
Apr 22 2023,positive,a nice movie to enjoy it is not a deep script to make you reflect but its charm is precisely that it is a movie to have fun to be amazed at how beautiful it looks to remember your childhood seen through the eyes of a child it is a work of art
Apr 22 2023,positive,i had a good time loved to watch this again
Apr 22 2023,positive,this movie was actually really fucking good it would be a 5 if the song peaches wasnt so god damn annoying
Apr 22 2023,positive,amazing small details related to the game great graphics interesting plot great music
Apr 22 2023,positive,super cast and lovely cinematography animation was superb and its a real fun ride
Apr 22 2023,positive,it was a pretty segmented movie it had its definitive story line it was funny and cute adults can definitely enjoy  just wish the story was more different but it shows a lot of mario characteristics
Apr 22 2023,positive,this this is the best video game movie i ever watched and i was really impressed with the movie and the fact it was made by the  minions i am impressed by how they made this
Apr 22 2023,positive,this film could be better as a movie in general the characterbuilding and plotline werent exactly barrenblocksolid however as a mario movie it does exceedingly well and is absolutely stellar the hundreds of references are more than appreciated the animation character designs and musical score were all astounding if you enjoy super mario then this film is a mustsee you will enjoy every second of immersing yourself within the mushroom kingdom and all it has to offer
Apr 22 2023,positive,this movie was a fun watch and id recommend it to the mario fans

Apr 22 2023,positive,it was a pretty good movie not perfect but definitely one of the best video game adaptations ive seen

Apr 22 2023,positive,loved the visuals and storyline of brotherhood
Apr 22 2023,neutral,it was ok visuals were as expected but the story was lacking they reached for the younger audience too much and forgot that mario came out in the 80s jokes did not land like i was hoping for and browser was too jokey and peach got more screen time than mario
Apr 22 2023,positive,a lil sad no yoshi but hes gonna be born i hope
Apr 22 2023,positive,its was amazing movie ever

Apr 22 2023,positive,its a step in the right direcction for videogame movie adaptations the only bad part about the movie was chris pratt ass mario it wasent the same with out charles martinet
Apr 22 2023,positive,excellent movie very nostalgic and not campy they integrated so much from the games in a very clever way probably wont win an oscar but for 80s kids this movie rocks

Apr 22 2023,positive,as is common frequently with the critics they completely got this one wrong if youre a fan of mario and you thought this was a bad movie you may never have been a fan of mario     my og nintendo is long gone but i remember it like it was yesterday     i remember playing the first mario ever at the age of five     i stared in awe as a 10 year old at super mario world for snes     i dare say i tried to find a flaw and the only flaw i could find was completely trivial and it was actually funny to see     do not listen to the critics go see this movie and be ready to permasmile

Apr 22 2023,positive,as a huge mario fan when i first heard about this movie i just had to watch it and i certainly wasnt disappointed the animation was stunning i have no words for this movie i especially loved the scenes where mario peach and toad got into karts with the other gorillas onto rainbow road yes i will admit bowsers song peaches was funny even though he was so hard to like as a character the movie made quite a few references to the older games super mario run and even the tshaped run from super mario odyssey when fighting bowser of course the most noticeable one was the karts i loved the part where luigi saves mario it shook me luigi was always said to be dragged down with mario or living in marios shadow      overall the movie was impeccable with the design and animation rainbow road was amazingly done and the characters were engaging the whole time

Apr 22 2023,positive,i am absurdely a fan of mario and watching this movie there was not a single second that i was not smiling or shivering with excitement maybe it was because it was cold in the theater  or maybe its both and not to mention the   34879862103756125846953163156532345 references and easter eggs in the movie even the tradition of blowing the cartridge to work is referenced at least in the ptbr version which is what i saw because i am brazilian  i thought it was humanly expendable for a film to surpass rio and sonic 2 personally but this film managed to do it barely but it did  summary this movie is practically perfect

Apr 21 2023,positive,faithful adaptation to the games and the effort in the music and storytelling is apparent this aint like game of thrones or the new star wars movies this was done with the fans in mind also chriss pratts voice was much better in the movie than what the trailers display
Apr 21 2023,positive,as a life long fan of the games i had a smile on my face the entire time so many references to old nintendo games and honestly they were well done also pratt wasnt bad as mario

Apr 21 2023,positive,it was an awesome movie my kids went bananas about it they liked it so much that were gonna go watch it again this weekend it is very entertaining for kids and full of nostalgia for the parents a for this one
Apr 21 2023,negative,someone on youtube said its the height of irony that a movie about historys most iconic character for jumping over things chose to jump over no hurdles and clear only the lowest bars and thats pretty much on point the movie was underwhelming and for lack of a better word dull they dont take any time to flesh out the worlds or characters or their development and relationships but simply go from point a to b while including as many references from the video games as possible youre not invested in the characters and their journeyshardly existent character arches maybe those are unfair standards but thereve been so many great kids movies in the last years that it just falls short in comparison
Apr 21 2023,positive,to those of us who left adolescence behind recently or not so recently it will surely bring us beautiful memories and at times it will extol our scenes behind the video game with a somewhat dreamy air bringing it to reality to family life to day to day of work and life with its problems and joys this mixture between the real thing and the 2d video game is a very big and pleasant plus    then we will move on to a fictional world which will bring with it in addition to a good load of memories a large amount of adventure and action here the story leaves the everyday behind and we find ourselves with adventure and more adventure with little context since the context is provided by the video game it is nice to see how the characters antagonists and main challenges of donkey kong and mario little by little are fitting into history with pleasant surprise we see how some characters are given another meaning an example of this the princess who little fulfills her role as a damsel in distress to become a strong and valuable character but preserving all her feminine sweet and pleasant the main bad guy is not so typical either hes a lovestruck bad guy and sometimes kind of cute    the ending also follows the same formula satisfying beautiful with a lot of action mixing the real world with the video game yes all this in a goodnatured calm environment suitable for all audiences without being childish however for some reason it is rated pg with parental guidance however i think it is more than suitable for all audiences    rating  idea 810   story 710   script 610   characters 710   effects 710   entertaining 810    age pg for all ages with parental supervision
Apr 21 2023,positive,casey chong  caseys movie mania  the super mario bros movie has a few worthwhile moments but it wasnt enough to overcome the sheer banality of its storyline  crittics who dont like this movie grown people dont watch kid stuff   me what did you expect to mario say bad words to be a movie about adult comedy well you can go see the super mario movie from 1993 or the canceled movie super hornio bros those movies were bad but you say this is bad my god have mercy on your soul

Apr 21 2023,positive,it was the greatest movie of all time i mean sure chris pratt wasnt very great but the other casts were great the best thing i liked about this movie was that they were bringing back mario memories since 1985 such as the course mario kart and the powerups
Apr 21 2023,positive,hope its the first of a long series for nintendo
Apr 21 2023,positive,this movie was awesome you really feel like youre in the game when watching which honestly made me feel super nostalgic for my childhood this game was huge to me when i was younger and i recently just started playing again on the switch the animation is magical especially princes peachs kingdom and maybe its just because i nanny 8 and 6yearold boys but i thought it was really funny overall a great movie about friendship teamwork and family 1010 recommend

Apr 21 2023,positive,super mario bros doesnt strive to subvert your expectations or take risks but for a mario movie thats exactly what you want to see a concise story about friendship family and camaraderie featuring an underdog protagonist who through determination manages to become a true hero its a movie true to its source material and i think i speak for most viewers when i say that was the best possible outcome

Apr 21 2023,positive,this movie is by far the most involved i have ever seen my 6 year old son in a film at the theater   all the children were reacting with laughter and amazement through the entire film at one point it gave my son the chills as he sat on the edge of his seat he hasnt stopped talking about it since   i loved the film as well 1010
Apr 21 2023,positive,as a fan of the games who grew up with them they have made a huge impact on my life my grandpa introduced me to them at a very young age and it gave us something to bond over the movie was pure perfection and exactly what it should be and i already want more thank you nintendo

Apr 20 2023,positive,its just like a super mario game but in a whole movie   simple just like that
Apr 20 2023,positive,i loved itthe voice acting the story the soundtrack it really surprised me cause i went in with low expectations and was expecting it to be like any other successful ip turned into a kids movie but they really knocked it out of the park with how good it turned out to be    im also just easily impressed though and i really like cartoons  kids movies lol  wish that some characters had more screen time but thats really the only complaint i have  overall its great i like how many references from past games were included and i cant wait for it to come out on streaming cuz ive wanted to watch it again ever since i saw it in theaters   1010
Apr 20 2023,positive,the movie was great for kids highly recommend for families
Apr 20 2023,positive,plot wasnt very involved but the animation was great
Apr 20 2023,positive,in this age of easy access to streaming cinema right in your living room it is hard to convince my family and i to go the old fashion route of paying extra for the movie theatre experience the super mario bros movie is that rarity to do just that especially my two nieces whom is hard to stay focus yet they were immersed the entire time and loved every second of the film  besides most films today in my opinion are lackluster in consistent momentum of storyline characters and overall fun for the entire family i recommend not only super fans of the nintendo fanbase but general public to see this movie you wont regret the nostalgia meeting new age the old generation introducing the new generation to this iconic and legendary game franchise i promise you
Apr 20 2023,positive,great movie me and my kids loved it
Apr 20 2023,positive,what a great movie thanks nintendo for give us a movie we can really enjoy in family
Apr 20 2023,positive,wonderful mario movie i love the animation the characters the music everything
Apr 20 2023,neutral,it was a great movie to watch with friends on a day out but sadly the mixed reviews made sense after giving it a watch the pacing is terrible it could have easily been paced out abit more the voice actors you can get use to 15 minutes in the animation is outstanding however which is a shame the music was good a film ony hyped mario fans would love tbh good enough for a kid anyway 65  10
Apr 20 2023,positive,its was very faithful to the games and the animators and writers really put theyre all into their jobs
Apr 20 2023,positive,good fun for the kiddos
Apr 20 2023,positive,the most entertaining movie ive seen in years this movie is overflowing with references that all fans young or old will find charming and nostalgic truly the best example i couldve hoped for from a nintendo themed movie
Apr 20 2023,negative,im a huge fan of mario and i think the actors all did a phenomenal job but i did not like the dialogue at all the story line was ok and followed the themes of the video games well but what was up with crowdwhos this guy peachdont worry about him then peachtheyve got mario crowd gasp why did they gasp they didnt even know who he was it was just so off and annoying
Apr 20 2023,positive,was nostalgic yet moderncomedy plus serious and original
Apr 20 2023,positive,i have been a mario fan for most of my life and this movie blew all of my expectations our of the water the music visual details and character interactions were stellar seeing mario and peach have dialogue between each other was truly beautiful the animation was the best i have ever seen
Apr 20 2023,positive,its by no means the best videogame movie and at times the pacing felt frantic but its a fun movie fans are sure to enjoy  the film is packed to the brim with subtle easter eggs both modern and retro that nintendo fans are sure to find enjoyment from  as skeptical as i was about the choice of seth rogen as my all time favorite nintendo character he does a good job of making the big old lug personable  only real gripe is that they do throw a lot at you in 90 minutes and probably couldve used an extra 1520 minutes but if you can keep up with the frantic pace you are bound to find enjoyment from this  it might not be the love letter to mario and nintendo most are hoping for but its easily near being the final draft
Apr 20 2023,positive,entertaining movie the kids liked it i enjoyed it worth it
Apr 20 2023,positive,fun for all the family
Apr 20 2023,positive,it was enjoyable and fun from the get go must go watch even if you dont have kids

Apr 20 2023,positive,an amazing visual feast with heart overall an amazing time at the theatre just wish that some momentscharacters had more screen time
Apr 20 2023,positive,best movie for family remember that d family
Apr 20 2023,positive,a breath of fresh air prepare to travel at warpspeed  it really isnt complicated if you want to have a great time and enjoy some fun this movie is for you while its not trying to win any oscars although that may not be out of the picture the mario bros movie is definitely trying to win your heart from kids to bigger kids the film has something for everyone if youre an 80s baby like myself the music alone will warp you back to  the era of video game arcades and walkmans you can tell the team behind the movie put a lot of care and effort into crafting it so many easter eggs pop up that its impossible to notice all of them in one sitting stop reading and go go go see the movie
Apr 20 2023,positive,i loved it it was funny and meaningful the movie was bright and vibrant and just overall a good movie for family
Apr 20 2023,positive,if i could give it 100 stars i would i loved it from start to finish make sure you stay for the three post credit scenes
Apr 20 2023,positive,this was a great but oddlypaced film the humor was spot on and all the references had me saying to myself yep i understood that reference
Apr 20 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was a great film for fans of the franchise with little easter eggs at every corner making every viewing a different experience each time the plot was dry but with a run time of 92 minutes i cant complain too much overall the movie is a great experience for long time fans and new fans

Apr 20 2023,positive,good graphics a little too violent for little kids
Apr 20 2023,positive,honestly the critics have absolutely no taste this movie is genuinely very funny and the amount of game references was pleasant i cant believe illumination made me laugh as much as they did    i also cant believe they put bowser in a jar
Apr 20 2023,negative,as much as i like the mario brothers and game  it just wasnt for me didnt hate it just didnt like it

Apr 20 2023,positive,as a fan of nintendo and mario games this is a delight and mustsee i was emotional and filled with joy throughout the entire movie
Apr 20 2023,negative,it was boring and most of the jokes were lame  the cast was dismal and chris pratt could not be consistent with the voice  i have never wanted to walk out of a movie more
Apr 20 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a visually striking videogame adaptation that is both enduring and entertaining
Apr 20 2023,positive,for anyone who played all the games specially the recent ones is a great movie short and sweet
Apr 20 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is an absolute blast as a lifelong fan of the video game franchise i was thrilled to see the iconic characters and world brought to life on the big screen with such care and attention to detail the performances are topnotch with the cast perfectly capturing the spirit and humor of the beloved characters whether youre a fan of the games or just looking for a fun entertaining movie the super mario bros movie is sure to put a smile on your face
Apr 20 2023,positive,goodness  the professional critics in a seeming eternal endeavor to convince us to view them as they view themselves just dont get it sometimes  super mario bros was made to be fun  and it is  does it have the emotional depth and well constructed story of up or the first ice age  no  but it is what it is  which is great family entertainment  no more  no less  you and your littles will love this movie
Apr 20 2023,positive,it is such a fun and bright movie for mario fans and even those who just know a bit about mario like myself it is a very sweet and cute movie with various nintendo references and loveable characters throughout if you would like to see a fun colorful heartfelt movie to just chill and watch then this one is for you cant wait for the next nintendoillumination movie
Apr 20 2023,positive,a lot of easter eggs and very nostalgic when you were growing up with the games also a lot of fun for the kids i work in a cinema and 95 of our costumers love this film its amazing how they were putting it all together mario kart  luigis mansion donkey kong etc if you loved the games youll love this film  the voice actors in both english and german were casted very well greetings from germany
Apr 20 2023,positive,this is the movie that diehard super mario bros video game fans have waited a long time for the animation from illumination entertainment was fantastic the voice acting was amazing and the film was funny brilliant and most definitely fresh definitely worth 5 stars in my opinion
Apr 20 2023,positive,great balance between an enjoyable entertainer and remaining true to the mario games
Apr 20 2023,negative,horrible movie for adultsmaybe kids too i thought it would be an animated movie adults could enjoy also such as minions or toy story but this movie was just a bunch of nonsense
Apr 20 2023,neutral,nice animation but the rest of the movie is without heart and feelings its more like a best of mario games
Apr 20 2023,positive,very nostalgic i played most of the mario bros games but nevered finished any  movie was fun from start to finish fun times
Apr 20 2023,positive,man this was a good movie but there were problems like the pacing of the movie like mario meets toad and they rush through it and toad says there best friends even though mario barely knows him and same with peach but i did like mario and donkey kong together though i wish they were more together and same with bowser and luigi those were the stars though bowser didnt feel like a villain some times like i get thats like that in the games but i think more villain scenes and also the references were good can only take you so far
Apr 20 2023,positive,its one of the best video game movie adaptations ever made filled with references and so much more its a big love letter to the game and its fans  i do agree tho with the critics that they went too safe with the story but this movie has heart it has a soul its clear that illumination and nintendo wanted this movie to be the best it can be this movie is the reason i got a nintendo switch not gonna lie xd
Apr 20 2023,positive,it was enjoyable and gave me exactly what i expected it delivered what it said it would deliver the only flaw that actually mattered to me was that it could have had a better cast  the voices for bowser luigi and toad were all pretty good and fit the characters but the others could have been better and more unique      oh and nitpick but i need a hero and take on me felt weird and random  not a huge deal but they did degrade the scenes a bit  the mario instrumental music was great they should have just done more of that
Apr 20 2023,positive,this was a great movie for us nintendo fans the songs and beats are so good the chracters where just amazing the voice actors were not bad anyways you sould watch this movie 5 stars
Apr 20 2023,positive,great movie i watched it online for free because it was hacked and shown its fun to watch and has a great and majestetic animation its also very entertaining and the voice acting is superb i would recommend it
Apr 20 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was a great movie and was absolutely packed with references to all sorts of bits nintendo history i wish that charles martinet was cast as mario instead of chris pratt but it was still a great movie that i would recommend to anyone even remotely interested in super mario or nintendo overall one of my favorite movies

Apr 20 2023,neutral,definitely had some funny and clever parts but overall felt like a drag and no real plot to the story felt more of the writers finding ways to incorporate all of the video games then focusing on a plot
Apr 20 2023,positive,super mario bros la película es una película maravillosa y muy genial con una música muy buena y genial con momentos muy memorables e iconicos logra entretener y disfrutar es bastante fiel a los videojuegos y los detalles y el amor que se le pusieron son muy hermosos y magníficos con un presupuesto de 100millones la animación es la mejor de illumination la historia es simple pero es muy bellísima y muy bien contada  demostrando que para hacer una buena película no necesitas ponerle obligatoriamente una historia profunda para conectar con la audiencia la historia se cuenta de una bella manera que te hace sentir como un niño otra vez es una película que le va a gustar a fans de super mario como al público en general lo único malo es que dura poco si tan solo le hubieran agregado otros 10 o 15 minutos hubiera tenido una mejor clasificación es la mejor de illumination superando en parte mi villano favorito 2010 y superando a otras películas fuera del estudio como sonic the hedgehog 2020 y sonic the hedgehog 2 2022 esperaré con ansias su secuela y gracias a esta película el cine de videojuegos crecerá a lo grande es obvio que la asociación de nintendo e illumination aún no ha terminado probablemente en el futuro veamos una película animada de the legend of zelda kirby splatoon metros un spinoff de luigis mansion o un rumoreado spinoff de donkey kong etc    y todo será gracias a esta increíble película     8910    la recomiendo mucho    english    super mario bros the movie is a wonderful and very cool movie with very good and great music with very memorable and iconic moments it manages to entertain and enjoy it is quite faithful to the videogames and the details and the love that was put into it are very beautiful and magnificent with a budget of 100 million the animation is the best of illumination the story is simple but it is very beautiful and very well told showing that to make a good movie you dont necessarily need to put a deep story in it to connect with the audience the story is told in a beautiful way that makes you feel like a child again it is a movie that fans of super mario as well as the general public will like the only bad thing is that it lasts little if so they would only have added another 10 or 15 minutes to it it would have had a better classification it is the best of illumination partly surpassing my favorite villain 2010 and surpassing other films outside the studio such as sonic the hedgehog 2020 and sonic the hedgehog 2 2022 i will look forward to its sequel and thanks to this movie video game cinema will grow big it is obvious that the partnership of nintendo and illumination is not over yet probably in the future we will see an animated movie of the legend of zelda kirby splatoon metros a spinoff of luigis mansion or a rumored spinoff of donkey kong etc    and it will all be thanks to this incredible movie    8910    i highly recommend it

Apr 19 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was one of the best video game adaptions to date now normally i was going to give  it a 55 but the story well lets just say it was fast paced and not very good also little to no character development i really wanted lugi and mario to have more screen time in the film but alas it was not true other than that if your really bored then mark your calendrer to see this extraordinary movie wahoo
Apr 19 2023,positive,as you can tell by the audience to critic difference this movie is intensly likable to those who enjoyed mario as a child or adult not the people who are paid to pretend to

Apr 19 2023,positive,very nostalgic lots of references overall very good movie 
Apr 19 2023,positive,i thought the animation looked smooth and i liked the humor in the movie   then midway through scenes started to feel a bit more rushed especially the last big fight   some things might not make sense if you arent invested in the universe of super mario    but overall i thought it was a pretty cool movie
Apr 19 2023,positive,pays homage in the most entertaining way to the greatest video game series of all time

Apr 19 2023,positive,if the critics hate it then its a good sign its a good movie
Apr 19 2023,positive,this was one of the best movies of 2023
Apr 19 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie although for me it could have been stretched a little more as it brought out things that leave a lot of questions but will probably leave them for the sequel there were a lot of references to old games although it was probably for fan service  but i loved this thing  and the animation okay it was amazing i must say  for the rest it was a good film for me however it is still a film for children so i didnt expect an avengersi would have extended it at least by putting things that leave no questions if not maybe for the post creditshowever it made me remember the good times when i played super mario so he left me with a good memoryand then i can understand that maybe the beginning doesnt seem like who knows what stuff but all the great stories have a not very good beginning but going vain you change your mind
Apr 19 2023,positive,the movie is amazing it will impact you with all the references to super mario bros and the super nintendo console but there are
Apr 19 2023,positive,a bright colourful switch your brain off movie  for adults and kids beautiful animation some light story arcs easy to follow plot a lot of fun not a lot of depth or emotive scenes with some little moments of humor to keep you comfortable
Apr 19 2023,positive,if you are a diehard mario fan you will surely enjoy this movie but even if you havent you will like the characters music and humour of this fantasic movie
Apr 19 2023,positive,i loved all the references and how the sound effects are from the games the art style is very illumination but thats their thing so i wont bash it it did look pretty and the designs of the characters were very good too  i did have some issues like the pacing some music options and character choices the story moves from one scene to the next but it is a movie where the stakes were low as is so it didnt trouble me much i dont get the funk of putting generic songs like holding out for a hero or take on me during parts where you can simply replace it with a song from one of the games those parts when the songs came up did make me cringe and just sink into my seat when watching a movie called the super mario bros they had to emphasize the whole brothers shtick because luigi was very underused and forgotten it didnt help that mario got more screentime than his brother which upset me  other than that just a silly mario movie and definitely better than the one from the 90s
Apr 19 2023,positive,it is no2 animated movie of all time for me no1 is puss in boots 2 the art style for mario was soo good and i loved it and mg friends did too the bowser song peahces was the best s  ong of 2023
Apr 19 2023,positive,let me start by saying the graphics were amazing  the story was good but felt rushed and kinda jumped between storylines to get to the finish music score was great with all the nods to the original game  i was shocked when it ended as it felt really short just kinda was over anticlimactic  overall good movie but expected more
Apr 19 2023,positive,this movie was just ok it had some nice easter eggs and nostalgia but a very weak plot and story  i cant really say there was much bad about it but really nothing that memorable either  my three kids felt the same leaving the theater
Apr 19 2023,positive,was pleasantly surprised with how good it was
Apr 19 2023,positive,once again the sheer difference in ratings between critics and audience reveals that yes this movie is in fact good despite critics incessant need to nitpick i never thought i would be interested in mario as an actual developed character but super mario bros showed me the light in fact i wouldve enjoyed a little more backstory of some of the other main characters too it includes a perfect balance of fan service by cleverly working many elements from the mario universe into nearly every scene which most gamers will be familiar with but i think anyone can enjoy the pacing is kept tight to the runtime which i appreciate so in my opinion the plot is just as deep as it needs to be
Apr 19 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece and why is everyone so mean about this movie its way   better then the live action one and the emoji movie    i give is a 1000010 on this and love the song peaches
Apr 19 2023,positive,enjoyable worths seeing
Apr 19 2023,positive,it was cute enough for the kids with lots of action but something about it wasnt engaging and i couldnt fully get into it even my kids werent that impressed and they usually like everything i did like how they incorporated lots of elements of the game though and i liked the sweet storyline about mario and luigis close relationship
Apr 19 2023,positive,i enjoyed how they included all the video games mario bros  the different islands donkeykong luigis haunted mansion mario kart great movie very funny
Apr 19 2023,positive,it told the mario story perfectly i hope they make a sequel because they just put all the right pieces together
Apr 19 2023,negative,one of the worst cinematic experiences ive had since transformers 4

Apr 19 2023,positive,the kids really loved this movie and illumination did a cool job in brining in references from the games but it felt very condensed like they tried to fit a tv season into a 2 hour movie  as an adult it passed the time but the graphics were cool  the kids on the other hand were watching every pixel on that screen  which made it worth it

Apr 19 2023,positive,if you grew up with mario since the 80s i think youll like this movie    its nothing mind blowing but i felt it stayed faithful to the source material and i enjoyed the fan service and easter eggs throughout the film    if youre a mario brothers fan you should check it out while you can still see it in 3d

Apr 19 2023,positive,i have seen the film only twice   the film has brought me great memories of my childhood with this movie   the very first video game i got introduced was the super mario 64 on my first video game console which is the nintendo 64   i got to see almost all the characters mario luigi princess toadstool peach king koopa bowser the entire koopa army from gombas to spike koopas to even kamek the magikoopa   in the dk donkey kong scene i would have never thought that they actually put the dk 64 rap on the fighting sense of mario vs dk   honestly that was pretty neat   but in the end of the movie thats where it actually hit me while i am enjoying the movie i felt the movie taught me a lesson   to never give up on your dreams no matter if everyone is against you   still just dont give up   but honestly i hope there will be a sequel to this movie   its definitely worth the time watching it
Apr 19 2023,positive,this movie its perfect
Apr 19 2023,positive,i loved it so much i especially love how the excuse on why bowser always kidnapped peach in the video games was so that he could marry her a good twist that made my day
Apr 19 2023,negative,as bad as the other illumination movies if you hated minions youll hate this
Apr 19 2023,positive,as an 80s kid who still enjoys old and new nintendo games this movie was a satisfying ride of nostalgia and fun   my kids although young share my love for retro gaming and identified many of the easter eggs and references which only magnified their own enjoyment of the movie  if i could say one thing that captures my thoughts of this movie is that it made me happy and brought a genuine smile to my face   this movie was made for the fans and although it wasnt a masterpiece it deserves five stars for what it is and what it accomplishes

Apr 19 2023,positive,super mario was a great movie very entertaining and good length of time
Apr 19 2023,positive,as a mario and nintendo fan i had a great time  though the pacing is not the best as it probably could have used an additional 10 to 20mins in run time but if your a kid or a fan youll probably love it like i did even some parents and older audiences who have nostalgia for this series might also like it but its a fun time   ps chris pratt did a fine job as mario

Apr 19 2023,positive,its a fun good time in the theater a ver nice family movie
Apr 19 2023,neutral,nothing super about this movie despite it being in the title its mostly the kind of typical fare for kids with hackneyed jokes and predictable writing youd have to be afflicted with a severe case of nostalgia blindness to think this movie is anything beyond a kids film to pass the time its a pretty piece of fluff so at least your eyes wont have anything too difficult to look at
Apr 19 2023,positive,movie was phenomenal love how it touched up on a lot of mario related things cant wait to see part two my only issue with the movie is that it a little longer
Apr 19 2023,positive,it was very good peach was badass lol

Apr 18 2023,positive,nintendo brings back my childhood memory when i had my first nds and was struggling in the desert levels in super mario when i tried out mario kart and was knocked out of the way by that giant heavy bowser kart when i opened up mario galaxy 2 on wii and was amazed by the design and the graphics  if youve ever come in contact with any of the mario stuff i can guarantee that you will get fascinated by the movie just sit back relax and let out your childish side for 90 minutes it was fun ps the critics are just boring adults trying to show how mature they are dont listen to them
Apr 18 2023,positive,it was very enjoyable and i was lowkey rooting for bowser
Apr 18 2023,positive,the movie was great we all know why the critics in rotten tomatoes are bad because is not a disney type of movie keep hating best kid movie in a long time

Apr 18 2023,positive,a wonderful ride full of nostalgia
Apr 18 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal i felt as if i was young again watching this movie i was entertained throughout the whole movie which felt shorter than it actually was brilliant jokes beautifully animated and it was filled with charming characters and easter eggs that new and old mario fans would recognise this movie is fantastic and it sure put a smile on my face i loved it
Apr 18 2023,positive,the critical score for this movie is criminal to me maybe im biased as a fan of the games but that also means im part of the target audience and as part of said audience i can that i loved it
Apr 18 2023,positive,played the first 2 mario games and mario kart n64 never mastered them but certainly had fun  this movie was worth my time and money
Apr 18 2023,positive,was a good entertaining show
Apr 18 2023,positive,a great movie about a videogame
Apr 18 2023,positive,i am rating this as a kids movie and it is perfect  sitting through as an adult with fond memories of playing the various mario games it still scores high  so many kid movies have things in them that kids should not be exposed to  this is exactly what is advertised
Apr 18 2023,positive,critical experts create a review bombing
Apr 18 2023,positive,amazing many memories in my head about this i loved it
Apr 18 2023,positive,i dont think this movie deserves the very low critic score that it has sure some writing was a little off but it doesnt affect the entire movie overall its just an enjoyable family film that i do recommended that you take your kids to see
Apr 18 2023,positive,liked the whole movie
Apr 18 2023,positive,movie was engaging from beginning to end great storyline and wonderful adaptation definitely recommend it for all audiences
Apr 18 2023,positive,fun for everyone who watches it i sincerely hope theres a sequel 
Apr 18 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is the best movie from nintendo and illumination ever its just a masterpiece i watched it on april 6th with my 3 other friends in the cinema in 3d and we all thought the movie was awesome also the details and the effort and love that illumination and nintendo put into it only to recommend
Apr 18 2023,positive,movie was a bit short but the fact that it represented the video game franchise so well with plenty iconic moments from the games and more i am glad that i had a chance to watch this movie and cant wait for it when it releases on blueray or dvd
Apr 18 2023,positive,the quantity of reference in this movie makes it great not only for the younger audience but for the older one as well excellent movie
Apr 18 2023,positive,brilliant fun and really did a great service to the games and history of the nintendo ip
Apr 18 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie gets the job done with the technical aspects with a beautiful visual and animation but it ends up having a really simple script with meaningless dialogues and a zero emotion narrative for what this universe could offer
Apr 18 2023,negative,polished safe humourless and very dull
Apr 18 2023,positive,very good movie  showing a mario recently arrived in the mushroom kingdom and inexperienced in this new world  it is quite right that it is a simple story since we have a mario who is just getting to know the power ups and the kingdom in general  and being pressured to save his brother he barely has time to handle the power ups so it makes sense that it would be a light adventure with a relaxed climax since mario is not an expert in that world and it would be very forced to master all the power ups in such a short time  the movie deserves a  1010
Apr 18 2023,positive,i absolutely love the way they made it all original from the game into the movie brought me back when i was a boy playing the game i still play it but it was cool me and my daughter love the movie
Apr 18 2023,positive,best all times the critical are theys a pendejooss a mamarla joder
Apr 18 2023,positive,fun movie for the whole family nostalgic for me and the kids loved it definitely a great movie to see if you want to take your family
Apr 18 2023,positive,went with my spouse and two children ages 4 and 10 everyone enjoyed the movie  absolutely a great family film  im surprised the critics didnt like it they must not have families
Apr 18 2023,positive,a great and entertaining movie  lost a star due to a creepy melancholic blue star character they kept pushing at us  not sure how it contirbuted to the plot
Apr 18 2023,positive,great movie it brought me good memories from the video game
Apr 18 2023,positive,i was a bit spectical as anyone of pratt playing the voice of mario but i think he did a pretty good job with the voice  and even though there was potential for jokes to be implemented which if they were there i would definitely give a higher review and with shigeru on illuminations side i think they suprised even the people who didnt have high expectations for it    great job
Apr 18 2023,positive,there is no shame in saying that it takes advantage of nostalgia and that is what makes it the perfect adaptation of the video game both my children and i enjoyed every second of the movie
Apr 18 2023,positive,movie was great i been playing the games since the nes era and i liked the movie a lot my wife has only played the mario kart 8 game and she loved it more than me my little girl love it as well  a good family friendly movie doesnt need to have a complex plot and be inclusive like everything else now a days
Apr 18 2023,positive,if youre a mario fan this movie is for you all the easter eggs and tributes are very well done
Apr 18 2023,positive,this is one of the best kidfriendly movies thats come out in a while i loved every minute of it it is the kind of movie you could rewatch over and over with your family and have a great time the voice acting and visuals in this movie are incredible well done
Apr 18 2023,positive,i actually enjoyed watching this film just seeing how wonderfully animated it was there was so much detail put into this film the story was short and simple kids will definitely enjoy this movie because of its humor and its actionpacked adventure especially if they played the mario games the memorable music from the games being in the movie was amazing as someone who played mario games during their childhood i can say that i really do appreciate this movie presenting an accurate representation of what makes mario great and iconic and i thank everyone who made this film now what i didnt appreciate so much was some of the music choices for some of the action sequences such those late 1900s rock music it really felt out of place when i heard the music i thought they could have picked or composed music more suited to a mario movie there could have been more scenes exploring the different worlds a little more maybe even adding some more challenges i thought the story moved too quickly through those other worlds besides the mushroom kingdom and the kong jungle it might have made the the adventure more exciting all that dark humor from that talking star made me feel a little uncomfortable because this is suppose to be a movie for kids you know some may disagree but thats just my opinion overall the super mario bros movie was a good film and i liked it
Apr 18 2023,positive,funniest great family movie my family and i went to the theather 2 times
Apr 18 2023,positive,one of the best child movies love it 0 forced inclution
Apr 18 2023,negative,i was really excited to see the new mario bros movie but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations the plot felt disjointed and confusing with too many undeveloped characters and storylines competing for attention the acting was mediocre at best with some of the performances feeling forced and unnatural and didnt do justice to the vibrant and colorful world of the mario universe overall i was disappointed with this movie and wouldnt recommend it to fans of the game or casual moviegoers
Apr 18 2023,positive,is a eellent animation for fan of the games is a entreteniment for all ages
Apr 18 2023,positive,kids loved it adults didnt check their watches every 10 minutes desperate for it to end nice to have a movie that kids liked and a parents werent cringing at
Apr 18 2023,positive,my kids love it animation was great recommend for the entire family
Apr 18 2023,positive,best movie for kids of the year  great job  keep them coming
Apr 18 2023,positive,for fans of the game this is a must see for someone who doesnt know much about it it may just been a 7 out of 10 animation movie but for fans it is a love letter  i absolutely appreciate that they nailed an awesome balance of humour and seriousness no villian seems to goofy and even some creepy images made it in the movie it just feels imersive and not to kiddy  they also found a great balance in making peach not just a damsel in distress but also give mario his place to shine  and bowser ist just perfect
Apr 18 2023,positive,it was so fun much better than the 90s
Apr 18 2023,positive,most fun ive had watching a movie in a long time
Apr 18 2023,positive,literally the best animated movie ive ever seen everyone should go right now to the nearest theatre and see that masterpiece
Apr 18 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a cinematic delight that will satisfy not only diehard mario fans but also those who are new to the world of mushroom kingdom this movie has skillfully blended numerous references and easter eggs from the classic mario games into a captivating and wellcrafted plot    the story takes the beloved mario brothers on a wild and surreal adventure through a parallel universe ruled by the wicked king koopa portrayed by dennis hopper the chemistry between the cast members is impeccable and the voice acting is spot on bringing each character to life in a way that is both entertaining and endearing    what sets this movie apart from others is its attention to detail from the iconic sound effects to the colorful and imaginative set design the super mario bros movie truly immerses the audience into the magical world of mario the soundtrack is equally impressive featuring a blend of classical and modern music that enhances the overall viewing experience    but what really sets this movie apart are the numerous easter eggs and references to the classic mario games fans of the series will recognize and appreciate nods to familiar characters levels and items these nods serve as a delightful reminder of the many years of gaming history that inspired this movie    overall the super mario bros movie is a mustwatch for anyone who loves the mario franchise with its skillful blending of references a wellcrafted plot incredible voice acting and stunning visuals this movie is undoubtedly one of the best adaptations of a video game to the big screen dont miss out on this classic masterpiece
Apr 18 2023,positive,fun filled enjoyment loved every second very nostalgic indeed
Apr 18 2023,positive,great movie for kids very family friendly i still find sonic movies better for various reasons but this mario movies does justice for the franchise and is a great introduction for the next nintendo movies the main thing that bothered me was about cramping too much stuff into a fairly short movie its too much lore to put into a single movie other than that i had fun and my nephew 8 yo and niece 5 yo had a blast i cant recommend it more if you have kids
Apr 18 2023,positive,it was an excellent movie i loved bowsers piano skills his character was spot on princess peachs face and character seemed a little off to me but it didnt take away from the movies 5 stars
Apr 18 2023,positive,the moive was great me and my granddaughter loved it  it was funny love the graphics the music was awesome in the moive we love everything about it  cant wait to see it again 
Apr 18 2023,positive,the peaches song thats all i have to say
Apr 18 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a great video game movie if you know the super mario franchise you can see everything of the all games but if you doesnt know much you will enjoy it too its very funny
Apr 18 2023,positive,this movie was perfection the story while we have seen it before still does something a little different with it the characters are there best versons of these characters  the animation is beautiful and feels like the first illumination film that tried to be good over all the best video game movie of all time and well done illumination
Apr 18 2023,positive,best animated movie of 2023 so far 
Apr 18 2023,positive,the story and some of the characterization was average  however all the nostalgic references to the mario games made for a very entertaining movie that i hope would spawn into a cinematic universe
Apr 18 2023,positive,great movie in that kids love it and adults who grew up playing the game in the 80s will have a warm rush of nostalgia well done
Apr 18 2023,positive,if youre a deep mario fan this movie is definitely for you couldnt stop grinning throughout the entirety of the film

Apr 18 2023,positive,is so funny and bowser is the mvp
Apr 18 2023,positive,a great animated kids adventure that has appeal for fans of the sm universe as well its blatantly pegged at children so stop taking yourselves so seriously critics it could have been a tighter plot mind i loved the multigenerational game tieins and jb as bowser makes me smile
Apr 18 2023,positive,amazing kid at heart film for adults and children
Apr 18 2023,positive,this movie was fun for our entire family my husband and i enjoyed the nostalgia and inside jokes and my kids loved the bright colors and humor as well  there werent any slow boring for kids moments  this is the first movie our 3yearold has been entertained the entire movie without getting bored and wanting to wander the theater
Apr 18 2023,negative,i was really hoping for much more it was nostalgic for a bit but the story was far too basic and the script wasnt hugely funny
Apr 18 2023,positive,i love this movie i dont know what the tomatometer means critics dont know what fun is but there is a problem you need to play super mario to understand the movie i give this a 5 star because i do play super mario but if i showed this to my grandpa he would be like what is this movie but in general it is a good movie
Apr 18 2023,negative,im a gamer and have played mario before this movie aims to entertain kids not us who grows up with the game too childish

Apr 18 2023,positive,this movie was great i saw it with three 14 years olds one 9 year old and two adults everybody loved it the only issue is really the pacing of the movie these critics are just pro everything disney and they hate everything that is not made from disney just look at the last jedi
Apr 18 2023,positive,the critics are stupid and the mario movie was great with flashing colors excellent graphics and a wonderful soundtrack this movie deserves a higher rating critics are stupid idiots and they are biased
Apr 18 2023,positive,very enjoyable movie for both kids grownups and families those critics voted negative are just idiots
Apr 18 2023,positive,truly a fun movie that shows how out of touch critics are while its not the perfect movie winning 100 awards it does it job to entertain and give a fun story with a happy ending
Apr 18 2023,positive,really good movie with some good comedy critics are wrong
Apr 18 2023,neutral,the opening scene really gives you an impression this movie will turn out completely different than what actually happens but your hope is quickly betrayed and the only thing that holds this movie up is the animation and countless references to the games the story quickly falls flat with a simping bowser and luigi hardly being in the movie    this is the kind of movie that  as a kid  is eye candy and super enjoyable but once you grow up youll say to yourself why did i have to ruin my nostalgia by rewatching it
Apr 18 2023,positive,this movie is a big comfort blanket of warmth and laughter it stirs childhood memories for gen x to z  it is pure escapism and fun i loved it
Apr 18 2023,negative,the movie didnt seem very well thought out i was so looking forward to this movie as i grew up playing so many mario luigi and donkey kong games the story lines didnt add up and werent finished the musicsound didnt line up or fluctuate with the story a lot of characters were missing including yoshi daisy and toadette just to name a few just disappointing as i was really looking forward to seeing the characters that i grew up playing and loving behind the scenes and in their worlds
Apr 18 2023,positive,it was so good it had a lot of references and funny moments and though they cut out some funny parts from the trailer like the fish going on mario than toad it only gose on mario
Apr 18 2023,positive,great execution appropiate story i mean its a super mario movie what did people expect i felt a little bit rushed at times i mean it needs a rest in the middle becuase something is happening at every moment from start to finish
Apr 18 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic as much as i wanted mario and luigi to have an italian accent it was much better without it rlly hope they make a 2nd one
Apr 18 2023,positive,delightful take on the mario brothers franchise great pacing for children and plenty of substance for adults i grew up playing mario and i was smiling ear to the whole movie
Apr 18 2023,positive,action packed and thrilling from beginning to end a must watch for all with lots of nostalgia and excitement for newcomers to the mario world loved it

Apr 18 2023,positive,spoilerfree super mario bros movie review i thought it was pretty good lots of scenes made me chuckle good voice acting by everyone charlie day as luigi stood out as a perfect casting choice my favorite parts were the musical cues as scenes changed the score was very nostalgic and true to the og games the pacing was a little quick but not overwhelming overall i give the movie a solid b b if youre a mario fan i recommend it its a very fun movie
Apr 18 2023,positive,these so called critics have no clue what mario even is  this movie was absolutely fantastic for someone who grew up with the character it made me open up a lot of possibilities story wise in my head i never wouldve thought about thank you illumination
Apr 18 2023,positive,nintendo really doesnt miss this movie was both nostalgic and refreshing due to its wonderful presentation of established lore and great storyline even though i knew what was probably going to happen because of my almost excessive consumption of mario games i still felt surprised it was great for kids beautiful to watch and the characters are delightful my one gripe is the casting of chris pratt and he shouldve held the accent for the whole movie but this is really forgettable just because how good the movie is
Apr 18 2023,positive,best animated movie ive ever seen the voice acting was pure gold the art style was amazing and the story fit so well you really felt like you were with the plumbers as they went on their day to day lives before they run into the mushroom kingdom the classic characters were executed perfectly with their trademark personality and seeing the enemies like shy guy king bob omb and even king boo was very nostalgic and amazing best movie ive ever watched and i dont usually enjoy movies overall the plot was to amazing to fathom characters perfect and no flaws whatsoever maybe the absence of wario and waluigi was the only thing i would like to see fixed in a sequel
Apr 18 2023,positive,ihyluigiexe reference

Apr 18 2023,positive,such a great movie for all ages
Apr 18 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is yet again one of those clear examples in which a lot of priggish pseudo critics end up rating a movie without knowing the source material or even worse trying to compare this film with a videogame not only this is the adaptation that fans old and new wanted but most of all the loving character deserves from the references and easter eggs that fill the screen to the magic of riding karts on rainbows only time and history will prove the super mario bros movie to be not only the best adaptation of a videogame to a film but also an endearing movie for old and new fans of the jumping italian plumber destined to rescue princess peach
Apr 18 2023,positive,we dont need the critics anymore as the fans know what we want like the payphone booth the critics will be irrelevant the mario movie seth rogen i hope youre paying attention

Apr 18 2023,positive,if you know mario bros watch it for sure the inside jokes and themes were hilarious and helped bring a great story and boost to the movie without feeling at all forced id say that the story was good  a decent plot and storyline and no loopholes or confusion of what is even happening the humor was good and never forced especially if you know nintendo if you dont know anything about mario youll probably be halfway in and completely oblivious to half of anything happening but if youre at all familiar with the bigger games like mario bros dk and mario kart i guarantee youll have a blast

Apr 18 2023,positive,the movie is by no means a masterpiece but it has enough elements in it to keep one entertained all the way thru never felt like the film was wasted with downtime it was a punch of nostalgia for us that have grown up with the red mustache man and a nice experience for the ones that have only seen him in the last few years worth it
Apr 18 2023,positive,a must see for kids and everyone else

Apr 18 2023,positive,i have to say i was a bit disappointed with the plot it was exactly what any person would expect from a mario movie maybe it was the point but i wanted the movie to go beyond of what it ended being but saying this movie is bad is exaggerated its fun and entertaining the animation is the best illumination has given us and i had a great time watching it but i cant help but feeling disappointed with how basic the plot is and how they wasted the opportunity they had of doing one of the best movies of the year its a decent movie but they went with a safe bet instead of surpassing expectations like puss in boots the last wish did last year

Apr 17 2023,positive,this is amazing usually these types of movies would be botched entirely and only be funnyentertaining for people with a twoyearolds humor however this film pulled through and with the help of awesome graphics pulled together a work of art the plot is pretty basic but thats not what you watch it for you watch it for the nostalgia and the true marioness it contains

Apr 17 2023,positive,brought my 4yearold granddaughter  she wanted to leave halfway through the movie  she liked the princess peach parts but it might have been just a little too long to hold her interest  she usually lasts through other movies  she might just have been a little too young for this one

Apr 17 2023,positive,my 6 and 8 year old had a blast
Apr 17 2023,positive,the recently released movie super mario bros has successfully brought the beloved video game characters to the big screen while staying faithful to the original material of the game as a diehard fan of the classic game i was thrilled to see the attention to detail in bringing the mushroom kingdom and its inhabitants to life    the film follows the adventures of the titular mario brothers as they navigate through various challenges to rescue princess peach from the clutches of the evil bowser the storyline remains faithful to the games original plot and the filmmakers have done an admirable job incorporating iconic elements of the game into the film such as powerups enemies and of course marios signature jumping abilities    what truly sets this movie apart however is its outstanding performances the chemistry between mario played by chris pratt and luigi charlie day is palpable and their humour and wit provide a muchneeded levity to the intense action sequences additionally anya taylorjoys portrayal of princess peach is simply outstanding as she brings strength and vulnerability to the character    as an expert movie critic i must also mention that super mario bros has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from children and adults alike in particular my kids loved the movie and have been begging to watch it again since we left the theatre    overall i highly recommend super mario bros to both video game fans and moviegoers looking for a fun actionpacked adventure the films adherence to the source material and excellent performances make it a mustsee for all ages
Apr 17 2023,positive,amazing movie for adults and kids
Apr 17 2023,positive,very fun lots of nostalgia and references and for a video game movie a very good story the voices were played very well by all the actors and actresses and the few problems i had with the movie were problems that most people would never notice i have spent too long playing video games the score was very well done and set a very upbeat and positive mood
Apr 17 2023,positive,a great movie for kids and anyone who was a kid in the 80s

Apr 17 2023,positive,this is going to be a very hard film to review as a mario lover this film is 55 but from a critics perspective it is 25 ill just do the average of that for my score anyway heres my mario lover perspective it has mario in it it had a very funky design and the music had some great arrangements of mario themes from a critics perspective this was not a good movie poor choices of voice actors for mario and peach scene transitions were carried out terribly any time anything emotional happened a character said a joke everything in the movie happened by chance to end on a happy note though bowser sang a funny song
Apr 17 2023,positive,definitely a movie for everyone if you grew up playing super mario bros youll love this movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,the movie was obviously visually entertaining the whole time but i loved seeing old and new nintendo references that all ages can enjoy
Apr 17 2023,positive,do the mario swing your arms from side to side come on its time to go do da mario 
Apr 17 2023,positive,it doesnt exactly have a deep plot but then again neither do the video games it successfully captured the look  feel of the source material which is a gigantic improvement from the previous super mario bros film it was fun and kept short so it doesnt overstay its welcome i liked it and i hope they make a sequel in the near future
Apr 17 2023,positive,pretty entertaining if you know the mario universe but many of the licensed musical choices were misfires and im not sure why you have to hamfist a wedding into this or make bowser all horned up for peach
Apr 17 2023,neutral,my kids really enjoyed it 12 and 9 and liked getting to watch their first movie in 3d i expected more i had wanted to see it with my husband in the theaters but dont think well watch it again not worth the time great visuals and use of the kingdoms and characters from the game just not an entertaining plot
Apr 17 2023,positive,the audience has spoken excellent movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,the movie was fantastic its way better than the old liveaction 1993 mario film imo universal illumination and nintendo do not disappoint wahoo

Apr 17 2023,positive,loved this movie in 3 d
Apr 17 2023,negative,its a below average kids movies that only young children and very infantile adults will enjoy the rotten tomatoes critics consensus says that its thinly plotted and while thats very true its not the reason why its bad    not every movie needs a complicated plot and ive enjoyed many movies with simple narratives the problem is that the story just goes from reference to reference not even set piece to set piece literally everything is just a reference to the mario games most of them are just taken straight from the games and dont work in the world of the movie it was all just so lazily done none of the characters get developed not a single one    there are a bunch of things that dont make sense narratively like when they have to fight donkey kong the rules of the fight are never explained do they just have to murder each other knock their opponent in the water beat each other in the head until someone gets brain damage they just say they have to fight then mario says he will be the one to fight donkey kong even though peach should clearly be the one to do it because we just saw her being way better at all that stuff 10 minutes ago its just poorly written the action is all dull and the kart sequence on rainbow road is awful looking and boring    i can understand that a small child would enjoy this its colorful looks nice and is funny adults should really know better though and not be so easily blinded by nostalgia have some damn standards
Apr 17 2023,positive,tyler is dumb so not smart he think bad moomie but it really good movie
Apr 17 2023,neutral,uh it was an ok movie pretty boring chris pratt was ok the bowser song sucked though and i got a massive migraine after watching it
Apr 17 2023,positive,mario is the best movie of 2023 so far me and the family loved it watched it 3 times already anyone i spoke to also loved it so i dont understand how the critics on this site are so out of touch clearly with an above 90 postive audiance score people like the movie but the critics here gave it 56 score what does this mean basically the profesional critics were wrong i would be embaressed if i worked for this site
Apr 17 2023,positive,the film is wonderful the music the colors the nostalgia the dialogues are so natural even the jokes are well balanced and the movie timing is perfect i got emotional watching it with my wife and friends in brazil thanks for reading

Apr 17 2023,positive,if youre not a mario fan you would either get lost over the references or lose interest in the story however if you are like me an hardcore fan of the franchise youll be certainly delighted by this movie its not profound or emotional its simple pure fun as someone who doesnt like illumination that much im so glad they took time to acknowledge the franchise of our favorite plumber and didnt just used it as a product you can see how much they cared to make the fans happy well it was a success for me wahoo
Apr 17 2023,positive,from references to song choice its an awesome movie

Apr 17 2023,positive,halfway through the movie sucked gets much better at the end honestly i write this review lightly as it may have not been the movie that pissed me off rather the theater
Apr 17 2023,positive,someone said this movie was a love letter to everyone who grew up with mario a very apt description
Apr 17 2023,positive,this is my second time watching it and omg the super mario bros movie is absolutely perfect  ive been playing mario games for as long as i can remember they were pretty much the main video games i played growing up and still play to this day i was so freaking excited for this movie to come out and it was everything i hoped for and more so many easter eggs  i was in such awe every time i noticed a reference or callback to different mario games throughout the years which was pretty much the entire time throughout the movie whether it was big or small including the sounds and music this movie was incredibly nostalgic and the fan service of this movie was phenomenal i literally started crying when the movie started just because i was so overwhelmed with the nostalgia and excitement haha it was so visually stunning and the animation was incredible this movie encapsulated all the wonders of the mario universe im still in such awe its as if they combined all the mario games nintendo has made with magic and perfection and then created this masterpiece of a movie i really loved how they expanded upon mario and luigis personalities and relationships their brotherly bond was so beautiful and heartwarming i love them so freaking much bowser was so freaking cool too it was so awesome seeing a different side to him and seeing how they expanded upon his character while also staying true to his characterpersonality from the games my girl peach too princess peach was everything to me when i was a kid i always loved seeing her in all the games whether i could play as her or just see her being kidnapped by bowser and then being rescued by mario haha i literally idolized her and always chose her whenever i played mario kart and mario party and still always choose her to this day lol it was so freaking amazing seeing peachs character and personality be expanded upon as well i loved seeing her be a part of the action and be a strong and brave leader the little girl in me was ecstatic overall this movie was just absolutely incredible it stayed true to the games while also being its own thing i dont want to spoil anything but if youve ever played the mario games you have to see this movie 
Apr 17 2023,positive,husband and and the kids and i agree it was good   there are easter eggs for the older crowd and at least one character that only older minds will find funny   the storyline was definitely only deep enough for kids though it wasnt trying too hard to be overly emotional for sure but it did touch on the importance of being there for each other  i actually liked every character for their purpose  they all make you realize that its important to treat other people the way you want to be treated  they touched on the italian accents which is all i was hoping theyd do   the graphics were really good  so good  my niece said she would have really liked it in 3d which i hear is the way to go if youre not 30 and can handle it    great escapism without being knocked back into the real world by real world issues i dont want that for my movies or for the movies i take the kids to it was great for us all to relax and be us without having to feel some type of way because some type of topic    i love us all laughing at the same movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,it was my favourite movie of this year the negative reviews dont make any sense to me this movie was really fun and in my opinion deserves more love
Apr 17 2023,positive,i brought my teenaged boys and they loved it i enjoyed it as well  its definitely a must for your kids and vintage gamers great for all ages
Apr 17 2023,positive,i dont know what the paidoff critics were smoking here the top critic review slams mario for featuring a milquetoast family sorry critics the family unit still exists and we like having equal representation too cope harder kids were dancing laughing and engaged the entire time through somewhere along the lines these cork sniffers forgot entertainment was meant to be fun and this film provides it
Apr 17 2023,positive,it is simply a big gift for the people who grew up playing this game  perfect is the right definition
Apr 17 2023,positive,total nostalgia overload  such a fun movie  if you have even a little of this franchise in your past you will enjoy it  tons of easter eggs and hidden references especially in the music  honestly a must see for millennials and families
Apr 17 2023,positive,this movie contains good animation a good soundtrack but it was expected to be a movie about the first super mario but it was a combination of several nintendo games and especially that it is the super mario oddysey movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,we love it  i took my kids and they all loved it specially the peaches song  great movie  we had an awesome time 
Apr 17 2023,neutral,the movie got carried by refrences and 3 charachters chriss prat performance was meh the story has alot of plotholes and i understand the low critics scores
Apr 17 2023,positive,decent movie especially for those who grew up playing super mario bros i saw it in 3d so some of the images were accentuated i really liked bowsers character a fun twist so would i see it again most likely not but it was a good outing with the family
Apr 17 2023,positive,last night my family and i really enjoyed watching the new mario bros movie it was such a great time filled with lots of laughs and touching moments that left us feeling amazed this movie is perfect for anyone looking for an exciting familyfriendly adventure that is better than you could ever imagine

Apr 17 2023,positive,awsome movie if i could i would give it another star
Apr 17 2023,positive,peaches peaches  peaches  peaches  peaches peaches  peaches  peaches  peaches  peaches
Apr 17 2023,positive,picture yourself at your lowest point and you at your highest point how does one make their way from the bottom to the top well that question is answer in the mario movie where we follow two loser plumbers become the hero of an entirely new dimension this story has enlightened me to rediscover the very meaning of my existence and what it means to be a plumber in this movie you will be introduced to characters that show you what true heroism is princess peach is a baddie
Apr 17 2023,positive,movie was great  the blue ghost was a little ageinappropriate but all in all a great movie
Apr 17 2023,neutral,on part with other lesser illumination films bright colors and rapid paced enough to entertain a four year old  but not really anything there as far as story telling in keeping with the game its drawn from  which is known for gameplay not for a deep story   so youre given a very basic framework of a story that is then plastered with fan service  that may keep you somewhat engaged  but doesnt elevate this to a good movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie im not too informed of mario lore but thats ok i loved the references to other games and everything about it i did find it funny that they made mario not like mushrooms and think it was inspired from the live action one but it worked better here    i would definitely go see it again
Apr 17 2023,negative,this movie felt like a fairly generic illumination movie with a mario brothers skin attached to it  there was no plot no character development and the tone of the movie did not fit the mario franchise at all
Apr 17 2023,positive,the mario movie was so much fun i absolutely love it it was all the perfect flavors of nostalgia with a fun new twist the characters graphics story and of course easter eggs were all fantastic i watched it with my family and everyone enjoyed it finally a good video game movie  wahoo
Apr 17 2023,positive,i loved this movie i am a big marionintendo fan and this movie was a dream come true i loved soundtrack and the story
Apr 17 2023,positive,loved it very cute movie for the entire family i was dreading watching it but had promised to take the kids i was babysitting and it turned out really funny
Apr 17 2023,positive,nice family movie i like it
Apr 17 2023,negative,the movie is incomplete its boring it was made just to sell
Apr 17 2023,positive,i think you could do it better but i love the essence going back to when i used to play this game 3
Apr 17 2023,positive,great movie to watch with the kids especially 3d lost of action and fast paced
Apr 17 2023,positive,the kids enjoyed it
Apr 17 2023,positive,great movie funny all you want when you go to the movie with your childrens
Apr 17 2023,positive,the soundtrack was amazing and the movie was pretty funny at times
Apr 17 2023,positive,i am 36 years old i have a 4 and 3 year old that already love mario likely because of me i have a nostalgia for all things mario and having just gone to super nintendo world i am filled with mario fanfare that said i was not sure what to expect with this movie going into it it wasnt a masterpiece of a film but you dont always need that for entertainment so this hit all the marks at good levels some dullish moments were enough to make me a lil drowsy even at 11am but it was a fast paced easter egg filled movie that appeals to not only me but my 2 young children who are starved and craving mario on the daily looking back in 10 years or so this movie wont sit the way other masterpieces do with time but thats never what i needed or wanted anyway if you take this movie too seriously can you say you ever loved mario as a child just enjoy the ride and dont ask questions allow yourself to get lost with your favorite characters and memories
Apr 17 2023,positive,kids loved itso much fun  full of adventure and never a dull moment throughout the movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,a film that both children and adults can adore it is beautifully animated the script is simple but it has so many details and references to video games that those of us who grew up with super mario bros can feel like children again and leave the movie theaters with a big smile on our face
Apr 17 2023,positive,the critics are completely out of touch with reality this movies was amazing and well done the audience in my theater clapped multiple times
Apr 17 2023,positive,fun movie brought out the game in a great way staying true to it while creating a story in the process
Apr 17 2023,positive,great for kids especially young ones
Apr 17 2023,positive,the whole movie is a call back to my childhood i grew up with mario since donkey kong and this is exactly how i envisioned a mario movie i loved the callbacks to other nintendo games like wrecking crew punch out and kid icarus also seeing a donkey kong arcade machine in the background renamed jump man which was marios original name overall the movie is a very fun experience kids will love it and its got a lot of things for us nintendo nerds too
Apr 17 2023,positive,i loved it great for kids and adults it has catchy music great charters and the animation is magnificent i already wen to go watch it 4 times
Apr 17 2023,positive,this movie is really great the colors pop and is pretty funny it is full of references and even though there is licensed music only one track doesnt fit the tone the voice acting is on point and in the end is a great time  8510
Apr 17 2023,positive,the film fulfills its objective it is obvious that it is a childrens film but nostalgic adults will also enjoy it the easter eggs are manysimple story fast paced hits the mark enjoyable for the whole family
Apr 17 2023,positive,great movie characters definitely remind you of old times playing youll have lots of fun would have preferred a better ending specially between mario and peach

Apr 17 2023,positive,absolutely amazing though the plot seemed kind of rushed it was good and overall a mustwatch for children eligible for visiting in theatres
Apr 17 2023,positive,saw it a second time absolutely fun and full of heart critics take things way too seriously while the rest of us have a great time xp  this video i saw actually describes it best  
Apr 17 2023,positive,i went with my mario fan 9yr son expecting him to love this movie and it to be plenty tolerable for me as an adult what i got was a fast paced fun romp through some great easter eggs and inside jokes i actually really loved this movie to be fair i am also a gamer who grew up with this stuff so the nostalgia of the throwbacks and soundtrack really hit me im not expecting excellent story craft or super character development but i got more than enough cohesive story it could have been just a bunch of gags and jokes instead it held together well no one expects a deep movie just a fun enjoyable one i really had a great time my kid loved it and i know we will buy it to watch over and over again what a fun time
Apr 17 2023,positive,fun for the whole family adults too
Apr 17 2023,positive,the best animarion in the last 5 years very good we want more mario bros movies

Apr 17 2023,positive,if you grew up playing any of the mario games youll appreciate this movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,this movie was such an amazing mario movie this is how you do a movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,aside from chris pratt not really sure what accent or voice to use for mario it was such a fun film  bowser was the best character
Apr 17 2023,positive,really fantastic animation fanservice and a classic heroes journey story just make it a very fun movie to watch
Apr 17 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is fun for the whole family surrounded by gorgeous animation great legacy characters and nice albeit simple story  the super mario bros movie is a surefire keeper
Apr 17 2023,positive,it was a very good movie  funny and entertaining  was very disappointed that it listed it as 3d movie but it was not  glasses didnt do anything but make the screen darker
Apr 17 2023,positive,it was a cute movie for our 7 year old grandson
Apr 17 2023,positive,this movie was everything it was meant to be critics dont know how to critique a movie that is supposed to serve a specific purpose like this this was a marionintendo fan service movie period and it was fantastic at what it was supposed to be this isnt supposed to be a deep movie with a heavy plot line that changes your life its supposed to be colorful fun and loaded with easter eggs and it hit every nail on the head    its 2023 movie critics are dinosaurs in an era where everyone has a forum to post their own opinion their opinion doesnt matter and it shouldnt
Apr 17 2023,positive,everything i could expect respectful to the games and fun
Apr 17 2023,positive,its just one of the greatest movie ive watched just below harry potter a lil bit
Apr 17 2023,positive,such a good flick really enjoyed the nostalgia it brought could hardly tell it was chris pratt as he disguised his voice pretty well sounded better than the previews
Apr 17 2023,positive,i like everything my granddaughter niece and nephew loved the movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,perfect movie for my 5 yr old and i enough nostalgia for the parents but action packed scenes and comedy for the kiddos such a treat from beginning to end
Apr 17 2023,positive,gen x millennial and gen alpha approved it was a hit for our whole family  we loved the nostalgic easter eggs  throughout the film it kept the attention of our young children anything with chris pratt will always be great in my book the fact that the critic score is so low in comparison to the audience score shows just how out of touch hollywood critics are
Apr 17 2023,positive,if youre a mario fan and just a fan of nintendo the references are well used theyve cleverly put what makes mario so enchanting into the world building something like mario doesnt need much character development or explaining the origins of why things unique to marios world work like they do this is based on a game series where the story is usually just bowser capturing the princess again its just giving you a reason to go on a creative adventure thats what makes mario one of the most beloved franchises this film does a great job of representing mario thanks to marios creator shigeru miyamoto working so closely with illumination on this
Apr 17 2023,positive,excellent pratt is the best
Apr 17 2023,positive,i thought that this movie is gray for all the nintendo fans out there must see this movie

Apr 17 2023,positive,entertaining for all ages
Apr 17 2023,negative,the story was hardly there no character development it felt real rushed and that they really just wanted to get as much nostalgia in as possible dont remember laughing or having much emotional response at all except nostalgia from time to time i actually yawned a couple times
Apr 17 2023,positive,i was already sold on the movie but it was even better than i expected
Apr 17 2023,positive,great story and action sequences

Apr 17 2023,positive,great made movie loved all the references to different games and characters
Apr 17 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant     visually incredible cinematically exciting musically genius  yes it wasnt a complicated plot but does it need to be its a 90 minute mario movie im glad they didnt go crazy with the story  it had all the references and easter eggs a mario fan could hope for i was smiling the whole time and laughed a lot too  haters gonna hate 1010 must watch for anyone whos played a mario game
Apr 17 2023,positive,one of the best game adaption 
Apr 17 2023,positive,very fun movie jam packed with references very fast paced but fun
Apr 17 2023,positive,the movie was very entertaining and exciting to watch all of the actors did a fantastic job on projecting their voice to the characters however it was quite fast paced and i expected more characters to appear overall good movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,its a 8910 or in other words 4 stars  so i recently watched it in the cinemas and its not a bad movie  here are some problems  1there are a lot of characters that i wanted to appear but didnt  2they dont focus enough on different part of the movie  one that is in the middle   the fact that charles martinet didnt voice mario but lets say that chris pratt didnt do a bad job either  there are also some good aspects  1the references are nostalgic  2the battlesaction was excellently done  3the quality is gorgeous  4lastly bowsers soft spot is kinda funny  if by any chance the super mario bros movie 2 comes out ill definitively g o watch it in the cinemas
Apr 17 2023,positive,as a mario fan it was great a lot of little things placed in the movie that i seen and kept pointing out which made it a lot of fun simple plot with entertainment value
Apr 17 2023,positive,this is a great adaptation of all mario games great soundtrack and voice acting tells the mario story in a quick and fast paced manor keeping you hooked the whole time while the target audience was a new generation of kids every age can appreciate it easily one of the best video game adaptations to date
Apr 17 2023,positive,great fantastic super mario very fun and some great action
Apr 17 2023,positive,loved it if youre a nintendo fan this is a must watch loved all the little background details only a nintendo fan would catch
Apr 17 2023,negative,terrible  the movie was all over the place
Apr 17 2023,positive,the movie was good but way too short should have made it longer
Apr 17 2023,positive,an absolutely thrilling and colorful adventure with a great storyline what makes this movie so fantastic is that its for everyone it is the end product of writers producers actors and a director who respected the source material bravo they all did nintendo and the mario brothers proud
Apr 17 2023,positive,i loved it took my nephews who are 6 and 2 and they were engaged the whole movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,my family really enjoyed ourselves watching this fun and fast paced movie the 90 minute run time was perfect and although the plot was pretty simple it left plenty of room for great jokes and wonderful visuals
Apr 17 2023,positive,its simple childlike fun that celebrates the games and thats all it needed to be
Apr 17 2023,negative,i had high hopes going in it had high points and it should not be an awful experience but the flaws were too prominent for me to recommend it over any other movie    the movie is really preoccupied with proving that peach is not that kind of princess and redeeming her in some way which is fine but it felt like the movie was constantly pointing out how peach is a badass which kind of defeats the purpose for me    what bothered me personally is how little heart she shows mario in the glib illuminationesque dialogue of their first meeting it just came across as meanspirited they have some sweet moments like peach trying to catch marios gaze on the rainbow bridge when she knows hes thinking of luigi    the bane of this movie for me was the lumu i do not understand how it got passed censors and it shouldnt have it was constantly talking about suicide and death im never showing this movie to my children because of the damn thing all children are expected to go through a phase of death anxiety in their lives which can develop into full thanatophobia this lumu ends the movie comparing the end of the movie with death being an endless void without the damn thing this movie would instantly gain a star back    the relationship between luigi and mario and cranky and donkey were well done
Apr 17 2023,positive,great movie brings good old memories from the 90s
Apr 17 2023,positive,absolute fan classic fun enjoyable and a great watch
Apr 17 2023,positive,excellent family movie

Apr 17 2023,positive,this is very entertaining movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,i and my wife enjoyed it the kids loved it a fun movie to watch
Apr 17 2023,positive,actionpacked and looks great
Apr 17 2023,positive,amazing as a super mario bros games fan is impossible not to love it i totally recommend
Apr 17 2023,positive,great movie fir kids and adults
Apr 17 2023,positive,i liked the whole movie especially the bowser song about peaches and toad pulling up in the big car
Apr 17 2023,positive,amazing movie absolutely well done  chris pratt rocked it
Apr 17 2023,positive,its a colorful adventure with a humor anyone can enjoy you dont need to know the full lore of videogames because the basic lore is already popular culture and its impossible to not get a good amount of references and saying the opposite is either living under a rock or being ilogically objective thinking anyone older than 3 cant understand any reference or thinking the universe presented doesnt have enough explanation theres no need for explanation considerating that super mario bros has been the flag of gaming since 1986 and it doesnt have a complex or ultra deep lore so you would need to play every game not at all even if you have never played any game you will be able to get the movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,i cant really say anything i fell asleep halfway
Apr 17 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie very true to the game
Apr 17 2023,positive,the movie is really nice my boys loved the movie

Apr 17 2023,positive,most likely biased with my history of video games but a wonderful movie and definitely worth seeing
Apr 17 2023,positive,itsaperfect wahoo
Apr 17 2023,positive,dislike the plot and predictable like the other moviesvideo games
Apr 17 2023,positive,my kids and i loved it
Apr 17 2023,positive,this movie was action from beginning to end which kept my 3 year old entertained for the entire movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,for someone who grew up playing super mario bros this movie did a well adaption of the fun and memorable soundtrack mario had i enjoyed the movie they did so well
Apr 17 2023,positive,great movie fans are well served
Apr 17 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie plot may be barebones like what many critics claim but it just sounds like they havent played many or any of the mario games since the story has stayed consistent since 1985 i really like the callback characters like swanky kong and foreman spike along with adding a purpose to the infamous bluespiny shell and adding marios actual family princess peach not being the damsel was questionable but understandable since this is an origin story of how mario first discovered the mushroom kingdom and nintendo not surprisingly didnt mess this concept up the casting was fantastic making these characters really come to life like adding more emotion to mario or making a brand new side of bowser being a more soft and kind beast even the filler parts were great and the big moments hit like a subway train i watched it with one of my friends for the first time going and it was just an easter hunt just to see what things they added like the crazy cap in the town or the cat dive from 3d world although ive played mario since i was around 5 starting with new super mario bros on the nintendo ds i cant give this movie a score lower than 95100 definitely will be going back more than a few more times
Apr 17 2023,positive,super mario was so great you must see it i love the movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,kids loved the movie and rpx experience
Apr 17 2023,positive,fantastic funfilled adventure
Apr 17 2023,negative,anyone who never played a game or heard a good amount of stuff about the game could like this me as someone who played some games not even very many i dont believe this all bowser really does is sing love songs about peach and peach literally does parkour and even fights bowser i really hate how they did peach
Apr 17 2023,positive,fantastic kids movie for the whole family
Apr 17 2023,positive,absolutely loved this movie i went with 4 of my friends and this movie brought the child out of 5 adults as someone who grew up with mario this movie made me understand the characters better while incorporating some of the newer additions to the mario franchise peaches      
Apr 17 2023,positive,great entertainment enough to keep an adults attention while remaining kid appropriate loved it
Apr 17 2023,positive,love it  and my son and husband absolutely loved beautiful movie
Apr 17 2023,positive,very good and fun movie great game references
Apr 17 2023,positive,it wasnt bad there were some cringe moments but they werent so bad that it took away from the movie the comedy and seriousness of the movie balanced very well id definitely watch it again
Apr 17 2023,positive,it was a grate and entertaining experience filled with lots of of laughs and numerous nostalgic moments that took me back to my fond memories of the games as a kid
Apr 17 2023,positive,great music great story what great work
Apr 17 2023,positive,it was possibly one of the best movies ever created
Apr 17 2023,positive,it wa a nice movie very funny
Apr 17 2023,positive,my favorite movie of all time and whatever the critics said was completely wrong because this is a love letter to mario fans and was super accurate to the games instead of taking place in the real world which is what hollywood usually does and this movie could be enjoyed by anyone at anytime and hopefully the critics get some of their braincells back when they review it on their second watch
Apr 17 2023,positive,exceeded all expectations
Apr 17 2023,positive,honestly if you love mario or even nintendo in general you will have a blast with this movie as it is a amazing easter egg hunt with many things to find i also loved the jokes and story to it
Apr 17 2023,positive,movie was funny had a lot of easter eggs must watch
Apr 17 2023,positive,fun fast neat movie tons of fun easter eggs and nods
Apr 17 2023,positive,awesome    the movie keep marios essence
Apr 17 2023,positive,when i started watching the movie i suddenly felt a moment of enormous hype in which i never imagined seeing the true potential of this movie since it has several references to analyze and many scenes to enjoy
Apr 17 2023,negative,only good part was when seth rogen did the laugh but the movie was still fun bc how bad it was
Apr 17 2023,positive,i love the heavy incorporation of the video game and how they explain things so well i would love for them to make another movie that incorporates peaches backstory they did an excellent job
Apr 17 2023,positive,i loved the super mario bros  movie from start to finished the cast was great i felt like everyone of them made their characters come to life in what was a visually stunning  bright and colorful world that is  the mushroom kingdom i felt  like a kid again while venturing through brooklyn watching the mario bros do their best plumbing work the transition from  the real world to the mushroom kingdom was seamless  just like games i played  growing up it  was a treat for me to  see mario up and running  again  on the silver screen  i would definitely see it again
Apr 17 2023,positive,spoilers i dont understand why people keep saying theres no plot mario is a disappointment to his father and has a dream to be helpful as a plumber aka super mario brothers  the plot was they get sucked into the universe and mario gets separated from luigi bowser who wants to marry peach plans to destroy them if she turns down his proposal is the main villian and captures luigi mario trains with peach to find and save luigi this causes bowser to become jealous of mario mario takes on donkey kong in order for the king to allow them to use kong army peach is captured saving the mushroom kingdom and turns down bowser they all take on bowser and luigi is saved mario does so in front of his father and makes his father proud bowser is defeated thats the plot thats an entire story haha all of these things enable them to feature so many things i never thought possible for them to feature in the movie make sense of things they had no business making sense ofdeep cuts it was pretty good it wasnt amazing but it was damn good any critic hating it doesnt know the mario universe it could be way betterbut for a kids movieit was great and the amount of fan serviced was impressive i was so happy about so many things that i wont spoil here

Apr 17 2023,positive,it was not a bad movie for a mario movie it was good but it led to many new mysteries
Apr 17 2023,positive,honestly i went in expecting a real kids movie what the creators of this film and in working with the director and the sound team really helps bring back that nostalgia furthermore with having a well selected cast with one exception it brought forth a fresh feel along with new flavours for our beloved characters the only issue i have is that you know when its seth it kinda breaks my dk experience     but other than that it was really cool to feel the mushroom kingdom going in 3d is a must if only just once for those of you who remember beating bowser on n64 this will hit home and feeling it happen was cool     overall it will be added to my fav 5 list
Apr 17 2023,positive,grandson liked the movie a lot

Apr 17 2023,positive,its a great movie but i will give it a 35 because of marios voice and the soundtrack sorry guys but marios voice wasnt convincing everyone knew that would be the result but you guys tried anyway and recycling musics every movie plays as i need a hero is too much cliche for a great franchise as mario bros the movie itself is awesome the animation is great the characters are well modelled and the story is incredible but marios voice and the soundrack sorry but no

Apr 16 2023,positive,i was very skeptical to go and see this but im really glad i did the mario characters are an ip that ive always held near and dear to my heart and with the current trend of studios rushing out beloved ips for a quick buck i thought it would be the same deal    it wasnt the creators took the source material seriously and gave us a movie with heart the callbacks are awesome and any adult that grew up with a nintendo in their house will genuinely really enjoy it they dont try and reinvent the wheel and the voice actors dont try to steal the spotlight from their character youll get a seth rogan laugh out of dk thatll make you groan but thats about my only complaint this was done incredibly well    55 team luigi 4 lyfe

Apr 16 2023,positive,my daughter love it from start to end    favorite part peaaaaacheeeees  the song is really sticky haha    really good movie
Apr 16 2023,positive,mini spoiler but not so much at first i thought the movie was not going to be so great due to the reason mario and luigi was portrayed as so weak and of course normal people but midway through the movie i was flashbacking back to my childhood memories which made me realize there was a big reason on why the movie was so different on the original super mario bros1985 on the nes you were given a choice to play as mario or luigi of course the game was new and no one understood the basics until you played it enough to fully understand on marios standpoint during the movie he failed and understood more or less through trial and error which reflects back to the video game but there was another reason on why mario and luigi were just ordinary people looking back to the super mario bros super show1985 mario and luigi in the intro were ordinary plumbers and got sucked into the mushroom kingdom by the drainpipe mini spoiler before you go on reading of course read at your own risk mario and luigi also entering the mushroom kingdom by entering a magical pipe they found so from not liking the story until fully understanding why the writers decided to do this makes absolute sense at the end if one has played the games watched some of the original cartoons etc one can understand all the references thrown in the screen if one can quickly pick it up overall i enjoyed the movie and will be going back soon to rewatch it all over again hoping to pick up more references
Apr 16 2023,positive,great movie  lots of action and so fun to watchl the kids loved it

Apr 16 2023,positive,this movie is definitely a worthwhile watch while the plot is noticably quick paced and the connection between mario and luigi isnt as strong as hoped for the movie is still a work of art in its own right the cast was phenomenal and the animation was spot on with this realistic yet cartoonish look the references from both mario and other nintendo games were also a nice touch while this isnt a perfect film its the best that we have to date and plus bowser isnt played by dennis hopper so im happy with the results to all who worked on this film well done

Apr 16 2023,neutral,well animated but honestly felt like a bunch of cut scenes put together wouldve been nice if characters could actually talk to each other for longer than 30 seconds making the excuse that its a kids movie is not the statement people think theyre making nearly every kids movie of 2022 has this beat with story

Apr 16 2023,positive,the movie was great loved the dynamic of mario and peachbrowser really stole the show at a lot of the points in the movie luligi needed more screen time but he still sticks up for his brother just like mariodonkey kong is funny sometimes and his relation ship with the cast especially mario is pretty goodi would say the movie needed to be longer it felt so sped up with no transition from beginning to middle and middle to end
Apr 16 2023,positive,growing up as a fan of the classic nintendo videogames there was a clear feeling of nostalgia in revisiting these characters the movie is loaded with easter eggs and call backs to the original game as well i had a great time watching this take your kids   theyll love it 7510

Apr 16 2023,positive,me and my kids enjoyed the movie
Apr 16 2023,positive,fun for the whole family
Apr 16 2023,positive,absolutely awesome the movie is for fans of the series for sure but nostalgia aside the story acts almost as a prequel to the games with the heroes not yet in their element learning the world the incorporation of stylized jumps and landscapes familiar to the game is flawless creating a living world where that behavior is just everyday activity all the characters feel like their counterparts from the game while the princess is no damsel in distress you still get the feeling that she is alone against an unstoppable force and needs a hero marios greatest strength is that of the player the heart and spirit to keep going keep trying no matter how hard it is overall this is a 10 in my book ignore the stuffy harsh critics with no real knowledge or understanding of what this was meant to be
Apr 16 2023,positive,loved it  as a gen xer this was great
Apr 16 2023,positive,i loved it like most people it really brought back memories to me

Apr 16 2023,positive,saw in 4dx which made it better nice nod to the nostalgia behind the mario games more like a 45 but def not mad about spending the 
Apr 16 2023,positive,i thought it was awesome    i absolutely loved many parts of the movie but in some places i feel it fell off or had missed potential some things i felt were built up but never continued although the good parts of it absolutely make up for all that    there also are a lot of references that may be missed if you dont pay attention
Apr 16 2023,positive,wellpaced highly accurate to the games and overall just a lot of fun    the idea that it was too feminized from peach being a girlboss became less of an annoyance when she explained her backstory and the fact she was raised in the mushroom kingdom all her life bowser kranky kong and princess peach are the ruling authorities of the mario realm therefore in terms of their actual abilities are also the 3 big power houses so it makes some sense that peach is that skilled and to add more she was no match for bowser even with donkey kongs help after nearly and only nearly spanking mario the only thing i wouldve liked to see from peach is her being more ditzy like she was in the games in fact combining that with competence wouldve made her character more comedic and entertaining    it was clear from the trailer that luigi was going to be the rescuee role of the movie but he was allowed to redeem himself of that role in an attempt to save mario and with him become a super bro with the star he got his shinning moment just as mario did mario himself got his shining moment 3 times in my opinion once with battling donkey kong another with rescuing his brother luigi and the 3rd in defeating bowser with him    the koopas goombas the toads and every other side creaturecharacter made the world feel complete as well as the addition of forms for mario i especially loved diddy kongs moment and toads monster truck moment however there were some things missing that i thought were important to the mario world marios white super form i think that was important because its been implied in game culture that the white suit is the equivalent to super sonic in sonic the hedgehog but i suppose you could save that for a second movie i was unacceptably surprised though that there were no fire balls thats a key ability that i expected mario to have one way or another also i dont understand for the life of me why there was some deep homelandersupermansounding general toad in peachs service they shouldve just replaced him with an earlier mushroom character like toadsworth toadsworth was without a doubt missing as a character it also wouldnt hurt to have toadette but i guess you could save her for a 2nd movie too but if king boo was going to be at bowsers wedding where is my boy petey piranha anyway those missing things and characters are not a reason to dock points from the overall writing those are just game accuracy issues that i have some general some personal    for actual writing some of the dialogue was too simplistic and even unreasonable at times like why toad joined peach and mario and bowsers peachloving moments though funny were way too cringy especially since mario and luigi end up living in the mushroom kingdom anyway my biggest issue with the writing of the movie was the setting of the climax it was like watching early supergirls wet dream of expecting too much gratitude over too much justarrived damage and destruction i think the writers shouldve thought of a different place for where that last pipe would lead mario and everyone else it instead led to a seemingly overall desolate brooklyn except during the moments it was most convenient to make it not desolate    id give this movie anywhere from an 88 to a 90 well done nintendo zelda movie next
Apr 16 2023,positive,great movie my kid loves it
Apr 16 2023,positive,great and very funny comedy the whole things was awesome
Apr 16 2023,positive,its perfect my whole childhood in the movies

Apr 16 2023,positive,really good movie my granddaughter  i absolutely enjoyed it from beginning to end
Apr 16 2023,positive,went with the whole family and absolutely loved the super mario brothers movie
Apr 16 2023,positive,nonsensical horribly paced and absolutely stupid the super mario bros movie is just barely made bearable due to its great cast and fantastic animation theres no story and events happen for absolutely no good reason whatsoever for the sake of inserting a cheap cameo nothing feels earned and the movie doesnt take its time to develop or build up to anything it just rushes through each scene with reckless abandon despite all this though i did still have a decent amount of fun and the blatant stupidity of the movie almost makes it seem self aware overall not a bad movie to just turn your brain off to but for those that arent diehard fans of the mario bros franchise thisll be a miss the mario fan inside of me wanted to give it a higher score but as it is the glaring flaws really dragged this movie down in the long run
Apr 16 2023,positive,if you are a mario fan i recommend you to see this masterpiece
Apr 16 2023,positive,we loved all the different characters the comedy and action kids really enjoyed it
Apr 16 2023,positive,its one of the best if not the best videogame adaptation of all time it is so much fun watching all the characters that you grow up with in movie theater this movie is perfect it has great comedy animation adventure and can please kids to adults

Apr 16 2023,positive,love the movie brought back childhood memories
Apr 16 2023,positive,really cool but it was going to fast there was no break time if the movie were a little but longer it would bé perfect  there was a lot of references i loved it if you are a big fan of thé mario game go watch it 
Apr 16 2023,positive,kids loved funny movie had our attention the whole watch our 2 year old was quiet and focused highly recommended
Apr 16 2023,positive,nobody listens to critics anymore and this is a perfect example why the movie was amazing for my kids and i we all loved every moment of that movie and would see it again in a heartbeat fantastic movie dont pay attention to the critic score

Apr 16 2023,positive,lol the critics are confused as to why its doing so well they must like the halo show
Apr 16 2023,positive,the most fun animated video game movie since the first two sonic movies it may not be a perfect film for story but as a fun time with cool nods to the games and nintendo history its historic     cant wait for the sequal with yoshi
Apr 16 2023,positive,this movie successfully choreographed different aspects of the mario brothers games while taking a new view as someone who wasnt raised in the mushroom kingdom having mario be introduced to each of these concepts is useful and smart writing as it introduces a newer generation to new concepts while including easter eggs for those who already have developed a bond with the mario brothers games
Apr 16 2023,positive,great movie kids loved it
Apr 16 2023,positive,loved it as an adultalways played with my kids and they loved it too
Apr 16 2023,positive,movie was amazing fun for the entire family 4d experience was incredible
Apr 16 2023,positive,fantastic animated movie with superb graphics and super smooth animation watching on anything less than imax would not do it service  despite critics reviews which apparently never played a mario game in their entire lives everyone of all ages will enjoy this film whether or not they noticed any of the nodshomage to the vast mario games in existence  the pace of the film is observed but it is understandable to keep kids engaged in the film  too much lore is great for old fans like myself but it will bore kids easily  it is a balance that needs to be made  i personally believe it was handled very well and look forward to what illumination studios does next with the franchise
Apr 16 2023,positive,loved how they stayed with all the iconic parts of super mario bros
Apr 16 2023,positive,awesome true to the video game
Apr 16 2023,positive,took my son to see his very first film and we had a blast

Apr 16 2023,positive,loved it all play mario understand and appreciate reference among us
Apr 16 2023,positive,it was good but the pace was too fast
Apr 16 2023,positive,entertaining and fun hidden references to the games arent nearly as gimicky as i had feared they may be they actually worked well i heard many complain about the casting but after watching it i dont understand that at all i thaught that the voice actors worked well with the characters dont go into it expecting a deep intricate plot its a movie based on a childrens video game dont be snobby and take it for what it is and you will enjoy it very much
Apr 16 2023,positive,what an amazing movie  why the low critic score  thats ridiculous my kids loved it and i loved bringing them to it  pacing is good story is on point voice acting worked and was great all around  this was done right  took 30 years to have a proper mario movie but its finally here i really hope this isnt the last of nintendo in theaters  post credit scene implies it wont be

Apr 16 2023,positive,awesome movieif you played mario bros and loved it then your in for a treat great job on making this come the screen
Apr 16 2023,positive,as someone who grew up with the entire franchise this movie was packed with nostalgia i still wonder why they chose to not use charles martinet as the voice of mario my guess is age but chris pratt still did a good job i like how they still included charles in the movie    i took my whole family to the show and though my kids didnt catch some of the throwback references they still absolutely enjoyed the show after the show they immediately got home and started playing mario kart 8    solid movie and very fun to watch
Apr 16 2023,positive,super hilarious loved all the references to the old mario and nintendo games definitely recommend
Apr 16 2023,positive,hands down this was the best movie this year my children 14 and 11 loved loved loved the mario bros movie they really showed out with this one we would definitely see this again at the theaters our favorite 
Apr 16 2023,positive,the first movie to cause a theatre reaction that i have longed to see and be a part ofas soon as the bowserpeaches scene began the whole theater knew what time it was  awesome feel good movie it was a movie that made me think back to my childhood and playing mario kart with my cousins and friends  i think it has opened a whole new door for nintendo and illumination  the fact that nintendo already has so many games and franchisees that have already been created and established also has the super mario world pavilion at universal and now has a movieit is such a smart business move for the company and i fully believe that if they play their cards right then we might have a whole new cinematic universe on our hands  how ever that the story plays out this movie has made a fan out of me and i am hungry for more  ps this was written by a disney fan
Apr 16 2023,positive,voicing was interesting not the best the story was a good beginning to what seems to signal multiple storylines leading to a bigger project definitely a mixture of kid and adult humor overall it was enjoyable

Apr 16 2023,positive,critics are out of their minds and obviously have never played a mario game or had fun in their life    this was the most joy i have had at a theater in a decade i laughed the entire time the story was perfect with enough video game references and easter eggs from every generation of mario play i had no idea what to expect couldnt have anticipated this film delighting me like it did will absolutely return to see it again  shame peach isnt being markers as the queenvip she is
Apr 16 2023,positive,if youre a mario fan whether that means youve played every game or are at least aware of most of them you are going to enjoy this movie with so many references and charm it makes it a must see the critics are just too judgmental and probably havent ever played a single game in their life they say it has no plot or character development and to that i say they really havent played the games because thats what mario was always been about the games have never had an advanced plot or deep characters mario is just a fun series and this movie encapsulates that perfectly making it the best video game adaptation ever made 8510
Apr 16 2023,negative,went for the nostalgia and that was about it

Apr 16 2023,positive,it was cool movie as it included of all mario games and lugie games that been made it had some laughters in it but i felt like they rushed the movie to fast then im seeing online that people are getting mad at scene where one of king koopas henchmen dress up as princess toad stool lmfao

Apr 16 2023,positive,such a cute movie went with a group of uni students and we loved it dont listen to the critics
Apr 16 2023,positive,honestly i though chris pratt as amazing an actor he is i thought at first that it would be terrible but it turned out to be absolutely terrific it both made the movie family friendly but also kept the mechanics from the actual game my favorite parts were when they did the 2d scenes making you feel like you are actually playing the game they also did peach a lot of justice instead of a damsel in distress she played a badass who teaches mario to be more powerful in conclusion i think the movie really did capture the playfulness yet seriousness of the actual game series
Apr 16 2023,positive,i seen this movie on easter loved it so much went to see it a second time if your a mario fan all the easter eggs in the movie you will love as someone who grew up with mario and still plays mario on their switch till this day i noticed almost every easter egg if u want a good time with family or are impatient waiting for the next mainline mario game this movie you will love

Apr 16 2023,positive,it was amazing changed my life loved the song peaches
Apr 16 2023,positive,the animation and the music was beautiful voice acting was pretty good and it had a lot of easter eggs it lacked in story though i was pretty bored the movie really needed a plot b and it felt like the characters just went from one thing to another as if nothing really mattered they had fred armisen play cranky kong and he had the worst lines i wish theyd let him at least improvise
Apr 16 2023,positive,it was very good and full of great humor plus as a gamer myself i noticed quite a few neat easter eggs i would recommend it to any fans of mario young or old just remember that its not as serious of a movie as others and that its true appeal is in the entertainment the nostalgic easter eggs seeing the mario characters given some additional personality and the overall fun of the mario franchise if you go in expecting it to be the best animated film of the last several years you might be a little disappointed but as long as you remember its appeal is more in the fun and spirit of mario with some great humor on top i think youll enjoy it quite a lot
Apr 16 2023,positive,the best animation movie in the last 20 years  is a letter love to the nintendo and super mario fans  absolute recomended for kids too

Apr 16 2023,positive,perfect for families
Apr 16 2023,positive,great movie my family had a really fun time with it
Apr 16 2023,positive,if you grew up playing the games youll definitely enjoy the movie its full of references to the game and stays very true to that the plot and resolution were a little too easy for my taste i think it may be due to the fact these characters didnt have a backstory to begin with and theyre trying to stay true to the video games overall definitely a fun movie and an enjoyable one to watch with the family
Apr 16 2023,positive,im a long time mario fan and really enjoyed the movie a lot with my little daughter for the first time in a movie both of us understood the references easter eggs ando knew allá the characters un the way

Apr 16 2023,positive,the best adaptation of a video game to movie that could be done so far
Apr 16 2023,positive,loved the movie was a perfect mix of serious and funny they did a great job incorporating multiple elements from the super mario world it was fast paced but as a movie aimed for younger generations it was explained enough
Apr 16 2023,positive,a wonderfully crafted movie that is loyal to the video games this fastpaced and a bit cliché adaptation is what makes it a great watch for everyone
Apr 16 2023,positive,flipping fantastic a masterclass in film went in expecting to hate it but boy oh boy was i wrong great plot great narrative drive fantastic score fantastic cast special thanks to toad and the penguin nation if you havent seen it you are miserably missing out to not see this is to not live at all
Apr 16 2023,negative,very basic boring only for fans of mario much fan service and color but without content funny for kids but the adult public is not the best movie
Apr 16 2023,positive,both my daughter and i love love loved it
Apr 16 2023,positive,movie was great loved how they incorporated all the different games and music from the games
Apr 16 2023,negative,the visuals were amazing the soundtrack was rocking because it was imported from the games and what wasnt was pop music used in appropriate scenes no imagination required and the story was a snooozefest sleep deprived parents exasperated with their kids all around the world were able to get a two hour nap for the low low price of admission hopefully younger siblings will not be bullied over how luigi was treated in this film but i doubt it every single scene in brooklyn was cringe and the movie should not have returned there for the finale peach dk and the depressed prisoner are the saving graces mario and luigi were by far the worst parts of the film
Apr 16 2023,positive,this movie is a much see for mario fans of all ages lots of easter eggs for og mario fans and tons of fun and excitement for the new generation of mario fans such a joy to watch and great for the entire family 55 stars

Apr 16 2023,positive,very fun to watch  the film will reportedly be a mix of animation and liveaction and will follow the adventures of mario and luigi as they try to save the mushroom kingdom from the evil bowser while there is not much information about the plot or the tone of the movie yet it is expected to be a familyfriendly adventure with plenty of humor and action    overall there is a lot of excitement and anticipation surrounding the release of the mario bros 2023 movie and fans of the beloved video game franchise are eagerly looking forward to seeing how their favorite characters are brought to life on the big screen
Apr 16 2023,positive,it was a fun movie  laughed and had a good time my wife and i are in our 60s and played mario 64 with our kids when they were little  brought back great memories oh and seth rogan didnt ruin it like he has other movies for those that care 
Apr 16 2023,positive,critics have been too critical about this movie pun intended  while it might be a movie made for kids i still absolutely loved it the story was great the casting was great and the movie pays tributes to so many mario games it had a buttload of nostalgia and the whole movie had the classic mario feel

Apr 16 2023,positive,when i first saw the mario movie it was awesome as the sonic movies and hopefully they will make a sequel of it
Apr 16 2023,positive,i feel it was different and the fan boys will be mad i loved it i feel they captured a lot of the games overall combined stories of the princess gets stolen and mario has to be rescued
Apr 16 2023,positive,brought me back to my childhood playing super smash bothers gameboy mario games super mario world and mariokart the added bonus was my daughter having a blast lol
Apr 16 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a masterpiece the characters are perfect the pace of the story was just right and the dedication to the characters was perfect and the story is very good with much more backstory but the character development wasnt much but still it was a must see for children and adults alike

Apr 16 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is definitely nothing short of a treat for long running fans of the franchise and as a whole is definitely worth a watch i would say the first half of the movie is slightly better than the second half but overall a pretty good movie especially for illumination

Apr 16 2023,positive,they say the mario bros movie may make a billion dollars  wow   what does that say about the pro reviewers that rate it at only 58   the pro reviewers are clueless about what entertainment really is   they have no idea what the people want and dont really care
Apr 16 2023,positive,my girlfriend and i both loved the movie  not every movie needs to have a complex story to be good  the story in mario is simple but effective at achieving its goal to take us on a fun lighthearted journey through a fantastical world  the visuals and sounds were all amazing  we would watch it again
Apr 16 2023,positive,movie seen in french  overall a great movie voice actors are really great really well animated immense fan service can be bad for some but not me amazing soundtrack it was really was a great moment     however the pacing of the movie was off it was fast we could see that they wanted to show us few things here and there and thats a bit of a let down that didnt 15  20 more minutes for the movie wouldve been perfect to make it feel less rushed at some points    810

Apr 16 2023,positive,movie was fun and entertaining theater was a pigs sty
Apr 16 2023,positive,movie of the year no doubt
Apr 16 2023,positive,great movie full of action
Apr 16 2023,negative,not as bad as i was expecting but the movie itself was still mind numbingly generic if i never had friends to insult on it with this wouldve been a mostly disappointing experience     pros   voice acting didnt bother me as much as i expected save for cranky kong    bowser was pretty entertaining hence his personality wish more of the characters were over the top like him    both donkey kongs voice acting and role in the plot was pretty entertaining giving mario a rivalry was a fun dynamic     cons  bland characters save for dk and bowser    by the numbers executed plot it barely works as the bare minimum     shallow references felt like they were trying to get a remember that thing from the game cheap reaction    unfunny jokes this is just personal preference but from the audience i heard an obnoxious omg i cant believe the cute luma said something so messed up which added to my distaste of the film even more    a disconnect with the movie via its modern musical numbers and making mario the proverbial man from mars trope because when i think of mario i definitely think of acdc    as for the post credit scene spoilers                  a yoshi egg is the hook for an inevitable sequel wow thats a lot to look forward to cant wait to see yoshi in the sequel oh wait i already saw a swarm of yoshi earlier in the movie anyways its a generic slop of a movie with some underlying yet far too few highlights
Apr 16 2023,positive,awesome movie i loved it
Apr 16 2023,positive,great for kids and for the parents that used to play mario as children
Apr 16 2023,positive,excellent movie very cute a lot of action  a must see
Apr 16 2023,positive,i honestly dont have a single bad thing to say about the movie it may not be the deepest or most impact full movie of all time but it tells its story well
Apr 16 2023,positive,this movie is amazing definitely check it out there are references of mario games the whole way and its lots of fun pointing them out
Apr 16 2023,neutral,3d was unimpressive and volume way too loud
Apr 16 2023,positive,love this movie all the level songs they played for different scenes just kept bringing me back to my childhood
Apr 16 2023,positive,amazing recreation of the gamesand funny parts love it
Apr 16 2023,positive,i disliked the fact that peach didnt very get the top of the flag
Apr 16 2023,positive,this movie is great for the whole family full of fun and action leaves you wanting more
Apr 16 2023,positive,look im not trying to say this is a great movie in fact academically speaking its very much a mixed bag the voice acting takes a bit to get used to the narrative is basic at best and some of the jokes needs to be launched into the sun illumination make a movie without any cringe humor in it challenge 2023 with all that said however i find myself in the incredibly precarious position of being biased by the subject matter given the cinematic history of the character at hand here all this movie had to do was show just a modicum of respect for things and i probably wouldve walked out with a smile on my face gratefully theres at least more than a modicum on display the score alone for this is chock full of enough audio cues to make the avid mushroom kingdom visitors ears prick up at least twice or thrice coupled with the stellar animation and some inspired setpiece design throughout i have to say i was more than entertained sure the fanservice is empty and lazy but what can i say im compromised here heres hoping i can feel less guilty about whatever sequels they make to this
Apr 16 2023,positive,super fun lots of subtle references mario fans will pick up on and enjoy the soundtrack was incredible as well

Apr 16 2023,positive,throughout my childhood i loved playing mario kart and super smash bros as well as donkey kong country so i was so happy when this movie was announced i had such a fun time watching movie as did everyone else in theatre this movie absolutely made sure it upheld all the traditions and lovable moments from the games i know when people first heard of the cast and everyone was quite worried i can reassure you there was and is nothing to worry about at all the cast was perfect as was the animation very well done the story was very good and had some fun surprises some scenes were just awesome such as the mario kart scene my gosh that was just beautiful my issues with this movie however was mainly with the pacing and editing a lot of the editing unfortunately felt very sloppy almost rushed in the production process the first half of the entire movie was very rushed no real time to take in anything but the second half really got back on track my final issue is we never really get much character development or emotional moments apart from mario which i understand why but at the same time some other characters couldve used more moments and development overall this was a very fun movie that took me back to my childhood

Apr 16 2023,positive,this is the best video game adaptation ever    positive sides     the characters are very cool its very funny for both children and adults very beautiful and colorful animation and many references for those who are fans of the game  the songs in this movie are very epic and nostalgic and i felt like i was going back to the times when i played super mario on my video game    negative sides      the story is a little predictable and also dont create expectations that the movie will have the deepest story of all time just like disney and pixar movies for those who dont know the super mario games you wont like the movie and despite the pop songs present in the film it did not make my experience worse but despite everything even so its very worth it i highly recommend it    attention      at the end of the movie there are two postcredits scenes so dont leave the theater until both scenes are over    hope you enjoyed the review

Apr 15 2023,negative,despite some wonderful attention to detail and fun references to the source material this film provides next to nothing above average boring run of the mill illumination animation combined with writing that ranged from dull to heinous is a recipe for falling asleep in the theater when it wasnt forcing copyrighted music into every single action scene the soundtrack was great playing on classic themes from the super mario games all in all it wasnt a truly terrible film but it also had nothing truly good going for it a below average childrens animated film
Apr 15 2023,positive,fun family time great movie

Apr 15 2023,positive,this movie would get a five star if everyone is voiced by chris pratt luigi bowser peach etc wouldve been better if they were voiced by chris pratt my favorite part of the movie was when chris pratt saids its chrissing time and pratts all over the place this movie should be called super chris pratts brother the movie it wouldve been more accurate actually the entire movie should be just chris pratt reading a dictionary other than that this was a movie of all time

Apr 15 2023,positive,one of the best animated movies in a long time
Apr 15 2023,positive,i was skeptical of the way it started but by the end i was fully immersed in a masterclass on how to celebrate a franchise absolutely a must watch nintendo nailed this
Apr 15 2023,positive,good movie well done kept the storyline of the original smb game with a few twists  good for those who grew up on the game franchise but also fun for those just being introduced good family movie

Apr 15 2023,positive,while the story is not anything to get excited about the movie did everything i hoped it would and more the voice acting was great most of the time even pratt did a good job the easter eggs were plentiful and fun but the mostly the movie is just a blast from start to finish
Apr 15 2023,positive,very fun movie lots of references to past mario games and the soundtrack is incredible and full of references i thought it would be more targeted for kids but this movie was definitely made for mario fans
Apr 15 2023,positive,if you grew up playing these games you will identify nicely with this movie and almost inevitably like it if not love it  if by chance you are a crusty old critic whos movie experience depends significantly on a compelling plot you may leave disappointed  im actually sit somewhere in the middle on this but my kids absolutely loved the movie  on a side note im thinking the lead role could have been handed to an artist with a stronger accent and a smaller price tag and done just as well
Apr 15 2023,positive,great little movie love all the 80s music
Apr 15 2023,positive,such a great kids movie and a movie for mario fans in general
Apr 15 2023,positive,definitely worth watching for any member of the family as a long time fan of mario i definitely liked it

Apr 15 2023,positive,great movie i had lots of memories flashing back to yesteryear my daughter loved it so that was a plus to experience it with her if youre going in with a mind set of thinking of a great oscar movie then you are in for a disappointment but if you go see it with the kids mind of the early 90s then your in for a great time
Apr 15 2023,positive,is very good lumaleee is very funny and the movie is very very good in 3d

Apr 15 2023,positive,two short but i love the mario game
Apr 15 2023,positive,the graphics were great and movie had a great storyline
Apr 15 2023,positive,a very thin plot with breakneck pacing that seems to be crafted to keep the attention of nintendos core demographic  children but that being said it was a colourful engaging and endearing portrayal of everyones favourite plumber and his friends in a world of homogeneous marvel blockbusters the super mario bros movie is a welcome breath of frivolous fun and childish adventure
Apr 15 2023,positive,it was surprisingly good its only flaw is that since its a movie for children its rather short other than that it has a good plotline and serves to entertain both long time fans and newcomers to the mario franchise

Apr 15 2023,positive,it wasnt bad kept us entertained but for a family of 7 it costs us a fortune to go out  i expected a little more
Apr 15 2023,positive,it was very good i thought especially as a movie with a target audience of younger ages the jokes were good and i liked the story and references to the games i felt peachs dialogue was odd at the beginning but got better later this is why the movie is not five stars and a perfect rating

Apr 15 2023,positive,the movie was hilarious there was a bunch of nintendo references throughout the movie i wish that they showed more of the numerous places mario peach and toad went through instead of just 3 to 5 seconds like yoshis island and the cheep cheep bridge to name a few overall i could not stop smiling while watching the movie

Apr 15 2023,negative,lacking in any particular depth the super mario bros movie relies on nostalgiapandering to keep the attention of children and adults alike the pacing of the film is too fast for you to get attached to anything besides the references to new and old mario games alike illumination was not trying to hide their ways of relying on flair over quality whatsoever

Apr 15 2023,positive,the best game adaptation in my opinion  i will watch again and again  the only thing is the criticism of this glorious art angers me  the world does not need these critics that want to roast anything they want just to think they are at the top of the world but in reality they are just crying maggots spreading around  i wish the fans were the critics the fans communities are awesome  a dick in your ass critics  if you have any complain about this then go cry to yo moma

Apr 15 2023,positive,i cant remember the last time i had that much fun at a movie they towed the line between making a fun movie and playing with nostalgia perfectly my only complaint was that chris pratt didnt sound like mario he wasnt bad just not my first choice idk why they couldnt get charles martinet to play mario they cast him in the movie so they couldve easily had him play mario but even that cant change how much i loved this movie
Apr 15 2023,positive,i get overly emotional when things seem just perfect the combination of visuals musicalscore  meaningsubstance a decision to provide a specific shotsequence due to previously stated storypoint andor audiences previous knowledge provide an emotional weight basically i cried a lot during this movie     from cranky kong donkey kong as a chad makes sense rainbow road and jumping off rainbow road to land on another section of rainbow road marios ground pound to racoon mario shoutout to 1989s the wizard many parts of the movie felt to me just perfect     the movie treated its audience of all ages and almost all exposure levels to its ip as mature individuals each aspect of the movie could be viewed on many levels depending on your exposure to the ip and allinall the movie was still enjoyable     i do understand if an audience member has zero exposure to the world that is the marioverse then almost everything that makes the movie perfect to me will be lost on them   luckily i am not them p    i watched this with my 7yo daughter who is completely new to the marioverse with minimal game exposure and she laughed a lot for myself there were so many easter eggs so many nostalgia sequences and i cried a lot     5 stars
Apr 15 2023,positive,admittedly i am a mario fanbeen playing since the nintendo nes first came out when super mario bros was on the same cartridge as duck hunt been waiting for a good mario movie ever since john leguizamo said that the version he was in was groundbreaking sure if the metric by which we are measuring is in the level of disappointment or halfassedness i guess thats true of all his films real throw up in my mouth entertainment went to see the new one yesterday not worried whether the film would attempt to trans my children or encourage them towards sexual depravity i didnt expect to walk away thinking it was the best animated film ive seen in nearly 2 decadesbut it was towards the end my youngest leaned over this movie isawesome it had the best animation ever and the story was constructed to include as many themes as possible no slaves built this country no man in a skirt shopping for tampons no lesbian make out session no trans flag no womanface cabaret performance no pride parade and no nonbinary calf it was the cap on a great day with my boys and got a standing ovation
Apr 15 2023,positive,amazing soundtrack and graph8cs
Apr 15 2023,positive,it was super cute movie any age would enjoy it
Apr 15 2023,positive,i loved all the fun easter eggs for old fans the visuals were incredible and i cant wait to see it again

Apr 15 2023,positive,movie was great but oh boy the intheatre experience was spoiled by the amount of people having loud conversations during the film would watch again tho
Apr 15 2023,positive,this is real cinema my respects
Apr 15 2023,positive,fun movie was great to see the nods to all the previous iterations of the mario world but done in a way that was still fun for a person who didnt grow up with classic mario kept me entertained kept my 4 year old mostly entertained cant ask for much more from a movie like this soundtrack was a
Apr 15 2023,positive,i love it this is my second time watching this movie its bring back all my childhood memories definitely ill watch it again for 3rd time

Apr 15 2023,positive,i loved it better than than the sonic movies had me literally loling throughout the music and nintendo nostalgia are fantastic with many references to past games there are so many that i know i missed a few so i want to see it again definitely buying a physical copy and will be buying the soundtrack
Apr 15 2023,positive,loved this movie perfect for the whole family
Apr 15 2023,positive,this movie is great all the easter eggs add to the story go see this movie  i feel most people that do not like this movie are not mario and nintendo fans and do not understand the easter eggs that help move this story forward i thought that this was one of the best movies that has done that using all the easter eggs in a genius way no movie has done this better i am seeing this movie more then once in theaters and this will be a movie i will buy nintendo nailed this movie go see it do not listen to people that are out of touch and are not fans and can not understand way mario becomes a cat i mean did you not playing mario games really fr maybe you should go play some mario games and then review the movie again so i am a mario fan and i have played the games and nintendo nailed the environment and power ups that have been used in mario games thus far this is one of the best movies i see in while and i look forward to what nintendo has planned next
Apr 15 2023,positive,overall the mario movie proves to be an enjoyable experience particularly for fans of the franchise and children the animation is nothing short of stunning with beautiful visuals at every turn the camera work is dynamic and engaging with some scenes reminiscent of the beloved games themselves    however the film falls short when it comes to character development and storytelling the plot is a slight twist on the classic mario game narrative but it lacks depth and complexity there is no metalevel story to be found which may disappoint those seeking a more thoughtprovoking experience    this movie plays it safe catering primarily to its fanbase and providing a delightful experience for children fans of the games will undoubtedly appreciate the familiar elements and characters but those looking for a deeper more intricate storyline with character development may find the film lacking    in conclusion the mario movie is a visual treat that will delight children and fans of the games but it may not satisfy those craving a more profound and engaging narrative
Apr 15 2023,positive,it was fun and entertaining  my child loved it
Apr 15 2023,positive,its one of the best movie interpretations ive ever seen one of my favorite films to date 1010 must watch

Apr 15 2023,positive,its a pretty good movie by illumination standards if you dont know muchdont care about mario this movie can feel like things are just being thrown at you it assumes that the viewer is a mario fan that already knows everything so it never really bothers to explain the universe and how it works its not a fantastic movie by any means but its still a whole lot of fun
Apr 15 2023,positive,reminded me of every game i ever played it was a seamless experience of the games in a movie definitely recommend seeing it at least once

Apr 15 2023,positive,it was an awesome movie from the action to all the references that a mario fan could ever want it was perfect in every single way and the possibilities of a second mario movie on the horizon due to the subtle ideas in the movie such as leaving some knots untied gives it an even better rating from me if the tickets would have cost 30 i still would have seen it

Apr 15 2023,positive,unapologetic in its roots and just plain fun as a result it wasnt a storytelling masterpiece but its so fun so who cares
Apr 15 2023,positive,amazing  movie with plenty of cool moments to enjoy would be a 5 out of 5 however lugi was way to wimpy browser was played out baddly dk  was way to narcissistic they spend way to much time in one place and the start was very rushed
Apr 15 2023,positive,it is the perfect mario movie it is filled with hillarious dialogue great voice acting from everyone involved and a lot of homage to the decades of nintendo content out there i couldnt imagine it being made any better
Apr 15 2023,positive,this movie is an absolute love song to the fans who grew up in the golden age of gaming during the 80s and 90s with enough new era stuff for the younger generation pay no heed to the critics as this movie once again proves how out of touch they are this movie is a blast for everyone even if you arent a mario fan

Apr 15 2023,positive,a beautiful movie perfectly adapted highly recommended and entertaining
Apr 15 2023,negative,i made an account to review this move if i was maybe 18 years old i might have enjoyed it a little but it was awful there was not plot and the entire movie was solely aimed at fitting every single mario reference into its runtime
Apr 15 2023,positive,starts well ends well but the middle was quite convoluted going on several tangents

Apr 15 2023,positive,all i can say is that if you grew up with mario or have some common knowledge of the franchise you will absolutely love this movie like i did now incase you dont know anything about mario or the universe he comes from youre still going to find yourself enjoying it because of the humor and the simple but yet same plots that the games always go for

Apr 15 2023,positive,this was really good i cannot understand why anyone especially a fan of the games wouldnt like this movie its for everyone and not just a kids movie you should go into this movie with the expectation to just have fun my only complaint is that it jumped around to much and i feel they could have fleshed some things out a little more there were some points where i felt the movie was going to end sooner than i thought but it didnt it gets to the action pretty quickly if there is an extended version i sure would love to see it 910 would see again
Apr 15 2023,positive,the animation is good and the story is awesome and bowser is funny and everything is just cute
Apr 15 2023,positive,too much constant peril where a character is always a millisecond away from getting hurt let us catch our breath a bit and enjoy the magic the mario universe
Apr 15 2023,positive,just the details they took the canon from every mario game and put them together in the best way possible only 45 stars because the story is a bit boring but so is all the mario games i mean you only play them for the gameplay and mechanics not the dialogue

Apr 15 2023,neutral,voice acting better than expected but the key plot points felt underdeveloped and brought little emotion battles seemed lopsided without any suspense or connection to mario except for his relationship with luigi even then the relationship couldve used some more work     youre better off watching it on tv at home

Apr 15 2023,positive,my son loves it and has seen it twice
Apr 15 2023,positive,the movie in general is good but the start is slow and the presentation of the problems to keep the story is a little generic and lazy the soundtrack is really good with some particularly unexpected songs

Apr 15 2023,positive,this is an enjoyable movie to watch together with your kids growing up playing the original game and some of the nods to the 80s was great it was a blast seeing the looks on our kids faces as they watched the movie and that alone is worth the price of admission     sometimes critics just like to read their own words so i would ignore most of what these professionals have to say and check it out for yourself its a fun adventure movie and a great way to spend a night out together as a family     i dont know about you but im not going to see an animated movie with my kids and complaining about dialogue or a thin plot just go and enjoy the film and watch the kids and adults when they come out of the theater smiling cheek to cheek

Apr 15 2023,positive,love it great for kids and adults
Apr 15 2023,positive,loved the princess peach song
Apr 15 2023,positive,as a super mario bros fan to say i was excited for this movie would be a massive understatement and to say i enjoyed it would also be a massive understatement its everything a mario fan could want and more with a plot that feels like it was taken right out of one of the games and callbacks to every mario game that i can think of unless you dont know anything about mario or how the games operate in terms of the world building i cant see anyone not liking this film which is probably my only criticism i have about it even though i dont fall into that group i can definitely see how it alienates a large group of people who dont know much about mario by explaining very little to the audience about how the world works as with most other people before the trailer came out i was really skeptical of the existence of this film mainly due to illumination being behind it but dont let that stop you from watching it because i would be lying if i said that this is my new favorite illumination film by a long shot
Apr 15 2023,positive,it filled the game to a t very much enjoyed it along with my boys and grandson
Apr 15 2023,positive,such a cute movie both my kids enjoyed it

Apr 14 2023,positive,the movie was true to the game except for princess peach but that was perfect
Apr 14 2023,positive,the movie was family friendly without sacrificing the story elements adults can appreciate lots of callbacks familiar music and several visual gags better than the ads looked 
Apr 14 2023,positive,everything that you could want or expect from a mario movie packed with so many easter eggs in references a refreshing relief from all of the other movies that are out
Apr 14 2023,positive,its not perfect but it doesnt have to be the pacing went by so fast its seems the makers of the movie feared they would have no story to make a movie long enough so they cut to many corners and made the movie unnecessarily short and fast it could have benefited the movie if it had more time to get to know all the characters a bit more but nonetheless as a diehard super mario fan i really enjoyed it seen it twice and will see it a third time in spanish with the family cant wait to see a sequel and other potential nintendo movies
Apr 14 2023,positive,loved this movie lots of cute easter eggs to for the gamers to notice

Apr 14 2023,positive,i havent been to a movie theatre and not cringed at least once from some type of hollywood nonsense in a long time but when i saw the mario movie i was grinning from ear to ear from start to finish i highly recommend this film and bring the family too
Apr 14 2023,positive,it was very childish but was littered with easter eggs and references to previous games in the franchise overall an enjoyable movie although the plot was pretty weak
Apr 14 2023,positive,this movie has an amazing animation style to it i truly love the references to the games and their music in the movie the voice actors play their characters so much better than i had previously thought overall this movie is a masterpiece
Apr 14 2023,positive,i just finished seeing the movie with my 11 year old son and it was a blast  great fan service and the sequels and spinoffs were cleverly set up just long enough to keep from being tedious for a kid and fun from start to finish      this is what a good family movie should be welldone

Apr 14 2023,positive,fantastic in every way smiled with a nostalgic high the whole time if you played the games you will love this movie
Apr 14 2023,positive,please do not listen to the critics reviews of this film if youre even considering watching this film then one would assume you have kids or at least a bit of a gaming background in which case just go and watch and enjoy without all the pretentious nonsense surrounding this film     it is non stop fun from start to end and as regards plot and substance it is rather akin to an amalgamation of previous game iterations so if you or your kids enjoyed those then you will not be disappointed     finally if you have a 3d 4dx cinema near you it is worth paying the inflated ticket price as it really enhances the fun so much fun in fact that my kids have asked to go and watch it again and i enjoyed it so much i will take them again
Apr 14 2023,positive,really good and accurate character actors were top notch kids loved the movie
Apr 14 2023,positive,definitely worth watching
Apr 14 2023,negative,boring basic movie  if you are a nintendo fan you might like it but if you played sega like the rest of us cool kids lol it seemed to be more of a straight to video type movie  plenty of easter eggs but short on entertainment  very bland blah movie  oh and sonic the movie both of them are stupid as all heck

Apr 14 2023,positive,this movie was awesome truly a very balanced videogame adaptation with potential for more sequels on top of that the movie felt anything but gutless and showed many streaks of great character building and comedy as well as some deep emotional tones and an electric choice of music most certainly a film worth watching and following with the entire family

Apr 14 2023,positive,fun to watch movie for kids and adults alike the easter eggs are great for fans of the video game series but the story stays generic enough for all individuals to fall in love with all the iconic characters would definitely recommend
Apr 14 2023,positive,a movie for the fans and a great time all around rushing and pacing issues sure but its nice to see an illumination movie where its clear that it was made for fun
Apr 14 2023,positive,a gamers dream come true
Apr 14 2023,neutral,visually spectacular but some of the voiceacting doesnt seem to fit the characters  plot is minimal and predictable  fans of the franchise will like it but other viewers will probably find it lacking
Apr 14 2023,positive,really good movie i just got to see it and it was hilarious
Apr 14 2023,neutral,animation set design and the score remixes were a beautiful love letter to the mario franchise  outside of that the poor pacing weak characterization and paper thin script leaves much to be desired not a bad time but mario deserved better  if you can get a halfoff ticket like i did bowser is worth the price of omission alone
Apr 14 2023,positive,best adaptation of a game so far
Apr 14 2023,positive,amazing hommage to the video games great colorful animation fantastic music with remixes from koji kondos tracks could be longer

Apr 14 2023,positive,i was transported back to the 90s thanks to an amazing movie im really looking forward to visiting nintendo land at universal
Apr 14 2023,positive,if you are a fan of the series there are a lot of references to keep you entertained if you arent a fan of the series its a very barebones story without much explanation for the various things that happen in it at least its well animated as you would expect from an illumination film
Apr 14 2023,positive,the definition of cinema
Apr 14 2023,positive,best animated movie ive seen in a long time something for kids adults and everyone in between so much nostalgia and the voice actor performers were great the movie ended and i wanted more nintendo cinematic universe

Apr 14 2023,positive,awesome movie in dinamix cinemas its almost like being into the videogame
Apr 14 2023,positive,absolute blast dont listen to the critics who take the movie way too seriously it was never meant to be something revolutionary plot wise if you are looking to have a fun time watching your favorite mario characters come to life on the big screen youll get exactly that  awesome
Apr 14 2023,positive,family fun awesome movie story line   voice actors were great
Apr 14 2023,positive,clinch story line and contented with hero savings from animation unicorn company without aspirations anymorei didnt have mood to comment  and watch what is going on until i was activated by kids laugher now its my best movie and move this year as i was kid now
Apr 14 2023,positive,im not sure why the critic reviews are so bad the movie was incredibly respectful of the source material and despite chris pratts mediocre performance it was an incredibly endearing film
Apr 14 2023,positive,saw it with my son plenty of call backs to the mario games i played as a kid
Apr 14 2023,positive,it works from the nice animation and colours to the serviceble plot and characterization this movie knows what a nintendo fan wants action and adventure over an complex story good feelings and happiness over drama good movie for all ages but mostly kids and mario fans
Apr 14 2023,positive,included all the mario characters from different games i dont play but my son and his son do and they loved the movie  mario spans generations
Apr 14 2023,positive,peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
Apr 14 2023,positive,its a fantastic movie and a great audiovisual spectacle this movie will take you right back to your childhood playing all these mario games
Apr 14 2023,positive,nostalgic for me is it sad that at the end when the star was absorbed the music that played made me smile and shed a tear simultaneously just bc i remember the song when you absorbed the star in the game if these reviews get read by producers  you must must must make a super smash bros movie and have all the characters in it  i mean all not 12 not 34  all  captain falcon marty  ike  all   ill pay 100 to see that in theaters dont get any ideas on the price but seriously
Apr 14 2023,positive,completely charming i took my nephews and nieces to this film and we had a wonderful time it was good fun and full of expected fan service and had a pretty cute story i have been playing mario since the 80s and i was surprised at how well they actually captured the universe the characters also seemed to be dictated by the great super mario rpg which was certainly the best fleshing out of the mario characters     ignore critics as always its fun its exciting silly and warm hearted a perfect childrens movie and of course us long time fans love it too its really a must see
Apr 14 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics they have absolutely no taste when it comes to films these days all they care about are the artsy type films not ones that are genuinely entertaining like this one the references the music the actors all perfect fits for people who grew up with mario and other nintendo properties i cannot wait to see what kinds of things mario and the gang get up to in the sequel
Apr 14 2023,positive,loved the movie  toad was by far my favorite character in the movie
Apr 14 2023,positive,not having to play or have the mario games i thought the movie was fun and entertaining for my self as a oldman
Apr 14 2023,positive,great for kids yes the story is thin and i wish mario has less of a brooklyn accent but its fun  clearly the critics are judging on a same scale as oscar best pictures this is not that it is a clean family friendly movie which in todays world is harder and harder to find without all the messaging that studios like disney try to put in
Apr 14 2023,positive,i actually really liked the movie it wasnt perfect obviously but i was expecting something good and got the good thing i was expecting just like the sonic movies the last of us arcane cyberpunk etc were getting some good video games adaptations recently and im all for it    loved the easter eggs too
Apr 14 2023,positive,love it so fun to watch
Apr 14 2023,positive,it was good but my favourite character sonic wasnt in it i took off a star because this youtuber named nathaniel bandy kept squilling and screaming at the film screen he had his flash on and kept taking pictures of the movie and repeatedly kicked my chair it ultimately ruined the experience he was escorted about ten minutes before the movie    ended and the police took him after the movie was over as he kept screaming at children and ran up and down to cinema steps in his boxers he screamed sonic forever and through himself over a family of five watching the movie
Apr 14 2023,positive,i took my grandson he is 6 year old and he love the movie it was his first time experience
Apr 14 2023,positive,old school and new fun for the entire family

Apr 14 2023,positive,cute movie with lots of nostalgia for the adults who grew up playing super mario bros
Apr 14 2023,positive,this was one of the greatest movies i have ever watched even when animated it can be very funny to adults as well
Apr 14 2023,positive,love it its just perfect 
Apr 14 2023,positive,while the critics say is not for adults what they so must have missed were the subtle references of nostalgia every 30 seconds  the punch out photos mario 64 paintings in the castle kranky kong is a real character funky diddy the cheats used in situations the dozen games referenced   the adults might just pick up on the 150 references in the movie  even the cage set up was similar to mario rpg   lots of fun    oh and the jab at kids these days complaining about having to pay things multiple times to beat a level lol
Apr 14 2023,positive,excellent movie that evokes the great memories i have of this video game incredible references great songs and the song dedicated to peach is wonderful great fun for the family
Apr 14 2023,positive,best movie of my entire life i was blown away by how good the movie was
Apr 14 2023,positive,me and my family loved it great for us millennials that have been playing mario our entire lives and our little ones that are just discovering the mushroom kingdom it also does a little bit of lore building which i found interesting apparently critics have never played a video game in their entire lives
Apr 14 2023,positive,i loved how inclusive it was and all of the easter eggs
Apr 14 2023,positive,my family and i loved loved loved this movies some hilarious moments which i wont spoil and we had so much fun with this i think the rotten tomatoes reviews just shows they are no longer relevant what the people say is more important
Apr 14 2023,positive,cool movie    also you critics have no life
Apr 14 2023,positive,keeping in mind that this is a childrens film i had a blast watching it the vibrant colors quick action and nostalgic soundtrack was more than enough to keep me invested great for the family
Apr 14 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie has to be one of the best video game movies of all time heck it has to be one of the best animated movies of all time theres so much fun to be had here for both mario veterans and nonmario fans     as a nonmario fan myself ive enjoyed every second of this masterpiece of course i did have one issue the pacing was too fast for me it felt like they were just rushing all the way to e  the end not leaving enough time for these characters to truly develop hopefully they do better in the sequel
Apr 14 2023,positive,so good been waiting and didnt disappoint if you are a long time player you will love it the animation quality is incredible too

Apr 14 2023,positive,i was a bit worried but its a fun movie
Apr 14 2023,positive,i think it is telling just how out of touch rotten tomatoes is when the audience score is 96 but rt says 58 here is the beauty of this movie i took my family to it and we all had a great time i was nostalgic and my children smiled the whole time probably will go see it again maybe if hollywood would stop trying to be self important and stop sniffing each others farts almost all of their movies absolutely suck nowadays they could get back to making entertainment like the mario movie
Apr 14 2023,positive,super fun movie we had a great time with it nostalgia animation and voice acting are all on point pleasantly surprised dont understand how the critics can be so off base with this one whatever its one we plan on keeping in our collection once it releases to bluray
Apr 14 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it nice experience to spend 90 minutes watching a fun movie
Apr 14 2023,positive,loved the movie about time something that i can take my kids and not cover their eyes
Apr 14 2023,positive,fun movie for kids and adults
Apr 14 2023,positive,a fresh take on a classic storyline complimented by beatiful animation sprinkled with easter eggs and nostalgic music
Apr 14 2023,positive,unlike what every critic says because those guys are often wrong about a movie so why should the ratings suffers if its all 30 adults this movie was insanely good and im glad that it wasnt generic peach gets kidnapped mario saves her but instead took place over two worlds and luigi is getting kidnapped also peaches is a 100100 song lol
Apr 14 2023,positive,it was a cute movie to bring your kids to
Apr 14 2023,positive,finally a good family movie i could watch with my son
Apr 14 2023,positive,we loved the movie as an adult who played the game as a kid is was the perfect mix of old school and new the graphics were excellent and i was really invested in the characters
Apr 14 2023,positive,on april 8th 2023 i saw the film it was awesome when chris pratt voicing mario omg
Apr 14 2023,positive,it was beautiful it had a crazy storyline and a lot of good humor a child would love this due to its colours and very creative style i would personally recommend this over sonic 1 and sonic 2 and this movie are about even this being one of the most expensive or earning movies is very worth it even parents can love this movie 1010
Apr 14 2023,positive,a movie recommended for adults and children since we all grew up playing mario bros and the new generation has the opportunity to see it on the big screen
Apr 14 2023,positive,it is my game memory
Apr 14 2023,positive,excellent animation illumination never fails me surprising voice acting especially princess peach and toad much more suitable than i expected i dont really care about how interesting the lore has to be the movie entertains me and thats enough
Apr 14 2023,positive,just a treat for gaming fans
Apr 14 2023,positive,great family fun loved the movie cant wait for the sequel
Apr 14 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is an amazing time experiencing it in theatres i like all of the characters the humor was great the soundtrack slaped so hard the only issue i have with the movie is the very quick pace and thats it overall a great time
Apr 14 2023,positive,decent enough mediocre in some aspects but definitely fun to watch
Apr 14 2023,positive,funny but thats it bowser peaches song it missed more of the adventure and fun of playing mario

Apr 14 2023,positive,it was amazing such a great laugh and was great to see so many references to other nintendo games in there too great music references to the different super mario games as well which my fiancé really appreciated and loved telling me which game each one was from my brotherinlaw to be who has autism and was super focused on the film and really enjoyed it as he was sat on the edge of his seat and did his excited ticks we saw it in a sold out cinema screen full of families with small children who all were so quiet which normally isnt the case so definitely a great one for the family to see 
Apr 14 2023,positive,getting the plot to its most basic concept and adaptating it to the new generation of storytelling the super mario bros movie is a refreshing new release for the plumbing brothers music adapted from the videogames to the movies like never before while giving more personality to mario luigi peach and bowser personalities that have never been seen before  without a doubt a golden a a total must see    ps what the deal with critics score on this movie you guys are destroying a wellwritten and wellanimated movie for free i dont know what you saw but this movie it aint 53 so go get your life together maybe thats what rotten
Apr 14 2023,positive,super good and it has sooo many references to the original games like donkey kong 64 and mario 64

Apr 14 2023,positive,really good awesome representation of the games
Apr 14 2023,positive,i was worried that the plot of the wouldnt make sense or would rely on dumb jokes but i was pleasantly surprised the voice actors matched the characters very well the plot of mario and luigi being down on their luck plumbers who accidentally stumble into bowser and peaches world via the new york plumbing system and marios journey to save his brother were all very well executed it may not be my favorite animated movie but it was very cute and i liked it well enough that i would pay to see it in theaters again if given the chance
Apr 14 2023,positive,the movie is amazing but i didnt like how they introduced the characters there are many cringe scenes if you are a 100 nintendo fan you will know that the story lacked essence
Apr 14 2023,positive,i loved this movie watched it 5 times now definitely a love letter to the super mario fans
Apr 14 2023,positive,my kids loved this movie and so did i
Apr 14 2023,positive,best movie ive ever seen in a while definitely it needs a second version
Apr 14 2023,positive,this movie was committed to create a movie that entertain video gamers of all ages loved it
Apr 14 2023,positive,this was a much much better outing than the one that happened in the early 90s it was full of nostalgia and was great albeit predictable from beginning to end managed to capture my toddlers attention throughout as well it was an enjoyable ride just dont go expecting an oscar worthy movie enjoy it for what it is and what its meant to be
Apr 14 2023,positive,not bad for a mario adaptation kids loved it and i enjoyed it 
Apr 14 2023,positive,mario is mario nothing was changed for any reason and it only stuck to things from the game series
Apr 14 2023,positive,well done great animation nice story and cute movie kids in the audience cheered and clapped enjoyed the family backstory to mario and luigi however disliked that princess peachs character was changed to being aggressive it did not feel authentic compared to the rest of the movie otherwise thumbs up
Apr 14 2023,positive,animation was creative and colorful
Apr 14 2023,negative,i couldnt make it i couldnt go i thought i bought tickets for the one near my location and unfortunately i still dont know where i bought it

Apr 14 2023,positive,the movie was great
Apr 14 2023,positive,very entertaining brilliant animation as expected from illumination clever and just long enough to not become repetitive took my 11 year old as i have no interest or game background with mario but was able to enjoy on face value no comparison to previous incarnations or expectations just an enjoyable film
Apr 14 2023,positive,i grew up playing mario in the old nes and really enjoyed the game the movie is a travel thru time since the first moment uses references to all mario iterations thru time the story is basic but loyal to its roots i guess the development is wellguided considering the lack of dialog and story the mario game has  gamers who have enjoyed mario games are likely to enjoy the movie and the tons of references to the game
Apr 14 2023,positive,these critics are delusional this movie was an absolute blast from start to finish its like they were embarrassed to be having such a good time at a ew video game movie and felt they needed to bash it call it lazy or otherwise bland this movie absolutely rocked and its clear over 10000 actual people agree
Apr 14 2023,positive,it had great reminiscent elements of the video games the voice actors were spot on with the character it was an enjoyable storyline my daughter says she cant wait till she can watch it at home too my husband says he liked how it embraced the fictional world of mario
Apr 14 2023,positive,its very good it has several references to the games and makes it feel like something beyond a simple mario game plus its very funny  maybe his story is somewhat predictable but simply
Apr 14 2023,positive,princess peach is the main character
Apr 14 2023,positive,this movie is great for the family and for long time fans of mario i was smiling the whole time seeing all the references to marios long history the only thing i could see them improving on is some more time for the characters interacting with each other and more character writing the movie looks stunning and voice actors did amazing i had faith in chris pratt before the movie came out and was surprised how i wasnt even consciously thinking of chris pratts voice
Apr 14 2023,positive,a definite for any super mario fans both my wife and i grew up playing the original nintendo and enjoyed the movie tells the story behind each character and brings you into the game id recommend 3d as the experience was more engaging plus the smile on our 8year old was priceless  he loved it

Apr 14 2023,positive,this is exactly what you think itd be a fun kids movie that people whove grown up with the games would also enjoy it contained many cool references to the many varieties of mario games filled with fun jokes and many beloved characters whats not to like the plot was thin however it did not need to be intricate that was not the point it was meant to be a movie to bring back good memories of a much simpler time as a kid and it did exactly that

Apr 14 2023,positive,did everything it was supposed to do as a mario movie for children pacing was really bad and final boss fight was anticlimactic they couldve done so much more but they checked all the boxes for a movie really stuck to the heros journey arc which was good playing it safe

Apr 13 2023,positive,king boo wasnt in much of the movie otherwise loved the movie
Apr 13 2023,positive,obviously the critics doesnt understand why this movie is good this is an adaptations of a classics game it is about memories and nostagia the filmmakers manage to fulfil that by putting a lot of easter eggs and it works

Apr 13 2023,positive,excellent movie just like the game
Apr 13 2023,negative,gorgeous looking rotten to the core mario felt like a side character that always needed saving pretty upsetting but in todays world of course they would make peach the badass shame mario and make mario and luigi useless without a star

Apr 13 2023,positive,good kids and family movie funny
Apr 13 2023,negative,this movie lingered too much in the beginning i never get up to go to the concession stand during a movie and this movie made me get up and go get popcorns for my daughter and i and then to boot it was a star studded movie that didnt do too well in my opinion but then again it is my opinion
Apr 13 2023,positive,super cute  great graphics
Apr 13 2023,positive,definitely made for fans of the franchise but 40 years after mariodonkey kong came into existence who isnt already a fan  so really this movie is made for everyone   i loved the references to 40 years of gaming history  well done

Apr 13 2023,positive,very good saw amc
Apr 13 2023,positive,a love letter to the mario franchise as well as nintendo as a whole the movie is simply fun not a moment where there wasnt a smile on my face go see this movie its a crime its this good
Apr 13 2023,positive,im not an illumination fan and i went into the theater saying i wonder which character is gonna fart in this one im 18 and im very opinionated about movies but honestly the mario movie was genuinely good it gave me a child like experience i havent had since i was a kid and i hope all kids get to watch this silly perfectly potrayed film that left me very happy for the first time in a while
Apr 13 2023,positive,i enjoyed it watched it with my son today i think if you liked the games you can really appreciate what they have done here so given i grew up playing mario in the 80s and 90s theres an instant parentchild bond thing going on here you can see a lot of love has been put into it from all involved and the production valuesi read one review calling it a lazy cash in animation as a 3d animation really are second to none  it looks absolutely amazing visually if youre looking for hidden meaning parallels to real life issues or emotional plot twists like you find in some pixar animations  youll be disappointed it is a very simple plot and its happy with that but lazy it is most definitely not its an enjoyable kids film they dont always need the above criteria to satisfy old critics that pays homage to its source material incredibly well you can tell nintendo are beaming with pride over this and so they should be
Apr 13 2023,positive,great movie guysplus the animation toos perfect and why animation is because these are familiar characters but in 3d animated form which is so well done moreover many characters nowadays used in animated movies just dont give vibe with some irregularity in shape or characters looking similar to past movies  but super mario bros does no such mistake and even the humans in the movie used are very different if ya get ma point  all in all a great movie  𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐥𝐲 𝐰𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞  
Apr 13 2023,positive,theres lotta game referees   and its just a mocking a kind a little italintime but the movie was great there was a lot of music that was very orchestra but im kind of sad that i didnt get the character that i wanted to see like wario kirby and bowser junior  i was pretty awesome that you she was in the end credit scene and how funny at the first and credit scene about to send you some for peach hilarious
Apr 13 2023,positive,such a beautiful movie everyone needs to see it gamer or not
Apr 13 2023,positive,my kids and i loved it and the animation was amazing
Apr 13 2023,positive,the best movie of this year fun and respect the fans
Apr 13 2023,positive,i really dont understand the critics ratings     this was so well done and is a mustsee for all fans of the games    5 super stars out of 5
Apr 13 2023,positive,a lot of nostalgia through music the story is kind of lame and could use some more oomph behind the why     however this is a great movie for entertainment for younger aged viewers and i think it offers great compliments to them and their adult counterparts as well
Apr 13 2023,positive,the wait is finally over this movie didnt disappoint at all as a mario fan it was very entertaining and i have no idea what the critics were talking about because this was a really good movie the voice casting choices were perfect for it and they didnt bother me at all this was the best movie that illumination has ever made stay till the end of the movie because it does have two post credits scenes and i think they were worth it i cant wait for more of these movies and as of right now i would say its the second best movie of the year and that might change in two months once i see spiderman across the spiderverse
Apr 13 2023,positive,it was a great video game movie 
Apr 13 2023,positive,took my seven year old grandson and he gave it a
Apr 13 2023,positive,awesome movie went and saw it opening weekend with my 4 year old son we both thought it was great
Apr 13 2023,positive,does the games justice great movie
Apr 13 2023,positive,honestly this movie is suspiciously pretty good considering that they mostly focus on making games and not movies 100 recommended to anybody pretty funny in my opinion and heart warming as well with bowser and peach during the movie my favorite would be bowser singing i absolutely loved that part 100 recommendations to everyone considering to watch this movie
Apr 13 2023,positive,family fun for everyone
Apr 13 2023,positive,super cute movie my 3yr old actually sat through the whole thing
Apr 13 2023,neutral,the movie really was kind of boring lets take the end fight bowser for some reason doesnt even you the star or whatever to be unstoppable like it doesnt make any sense
Apr 13 2023,positive,it was a great movie right in childhood its all we fans want
Apr 13 2023,positive,it was such a fun movie i took my dad along and he enjoyed it just about as much as i did and he barely knows a thing about mario and his worlds

Apr 13 2023,positive,i would say that the movie accomplishes on what its set out to do and when i watched it in theaters i could see that well done and rate it 5 stars i dont think the elite reviews get to decide what the entire fanbase feels about it
Apr 13 2023,positive,pure entertainment our kids couldnt get enough of it not all movies have to rival the lion king in storytelling to be enjoyable its wonderful to have a fun film that brings joy to everyone watching the super mario bros movie is set to be a timeless family favorite and a regular feature in our movie lineup
Apr 13 2023,positive,i really liked it so many references to the game and the style is cute 
Apr 13 2023,negative,sound design was amazing visuals were great with an insane number of easter eggs    but the story was basic and bad every scene felt rushed and it was basically nothing but action scene after action scene characters didnt have any time to shine regardless of how good the voice acting was the dialogue was basic but mildly funny    if youre here for a mindless time and going oh i know that thing then this movie is for you if you want an actual movie look elsewhere
Apr 13 2023,positive,didnt stray away from what mario has always been kept is simple but entertaining
Apr 13 2023,positive,loved it i felt as though i went back in time to my childhood playing the game loved its originality not changing the story to fit todays world
Apr 13 2023,positive,as a mario movie based on a game i give it a 9510 they did everything right and the performance of every cast meme we was excellent as a movíe i would give it a 510 is entertaining but not the best movie if you havent played at least one mario game the movie was made for the mario fans people that dont need an explanation to who the characters are if youre a mario fan go ahead and watch it if youre not a mario fan first play the video games and watch it after
Apr 13 2023,positive,it was a masterpiece with constant entertainment
Apr 13 2023,positive,my son and i enjoyed it
Apr 13 2023,positive,growing up with this game brings back so much nostalgia i loved it so much cant count how many times i cried

Apr 13 2023,positive,everything is awesome
Apr 13 2023,positive,the movie is visually beautiful and convincing like they say we need karts now and you say oh ok got it  you dont stop to think about whats happening you just take it easily btw the movie is very funny specially the peaches scene
Apr 13 2023,positive,i think it was as good as it possibly could be considering the premise anyone who has ever played mario will like this movie
Apr 13 2023,positive,it stayed truer to it self so much fun for the little ones and for me a lot of easter eggs and a lot of memories coming back i would recommend it to everyone
Apr 13 2023,positive,great refrences slightly loose story but overall good fun throughout

Apr 13 2023,positive,stays true to the source material  it really helps when the original creator shigeru miyamoto has a hand in development  my kids and i love this movie
Apr 13 2023,positive,amazing movie great memories
Apr 13 2023,positive,freaking amazing it isnt supposed to be citizen kaine  it is a video game movie but you know what it was amazing in every way why do we have movie critics anyway  with the internet you can see real person reviews and make your own decisions fck critics bunch of whiny losers most of them how many of them have ever made a movie it was awesome
Apr 13 2023,positive,great humor for adults and kids nostalgic and original all in one
Apr 13 2023,positive,great movie they really made justice to the games loved it
Apr 13 2023,positive,made an account just to give this movie 5 stars
Apr 13 2023,negative,the real let down of this movie was in fact bowser bowser should have been the protagonist as he had only good intentions unlike mario who tried to murder a dog in the opening scenes bowser was the best character and this movie was a sad flop without him as the protagonist also where was yoshi
Apr 13 2023,positive,always go with the audience score always great movie thats fun for the whole family you your other half and your kids will have a great time with this one add another half a star if you know even a little about mario games

Apr 13 2023,positive,this a great movie to celebrate mario
Apr 13 2023,positive,this movie is just like the videogames   because some times has no sense betwen worlds you can travel feom one world to another one because thats the game you can go to the top of a mountain or be on the gokart ath the rainbow track because its just a magical kingdom and its just like the old mario videogames its just beautiful
Apr 13 2023,positive,its fun and not boring i think chris pratt did a good job at portraying mario a fun ride luckily im a fan and not a critic
Apr 13 2023,positive,it was a great movie that hints at a next installment through the baby star which belongs in the galaxy meaning a super mario galaxy movie is on the horizon this is only meant as an ice breaker into the movie world beautiful graphics so reminiscent just wish yoshi and luigi had more of an impact
Apr 13 2023,positive,this movie is amazing i left the cinema already waiting for the continuation i really underestimate this movie a lot but this movie can be better than sonic 2 the movie    summary mario and luigi are starting their career as plumbers but their first job doesnt work out very well  then theres a leak in brooklyns pipes mario thinks that if he fixes this problem everyone will respect his work but he finds a different pipe that takes him to another world but his brother luigi went to a dark world well bowser wants to marry peach and thats all its all very simple but it can be great

Apr 13 2023,positive,an excellent mario brothers movie about as good as one could hope for lots of mario references a short run time and a simple enjoyable story
Apr 13 2023,positive,i love bowsers song and the crazy star from the trailer i wish the movie was longer i did not like cranky kongs voice it didnt fit for an old person i have no desire to watch the movie again even though i like it

Apr 13 2023,positive,it was a fun movie lots of references to the games which was cool and it was very funny a good watch for the whole family
Apr 13 2023,positive,as a regular movie it falters a lot in many of the elements that are what it has to be but as a mario movie it is an enjoyable experience crafted out of love for a beloved franchise and succeeds in what it was set out to do bringing fans a faithful adaptation of a beloved game franchise
Apr 13 2023,negative,the lack of dr mario representation didnt appeal to the real drs expectations voice acting was great atleast with good seating and cup holders
Apr 13 2023,positive,what a great film for both young and old mario fans  the animation was incredible and the amount of easter eggs was great the jump man arcade machine beside mario before the final battle was a neat addition  there was a lot of comedy for all ages and bowser stole every scene he was in  critics are complaining about the lack of character depth and thin plot but its a video game movie  its a lean 90 minute movie that plays the greatest hits locations from the games rainbow road  my grandchildren were standing and cheering through the last ten minutes of the film along with most of the kids in the theater
Apr 13 2023,positive,just getting my 5s in to say f u to the out of touch critics and give a real score to a good movie

Apr 13 2023,positive,this movie was really great it was made for all ages and have a really good felling true the movie from here on i hope the next one will take a bit more in the story part than this one but as the first movie it was the right call to go
Apr 13 2023,positive,this movie was so so good kids loved it but i think the adults enjoyed it more so many easter eggs but not in a corny way was just a great movie
Apr 13 2023,positive,lots of fun easter eggs for mario fans  as an 80s nintendo guy i had a lot of fun

Apr 13 2023,positive,this movie is amazing  dont listen to the review they dont know mario or nintendo they put the sonic movie higher they have no icon places they had green hills for two seconds not saying its bad  but there in the street and the mario movie is in the mushroom kingdom  the actors are prefect and they themes are reamagied  and better then the og themes what a master piece
Apr 13 2023,neutral,the movie itself is nice but it seems too rushed then the soundtrack is quite awful and repetitive
Apr 13 2023,positive,life altering movie i left the theater feeling inspired 1110 would recommend to anyone

Apr 13 2023,positive,looking forward to seeing it again
Apr 13 2023,positive,what can i say the movie is fun i love it is it a story that will change my life probably not by itself but my daughter loved it too creating one more bond between us over something new and that is what life is about memories we create with our loved ones     i dont know what critics are looking for maybe a new masterpiece of the seventh art but i can say they are looking in the wrong place it is a family movie

Apr 13 2023,positive,amazing film mario and luigi were sublime im honestly lost for words to understand how the critics seem to get it completely wrong again rotten tomatos needs to sort their sht out and remove these over zealous goblin creatures from the feature page of each show its beyond ridiculous at this point

Apr 13 2023,positive,unexpectedly so funny great plot perfect nostalgia hit and will gladly watch again script was great every scene carried its weight the only thing out of place was the use of the song mr blue sky because its still too closely linked to opening sequence of guardians of the galaxy vol 2 and chris p it just came across as repetitive and overused
Apr 13 2023,positive,great movie exactly what nintendo gamers needed
Apr 13 2023,positive,if you are a fan of the super mario bros video game franchise you may want to watch this movie out of curiosity or nostalgia
Apr 13 2023,positive,this is movie is fantastic i would play some games or watched videos before watching this since this will make the flim more enjoyable
Apr 13 2023,positive,great movie for its kiddie target audience  and the pacing means it keeps moving along so adults wont notice the time dragging i also really enjoyed how the film makers wove the theme of the game and its mechanics into the movie
Apr 13 2023,negative,saw it in imax the rainbow road scenes and those that showed the what the characters were seeing in first person were cool but thats about it  except for a few moments it wasnt very funny  and the story needs work
Apr 13 2023,positive,faifthful to the super mario bros saga in every aspect clean and fresh this is how you make movies based on video games respecting every aspect of it and adding good action scenes and good sense of humour for children
Apr 13 2023,positive,absolutely must see if you played the games  i loved it
Apr 13 2023,positive,great flick what isnt there to love its friggin mario

Apr 13 2023,positive,great kids film lots of nostalgia not sure what the critics were expecting its a mass market film for kids its perfect at what is  55
Apr 13 2023,positive,the greatest game adaption and animated movie of all time toy story has been bested
Apr 13 2023,positive,would have given it a 5 stars but no yoshi with that i take my leave
Apr 13 2023,positive,must see fantastic
Apr 13 2023,positive,very funny movie get back a lot of games time memory here
Apr 13 2023,positive,the movie is awesome but the song take on me shouldnt be in it
Apr 13 2023,positive,i love that there is video game references in the film and the animation is great
Apr 13 2023,positive,this is a prefect movie for super mario fan watched with my 11 year old kid and we both loved it looking forward for part 2 and other movies nintendo cinematic universe
Apr 13 2023,positive,took my five year old brother to see this kept his attention very well and it was easy to sit through as a 25 year old adult 
Apr 13 2023,positive,i tried to hate this movie i really did they even got me with how they handled the accents dilemma even when i feel like this movie was moving along too fast i stopped and thought to myself why is that a bad thing great movie with tons of little gems better than the last 3 marvel or star wars movies ive seen combined what else can i expect from he people who created despicable me fun fun fun
Apr 13 2023,positive,very colorful  took my grandkids to see it and it actually held my interest
Apr 13 2023,positive,a fun little film but very safe and barebones it has issues with the pacing and is an overall mid movie not bad but could have been better if they tried more or cared more about the story    despite glowing reviews from the audiance score it feels like the over 90 comes more from people not understanding the a 50 or more usually means mid and assuming that all critics are simly out to hate the movie as well as the familys of the studio and their dogs however while i think some are harsher than other i agree it was a mid level movie it has alot of references which people can have fun with and overall a colour festival children will enjoy but other than that its kind of bland story wise and the pacing hurts the film alot as scenes start and end way too quickly while the plot doesnt need to be some kind of masterpiece i do agree it very safe however i did enjoy it overall not too bad but nowhere near the  bowser song was so deep i cried and my marrige was saved level that people give to simply be contrarien also the peaches song does not deserve an oscar and i will die on that hill
Apr 13 2023,positive,very good story not as amazing as everybody is saying still great the animation is brilliant the soundtrack is awesome and the best part it is full of the mario bros games and if you are were of want to be a fan of the saga that is something very appreciated
Apr 13 2023,positive,it was entertaining for me  we may not have evryone from the videogame but soon will get them but the movie was ok glad it was not that cheap like the last one
Apr 13 2023,positive,the reason i give this movie a 4 out of 5 is that movie isnt hard to watch it is a simple one this movie is good because of the fact that it doesnt take itself too seriously while it looks so incredibly good the movie wont take any awards from the academy but it will win an award in my heart for being the perfect experience for all audiences i heard people of all ages in the theater laughing the way they made mario have some sort of lore rather than just save the princess was cool like the kongs using  gokarts rather than the pipes of the mushroom kingdom it added depth to the world rather than throwing a bunch of mario stuff into the movie and calling it a day the movie was a short fun adventure and if you want a quick laugh and smile this movie is perfect
Apr 13 2023,positive,loved it if youre a true nintendo fan and a fan of super mario bros franchise youll enjoy all the easter eggs and fun little references made throughout the movie very smart and well thought out
Apr 13 2023,positive,for the low expectations i had walking into this film it made me leaving the movie theater smilingtwice i went two days in a row certified classic
Apr 13 2023,positive,its called super mario brothers but everyone else has more facetime over luigi they turned him into a damsel in distress so they can turn peach into an overly ba chick peach is already awesome just the way she is and they just overdid it here and it almost appears as if they had no idea what they wanted to do with mario he was doing all these mario things in the beginning only to turn around and forget when he meets peach     anyway side characters and browser are awesome and it was a fun watch hope to see better storytelling if there is a second movie next time
Apr 13 2023,positive,if youre a fan of mario games youre bound to have a blast i had a fantastic time watching it with my daughter
Apr 13 2023,positive,great watch doesnt take itself too seriously and i love that sometimes thats all you need and they nailed it
Apr 13 2023,positive,out of my expectation its an excited movie and really release my pressure a good movie to watch during weekend
Apr 13 2023,positive,good enough for the families and the fans to enjoy yes ill admit the story was a bit too simple but it didnt stop me for really enjoying this film as a huge super mario fan heres some good advice dont listen to the critics all the time alright because theyre arent always right you know even if they are sometimes but either way if you have family and kids or youre a super mario fan youre gonna love this film
Apr 13 2023,positive,movie was so much fun loved how it was just simple fun made for children and us adults who grew up with the nes also anyone who just likes a good fun movie well done nintendo
Apr 13 2023,positive,very funny and entertaining 
Apr 13 2023,positive,as a moderate nintendo fan and person who grew up with lots of mario games played growing up this movie was an excellent rendition of the mario series and was very entertaining to watch  the critics as always are never in touch with whats actually entertaining  910
Apr 13 2023,positive,it was great my kids and i enjoy it so much hope to see more of nintendo characters movies
Apr 13 2023,positive,we choose the 4dx experience  it was great  the sound was fantastic  we experienced the onscreen visuals with synchronized motion seats and environmental effects which enhanced the action on screen i had so much fun
Apr 13 2023,positive,the movie is great i love it   its made me  feel so happy like  my childhood playing nintendo 
Apr 13 2023,positive,i enjoyed every second of the movie having grown up with the mario video games this movie much like the sonic movies this film is a love letter to the fans deeply respecting the characters and lore while being a fun family movie at the same time truly a fun ride
Apr 13 2023,positive,really good we loved the 80s music and it had a really funny sense of humor
Apr 13 2023,positive,great kid movie good story line to keep adults interested lots of nice touches from the original games

Apr 13 2023,positive,this is such a great movie great for the whole family
Apr 13 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie from start to finish an absolute masterpiece for the fans
Apr 13 2023,positive,i saw the movie last friday and it had a good animation a lot of references to a lot of games and even the old movie from 1993 i liked it a lot and my brother too i would see it again
Apr 13 2023,positive,the best movie ever    les guste o no gano el cine
Apr 13 2023,positive,im 28 years old and have been a mario fan since i can remember i enjoyed a lot the characters personalities the action sequences the beautiful animation  also i expected a simpler plot and no backstory whatsoever so i consider the movie did accomplish to give us an entertaining solid story with enjoyable characters and a measured amount of fan service in only 90 minutes     i believe this is the perfect movie for the franchise i remembered many stories with my friends playing mario games while watching it if like me youre a fan will spend the whole movie with a smile on your face
Apr 13 2023,positive,so close to perfect but felt a little too fast though
Apr 13 2023,positive,same plot as a mario movie would have and with the characters that we all know and love if you dont like the movie then you probably dont even know who or what mario is or nintendo    by the way mario and the nintendo franchise is nothing but nostalgia so if you wanted to make a movie about mario and the gang and not have it being nostalgia you might as as well watch the 1993 mario movie    take a snapshot of 1993 mario and luigi and movie it to kids nowadays and i guarantee they wont know who the heck theyre looking at because its not the mario brothers    nintendo for the win
Apr 13 2023,positive,good mix of nostalgia and humor
Apr 13 2023,positive,best movie ive ever seen its so freaking amazing
Apr 13 2023,positive,kids lived the movie recommended
Apr 13 2023,positive,great movie i hope for a super mario bros 2 so that we can get more development between the characters and explore more characters and places
Apr 13 2023,positive,what a great movie to remind me of a childhood iconic video game well made movie chris pratt is an amazing actor
Apr 13 2023,positive,it wasnt that bad it was actually good i give it 9310
Apr 13 2023,positive,the family really enjoyed it
Apr 13 2023,positive,they did great  loved the movie
Apr 13 2023,positive,a adaption not afraid to be faithful to the source material that sets a new standard for video game movies
Apr 13 2023,positive,its a simple and fun movie families dont need more angst or depression in the movies its a fresh breath without pretense it is what it is a movie to laugh with the family
Apr 13 2023,positive,i know why this scored so high with audiences its jammed full of nostalgia and references very cleverly done the music was especially good the plot concept worked out the world fit together nicely animationaudio superb the humor was great and princess peach as an action girl rocked   and overall it was so refershing to have an action kids film where standing up and fighting evil is part of the theme sick and tired of love and friendship and misunderstood villains get redeemed with the environment pulling most of the adventures action there is wrong and evil in the world and kids need to know sometimes the only way to defeat it is to stand up and fight for whats right    honestly reminded me of chip and dale vibes streamed not long ago    but there were things that held this movie back first the incorporation of the real world and the startup story of the mario bros being another bum loser origin and then discovering the otherworld is really worn and difficult to settle in to erasing the family background and keeping everything contained in the mushroom world wouldve flowed better and tightened the beginning sequence for more development i wish plumbing skills actually became useful there was a little clever carryover from marios life that applied to the adventure but it was very thin at best    there was some fine missed opportunities to make this deeper and more interesting than what it was and i think redoing the beginning wouldve helped that along and unfortunately for this they shoved luigi to the sidelines for 95 of it     also im glad that illumination is finally learning to stop fart and butt jokes mishmashed with crude adult humor and calling it a family movie but i think they couldve given some under the radar stuff since how the target audience is aged 2040 gamers bringing the kids
Apr 13 2023,positive,very nostalgic and i loved every minute of it now i want to play mario games all over again great family movie
Apr 13 2023,positive,was such a cute movie my little ones loved it
Apr 13 2023,positive,a good movie with some personality changes of the characters makes you think but its not bad since it maintains the essence of them and can lead to possible other plots if you know how to use that it entertains all the time and gives very recordable scenes it can improve details and be another next success easily with good dubbing animation and plot    ps if some pseudo critics stop kicking for issues outside the cinema they could enjoy a movie so as not to think differently from 96 of people and excuse themselves by calling themselves experts unique and true movie connoisseurs many lack selfcriticism diapers handkerchiefs and little goats    es  una buena película con algunos cambios de personalidades de los personajes da que pensar pero no es malo ya que mantienen la escancia de ellos y puede dar para posibles otras tramas si se sabe usar eso entretiene todo el tiempo y da escenas muy recordables puede mejorar detalles y ser otro siguiente éxito fácilmente con buenos doblajes animación y trama    pd si algunos pseudo críticos dejan de patalear por temas externo al cine podrían disfrutar de una película para no opinar diferente al 96 de las personas y excusarse auto denominándose expertos únicos y verdaderos conocedores de cine a muchos les falta autocritica pañales pañuelos y cabritas
Apr 13 2023,positive,not going to go down as a cinematic masterpiece and the target audience isnt film critics and the academy judges its children and nostalgia seeking gamers its not high quality cinema its supposed to be a fun and lighthearted romp for one of the worlds most recognisable characters and it absolutely nailed it
Apr 13 2023,positive,this was a pretty good movie for one based on video games
Apr 13 2023,positive,i went with my family to see the super mario bros movie and i loved the animation and the references  we had a family argument but when we finished watching the movie we left the theater happy and commenting on how good the movie was

Apr 13 2023,positive,its so adorable and beautiful
Apr 13 2023,positive,fun and action packed movie i definitely enjoyed my time with it if youre a mario fan youll appreciate the movie all the more
Apr 13 2023,positive,this is a great movie and it really brought back a lot of nostalgia the movie seems rushed and if the directors ran out of scenes or ideas to add 810 would recommend
Apr 13 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie was so fun and entertaining i laughed out loud multiple times with my entire family would definitely go watch it again too 5 stars
Apr 13 2023,negative,movie took lots of inspiration from all around nintendos world of mario and luigi but failed in applying any of the good easter eggs or nods to said world and left with unexplained gaps that led to viewers asking why even put that in there music was fantastic and well implemented overall movie lacked in clear story telling and poor reasoning
Apr 13 2023,positive,beautifully stunning
Apr 13 2023,positive,amazing movie for all audiences the cgi was mind blowingly good with excellent fan service

Apr 13 2023,positive,loved it its full of references and so much nostalgia
Apr 13 2023,positive,loved the nostalgia the music everything was great loved how peach was empowered and jack blacks songs are still in my head
Apr 13 2023,positive,a few lore issues but otherwise a great movie plot adaptation from a video game that doesnt feel like a video game plot there is a lot fun easter eggs and a great fusion of content from many of the loved video games
Apr 13 2023,positive,i liked everything the animation is very well done the wait on the impact was very pleasing sometimes there was too much going on to fully understand and some scenes needed an extra minute to fully complete the moment the score was amazing absolutely perfect not enough luigi screen time
Apr 13 2023,positive,i thought it was perfect i was skeptical of pratt but was pleased with his performance im a long time since nes nintendo fan and i thought the movie was a great iteration of mario cant wait for the sequel
Apr 13 2023,positive,fast pacing with a basic story suitable for a kids movie about a kids game
Apr 13 2023,positive,its for kids and we loved it
Apr 13 2023,positive,it was a fun entertaining movie that didnt aspire to be more than that its plot is very thin and the characters are very surface level caricatures but it makes up for this with the fantastic animation and stellar original score
Apr 13 2023,positive,what i can tell you with certainty is that the kids in my screening of the super mario bros movie were having an absolute blast i think there are some solid laughs and some good fun to have with the movie but its definitely an animated film more geared toward children like many others i grew up playing a variety of mario games and think this is a fun nostalgiafilled ride that families can enjoy together i think the movie has plenty of good animation and voice talent the story is pretty paper thin but to be fair the game franchise is also not known for storytelling overall it is a cute movie that all ages can enjoy and while im not in any rush to watch it again i had fun with what was presented and think its one of those movies that will boost anyones mood

Apr 13 2023,negative,im sure kids that love mario are going to love this movie however as an adult i found very little to enjoy the strongest part of the film was luigi and marios brotherly relationship but theyre separated for most of the film it also felt like scenes just sort of happened with very little threading them together its like the writers made a bunch of important movie moment bullet points for their script and said theyd fill in the blanks later then never did conversations just happen with it feeling like characters arent really listening to each other i saw this movie with my wife and we both had bored expressions on our faces for the majority of the run time im sure kids will love it

Apr 13 2023,positive,it was amazing yes the plot isnt anything new the pacing is a bit fast for its short runtime and there isnt as much luigi as there should but i still enjoyed every bit of this movie regardless and ive no doubt that any mario fan will enjoy it immensely too
Apr 13 2023,positive,good clean family fun movie
Apr 13 2023,positive,loved the humorhad my kids and i laughing they did such an awesome job
Apr 13 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in a while
Apr 13 2023,positive,this was so much fun for a mario fan like myself there are so many details referencing the history of super mario keep a sharp eye when the movie was over i still wanted more make sure you watch all the way through the credits it was visually beautiful and kid friendly i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys super mario
Apr 12 2023,neutral,well what can i say its entertaining but strangely enough not really funny there were a few scenes which caused a slight giggle especially when a typical item of the video game was perfectly adapted but nothing really nothing to ever cause real laughter in fact besides me with my juvenile mind and two young ladies in another row nobody of the 30 persons in the cinema ever giggled i never cared for the video game which i considered completely dull and extremely repetitive but i thought a video adaption should be great and it was somehow the visuals contrary to the naturally extremely basic ones of the video game after all its been 40 years are absolutely amazing and so extremely colorful that its mainly and possibly only those visuals and extravagant sceneries covering whole landscapes full of details from the game multiplied by a thousand which actually carry the whole movie if you like animation you might enjoy this just to while away 90 minutes if you are a nintendo fan it is probably a must see 510 points
Apr 12 2023,positive,simple but good movie great for kids
Apr 12 2023,positive,i liked everything of it
Apr 12 2023,positive,it was a good movie overall

Apr 12 2023,positive,it is the most beautiful video game movie i have ever seen super mario was my entire childhood i had high expectations and it exceeded them
Apr 12 2023,positive,the animation was really good for this movie my only real request would be for more of marios allies and villains from the games like yoshi plus the movie shouldve been like half an hour longer other than that i love all the references to old nintendo games overall great movie you should definitely go see it
Apr 12 2023,positive,took my grandsons to see this we love it animation was amazing the story line held your attention and it was fast moving no time to get bored watching it
Apr 12 2023,positive,my family really enjoyed the movie it was slow going but it came through with the action
Apr 12 2023,positive,fun movie with a lot of easter eggs and call backs to not just mario but a bunch of classic nes games ranging up to wii and switch
Apr 12 2023,positive,super fun movie great cast decent story  its a video game so what do you want good time watching
Apr 12 2023,positive,when i read the press reviews of this movie i am outraged it seems they were expecting some kind of cinephile masterpiece   they dont seem to understand that mario in addition to being aimed at gamers is above all aimed at children   moreover in the gamess universe the plots are very often summarized in hero who saves a loved one from a villain or find a mcguffin and take place in a light and relaxing universe mixing several fictional genres   so dont expect a complex story these hateful reviews from the press in addition to being shameful are proof that there is still an unjustified contempt for gamers and that according to people video games are not real art   this means only one thing only children and mario fans are able to judge this film at its fair value while the press doesnt understand marios universe and doesnt care to understand it  the story is basic but its the kind of story youve seen in all mario games since this universe has existed moreover apart from that there is a touching brotherly relationship a story about selfconfidence and fear that are well written  in addition the film is well animated the characters are cool the music is pretty and the gamess universe is well transcribed  the only thing that can be criticized about the film is that it could have lasted fifteen minutes longer so that the relationships between the characters could have been written better   but that doesnt matter the movie is still great despite that  in short about this film dont listen to the press listen to the audience only
Apr 12 2023,positive,like how they paid homage to a lot of the different games wasnt a bad movie could have made bowser a better villain instead of a simp to peach  other then that good solid movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,it a great movie my kids really loved it
Apr 12 2023,positive,i liked it i watched it with my sister and nephew my nephew liked it a lot he whispered to me every characters name and at most funny scenes he laughed with other audience my sister said it was good and i said it was great other peoples opinions maybe different but this is my opinion
Apr 12 2023,positive,this was a really good movie the action scenes were good and visuals were great my only problem was the voice choice for cranky kong he didnt sound old enough and i didnt really like it but apart from that it was a simple fun and entertaining movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,way better than we expected
Apr 12 2023,positive,i do not understand why critics hate this movie because this has to be one of my favorite movies ever it needs more character development and less references shut the hell up its mario its not gonna be the most emotionally deep movie youve ever seen in your life and yeah there is going to be lots of references but its the mario movie dont know how the hell you walked in there and didnt expect that i dont even think they thought it was gonna be some other sad movie  i thought it was a great movie it looked great voice acting was great for most of it especially for bowser and luigi loved the lighthearted feeling clever references for people who get them and also peaches is now my favorite song ever  im not joking i have listened to it at least 40 times in the past 2 days
Apr 12 2023,positive,cute movie could have added more scenes with the go carts only wonder about the monster we had a lot of small children in the theater i was in  scary to them
Apr 12 2023,positive,critics are stupid its a good movie end of story
Apr 12 2023,positive,better than expected my 5yr old restless kid was fully immersed and wants to watch it again
Apr 12 2023,positive,hope that this page critics have another kind of job totally different because they really are bad doing this
Apr 12 2023,positive,not great definitely not bad a fun time all in all  really would have loved to see mario and luigi together for the big adventure though  those two were good together
Apr 12 2023,positive,movie was so much fun but the d box tickets i booked didnt work i just felt a slight vibration in the 3 that my party purchased
Apr 12 2023,positive,pretty good movie the liveaction one is still the best tho
Apr 12 2023,positive,all the action and the race cars
Apr 12 2023,positive,best adaptation yet
Apr 12 2023,positive,in my opinion despite the story being shallow and being very fast super mario bros the movie is one of the best video game adaptations with many references and incredible animation this movie is very worthwhile for anyone who is a fan of this franchise
Apr 12 2023,positive,i loved how it referenced a lot of the games and had a lot of the old game sounds very great movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,well 2023 is off to a pretty good start had a great time with this film
Apr 12 2023,positive,captures the fun and thrill of the game in nearly every way with a simple yet sturdy plot that is sure to please fans of the game
Apr 12 2023,positive,5 stars means it was a great experience go see it and smile
Apr 12 2023,positive,perfect nostalgia for those who grew up playing super nes  super nintendo  easter eggs hidden throughout the film makes you want to watch it over  anticipate the stream release  i dont understand how you watch this movie  dont smile  have a good time  people review this as if its the last marioverse movie going to be made  as a intro to the many movies that are going to be spun off the characters in this franchise i cant wait to watch yoshi waluigi wario  maybe even metroid  other nintendo games be made with the illumination team who were in their bag with the visuals and sound effects all thru the movie  bowser stole the show tho  cant forget the music either  superb job
Apr 12 2023,positive,great movie for the family highly recommended
Apr 12 2023,positive,a true family movie very fun nostalgic and free from what i caught from adult themes and humor which is a refreshing change of pace

Apr 12 2023,positive,yes its a forgettable mess that cant keep up with itself but people need to take this movie for what it is a nostalgic fun time
Apr 12 2023,positive,it was really good   it had creativeness  and it subverted expectations   and for the people who disagree its at least better than the last mario movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,they tied this movie together so well kids loved it too gotta watch in 3d
Apr 12 2023,positive,first movie we took our kids to see in the theater it was so refreshing to sit through a kids movie that just focused on being fun and staying faithful to the video games
Apr 12 2023,positive,the perfect super mario movie great watch with kids
Apr 12 2023,positive,i liked it because my grandson played this game when he was young  he is now 34  him and his roommate insisted that i go with them  they loved it  it was ok for me but i am 83 and it was too much zooming around  not my type of movie  i am glad that i got to share the experience with them
Apr 12 2023,positive,saw this movie with my mam and my six year old brother and we really enjoyed it
Apr 12 2023,positive,the critics are so far off base with their assessment of this movie were going back to see it for the second time its an exceptionally fun experience for all ages
Apr 12 2023,positive,very fun and exciting its not exactly complex or thought provoking buts its not supposed to be its super mario could have picked a better voice for mario howeo
Apr 12 2023,positive,wow i have to say this was another 1010 movie from universals animation studio illumination and there 1010s are sing 2  despicable me 1
Apr 12 2023,positive,action all throughout
Apr 12 2023,positive,a prime of example of how modern critics are disconnected from the audiences the film was fun light and colorful stories dont have to tick boxes or to promote deep messages to be good and fun
Apr 12 2023,positive,it was very very very very very very  cool movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,peach is badbutt i havent even seen it also poor freaking luigi and why does luma lee want to die lol this is linked to my school account so i cant swear
Apr 12 2023,positive,the movie was very true to the game and i enjoyed how all the elements interacted my only criticism is that the volume of the sound overpowered the characters being in the theqtre with only 4 moviegoers in it the volume was a bit much my ears needed cotton to dampen the sound reverberating throughout the empty theatre
Apr 12 2023,positive,the audiences views are extremely more important that what any critics have to say about this movie this movie was a masterclass in bridging the old and the new boring and the fun elements of the entire nintendo universe i personally wasnt excited to hear chris pratt was going to voice mario however i can see past this with how well they honored the original voice actor charles martinet with all of this said all i can say is the mcu franchise better watch out because mario and his friends are coming for you cheers to the sequel
Apr 12 2023,positive,all i have to say is peaches
Apr 12 2023,positive,amazing bright and cheerful
Apr 12 2023,positive,cute movie geared toward kids and adults lots of laugh out loud parts great soundtrack
Apr 12 2023,positive,this movie filled me with so much joy i have been playing mario games since i was 7 on my very first game system the gameboy advance mario advance 2 super mario world port this movie was honestly lacking in story but it more than made up for it with comedy and character development im sure gonna see this again
Apr 12 2023,positive,great movie my grandson loved it
Apr 12 2023,negative,the only one who really carried this movie was bowser other than that the whole story made no sense and was very disappointing that peach was bullying mario most of the time
Apr 12 2023,negative,found out this movie was straight up ass
Apr 12 2023,positive,all that audience want to see in a mario movie references and good characters everywhere
Apr 12 2023,positive,i think the movie was good it had good animation the voice acting was great it was interesting to see peach as the tuff one and not the damsel in distress for once i cant wait for the next film i hope it focuses on yoshi island and not mushroom island as thats where it looks like its going
Apr 12 2023,positive,this is a work of cinematic art and fun blended with classic game references and lots of interesting characters as an enjoyer of the games i can say with confidence that the critics saw a complete different film 1010 must see
Apr 12 2023,positive,so funny and feel good plot was simple but thats true to the game so dont think its a complaint

Apr 12 2023,positive,so many references and i love them all
Apr 12 2023,positive,i liked when princess peach was going to marry bowser and tricked him and got ice power
Apr 12 2023,positive,let me begin by saying that the animation of super mario bros is stunning it is visually lovely and colorful and engaging    but thats where the engagement ends the movies plot is thin painfully thin it felt like 90 minutes of plot crumbs in between fan service scenes i was so bored     it was the video game movie version of a sbarro pizza slice at the mall yeah its pizza so its okay by default but pretty bland and unremarkable     
Apr 12 2023,positive,the movie was great what it was meant to be a gamers nostalgic memory of the time when things were simple and fun if youve ever enjoyed playing any of the mario games and enjoyed playing them either by yourself or with friends then this movie will tug your feelings of those times from the audio music and sound effects from the one liners you found in game and from the comedic story line this will have you in a happy place now if you never played the games or had a different childhood this probably wont hit the mark for you as well as it does others the movie will come off as childish and probably predictable its based off of a video game thats what needs to be remembered going into it a simple yet wildly popular video game and we loved it
Apr 12 2023,positive,this movie made me smile so much tomatoes be darned this movie was a thumbs up from me
Apr 12 2023,positive,honestly its a great movie to see with the family or just with friends who want to see a funny movie it has fantastic easter eggs that all people fans of mario would love also to the critics dissing the movie you better have played mario game or any game in that universe to be able to give a reasonable review

Apr 12 2023,positive,this movie was definitely made for us older people who grew up playing the super mario games lots of easter eggs in the movie from the mario games and nintendo as a whole i enjoyed the movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie seems to me to be a very good adaptation of the video game to the big screen full of references and remaining faithful to the games at all times even though its history and its duration have not been to my liking i feel that nintendo will learn from these mistakes for a followup sequel
Apr 12 2023,positive,i cant speak for the avergae movie goer or film critic but this movie is a mustsee for all nintendo fans its literally perfect i go into all movies with neutral expectations but even if mine had been sky high for this movie it still would have shot right past them 1010

Apr 12 2023,positive,a great movie for nintendo fans i really enjoyed the jokes the easter eggs and the story
Apr 12 2023,positive,loved the story and all the hidden gems from all the different mario games alot of fan service which as a huge mario fan i loved loved bowser he was as expected with a little side humor cant wait to see what they do with the series lets a go whoooo
Apr 12 2023,positive,as a mario fan i found it fantastic all the easter eggs and music and source material of the games its just perfect for everyone who likes mario definitely must watch      youtuber  rns studio
Apr 12 2023,positive,i took my kids to this and we all liked it my snooty and sophisticated 12 year old my crazy 9 year old and 6 year old who cant sit still in movies and 40 something me i think that really says this movie does what it is meant to maybe the critics wanted that gritty hbo mario with pedro pascal  i mean id watch that too lol
Apr 12 2023,negative,this movie is painfully mediocre which makes me sad since im a huge fan of mario the thing is mario is great because its fun and creative this movie is lazy they spent no time making the story fun and creative and only spent their energy on references to the mario series this is not what i hoped
Apr 12 2023,positive,i loved it hope they make a second one
Apr 12 2023,positive,great film for families and young children fun looks fantastic and full of nostalgia for the parents story line is weak but didnt stop from enjoying the movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,in the past there have been video game adaptations that dont really live up to the name of the game however the super mario bros movie did an excellent job at capturing what it felt to play mario for the first time the movie is beautifully animated with tons of hidden easter eggs hidden for new and old mario fans the story itself was extremely simple which i was ok with since you dont really expect an emotional roller coaster from mario just fun adventures with alot of action i had a smile for almost the entire span of the movie one thing i found weird however is the use of 80s songs i understand that they were probably used to cater to fans who player mario during that era but it just felt very weird i feel like they couldve used one of marios ost and it wouldve worked even better go into this movie expecting good time and nothing else is it perfect no but its a breath of fresh air compared to other movies that released during this time and i cannot wait to see it again 9510 overall would recommend
Apr 12 2023,positive,a fun family movie with a great cast
Apr 12 2023,positive,while not having an overly complicated plot line the movie still provides easy enjoyable fun the characters are well thought out and easy to get along with the film also has a lot of great references for older generations who grew up on mario my one complaint would be the pacing the movie seemed like it was in a headlong rush to the finale i think if the directors had given it some room to breathe they could have gotten a lot more enjoyment put of the situations and locations
Apr 12 2023,positive,great movie with lots of dazzling visuals and excitement for mario fans
Apr 12 2023,positive,if you are a real fan of the super mario bros saga and if you are not you are gonna enjoy this movie because it has an excellent animation scenes references etc this is one of my favorite movies ever seen on my life

Apr 12 2023,positive,you need to watch this movie in 3d
Apr 12 2023,positive,i basically went to see it to find out if what the critics say is true but no lately ive been thinking about what the critics say about the latest movies but we shouldnt get carried away by what they say but mario bros is the best bowser steals the movie every time it comes out the music is the best and each reference makes us remember when we played at least one mario bros game and if you go with your family to see it it will be fun to watch
Apr 12 2023,positive,nostalgia film for fans of the franchise
Apr 12 2023,positive,critics never get genre or animation films right theyre not fans theyre just pretentious anyone that is a fan of mario will love this movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is one of those movies that if someone asked me to watch it again i will for any mario likers at any age and havent watched this before id recommend that you should have a look at it
Apr 12 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece enjoy af and any age group can enjoy the movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,the film is a tribute to fans of the franchises games i really liked it
Apr 12 2023,positive,its just what i expected ill give it a 10
Apr 12 2023,positive,all the concerns i had about this movie werent true  pratts mario was tolerable and the accent was not disruptive to the narrative or viewing its a bit thicker than in the commercials but i think they could have done better   although they pushed together a few ips it wasnt crammed in like wr 2 felt cohesive they integrated key elements of several games into the story without much deviation from the core material and from it created a narrative structure that combined the game and cinematic universes well     this is by far one of illuminations better projects likely thanks to nintendos notorious strict control over portrayal of their properties in fact i would say that illuminations style fit the universe better than any other studio the goofiness was toned down    while the mario movie was not perfect too short story deviated more than it needed toon accents could have been better it was still a great movie for what it was    i believe the poor critical reviews come simplicity of the story however that is an attribute in my opinion more creative freedom could have produced a more cinematic movie but it would have also made the movie something it wasnt supposed to be     the writers and animators didnt make a movie in the mario universe they made the mario universe into a movie  exactly what we all wanted      if you are a fan you wont be disappointed
Apr 12 2023,positive,excellent movie i watched it with my family and i really enjoyed it i recommend it to everyone
Apr 12 2023,positive,although the movie at the begginning seemed dry i quickly got into it rooting for the mario brothers throughout  some parts are predictable but still doesnt out do the good i heard the reviews were bad but im so glad i went to see it
Apr 12 2023,positive,despite a couple of flaws here and there the super mario bros movie is a fun time that will entertain people of all ages
Apr 12 2023,positive,its a must see and fun movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,simple yet effective nintendo and co played it safe by following a tried and true 90s movie formula after the disaster that was the first mario bros movie i can understand why they played it safe my inner child was happy and my adult brain found it pleasing absolutely riddled with easter eggs this movie will be rewatched and possibly purchased in hardcopy by many households critics giving the movie bad reviews are tone deaf not familiar with the source material and ignorant of the franchises movie history sequels will add more depth
Apr 12 2023,positive,the best movie i have seen in a loooooooooong time extremely good references hidden in the movie 1010 will watch again
Apr 12 2023,positive,the movie is really nostalgic and braucht back alot of memories story is pretty good even tho luigi couldve gottes some more love but overall it is a movie worth seeing
Apr 12 2023,positive,you dont realize how much mario bros you have had in your lifetime till you see this wonderful film just fun
Apr 12 2023,positive,i loved every second of the movie watching this will make you forget thats its actually an illumination movie by far their best movie ever made while the movie was fast and didnt have any parts to slow down and have character devolpments but in a mario film adaptation where the games dont have a canon i believe they didnt really need it thats really my only problem with the movie but every second i was smiling with my freinds constantly pointing out easter eggs and more must watch even if your not a mario fan it doesnt really need explanantion
Apr 12 2023,positive,this was a fun time im glad disney didnt get the chance to destroy this it was quite refreshing i loved the music and rainbow road was awesome i also really enjoyed peach and dk
Apr 12 2023,positive,best movie ever this movie deserves a sequel no wonder its the 1 grossing animated movie of all time i have no idea why any critic would give this a rotten tomato the story was epic the scenes were funny the graphics were colorful and everything about this movie is perfect i couldnt even stay in my seat i liked it so much all the easter eggs and music references were cool too this is a mustsee oscarworthy movie

Apr 12 2023,positive,this movie was a ton of fun the music and visuals had a ton of fun little easter eggs for people who grew up playing the games but the movie was still good enough in its own right to appeal to newcomers too looking forward to what nintendo and illumination do next

Apr 12 2023,positive,loved it dont listen to these wanna be critics its awsome trust me
Apr 12 2023,positive,knows exactly what it sets out to be and is a fun experience for all ages
Apr 12 2023,positive,this is a mario movie its not meant to be some intimate piece of fiction that inspires deep thought and emotion it was entertaining and funny worth the watch  i was a little apprehensive about chris doing his voice but they handled it in an interesting and viable way
Apr 12 2023,positive,it wasawesome  the world the charakters ts so bad to see that the criticers has no plan from mario
Apr 12 2023,positive,fun from the beginning to the end but sometimes a little bit cringe
Apr 12 2023,positive,a certified banger so many refrences i was litterally pointing at the screen at some parts lol  i think they couldve expanded more on the world as most scenes were in brooklyn the mushroom kingdom or bowsers castle thing though if they did it would probably drag out the movie longer than it should be  if they decide to make a sequel which they definitely will i mean the movie is litterally 1 on the box office as of right now id be down to watch on day one maybe a mario galaxy or a luigis mansion movie there were some refrences to galaxy but none for luigis mansion if they eventually make a sequel hopefully they wont fck it up like most sequels    anyways just watch it its a certified banger meaning that its really good and has a lot of refrences just watch it
Apr 12 2023,positive,amazing movie amazingly well produced the movie has the perfect balance between plot and funny moments to deliver exactly what a mario movie should be lightly paced and extremely funny  the movies energy goes hi in the first minutes and keep like this until the very end  the plot gives the movie a natural direction and allows the extremely funny and unique characters to shine  the soundtrack is perfect period 
Apr 12 2023,positive,for those who have known the game for decades we know the references shown for younger audiences its a great movie family friendly funny maybe not the greatest script but nostalgia hits also this is historical because its the very first mario animated movie at least
Apr 12 2023,positive,my wife and two kids went to watch it they all loved it
Apr 12 2023,positive,me and my kids love it great and fun story perfectly suited for kids
Apr 12 2023,positive,i thought this movie was a fun movie to watch i had a great time searching for all of the easter eggs and references
Apr 12 2023,positive,good music great affects and thru it all very wonderful for the family
Apr 12 2023,positive,an extremely faithful rendition of the mario games that span decades the plot is simple and straight forward but lots of fun from a nintendo gamer perspective
Apr 12 2023,positive,not perfect but was very good and the kids loved it
Apr 12 2023,positive,movie was great nostalgia gave the backstory of mario and luigi for the younger generations that dont know much about the plumber brothers lots of great odes to the past not to mention the music is all mario brothers themed great to be able to take the kids and enjoy it together
Apr 12 2023,positive,great movie imo it delivered exactly what i think nintendo characters should bring you thats fun and chill time movie had lovely references to the the games they felt totally in place it didnt feel rushed or anything it kept me engaged throughout the whole thing it managed to deliver the dynamic you feel when playing the games absolutely check it out  have fun
Apr 12 2023,positive,my wife and i enjoyed it  they made great use of the assets from the franchisee and provided an entertaining story  you can definitely tell what actor is voicing which character which was my only real issue  if you like mario or have niece nephew or kids i would recommend taking them to this    ps my wife and i loved the blue lumas star
Apr 12 2023,positive,great time it good for families to have a good laugh and enjoy some time for the every ending world outside if im being honest really only hardcore mario fans will actually get the movie for me it felt like a whole mario game in a movie there so so so so many references the dk rap the wedding dress i love it so amazing if they dont make a sequel that bad honestly dont see why the credits gave it a 57 it was like an 80  final score 45 out of ten
Apr 12 2023,positive,i think the professional reviewers are sadly mistaken on this particular movie it is meant to be fun there was very little plot to mario to begin with and there never really needed to be its about the game and to be honest it was much better than i thought it would be
Apr 12 2023,positive,despite the everyone seeming to have negative things to say about this movie my daughter and i enjoyed it very much 
Apr 12 2023,positive,ignore the critics yet again they have to grade a movie on technical aspects took my 9 year old and wife and we loved it he wouldnt stop talking about it all night and neither did we it is mario the story is simple defeat bowser and rescue the princess in this case luigi done the highlights of the movie are all the nostalgia elements we especially enjoyed that they kept the soundtrack from the 80s  they introduced enough mario elements that we found ourselves calling them out throughout the movie but they only touched the surface and left it open for the future  i only wish they had saved rainbow road for later on and made it more difficult lol
Apr 12 2023,positive,i really like this movie  it has great comedy animation and a ton of great references  810
Apr 12 2023,positive,movie was great kids loved it it was more of a mario movie then the bros but still a good start for what looks like many more to come

Apr 12 2023,positive,movie was great and funny
Apr 12 2023,positive,a film with incredible art direction the characters and their personalities are very faithful to the original game the script is very interesting and the composition in general is impeccable an illumination masterpiece
Apr 12 2023,positive,one of the best movies in recent memory first time in a long time i actually want to find a reason to see it again in the theater it didnt disappoint even though mario is the main character screen time is distributed between all the main characters and we get some character development and lore that doesnt break the source material or solely copy it they even give bowser real motivation remember that it was an important item in acting and character development he has a deeper believable reason why he is trying to take over everything stay until the very end of the film
Apr 12 2023,positive,the mario movie is honestly one of the best films ive ever seen all the critics are wrong this should get an oscar
Apr 12 2023,positive,wow nostalgia grew up with super mario as an 80s baby this movie just hit all the right markers to make me relive my childhood in the best most fun type of way

Apr 12 2023,positive,fun and entertaining movie great content for the whole family loved it would see again
Apr 12 2023,positive,the game is amazing to see its mario  but i think that you can mostly enjoy it if your a mario fan or a kid   for a mario fan its just for all the little nods to the fan  for a kid its just since the lack of story  its an awesome movie but the story is a bit lacking still doesnt take away from the amazingness of this movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,the film brings several wonderful elements to those who know the games in the franchise in addition to giving due importance to the main characters it was interesting to give bowser a reason to want to kidnap the princess
Apr 12 2023,positive,the super mario movie is a fun playful movie with all the feels we loved every minute of the movie its a fun story with great characters dk todd and peach make this movie more than a movie bros adventure

Apr 12 2023,positive,today i saw my most beautiful movie of my life i gazed at this masterpiece in amazement my childhood dream has come true through this beautiful animation full of nostalgia thank you nintendo and illuminationentertainment for this wonderful movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,it was a great movie critics bash the movie for its overstimulating content when it was designed for kids the movie was great and it should be treated as such as it was designed to draw kids kids cannot grasp a movie with a complex plot critics need to stop treating it as a movie that was designed to have a thick complex plot and grasp that it was a movie for kids no it isnt too predictable as i was surprised at some parts but it was a great movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,what an awesome movie if youre a fan of nintendo or the mario bros franchise you will really enjoy this fan service

Apr 12 2023,positive,this movie brought back a lot of great childhood memories when my sister first introduced me to video games it was the super mario brothers that made me fall in love with video games took my 3 year daughter with us and this was her 1st experience at the theater  she loved the movie and was pretty entertained by the characters the cameos to the movie was on point and wanted more just wish there were more stories to tell but the plot was on point
Apr 12 2023,positive,if youre a true mario bros fan youll appreciate this movie its very accurate to its source material great to watch with your kids and families but also entertaining for those who are still mario fans at heart hopefully the start of many sequels and different iterations using these iconic characters

Apr 12 2023,positive,great movie enjoyed from start to finished
Apr 12 2023,positive,i think this is clearly one of if not the best movie adapted from a video game i took my family to see it over the weekend my kids loved it i loved it my wife loved it if they expanded on this universe and brought us more of our classic video games characters while sticking to as much of the source material as possible then they are really going to scare disney i cant wait to see whats next will dk have to save his kingdom will link have to save zelda will we see samus make her debut so many possibilities so much potential and as long as they do what they did here then it will be successful
Apr 12 2023,positive,fantastic fun movie chris pratts stupid voice did take me out but went right back in because it was hilariously bad
Apr 12 2023,positive,this movie was really good it had great cameos and they story was just so good why is the critic score so low the movie was

Apr 12 2023,positive,amazing movies for mario fans if you are not a fan of mario you probably wouldnt understand it and all the easter eggs plus dont listen to the critics they probably have never played a mario game
Apr 12 2023,positive,this movie takes a great and well known property and puts a twist in what people know and the relations between characters it is full of great music great voice and character acting and just the right amount of fan service nods to multiple games and tropesjokes from these games thoroughly enjoyed and would rate a 1010
Apr 12 2023,positive,amazing  we had absolutely the best time so much nostalgia our family of 10 booked deluxe tickets and paid almost 300 all up but it was worth it just pure fun 
Apr 12 2023,positive,good video game adaptation 
Apr 12 2023,positive,its a fantastic movie although the plot is too simplistic and predictable it has too much fan service which is great but the story is kinda forgotten like wtf
Apr 12 2023,positive,i loved it  animation and voice acting was very good full of references the movie is very lean with action scene after action scene   simplistic story but easy to follow for the little ones    highly recommended
Apr 12 2023,positive,i think it was a good movie that did well what it was intended to with a bad critic score like that for an animatedfamily movie i think its time for a spring clean up inside official reviewers when you are not able to do your job properly anymore its time to go critics should be close to the target audience reviews however mario movie shown something nobody cares of critics anymore because they know they are irrelevant
Apr 12 2023,positive,the nostalgia of growing up playing mario great family movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,the runtish guys mario and luigi are brothers in a bigger italian migrant family in the us maybe weird at first but a perfect fit for the showjumping course scene and for super mario odyssey by accident they teleport into the fantastic parallel universe as depicted by mariorelated video games mario wants to find his brother alive rescue the parallel world from bowsers domination and danger due to marios perseverance fiction is connected with reality in one background story which the video games never do the films story perfectly achieves the goal of connecting mariorelated games with an overarching story providing surprising scenes and ideas to fans without an alienating story discordant to the mario universe or mismatching the games that fans know the movie completes the characterization of the protagonists with virtues instead of glichees i admit i have certain things in common with marios character which has an encouraging effect    its masterpiece in the aspect that it succeeds to satisfy the requirements and expectations of a movie about mariorelated games just like the games the video games main goal is exactly fun and a homage to the games even though the mario games have been deemed very difficult to be turned into a movie it remains religious neutrality with a mix between fiction and reality so that a wider audience can enjoy the film maybe some dont enjoy the mild violence depiction but its faithful to the original in a cineastic way like the games it avoids focus on the romance between the independent selfconfident and athletic sporty princess peach and the determined persevering and plucky american plumber mario after all the movie is a mix of super mario bros super mario 3d world and mario kart    i also admit the plot is quite unrealistic in many places which i perceived as the main cons but not being too realistic is actually part of the requirements and doesnt spoil the film sadly critics who critize the movie for just the story or colours possibly refering to the fictional iconic 3d graphics style entirely fail to understand animation art intensions target group its requirements and the excellence of how the story is visually and aurally presented maybe except for the weird pop song overlay á la illumination entertainment in the kart garage critics really need to watch the movie again without discrimination but with another mindset and understanding of the requirements story colours and crazy fiction is kind of typical for the modern japanese culture    summary fantastic art and entertainment with many surprising story and character elements particularly for people who are familiar to the mario universe the super mario movies promise is its beautiful art design craziness and being fun if you dont like movies which focus on fun the movie might not be for you

Apr 12 2023,positive,i went to see the mario bros movie and i liked it although i didnt really like the songs but the rest is a love letter made for fans of mario games so if its recommended dont listen to the bad ones critics  keep creating adaptations of games to the movie i give it an 810
Apr 12 2023,positive,had no expectations going into this as a mario megafan as i wanted to protect my heart and didnt want to risk feeling disappointed after all the anticipation but wow this was a lot of fun nintendo is first and foremost a family company and this is a family movie  so dont expect any deeply adult humour what you can expect is overflowing creativity packed into every frame and if you know you know moments for the power nerds yeah the plot is pretty by the numbers but anything more complex would have lost people just looking to see these iconic characters on the big screen its a strong start to marios long journey and although its been more than 2 hours past the late showing i went to im still buzzing with excitement what a wonderful moment satoru iwata would be so proud letsago nintendo
Apr 12 2023,positive,loaded with mario brothers and other nintendo game references  sounds lots of nostalgia included well put together to get a lot of features in 3d was ok but not as distinct as other 3d movies story was easy to follow but a little bland in parts slight humor but mostly action im a huge nintendo fan so i give it 45 but nonnintendo fans would probably give it 35
Apr 12 2023,positive,stunning entertaining and astonishingly beautiful for over 7 years in the works this film deserves the best attention than any film in 2023 the countless references and effort put to this film is truly a love letter to all mario fans out there the story may be a bit sketchy but overall it is easily the best film in 2023 letsagooo

Apr 12 2023,positive,the pure nostalgia flood the movie never felt hamfisted or forced every little easter egg or mario franchise they included just flowed seamlessly with the story it was so well done the comedy was subtle didnt feel forced like it does sometimes in marvel movies an excellent foray by nintendo

Apr 12 2023,positive,absolutely amazing through and through filled with nintendo references such as punch outwrecking crewduck huntballoon fight any many more even a charles martinet cameo in the beginning part of the movie i highly recommend this movie to any die hard nintendo fan or any marionintendo fan out there 1010 performance from all the actors lets not forget the definite oscar winning song peaches
Apr 12 2023,positive,great movie i highly recommend
Apr 12 2023,positive,the movie provided exactly what both children and parents wanted a bunch of fan service well made jokes paying respect to all the games that came before and enough meat left on the bone for a sequel without feeling like they left anything on the table    the voice acting was great except for donkey kong and cranky kong  both of those are awful but that never stops this film from being enjoyable    well worth your time for the whole family    peaches

Apr 12 2023,positive,great movie my son enjoyed it 
Apr 12 2023,positive,i absolutely loved it and the nods at the games
Apr 12 2023,positive,okay lets be honest here some of critics got it wrong you or others arent coming to see some action movie you are coming to see mario you didnt come here to watch any old movie you came for nostalgia and fun the mario movie stays mostly canonical and if it didnt any sane person would have hated it even the critics i applaud illumination or however youre supposed to spell it and nintendo for this now is it missing a little story and character development perhaps but it makes up for it in easter eggs like the cappycap store at the start of the movie and quite frankly mario and luigi now lets talk about the elephant in the room the vas chris pratt was definitely questionable choice and i wouldnt have picked him even now after seeing the movie however he wasnt the worst so we got that out of the way   best movie ive seen so far of 2023 but maybe im biased because im a gamer   edit im not trying to attack anybody i would just like to clear up some of the confusion and share my albeit very potent opinion
Apr 12 2023,positive,my son was so excited to watch it and he loves it its amazing
Apr 12 2023,positive,as a long time mario fan this movie delivers the fun and magic we all love both kids and adults will have a great time
Apr 12 2023,negative,walked out just a nostalgia grab

Apr 12 2023,positive,such a fun movie visually and musically
Apr 12 2023,positive,i say 455 because as a gamer i loved it it was phenomenal it would be a 55 if it wasnt for there being basically no character development and no formal structured story but that doesnt matter because it looks beautiful and it was one of the best movies of this year i want to watch it again for its stunning animation and impeccable music also sub to game0ver on youtube because im gonna make a review video about this and super nintendo world in hollywood
Apr 12 2023,positive,you get everything from a mario movie you expect to get so many references from every game the story does enough to get you by it and laugh through out makes you hyped to see more from this universe i grinned nonstop a wonderful enjoyment
Apr 12 2023,positive,i loved it  insta classic for true gamer fans and lovers of mario everything 
Apr 12 2023,positive,awesome a much better interpretation of the video game franchise than the 1994 movie everyone is a lot of fun plenty of video game references for the fans 
Apr 12 2023,positive,super mario bros simply the best movie whoever has not played the video game has no right to comment it should take more than 30 years to see my favorite game turned into a phenomenal movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,lots of fun tons of easter eggs in the film from the thirty plus year history of the games   watch and see

Apr 12 2023,positive,i havent seen this movie yet
Apr 12 2023,positive,lots of references to past games but a bit too fast paced
Apr 12 2023,positive,disregard the elitist snobbery of the high minded critics  if you came to watch mario and expected the 2nd coming of the shawshank redemption  it probably says more about you than the movie  super mario bros is a kids movie  lets set that straight  you can only expect the plot to be so deep  but as great animated movies go it has more than enough to delight audiences of every age  if you like mario which is the only reason why you want to watch the movie to begin with you wont be disappointed and youll have a great time  at the time of writing just came back from a packed theatre 9pm showing on a tuesday night a rare ovation with the credits   this movie also breaks the ground for a brand new nintendo cinematic universe with the other timeless characters  its good to see nintendo take their place in modern day media folklore  here we go
Apr 12 2023,positive,the movie is awesome it is obviously aimed at kids but i went to see it with my daughter and now she loves mario this shows rotten tomatoes doesnt need to be taken seriously
Apr 12 2023,positive,i loved it it was no artistic masterpiece worthy of the record books but it was fun entertaining and engaging i loved the corny humor and the inherent nostalgia from my childhood
Apr 12 2023,positive,mario and luigis plumber backstory is gold peach as the mentor was a perfect fit voice acting and visuals were delightful they blew it bigtime by adding in some super dark scenes making bowsers crew into a sadistic human sacrificeholocaust cult and making jokes about suicidal depression that was not true to the mario franchise or to nintendo
Apr 12 2023,positive,fantastic family movie
Apr 12 2023,positive,the movie was nearly perfect it was eye and ear candy to beloved fans of the mario franchise the song peaches was hilarious but my only minor problem is that it is fast paced but thats okay since the movie is targeted towards kids
Apr 12 2023,positive,awesome i enjoyed a lot
Apr 12 2023,positive,for me this is one of the best mario movies reminding me of my childhood when i played and besides the animation quality is perfect this movie is gold
Apr 12 2023,positive,it was visually stunning and hilarious it took a bit to get used to the voice acting but overall it is a great movie for fans and everyone else

Apr 12 2023,positive,a great action packed fun movie with good humor although i feel like chris pratts voice does not fit mario he tries to do the italian accent but mostly stays away from it overall 710
Apr 12 2023,positive,any time  critics dont like something it turns out its good and ppl like it not sure who pays for these idiots this will break a 1 b

Apr 12 2023,positive,a bit too light on the story aspects and fast paced yet still an excellent adaptation of nintendos mario that has something for fans of the franchise young and old to see
Apr 12 2023,positive,i thought it was super cute  really well done  im not a video game player so im sure i missed a lot of the more nuanced easter eggs but i was familiar with enough to really enjoy what they did with it the storyline was great the comedy was great the action was great  it was great would definitely recommend
Apr 12 2023,positive,my husband and i took my 2 nephews ages 5 and 8 to see the movie all 4 of us loved it the story was great the characters were lovable

Apr 12 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in years theres virtually no plot or character development most of the jokes are just about how cute characters are or super awkward sterile kid friendly dialogue that will make anyone expecting any semblance of serious writing or dialogue cringe the voice acting is super hammy like the director has never heard humans speak before and the majority of the run time is really lazy easter egg placement plenty of kid friendly movies have dialogue or jokes adults can appreciate but this movie is just another bad cutesy movie from illumination

Apr 12 2023,positive,long time nintendo and super mario bros fan so this was a thrill to see beautiful graphics throughout and loved the music and sound i was cheering and rooting for the crew the whole time didnt love the large focus on donkey kong though the family scenes were cool but kind of long i was hoping for a little more in depth on the power ups and worlds i felt yoshi was lacking and other characters that i loved the fire flower scene was beautiful but too short thats my only complaint i wanted to linger in the worlds longer and get more exploration but it was engaging and wonderful and a must see
Apr 12 2023,positive,i loved it so cute so action packed and definitely for the entire family

Apr 12 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics they dont know about movies  this movie is better than you think it is
Apr 12 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie paid a great deal of homage to one of if not the most popular video game of all time which has transcended from generation to generation     it was full of color and life  a star stunted cast filled with amazing voiceover work  chris pratt hit the mario voice on the head    lots of easter eggs throughout the film filling the room with nostalgia and keeping the world open full with opportunities     the film seemed to hang heavily on the nostalgic feelings and a lack luster plot it seemed as if they just had too much to put in and cut out a lot of context to the plot i think it could have been an even better film if the trials before the final battle had more adversity or if there was an initial battle with a fall from glory to a rise to redemption     the possibility could have been endless     none the less i would recommend this film 100
Apr 12 2023,positive,the storyline and graphics were great i loved the push and motivation that mario and luigi demonstrated this is good for children to sew a good example to never give up
Apr 12 2023,positive,it was ok the kids enjoyed it but it was way too overpriced it was totally not a 20000 experience the food drinks and snacks is way too overpriced
Apr 12 2023,positive,after years of video games cartoons and a live action movie we finally get a super mario brothers movie the movie was well worth the wait and could open the door to other movies it was a tale that showed that we are more than how we are perceived by others and can rise above expectations as long as we keep reaching for the stars enjoy the movie for gamers like myself and others who may have no idea what its super mario brothers is about  this movie is well worth watching for the whole family it gets an a stay after the credits

Apr 12 2023,positive,the critics are wildly wildly off the plot isnt thin its just right as its riffing off of mario games any more plot and theyd be making stuff up and have us shrugging the music was awesome and the voice acting was great honestly no complaints though i am worried film critics have just decided to start panning movies that have any cgi or animation in them oh well their loss

Apr 11 2023,positive,we took our kids and several neighborhood kids to a matinee saturday  they all loved it and wanted to watch it again   very very entertaining for the kids  both of my kids 31 years old who took a few of their kids and a few of their neighborhood kids enjoyed the movie  my kids grew up on marie bros and they enjoyed it  time well spent with the family  highly recommend the movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,good story line plenty of action  movie would have been more enjoyable without the depressed start  my kids had a good time
Apr 11 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is one i was looking forward to for a while i remember thinking it was gonna be bad once i heard illumination had their hands on it way back when it was first announced but it turns out that the film is pretty good as a lifelong mario fan i was happy it had fantastic visuals an amazing soundtrack nods and easter eggs to the games for fans and it was just really heartfelt and fun its nothing special narratively but thats expected from a mario movie the pacing was my main issue with the film aside from problems like these though its still a a pretty solid movie thats true to the source material
Apr 11 2023,positive,a movie made to keep fans happy not to satisfy the rotten stablishment ideological views i love every second while watching well spent money
Apr 11 2023,positive,pacing could have been a little bit better but other than that great movie

Apr 11 2023,positive,if youve ever played a mario game before your gonna at the very least have a fun time with this film as a massive mario fan myself it was an absolute blast seeing my favorite characters on the big screen only issue against this film is that the story is a bit shallow but the games are the same way so i cant really knock the rating for that reason its a must see for any and all mario fans
Apr 11 2023,positive,i am fond of the mario franchise    funny cute great  one thing that could of been better  1 better yahoo chris pratt  i liked the luma saying the sweet relief of death  the peaches song ahh best song in history  thats it
Apr 11 2023,positive,very good movie the best one of super mario bros
Apr 11 2023,positive,i loved it i watched it with my brother and i enjoyed it so much especially the dynamic between dk and mario huge w 
Apr 11 2023,neutral,love the fun and homage to mario games great laughs  but i can not look past the part where they made mario and lugi incompetent and peach is perfect and fails at nothing why making any character fake or real unrelatable due to they can do and thing and never fail especially making the opposite sex pathetic  hurts the film
Apr 11 2023,positive,perfect movie about an italian plumber finding himself in a kingdom of mushrooms only criticism is that theres no yoshi but hes confirmed to be in the next one

Apr 11 2023,positive,fun movie that had a lot of call backs to the games
Apr 11 2023,positive,that it was adult friendly as well
Apr 11 2023,positive,wow i loved that took me back to when i was a kid and played at the nintendo
Apr 11 2023,positive,its exactly what the movie needed to be it delivered brilliantly  im a 40something father of two young teenage sons and we all loved it  the critical reviews are so detached from any understanding of the history  intended audience  the critics didnt do their homework  which they needed to have done to actually understand  review this movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,loved it took me back when my kids played the nintendo version i got a lot of enjoyment watching them play the levels and learning all that you could do with the characters and such fun
Apr 11 2023,positive,a fun family movie worth seeing
Apr 11 2023,positive,was a huge mario fan growing up went in without any expectations and really enjoyed the movie tons of momentos and references to older mario media great animation easy story to enjoy and a lot of funny moments i think it can be enjoyed even if youre not familiar with the mario world even though it has a lot of easter eggs for the fans i highly recommend the movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,super fun movie to turn off your brain and enjoy the moment and the references to the games is like a reward for the fans of the franchise
Apr 11 2023,positive,one of the best video game movie adaptations ever the nintendo cinematic universe is now a huge possibility
Apr 11 2023,positive,must see for anyone who is a fan of previous illumination animation and of course anyone who has ever played a nintendo console kids loved it adults loved all the little easter eggs and references hidden throughout the movie everything a mario movie should be and more
Apr 11 2023,positive,the greatest based on game movie of all time tribute to fans   story is actuall simple not complixated but this is huge advantage finally a movie for kids with happy parents to wath and laugh together we needed movie like this
Apr 11 2023,positive,you dont even have to have played the mario bros games to love this movie he is so cute and well produced in every detail incredible and nostalgic soundtrack simply one of the best animations
Apr 11 2023,negative,why is it that movie making has become such a mindless collection of characters crashing into something or beating each other up this is the third film in a row in which my daughter said halfway through the show daddy i have enough of this can we go home now  well done my girl for not being fascinated by onscreen violence even if this may have put you off going to the cinema for the rest of your life if i could add some rotten cucumbers i would
Apr 11 2023,positive,cute intro and visually gorgeous but hardly an interest in the actual story and characters
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie was awesome not just for kids but for adults who played all the different mario games growing up the fact that the critic score for this movie is 57 just shows how out of touch movie critics have gotten from the general public
Apr 11 2023,positive,loved the sound track
Apr 11 2023,positive,definetely a must see for mario fans the movie delivers big time on animation and mario stuff definetely thrilled about it only disappointment i feel like is the plot it could have been more thoughtout and definetely screen time should have been at least 2 hours since there are a few cliffhangers left but those are minor errors for a mario fan
Apr 11 2023,positive,i want to live in these worlds they have created funny joyful and nostalgic
Apr 11 2023,positive,wish mario was stronger
Apr 11 2023,positive,over all great experience only con some weird pacing choices
Apr 11 2023,negative,the movie was ok the plot was weak and made minimal sense characters were flat the visual world was appealing  saw this in 3d absolutely not worth the extra  for 3d which is a shame because there were a lot of good visual opportunities that were never taken
Apr 11 2023,positive,this film speaks intergenerational fans across the world with the 100s of visual easter egg gem the soundtrack which reigns king and our beloved characters bring the many game elements to life as a gamergirl this film speaks directly to my generation as i know it will to all nintendo  mario bros fans i especially loved seeing the relationship between mario and luigi peachs bad assery toads determination bowser being misunderstood and donkey kongs energy i loved seeing every moment on screen just wish the film was longer
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie was so nostalgic and clever paying homage to almost every version of the mario games ever made fun story line and many funny laugh out loud moments 
Apr 11 2023,positive,the critics are too rough on these types of movies as a long time fan of the super mario franchise i see it as the perfect way to do a mario movie the animation was great and it had many references to find if you have never played a mario game before you will be able to see just what its all about if you have played a mario game you will have lots of fun discovering references and the humor truly an amazing homage to the mario bros franchise
Apr 11 2023,positive,i loved the mario movie it was deeply nostalgic for me to watch having played mario all my life it was amazing
Apr 11 2023,positive,fun and entertaining
Apr 11 2023,positive,its amazing but above all a gift for mario fans
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing a true love letter to mario and nintendo fans it has great visuals fantastic voice acting very good humor incredible soundtrack and it is jam packed with references the story however is very simple and the pacing of the movie is very quick so if youre looking for a movie that stands out on his own you would be a bit disappointed but if you love the games and youre looking for a fun family movie youll have a blast   9510 
Apr 11 2023,positive,this is genuinely one of the funniest movies ive ever seen and im about to graduate
Apr 11 2023,positive,it was a quick 90 minutes and fun

Apr 11 2023,positive,honestly its really good
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie knows exactly what it needs to be and delivers it doesnt try to pretend its more all round fun adventure great visuals great music exciting actions and references an ultimate love letter to long time mario fans
Apr 11 2023,positive,lovely simple true to the fans fun movie and great soundtrack
Apr 11 2023,positive,to be honest im going to agree with the critics here while it definitely wasnt a onestar movie illuminations best production and the best videogame film since sonic the hedgehog i did feel like it was more of a reference movie then a movie with character    the story is the same as the original video game plot line but with a few twists mario and luigi two brothers brandnew to the plumbing business get transported to the world that the movie takes place in with mario being taken to the mushroom kingdom and luigi being taken to the badlands throughout the course of the movie mario meets iconic characters such as donkey kong princess peach and toad while also doing iconic things and visiting new places thats the thing though    while the movie was good overall most of the plotline included references to nintendos various games such as mariokart dk and various other things while i loved the references for a bit they got old really quickly i wouldve loved to seen more story like finding out if peach was from earth or not while some of my plot ideas would have to fit in a sequel of sorts i think the references were a bit overthetop    but other than that it was a great movie the actors did really good on their parts the animation was stunning and it was worth the time to go watch it i did hate the peaches song though kinda ruined bowsers character for me
Apr 11 2023,positive,seeing all the nods to the older games although true fans would realize some people were missing fun for all ages
Apr 11 2023,positive,great movie kids loved it nothing in the movie that would worry a parent besides a few scenes that might be scary for kids under 4 but even at that they are softened by humor 100 glad we went
Apr 11 2023,positive,loved how they added all the details from the game in the movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,amazing hope they make the game just like the movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,a fantastic movie for family and fans it truly gives nostalgic vibes as a kid i wanted an animated mario movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,amazing visuals all around the 3rd act especially was very gorgeous i had no problems with any of the voice cast the soundtrack is top notch the references are amazing callbacks for mario fans and the story is simple  which i enjoy  but the first half of the movie is incredibly fastpaced luckily it slows down a bit later on there isnt really much character development or huge personal arcs but i do enjoy the character interactions because they just feel very natural especially those between donkey kong and mario overall its just a fun movie nothing huge to take away from it and the perfect movie if youre just looking for a good time
Apr 11 2023,positive,bright colors and the characters action packed all loved by my niece and nephew 8 and 10 yrs old fun movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,best movie i really love it
Apr 11 2023,positive,great family entertainment if you look at the box office youll see its what families are craving this was true to the super mario games and great fun
Apr 11 2023,positive,movie was awesome dont listen to the critic scores
Apr 11 2023,positive,another movie rt got wrong possibly the best family movie out there
Apr 11 2023,positive,this was a good starter movie for mario if they continue to make more it would be nice to see mario on an actual path to get peach and not just fight on a regular street
Apr 11 2023,positive,berger than disney
Apr 11 2023,positive,this is a family movie that cross generations a well done videogame movie with a lot of fan services and mario plot style the simplicity here is a charm finally mario has what he deserves
Apr 11 2023,positive,great movie went with my 7 and 10 year old kids both loved it i was bit worried about the amount of action and fighting but kids understood the context and thought that it was like a mario video game
Apr 11 2023,positive,the film is very good it certainly brings childhood nostalgia to those who went to see the film i loved that the film didnt address the modernity of today so we can take children family and parents to the cinema i just didnt like the songs that were kind of out of context in the movie but otherwise the movie is very good
Apr 11 2023,positive,excellent film the nostalgia was real
Apr 11 2023,positive,really cute movie saw it with our grandkids who thoroughly enjoyed it
Apr 11 2023,positive,that was so perfect movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,while i found the warcraft movie to be the pretty good all things considered games turn into movies this one absolutely hit it out of the ballpark if i had to rank the top 3 game movies this goes first followed by dnd then warcraft absolutely must see and long time fans will enjoy every single little easter egg that ranges across the various mario games that includes donkey kong
Apr 11 2023,positive,its refreshing because i havent seen such a good movie in a long time it has alot of references to the old game to make the older fans smile like the dk rap from donkey kong 64 or old theme songs but also has something for kids to enjoy
Apr 11 2023,positive,great adaptation of the video game 
Apr 11 2023,positive,my children enjoy it they watched twice in a row we were excited with every new scene reminding all the versions of super mario bros games
Apr 11 2023,positive,such a great film for someone who grew up playing the games it seems like the story was left open for a sequel
Apr 11 2023,positive,a true piece of art for mario fans no matter their age

Apr 11 2023,positive,it was a fantastic movie we love it and enjoy it every second of if 
Apr 11 2023,positive,disney watch out it looks there is a new kid on the block this movie was super family friendly and so much fun to watch so happy i can take my kids to a movie without inappropriate content behind it
Apr 11 2023,positive,had a great time with my son best movie this year woohoo
Apr 11 2023,positive,awesome i love the nes references its funny colorful and made for video game nerds
Apr 11 2023,positive,critics seems to be expecting schindlers list kind of drama from this cartoon only emotion you will be experiencing will be excitement as far as pg animation goes its top of the cream there cant be more perfect movie for mario than this
Apr 11 2023,positive,my family and kids enjoyed this movie  i remember that i told my friend this movie felt like movie movie as i want to be entertained when i go to the cinema   it was wonderful for all of us who grew up playing super mario with lots of surprises   nothing felt forceful and everything had a nice flow 100 recommend
Apr 11 2023,positive,greatness in a movie such an excelent work from both illumination and nintendo 5 stars are not enough u must see it
Apr 11 2023,positive,if you have not played mario you simply cannot comment on the movie  its a great move from console to movie screen excellent movie

Apr 11 2023,positive,it was a fun movie to watch
Apr 11 2023,positive,i like everything about the movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,as a 25year old who grew up playing various mario related games i loved this movie it was everything it needed to be simple fun and playful me and my girlfriend had a blast watching it this is the first time i have bothered posting a review for any movie because reviewers dont know anything theyre paid to be critical and give it outlandish reviews hey reviewers its not supposed to be a shawshank redemption its not supposed to be an interstellar its a fun movie paying homage to a beloved franchise    point is official reviewers suck and judge it by the audience scores     booooooo to the reviewers
Apr 11 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies from past 10 years hollywood should take lessons
Apr 11 2023,positive,it was a good solid movie   i grew up on mario and nintendo so very nostalgic  and took my 8 yr old son who loved it as well so refreshing to see a movie now a days without feeling like you are be lectured to they kept it about the story and stayed true to the mario brand
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie was very well done it has a great amount of story telling and nostalgia that is whimsically entertaining both adults and kids will thoroughly enjoy this movie rotten tomatoes critic score is laughably wrong definitely look at the audience scores for this one
Apr 11 2023,positive,super mario bros movie was really fun i even think people who arent fans will like it but if you are a fan youre going to have a good time
Apr 11 2023,positive,my kids 9 and 5 and 6 year old and my husband and myself enjoyed the movie very much amazing colors amazing production
Apr 11 2023,positive,peach got the gyattt
Apr 11 2023,positive,nostalgia has everything 80s and 90s babies loved about the mario kart game and super mario games growing up it also has a 3d affect that todays kids have come to love from their video games hoping theres a sequel
Apr 11 2023,positive,idk whats up with the critic reviews this move was great really fun and funny
Apr 11 2023,positive,super cute 1000 family friendly
Apr 11 2023,positive,was a fantastic movie for kids and video gamers alike the story while very simple had its charm and easy to understand plot cant wait for them to do a part 2
Apr 11 2023,positive,loved it  fun simple wholesome movie   refreshing change   great nostalgia factor
Apr 11 2023,positive,the movies its just great not a long movie direct to the pint animation is on point
Apr 11 2023,positive,what i felt when watching this movie was heart and soul put into this movie for those who are hating on it you have no love and appreciation for what these animators directors sound designers writers and actors is their hard work into
Apr 11 2023,positive,do not expect a serious movie its a freaking mario movie it doesnt tackle any politcal tones or messages what so ever so it can be enjoyed by anyone expecting a good family movie a must see for the family personally 810 peaches peaches peaches peaches
Apr 11 2023,positive,it was a lot of fun
Apr 11 2023,positive,the movie was  an iconic experience for any gamer and mario lover the movie has many characters from the first to the last game and iconic voices from the characters as well this is what hollywood should focus on to entertain the audience and fans of the franchise
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie was a great way to bring a big nintendo franchise to the big screen as a avid nintendo fan growing up this movie really brought back childhood memories it made me feel like a kid again reminded me of that moment in the movie ratatouille  when the flod critic eats the dish the main character makes him it took him back to his childhood  same feeling for me i literally almost cried of joy and excitement  and felt  very smart when i would identify and understand  the small references and easter eggs this movie is  a must have in your physical or digital library 
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie is perfect for children as well as long time fans of the super mario bros there are references to the original game series as well as newer games within the mario and luigi universe nintendo and illumination knew what they were doing when they put this movie together and i hope for more in the future
Apr 11 2023,positive,took the whole family to see it on opening weekend it was so good a clean well made family friendly movie they stayed true to the marionintendo theme and packed it full of fun and adventure its the family friendly movie weve all been needing well done we loved it
Apr 11 2023,positive,entertaining and a good family movie  has a normal run time no three hour filler here
Apr 11 2023,positive,it is one of the most enjoyable family friendly movies i have seen in years my son loved the movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,i was equally delighted and disappointed by the super mario bros movie in a way i both loved it and hated it i entered with fairly low expectations and i emerged surprisingly pleased it exceeded my expectations it did not exceed them that much but it exceeded them nonetheless the plot was barebones as i expected and this in part thanks to its poor pacing there was simply too much crammed into those 92 minutes the film attempted to cram 42 years of mario history into 92 minutes the plot and pacing were pretty poor and there was little to no character development plot twists or overarching themes the music and the visuals were also as i expected for they were both unlike the plot excellent it was so surreal and so wonderful to witness classic characters characters i have grown up with realized on the silver screen and they were realized surrounded by spectacular setpieces the world of super mario realized on a grander and more glorious scale than ever that was certainly a highlight seeing something i never thought we would see in my lifetime of course there were easter eggs aplenty quite a few of which i caught and though this adds no narrative value to the film it does make the film a fantastic time for fans of every generation it is in effect an extended easter egg hunt overall the super mario bros movie was both a fantastic and fun time and a shallow and straightforward time because of its fidelity to the source material it is one of the best video game films ever madethis praise is not saying much as these adaptations rarely reach above mediocrity the super mario bros movie is no exception to this curse though it is a fun time for family and fans alike the super mario bros movie suffers because of its poor and poorlypaced plot in which far too much is stuffed it is a cacophony of colorful chaos crammed into 92 minutes that is perfect for children and for fans the simple plot is for the kids and the easter eggs are for the fans the super mario bros movie is an energetic and straightforward love letter to the series but it could have been so much more
Apr 11 2023,positive,peach is a mary sue kind of character but somehow lovely the movie is just one well served fanservice stuff after another the script is almost nonexistant the story is predictable and everything comes too fast but you know what my 7 year old daughter asked for it we went to the cinema and we had a wonderful time all in all a funny movie the kids loved it gamer parents like me had a lot references eastern eggs and a lot of laughter and hey funny thats all we want
Apr 11 2023,positive,great references of past games a good retelling of the series amazing soundtrack outstanding acting its a fun movie to watch 1510
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie was so fun a lot of easter eggs for long time nintendo fans great appropriate humor for kids the theater clapped when this movie ended im not sure about that but this is a good one
Apr 11 2023,positive,smiled all the way from the first scene to the end of the movie thats what i expect from a movie like this and it gave me the same so 5 all the way was like a refresher to my childhood memories loved it
Apr 11 2023,positive,it was as simple as the game you log in for the first time and you are amazed by the surroundings but unable to play after a few rounds you start tu understand how this world works   this movie gives the audience an other perspective you are not the gamer but the spectator watching the iconic characters interact with eachother   you shouldnt expect much if you never had anything to do with this game but it is probably a dream for young fans and nostalgic for the older audience who received a colorful movie of game characters who were exactly how they were known for
Apr 11 2023,positive,i literally made an account because movie critics must have never played a mario games this movie is perfect
Apr 11 2023,positive,its an amazing movie full of everything we can find in the super mario bro universe full of nostalgia and the truth is incredible animation references to all the games there nostalgia from beginning to end simply wonderful
Apr 11 2023,positive,i dont know what movie the critics saw it was great for fans of the game it delivered and went beyond the expectations for not so gaming fans like my girlfriend it was still super enjoyable every character had its place and moment and made sense as it was portrayed a lot of fun good pace introduced a whole universe of possibilities without overwhelming cant wait for more of it
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie is great but only if you have played several mario games from the original nes version all the way up to the latest mario games  mario kart 8 mario galaxy etc etc and it doesnt end there if you used to watch the super mario bros animated series you will be in for a treat as well so if you are a vivid nintendo gamer with many mario games finished you will absolutely love this movie but if you dont well then you wont get any of the many references in this movie and miss the whole point so i get why the movie got a 55 at rt but gamers will judge this movie differently
Apr 11 2023,positive,movie was fun to watch felt rushed in some aspects could of had more characters in it
Apr 11 2023,positive,if you love super mario and mario kart games you will love this movie it is a fun entertaining movie for the whole family
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie is so good and gonna see for a second time this weekend 
Apr 11 2023,positive,an absolutely stunning tribute to the games no overly complicated plot didnt try too hard it was basically a mario game with better dialogue its exactly what we all needed from a mario movie weve been singing peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches constantly since watching so excited for them to make the next one with more characters and worlds
Apr 11 2023,positive,while some of the voice acting took me out of the movie at times it was still wonderfully made and developed
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic our childhood dreams of getting movies based on our favorite video games are finally coming true first sonic now mario this movie has excellent animation comedy music and is wildly entertaining true it does have flaws of course the plot is super thin but what do you expect for a mario movie thats 90 minutes long  my only dislike was probably their use of popular 80s songs that have been overused  still this movie is fantastic and invokes much nostalgia definitely see it
Apr 11 2023,positive,an amazing movie for the whole family video game movies are definitely back to stay
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie was nothing short of a masterpiece phenomenal voice acting from an incredibly talented cast anyone who dislikes this movie is delusional absolute must see
Apr 11 2023,positive,it was an amazing movie that me and a few friends went to watch
Apr 11 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics this was a thrill in 4dx format the critics are far removed from both moviegoers and common sense i had a smile on my face for a whole 1h and 30min this must become a franchise
Apr 11 2023,positive,this was one of the best movies ive seen in a long time the cast was phenomenal and there were so many easter eggs and nods to other nintendo properties very small critiques for one of the most fun and entertaining movies ever
Apr 11 2023,positive,i think its about time we just didnt have critics if you listened to those out of touch people you probably would miss a great movie that was made for nintendo and mario fans and contains a ton of references to the games great cast and enjoyable story based on the games all characters get a chance to shine but seth rogen as donkey kong steals the show chris pratt is also getting flak for his role and voice when its actually great but its trendy to hate chris pratt and not trendy to have a guy save the day so i guess we know why critics gave it a bad score
Apr 11 2023,positive,critics dont get that you dont need a plot to make a good film instead the mario movie proves that you dont need oscar worthy story to drag a film along instead you need likeable characters and an interesting concept to help make your movie work a must watch if your a fan and child
Apr 11 2023,positive,i dont have high expectations for childrens movies so this one was a nice surprise it was done well the characters and their relationships  make you feel something inside  whatever that may be 
Apr 11 2023,positive,such a great movie never trust the critic score that thing is way off
Apr 11 2023,positive,perfect adaptation from the game to the cinema loved every minute of it untill the last post credit scene dont miss it if you loved the game and please dont care what the experts say they just wouldnt understand
Apr 11 2023,positive,when the mario movie was first announced i had doubts because its illumination this movie is great the cast is outstanding it lives up to the hype with the amount of references in the movie the animation is phenomenal and beautiful i definitely recommend to see it now
Apr 11 2023,positive,nice textures in 3d wholesome escapism adventure everything we want from animation there are times it really seemed like a little set of toys almost like claymation at some points peaches takes a more prominent role but it fits with the original game  shes just not that much of a victim here anymore its a good power up for her without it seeming like its all forced but mario is still our hero much better than most 3d animations
Apr 11 2023,positive,great movie kids loved it with plenty humor for parents
Apr 11 2023,positive,loved this movie it was a great movie adaptation to the game series charlie day as luigi was my favorite casting choice
Apr 11 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie i did realize there was an uproar with some actors until the day before the movie as the main characters were not played by actual italian actors  with that being said i found it enjoyable donkey kong made the kids scream they were jumping up and down in their seats when he came on screen  the rainbow bridge was amazing seeing them drive using all the tools in the video came was so cool and then using the star  the grandkids enjoyed the movie and talked about it all the way home
Apr 11 2023,positive,i can see people watching it a 2nd time and trying to find all the easter eggs but the point is there are too many easter eggs and it can get tiring just trying to find them all but the movie is an excellent and colorful adventure that families adults and kids would enjoy and love
Apr 11 2023,positive,its good just enjoy it 
Apr 11 2023,positive,love it only videogame nerds understand this animated film
Apr 11 2023,positive,its a good movie that is supposed to be fun
Apr 11 2023,positive,i enjoyed it way more then i thought i would thought the voice acting would bother me but it didnt take away from the movie at all dont know how critics give this a 1 they have to be getting paid off
Apr 11 2023,positive,i liked how the movie was just like the game but it was upgraded
Apr 11 2023,neutral,i mean the way the plot is assembled there is bound to be absolutely no depth in it  compare it to a traditional mario game  bowser is trying to attain power in the mushroom kingdom to do this he wants to kidnap princess peach and force her to marry him so he can claim to be the new king of the mushroom kingdom and boot king toadstool off the throne   this gives peaches capture purpose and meaning and puts pressure on mario to go save her  mario aka jumpman who is a well known and respected hero of the mushroom kingdom is called upon by king toadstool to go rescue his daughter before the entire mushroom kingdom is sent into turmoil   mario cant do it alone so he enlists his brother to help him meeting new allies and finding new powers to help him along the way   after defeating some of bowsers cronies mario eventually ends up fighting bowser in an epic fight in order to free princess peach and save the mushroom kingdom     everyone has motives and purpose and clear objectives and goals to achieve along the way the story has tension and the stakes are high      in the mario movie  peach is a warrior princess who doesnt need anyone cause you know its 2023   bowser captures luigi because reasons   mario is just some guy with no skills who now needs to go save his brother before bowser can what kill him again for reasons  which in doing so would be sad but have no larger effect on the mushroom kingdom as a whole  so why the princess gets involved is anyones guess i suppose shes just so nice that shed put her life on the line to help some guy she kinda knows rescue his brother     so the plot is shallow the characters are shallow their motives are extra shallow this is what happens when you take an established world and characters and try to put your own spin on it for no apparent reason the old formula works and is even less tired and rehashed than the new formula we just got     so while the movie is fun is has zero rewatch value and if youre looking for a movie that stand on its own say you dont know much about mario and arent a nintendo fanboy maybe like many parents out there then this movie will disappoint you   if you just want an iv drip of pure nostalgia for a while then this movie will suffice     it works in the loosest possible sense of the term
Apr 11 2023,positive,super mario bross being the most faithful video game adaptation is certainly a great achievement for the film industry its great to see filmmakers taking the source material seriously and doing justice to the beloved video game franchise lets hope this trend continues and we get even more faithful adaptations in the future
Apr 11 2023,positive,i am 69 yrs old my wife 59 and my son 14 we all loved the movie on wednesday opening night we are all going back tonight and i am learning the bowser peaches song to play at my piano lounge    peaches peaches peaches
Apr 11 2023,positive,ive just arrived back from seeing the film i have to say that for me its undoubtedly one of my alltime favourites seeing my childhood hero so faithfully adapted to the big screen with many callbacks to his japanonly 1986 movie not to be confused with the infamously awful 1993 liveaction movie were much appreciated too as it was the closest thing i had to this new film as a child it would be wondrous to see this as a child today  i was grinning like one all the way through
Apr 11 2023,positive,a lot of fun and way better than i expected really loved what they did with princess peach and her origin story really got me excited to see where they take her next
Apr 11 2023,positive,absolutely incredible full of fun for all the family  endless references for marionintendo fans
Apr 11 2023,positive,it really is a good movie it is the best that could have been made regarding this franchise the top critics have basofia in their heads they live in their boring world waiting for more the joker instead of learning to enjoy a good movie i pity their boring world where they only have money and bad taste
Apr 11 2023,positive,it was perfect everything down to the last minute details
Apr 11 2023,positive,despite the movie opening with a real world setting to ease people into the video game world of the rest of the story which is usually something i personally dont like the film succeeds on every level its the kind of thing thats ideal for fans but if someone you know is dragging you to it i bet youll have a good time
Apr 11 2023,positive,great movie my kids wanted to see the movie and even though i was a fan of the game i remembered how bad the first mario bros movie was  and i braced for disappointment imagine my surprise when the movie was true to the source material  it was funny and did not try and push anything other than humor fun and excitement fantastic film  if you loved playing the super mario bros super smash bros super mario kart  you will be thoroughly impressed and have a great time 5 stars
Apr 11 2023,positive,i thought this was the best adaptation of the mario games to date do not listen to the critic score its wildly misguided in understanding the appeal of the movie its a basic storyline sure but its wellexecuted the animation and music were phenomenal and even the voice actors i wasnt so sure about pratt rogen did great this is a must see
Apr 11 2023,negative,this movie was very cringe and bad so disappointing coming from mario
Apr 11 2023,positive,okay from the very beginning i must say that i was born in 1991 so mario was practically ever since i have memorythat being said i must say that this movie brings back old memories from the very beginning i can tell the producers took care of every small detail in the movie from the little but really enjoyable easter eggs to the amazing soundtrack i was hoping nothing less from a nintendo movie because music in their games is usually fantastic the character design is enjoyable to the eyes special kudos to peach and donkey kong design the worlds that where shown are bright colorful and beautiful and the plot is simple yet entretaining enough for both adults and kids   i would go back and see it it is a must watch
Apr 11 2023,positive,we loved it it was fun and very nostalgic def recommend
Apr 11 2023,positive,it was amazing love how they had parts from every game
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie brought me back to my childhood my kid and i really enjoy it from the beginning i wish they make a part 2 for this movie or expand its universe
Apr 11 2023,positive,absolutely amazing movie its all that an historical game fan needs fidelity to the history of the game and supervised by the legend mr shigeru miyamoto it would be almost impossible for this movie to turn out badly i will see it again and again and and i hope that the nintendo universe expands in new movies and new movies from the wide universe of mario bros arrive thanks to illumination and nintendo for gave us such a great movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,loved it  best movie in a while
Apr 11 2023,positive,the critics just need something to hate on this movie was fantastic

Apr 11 2023,positive,very entertaining and nostalgic great fun for the family
Apr 11 2023,positive,all of the so called professional movie critics obviously never played a mario game this movie is 100 nostalgic fun for the og and new era of the mario world fanatics they kept it true to the core with all the characters except maybe dk but none the less finally a movie i can rewatch over and over again did i mention the  soundtrack peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches     ps critics are probably mad because peach wasnt turned to an african descent
Apr 11 2023,positive,clean wholesome family entertainment
Apr 11 2023,positive,i am genuinely perplexed by the low tomato score on this film but i am relieved to see the audience score is so high because this was a great film    as kids movies go you will be hard pressed to find one that is as fun goodnatured and entertaining as the super mario bros film while there is not a whole host of jokes that will have adults rolling with laughter the film does offer some comedic moments for older viewers to enjoy the performance of jack black in particular as bowser is energetic as ever and makes for a very compelling viewing for kids and adults alike lastly those who have enjoyed nintendo games over the years will be thrilled by the countless references the film makes to those games     if anyone is looking for a fun wholesome and entertaining film to see with their kids this is it
Apr 11 2023,positive,i thought the movie was great full of memberberries and fun had me laughing and wanting more will definitely see this one again
Apr 11 2023,positive,when i went to see the movie yesterday i was shocked the whole movie was a peak what is kind of sad is that the movie is 1 hour and 32 minutes which is short but good
Apr 11 2023,positive,the movie was truly spectacular people keep saying it a love letter to long time fans and theyre absolutely right the animation the music the nostalgic
Apr 11 2023,positive,the best game adaptation for the movies ever a true gift to the fans
Apr 11 2023,positive,pay no attention to the whiny movie critics theyre just mad the fans love this movie so much its a fun kids movie not meant to be taken to seriously with no deep plot with many great fan service references that i myself couldnt get enough of as a 30 yr old who grew up with mario i was so happy to see how many children of this generation had fun watching mario on the big screen warmed my heart to see that mario is still relevant to this day of age    if you were expecting otherwise rethink your opinions and take it for what it isa fun kids movie and not what you wanted it to be
Apr 11 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie exceeded my expectations as both a fan of animation and nintendo illumination did a brilliant job bringing the mario universe to life ever since i was a kid sitting on the floor playing games featuring this mustachiod hero ive been waiting for a movie like this even though i wanted to see it when i was 10 it was even better seeing it at 27 the movie didnt just feed on nostalgia but had humor that had me laughing the whole time i highly recommend it for anyone of any age that has love for the franchise and just love for animation in general
Apr 11 2023,positive,a genuine blockbuster of a movie it was super cool and colorful and i love how they depicted the characters its super fun to watch with your friends
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie gave me all the nostalgic feel goods if you are a gamer from the past or even the present and love the mario franchise you will love this movie the voice acting was on point and the soundtrack was so retro which helped us old schoolers relive late nightsearly morning gaming sessions i really enjoyed it i actually want to preorder the movie would highly recommend to gamers of old and folks you who love animation  kids loved this too they were so hype in the movie and i loved it
Apr 11 2023,positive,entertaining and mildly comical at a perfect movie length of 15 hours     55
Apr 11 2023,positive,excelente película  si alguna vez jugaste por lo menos un juego de súper mario vas a disfrutar cada segundo de la película la trama es más sobre el amor fraternal que la búsqueda y rescate a una damisela en peligro para lo que dura la sentí muy corta en la sala de cine escuchaba las risas de niños como de adultos se notaba como todos disfrutaron la película a pesar que tenía referencias a los nuevos videojuegos como a los videojuegos de los años 80s vi a un abuelo que hasta se le salieron las lagrimas de la risa si los críticos dicen que no es cine pues es un espectáculo dentro del cine en cuanto chistes referencias colores y animación    excellent movie  if youve ever played at least one super mario game youre going to enjoy every second of the movie the plot is more about brotherly love than the search and rescue of a damsel in distress for the duration i felt it very short in the movie theater i heard the laughter of children as well as adults it was noticeable how everyone enjoyed the movie despite the fact that it had references to new video games such as video games from the 80s i saw a grandfather who was even tears of laughter came out if the critics say that it is not cinema it is a show within the cinema in terms of jokes references colors and animation
Apr 11 2023,positive,family friendly and fun
Apr 11 2023,positive,if you enjoyed everything made by nintendo youll love this movie it all around fun for all ages if youre someone who wasnt born around the time of the super mario bros games youre in luck they have references to not only old games but even to newer games have fun gunters

Apr 11 2023,positive,everybody needs to stop complaining about this movie half of them use big fancy words that they dont even know the definition of this movie was perfect
