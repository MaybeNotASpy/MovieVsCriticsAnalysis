Oct 5 2023,negative, its probably for the best that warner bros is partially rebooting its dc extended universe and taking it in a more broadly appealing direction black adam is the perfect example of how all their prior efforts have been for naught the plain simple truth of the dceu is that its dark and gritty styles arent broadly appealing such designs might make the efforts feel realistic but they are gloomy and that will sell to a certain demographic but not to others warner bros has been trying to back off the darkness and grime that zack snyder has infused into the franchise for a few years now but their inability to find a formula that works is more obvious in a film like black adam than it ever has been before played by dwayne johnson black adam is an antihero locked away for centuries in an effort to thwart the theft of a demonic crown he is awakened and his thirst for vengeance isnt easily slaked meanwhile a group known as the justice society is hired by amanda waller viola davis to bring this dangerous threat in and lock him away in her supervillain prison while the theme of the film is to question what the definition of superhero should be if they arent going to thwart all villainy in the world the producers have shoved the film so full of visual effects and oneliners that its noble intentions are largely crushed beneath the weight of pomp and circumstance one of the most notable issues with johnson as an actor is his constant mugging for the camera when hes not sufficiently counterbalanced by better actors such as in the jumanji films his performances tend to topple over the edge of tastefulness thats largely true of his performance here which is notably lacking in charm and gravitas part of this is the writing but much of it is his looming presence hes a movie star and the director isnt able to rein that in sufficiently even with strong actors like aldis hodge and pierce brosnan in place theres little that they are able to do yet they still come off as more conscionable and appealing heroes even if their concept of heroism is tempered by a need for propriety and societal balance what the exact fate of each dc character will be is not fully known though based on the mediocrity of this film one might hazard a guess that black adam will be the end of johnsons dceu line
Oct 4 2023,positive, though slow to get into its stride once it does black adam is fun  not omg eyeballsearing movie magic but jolly good nonetheless the 11th film in the dc extended universe dceu this shazam spin off begins 5000 years ago in somewhereistan this time going by the name of kahndaq among the sand and soaring cliffs of kahndaq is a rare and precious metal eternium what is with these fauxlatin sounding fantastical metals remember unobtainium and vibranium anyway that is a story for another time back to the jaume colletserra jungle cruise led black adam where the despotic king anhkot intends to use eternium to create the crown of sabbac to get unlimited power and rule the world you get the drift a slave boy leads a revolt and just at the moment of his execution becomes allpowerful and challenges sneery king anhkot five thousand years later kahndaqs miseries are not over as the country is being ruled by a gang of mercenaries a university professor who is also a resistance fighter adrianna sarah shahi is looking for the crown of sabbacc to ensure it does not fall into the wrong hands the wrong hands led by ishmael marwan kenzari have watched enough movies to know that they just have to follow the good professor turn one of her team against her and the crown is in your pocket or on your head however before that happens adrianna wakes up the slumbering superhero tethadam dwayne johnson and all hell breaks loose the justice society of america jsa is called in to neutralise adam much to the dismay of adriannas superheromad son amon bodhi sabongui the jsa led by hawkman aldis hodge with doctor fate pierce brosnan providing irritatinglyvague predictions in hindsight atom smasher noah centineo eager to fill his uncles shoes and cyclone quintessa swindell head to kahndaq only to realise the ground reality is rather different all naturally comes right in the end in a storm of cgi with that midcredit sequence showing the deliciously dimpled metahuman promising much joy to come brosnan lends gravitas while centineo and swindell have a cool chemistry  comments have to be in english and in full sentences they cannot be abusive or personal please abide by our community guidelines  for posting your comments  we have migrated to a new commenting platform if you are already a registered user of the hindu and logged in you may continue to engage with our articles if you do not have an account please register and login to post comments users can access their older comments by logging into their accounts on vuukle
Aug 17 2023,negative, some five thousand years ago teth adam dwayne johnson was endowed with the gifts of the gods and arose as the saviour of the middle eastern country of kahndaq freeing the country from its oppressors and slavers cut to modernday kahndaq and the country is once again under oppressive occupation  this time by the international crime syndicate known as intergang but when a group of treasure hunters stumble on teth adams tomb and accidentally bring him back to life the future of khandaq is irrevocably changed whether its for the better or worse remains to be seen but teth adams ruthless approach quickly draws the attention of amanda waller viola davis who sends the legendary superhero group the justice society to khandaq to take him down much of the hype surrounding black adam has been that its the film that will change the dc extended universe forever so its ironic that though there is certainly a lot to enjoy about dcs latest superhero film its remarkable how much it plays out like a very bythenumbers origin story but then the whole idea of changing the dceu in the first place is rather suspect what with warner brothers attempt to match marvel studios success with their roster of dc comics characters having been a chaotic mess right from the off that chaos has given rise to superior superhero flicks like wonder woman shazam the emphasis the suicide squad and birds of prey but the reason those films worked really was because they were largely selfcontained with warners having been bought out once again  this time by discovery not that one  plans seem to be afoot to take another swing at trying to match the cohesiveness of the marvel cinematic universe and much of the admittedly unofficial hype around the film was that black adam would be the turning point for the dceu apparently no one told screenwriters adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani however because though it is clearly supposed to be in the shared dc universe i think we can pretty safely say by this point that viola davis is fulfilling much the same role at dc as samuel l jackson did at marvel the film is weirdly disconnected from what came before for example why does waller send the justice society to go after black adam when this is a world where the justice league already exists and for that matter didnt waller create task force x the official name for the suicide squad to deal with supermanlevel threats like this the film doesnt even bother to explain who the justice society are  and for that matter why this society has only four members for the record the justice society of america was the firstever superhero team that debuted way back in 1940 and included the likes of hawkman and dr fate as seen here but also the original versions of the flash green lantern the sandman and others theyre kind of a big deal even more baffling though is the complete and utter absence of shazam not only was black adam originally a shazam aka captain marvel villain but he transforms from an ordinary man into his super self by uttering the magic word that is both an acronym for a group of gods and the name of the wizard that gave him his powers shazam djimon hounsou returns as the wizard shazam in a brief cameo but the character is not mentioned by name and there is not even the slightest hint that shazam has a new modern champion who is imbued with the same gifts a character that has already been played by zachary levi and asher angel and whose sequel is literally the very next film to be released by dc warners early next year  once again this feels like a dc film with a whole bunch of cuts made to it  add to all of the above a credit to jack kirbys fourth world which doesnt appear in black adam at all  but unlike say suicide squad or batman v superman it remains a reasonably cohesive and relatively straightforward anti hero origin story for both good and ill on the bad side director jaume colletserra who is something of a veteran at midbudget thrillers and horror flicks and who just recently teamed up with dwayne johnson for jungle cruise seems completely lost in putting together decent action scenes here the cgi is perfectly decent but it is relied on far too heavily to give the film any weight for some unknown reason he or the films producers decided to bring back the dreaded abuse of slowmotion to punctuate every single action scene apparently not having learned anything at all from zack snyders ridiculous excesses more than anything though theres just a sense of tedium to these weakly choreographed bythenumbers action scenes that may certainly have some very cool moments but become quite numbing very quickly never is this more true than during the climactic battle which is just a badly conceived trudge of messy action a totally crap villain and not so well cgirendered in this case and a weird case of amnesia when it comes to just who the main star is here hawkman aldis hodge and dr fate pierce brosnan steal the emotional core of the film away from black adam himself though for the latter at least thats not exactly surprising the man formally sometimes known as the rock certainly looks the part of black adam and he is more than convincing as a truly unstoppable force of nature but considering just how stoic and severe a character black adam is he never gets the chance to bring the sense of selfknowing fun that we all love him for to the role in comparison pierce brosnan is a total blast as dr fate even during his more melancholy moments and the rest of the justice society including rookies atom smasher noah centineo and cyclone quintessa swindell bring a lightness of touch to the proceedings even if they are woefully underdeveloped  black adam is clearly a major passion project for the rock and he clearly wanted to go for something of a more dramatic role but it doesnt always feel like the film is making the best use of his talents though for what its worth he still does a very fine job as this more morally ambiguous superhero and handles the more dramatic moments really rather well dwayne johnson is not exactly known for subtlety in his acting but hes actually very good here at balancing teth adams coldness and arrogance  another thing that the film gets very much right is in centring the entire film around this fictional middle eastern country called khandaq it gives as much space to some of the ordinary people of the country not least sarah shahi as adrianna tomaz the woman who brought teth adam back to life and her son amon played with real charm by bodhi sabongui the film also i suppose takes a swing at dealing with colonialism but the only thing new offered to this particular conversation is that khandaq isnt occupied by a country but by a criminal organisation intergang who are usually more closely linked with superman than with the shazam side of dc but whatever its an interesting wrinkle  whats rather less effective though is the way that the film tries to present black adam as a new kind of superhero in the dceu  a superantihero that will gladly kill his enemies thats presumably why the film turned to the justice society rather than the other super teams running around but the whole thing rings just a little false  and that i suppose is the thing about the film in general between its strong cast and strippedback story for most of the film anyway theres plenty to enjoy about black adam  no this is not another morbius situation or anything like that  but its a superhero film that resolutely fails to take off like too many superhero origin films it does feel like this is setting things up for a superior sequel and hopefully a justice society or at least a dr fate spinoff but as beginnings go its not half bad

Jul 25 2023,neutral, synopsis nearly 5000 years after he was bestowed with the almighty powers of the ancient gods  and imprisoned just as quickly  black adam dwayne johnson is freed from his earthly tomb ready to unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world like most viewers i dont know anything about the original comics of most superheroes that occupy our theaters nowadays whether its dc marvel or another studio the respective genre is without a doubt the one that brings the largest audiences to the big screen and its not hard to understand why as a fan of this type of film im always more excited when it comes to meeting a new protagonist who im unfamiliar with the marketing campaign surrounding black adam promised a movie that would forever change the dceu power hierarchy as well as leave a lasting impact on the genre itself did it yes and no black adam indeed introduces a superhero who is perfectly capable of fighting anyone presented in this cinematic universe so far however the film cannot overcome the formulaic barriers surrounding its screenplay from the narrative structure to the story itself none of the three screenwriters brings enough originality or imagination to escape the genres conventionalisms in addition to being predictable and simply generic all the essential information is conveyed through expositionheavy scenes during the entire runtime  be it flashbacks narration or forced dialogue no matter how obvious or important black adam delivers revelations so monotonously that it takes away any impact associated with them the protagonist black adam isnt a traditional hero dwayne johnson embodies his characters terrifying ragedriven persona adding the movies central most interesting theme to the narrative the moral and ethical rules of a modern superhero dont fit with the more aggressive assertive behavior of adam resulting in genuinely fascinating conversations with hawkman aldis hodge and doctor fate pierce brosnan too bad jaume colletserra finds himself torn between two different types of film on one hand black adam is a dark movie focused on an intense debate between good and evil between being merciful or unforgiving between justice and fate on the other hand moments of humor break the darker tone of the general film and of the protagonist who presents himself as someone fearsome and to be taken seriously comedy à la marvel doesnt really work in the atmosphere built for this movie and dc seems to have problems understanding which films actually work with this type of humor honestly the explanation isnt very complicated despite being someone who starts getting increasingly tired of marvelesque comedy most of the mcus installments are predisposed to receive that lighter environment from the bright color palette to the fun personalities of the heroes without forgetting the lighthearted tone with which they approach more sensitive topics marvel built its universe that way black adam shouldnt even try to be witty because its protagonist isnt joking around its almost cringy to observe a character trying to throw jokes out of nowhere when adam finds himself processing his moral dilemmas this creates a jarring sensation where the viewer doesnt know how to react to black adams discordant tone however the cast manages to salvage a good part of the clumsy script as noted above hodge brosnan and johnsons characters have interesting conversations about how each uses his powers and how the bad guys should be treated johnson is an absolute badass  his physical presence is a significant factor  hodge is an excellent counterpart but its brosnan who surprises and steals the spotlight with an incredibly absorbing performance quintessa swindell stands out from the rest with striking charisma when it comes to popcorn entertainment the movie delivers several action scenes packed with energy and powerful sound design the combat itself isnt amazing  excessive use of cgi and slowmotion  but when all aspects seem to be in sync  choreography visual effects score camera work editing  black adam shines and delivers a couple of memorable sequences lorne balfes music completely transforms the most impactful moments being the only technical element i can genuinely define as epic and chillinducing one last word for the marketing department black adam is one of the most publicized films in recent years  johnson also played his part  but it becomes dangerous to sell such generic content as something never seen before high expectations more easily lead to misleading disappointments that is perfectly decent works suffer with public opinion more than they deserve precisely because of the intense marketing that raised too much the levels of anticipation for the movie adding a trailer that spoils the sole  and quite effective  narrative twist only creates even more conditions to disappoint countless viewers black adam is far from impressive being somewhat disappointing due to its formulaic predictable screenplay when something different was anticipated lorne balfes epic score and a magnificent cast  dwayne johnson aldis hodge and most remarkably pierce brosnan are phenomenal  try to elevate the decent action and visuals but the moderate entertainment levels dont make up for the dated narrative structure tiresomely heavy exposition story with little to no creativity and inconsistent humor make it impossible for the dceu to take the next step in a truly impactful manner
Jul 25 2023,positive,a misunderstood epic kick off to the next era of the dc universe visceral  intense action scenes create such a kinetic time that i loved therock completely became black adam  added much needed mythology to the word shazam
Jul 21 2023,negative, one of the most iconic and memeworthy quotes from dwayne the rock johnson in the press buildup for his almost 10year passion project is that black adam will change the hierarchy of power in the dc universe indeed a ballsy claim no less coming from one of hollywoods biggest movie stars some saw it as a dig at superman the golden boy of dc who would now apparently play secondfiddle in terms of superstrength levels compared to the shazam antihero  then johnson came out again and said his film would mark a new era of the dc universe he later clarified in an interview that he along with the entire cast and crew would usher in this change by listening to the fansand doing our best to give the fans what they want in many ways black adam does listen to the fans and because of that simple reason it feels like the most disruptive dc film in decades disruptive not because of its disorderly and incongruent parts but for its sheer dedication to producing an entertaining actiondriven film that leaves little room for extreme divisiveness its a safe film for better and worse dc fans deserve this kind of fan service after everything theyve been through and because the marriage between fandom and comic book movies is almost always a rocky one this should be considered some sort of a minor miracle  the film nevertheless leaves much to be desired regarding pacing tonal consistency and scriptwriting perhaps because of the constant pandering to fans black adam ultimately succeeds at doing what most sustainable franchises have always done creating a passable movie that does not vehemently anger most people me included  does that make it a better film hell no though youd be hardpressed to find a better representation of the equivalent of action figures being clashed by a child who knows only of the pure exuberance derived from seeing superpowered individuals face off against each other  the story starts with an exposition dump about the history and world of kahndaq the ancient city that the enslaved teth adam considers his home after gaining the powers of the gods and being hailed as the champion of the people he uses his powers for vengeance and is subsequently imprisoned for it nearly 5000 years later hes freed from his entombment and wreaks havoc in his own twisted way now seen as a threat to the world the justice society of america or jsa consisting of doctor fate pierce brosnan hawkman aldis hodge atom smasher noah centineo and cyclone quintessa swindell join together to subdue him as it turns out the city of kahndaq embraces him once more as their champion as he administers the cruel sentence of death on the military occupiers of the nation using his unparalleled superhuman strength strangely black adams persona has the air of an authoritarian leader from a thirdworld country his whole mythology is built around a lie and yet he is cheered for his displays of machismo and extrajudicial killings coincidentally the jsa is seen as an unpopular foreign invader who has never shown much aid or attention to kahndaq throughout history much like colonial forces and international peacekeeping forces  this intermingling of interventionist rhetoric and the shaky politics of savior narratives could have been a solid foundation that fits the theme of black adam being a central figure in blurring the line between good and evil unfortunately theres just too much going on in this film that even its most interesting commentaries get lost in the fold  whenever theres a moment where youd think the film begins to tap into its vaguely middle easternbased politics it pulls back and then never says anything about it later on a nation embracing an antihero is a fruitful conceit that can draw from multiple vantage points in reallife just take one look at brazil and even the philippines and other films have been geopolitically conscious in the past as well black panther so i see no reason why black adam couldnt have pushed its parallelisms further never once does the film follow through in questioning the privilege of heroes such as atom smasher a literal nepotism baby who is probably more concerned with flirting or even cyclone a teenager sent to a thirdworld country as a weapon the previous dc film earlier this year the batman was able to interrogate hypocrisies embedded in its world  why not here too and then theres the character of adrianna sarah shahi and her son bodhi sabongui who are supposed to be the surrogate audience standin throughout the film the film goes to a screeching halt whenever it cuts back to their storyline the opening half is painful and a chore to get through shahi is undoubtedly a great actor but feels so generic here and sabongui is illsuited to narrate and give plenty of the supposed heartwarming moments the film is also incredibly fastpaced primarily because it knows what the audience wants to see the bombastic action setpieces black adam packs some of the strongest action in dc thus far and some of the visual effects especially one involving doctor fate are astounding to behold i just wish there were scenes interspersed between some of the action to release the tension or give a breather director jaume colletserra orphan jungle cruise wanted to make the dirty harry of the superhero genre most likely referencing the clint eastwood antiheros rogue personality lucky for him dwayne johnson is in the lead and shines with a deadpan and renegade tone its surprising since johnson is most known for his smoldering and excessive charisma but hes more restrained here and its a good thing in the end dc eventually needs to snap from its obsession with antiheroes like come on joker harley quinn suicide squad peacemaker how hard is it to make a good superhero film not about a villain in the meantime johnson fulfills his passion project of disrupting the dc universe by introducing a character that could very well be the focal point of the franchise moving forward 
Jul 20 2023,positive, its safe to say that the whole superhero subgenre that was once filled with awe and excitement has become bloated generic and safe every other property looks washedout devoid of any genuine passion and filled to the brim with a certain kind of humor that really needs a laugh track to let the viewer know that the poorly written characters are cracking a joke and even though the bar for such movies and shows is pretty much undergroundapart from a handful of criticsyou wont see a lot of people complaining about it and demanding the bare minimum instead youll see them pitting critics against fans and defending these billiondollar companies as if they were indie productions on the brink of bankruptcy amidst all this nonsense much like the last dc project the batman black adam feels like a tangible film and not something that has been made in a parking lot and later polished by overworked vfx artists directed by jaume colletserra and written by adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani black adam opens with a long expository sequence about the ruler of kahndaq king ahkton marwan kenzari he wanted to forge a crown made of a mineral called eternium and summon the power of the devils one day a kid revolted against him and almost motivated the people of the country to do the same but he was arrested by the kings guards and sent for execution just when he was about to be killed he was gifted with the power of shazam which he used to destroy king ahkton it has been 5000 years since that day and in the present archaeologist adrianna tomaz sarah shah along with her brother karim mohammed amer and colleagues rami patrick sabongui and ishmael kenzari is trying to locate the tomb in which the crown of sabbac is hidden thats where they awaken the champion preserved in that tomb tethadamblack adam dwayne johnson and as adam begins to wreak havoc the justice society  which is made up of dr fate pierce brosnan hawkman aldis hodge atom smasher noah centineo and cyclone quintessa swindell  drops in to say hello the most surprising thing about black adam is that it is openly political in nature its customary to expect superhero shows to address reallife issues on the level that the boys or watchmen have done but when it comes to movies they either appear surfacelevel or extremely problematic colletserra along with his team of writers establishes the two kinds of tyranny kahndaq has faced one is that of king ahkton who turned his own people into slaves the second is that of the intergang a neoimperialist american organization that is oppressing the people of that country while robbing it of its resources and like many superhero movies they pose the justice society as the token white saviors of this narrative however adam and the people of kahndaq eventually prove that they dont need heroes who arent even from their continent they are much more willing to champion one of their own even if said champions history is a little dicey because hes willing to change for good coming to the overall characterization of black adam in shazam he was painted as a villain the justice society particularly hawkman treats him as a villain and to be fair adams brutality does make him look like a villain but the false laurels on his shoulders amon bodhi sabongui gushing over his awesomeness which serves as a great commentary on the commodification of superheroes in general and the need to liberate the people of kahndaq even though the place is radically different from the kahndaq from adams time force him to change his ways that is some pretty layered stuff thereby making black adam a very interesting character that said it gets buried under the heaping amounts of exposition regarding the possession of the crown of sabbac periodic reminders about how the plot is going to progress and the repetitive exchanges between hawkman and black adam yes all of it is necessary however since its presented in the same way every time sometimes with the same set of words the viewing experience becomes tiring as mentioned in the title black adam compensates for the copious amounts of expository dialogue with copious amounts of action and spectacle dwayne johnsons entry as the titular character is fantastic theres visual comedy it is quite barbaric and most importantly it looks great the yellow tint is a bit much but since its consistent throughout the film and makes the production design costume design set design and the displays of power especially in slow motion pop on the screen i didnt mind it at all overall the cgiheavy fight sequences fare better than the handtohand noncgi battles i am assuming thats the case because the bigger set pieces were heavily previsualized preplanned and werent tinkered with too much as for the rest i think there are two issues the actors relied way too much on their stunt doubles and the fight choreography and action direction didnt take that into consideration thereby leading to the choppy editing the frenetic cuts also plague some of the conversational scenes probably to give them a sense of urgency but that doesnt work and just makes those scenes jarring lorne balfes score is addictive pulpy and gives adam a sense of oomph you know i used to be a huge fan of dwayne johnsons work i have watched and rewatched the scorpion king the rundown walking tall gridiron gang tooth fairy fast five snitch and pain  gain then something happened post san andreas and in an attempt to charm everyone he stopped taking risks a 2019 gq article on how the actor doesnt want to lose a fight onscreen essentially proved the theory that johnson wont accept anything thatll portray him in a negative light so when he took on black adam it seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to look powerful and stray away from the path of blandness he had been on and ill say its a success for the most part johnson plays adam like the t800 arnold schwarzenegger from judgment day complete with a kid sidekick who is teaching him about the ways of the world his hulking body contrasts the hollowness his character feels pretty aptly his chemistry with hodge and brosnanwho are oozing with so much charismais great as for the rest of the cast centineo sarah quintessa bodhi and amer are very endearing and lovable kenzari has no option but to be onenote but since i didnt go in expecting a complex villain i didnt mind it too much all in all black adam is a movie worth watching on the big screen go watch it with your friends and family or on your own just ensure that the projector is working well and the sound is dialed up to eleven and im sure youll have a great time with that out of the way i want to talk about jaume colletserra who has made genredefining horror films like house of wax and orphan although the film flopped and was panned critically ive watched goal ii living the dream at least a dozen times his collaboration with liam neeson has given us unknown the commuter nonstop and run all night the shallows is one of the greatest shark films of all time and it looks like he has entered a phase where hell be collaborating with dwayne johnson but the troubling part of this collaboration is that it isnt allowing my man jaume to truly shine so i genuinely hope that changes and he returns to the kind of movies he does best lowbudget tense cold and actionpacked while taking dwayne along with him
Feb 23 2023,negative, the turbulence that has recently shaken up the success of warner bros discovery has threatened to watch their entertainment empire fall after troubles stack upon one another between the massive changes made with the streaming service hbo max the batgirl cancelation followed by the dc extended universe redirection and the number of controversies that keep the leading cast in warner bros discovery projects has remained to be unfavorable for the studios reputation  the dc extended universe has yet to secure a consistent cinematic universe despite attempts to reapproach the model through different creative perspectives headlined with the comic book publishers most famous names 15 years after its initial announcement black adam reiterates that it isnt time that has taken a toll on the dc extended universe but the lack of consistent quality  black adam knows somewhat what it wants from dwayne johnson as the titular antihero though it feels like its filling its pictureperrate deals with remaining cast members theres a distinct lack of chemistry between the freshlyassembled justice society of america who introduce themselves on a flimsy script theyre deprived of any meaningful substance spitting out oneliners that fail to land  the balance between an effortless sense of cool while yearning for a sense of humor falls completely flat leaving the film to be simply unfunny  the humorless hollow screenplay doesnt exactly know how to handle itself as it wants to grasp the intensity of more dramatic superhero pieces that have proceeded it while tackling the comedic beats that made shazam so successful the overall aimlessness of black adam   feeling lost in its narrative guided by misdirection  warns warner bros discovery and their dc film team that cgied mass destruction is not enough to save an effort to rebuild a brand  accusations against the dc extended universe for misusing its characters have been given a new victim as the superficiality of black adam contradicts any signs of progression for the studio foundationally its a showcase of wonderless ancestral superhero storytelling without much of a story to support itself on it strips itself down to the bareboned and uninspired good vs bad while marketed as an elaborate forthcoming of the dc extended universes next phase black adam primarily displays how dc has built its mainline liveaction universe from the outside in depending on highvolume talent to attach themselves to projects before taking the steps to craft a comprehensive work of fiction theres a great disregard for audience expectations needs or desires by instead offering an expensivelooking excuse for an origin story a villain or primary antagonist has the fluidity to take any form emotional physical mental or metaphorical black adams sabbac barely makes his way into the film whose takedown mirrors a highrendered video game cutscene sabbacs latestage introduction in black adam does not justify the ill timing of his arrival it only strains an alreadythin plot perhaps black adams greatest strength is its postcredits scene which features a thrilling cameo that promises to delight dc fans the grand reveal is credited to johnsons doing and might be his greatest contribution to the dc extended universe yet 410 
Feb 19 2023,positive, comic book movie fans unfortunately soak every big budget adaptation release in a cloak of greatness before they are even released and black adam is no different led by dwayne the rock johnson this unique antihero in the dceu universe is meant to make a quick imprint on the world of superhumans if the legions of comic book mega nerds can allow it to breathe a movie that has been many years in the making takes a big swing with its launch this past weekend and im here to tell you if director jaume colletserra and his largerthanlife star were successful or is this another warner brothersbuilt tower of eyerolling boredom born out of rage johnsons teth adam grew up a slave in kahndaq a fictional country embedded with tyrant rulemaking mercenaries cue the chunky rushed backstory retelling the film begins the film with in this very early setting the mercs ruled over the poor slaves and enlist them in the mines searching for an ancient yet powerful resource called eternium this gives rulers of kahndaq unchecked power and abilities which is where young adam comes into play in a desperate attempt to help his people young adam makes a bold attempt to capture the attention of the gods making a wish of sorts that takes him from feeble young teen to fierce god with the saying of a single word shazam but bigger muscles and unlimited powers can still yield dangerous results for heroes villains and the ones stuck in between like adam sound familiar suffice to say adam has a monstrous grudge brewing beneath the layers of concrete many decades later when a group of locals go looking for a magical crown the search lands them in a dark cave where nothing good happens and what you were looking for becomes something else the locals run into mercs and they all eventually awaken a pissed off adam chaos ensues black adam gets a lot more fun when the backstory finishes and the big fella breaks out to play the justice society well get to them later gets called into play and every bad guy in kahndaq and anywhere close is dispatched to either find the crown or take out adam the interesting thing here is adam isnt playing for the good guys or the bad folks hes a highly dangerous man apart at the outset this unusual dynamic allows audiences to see a different side of johnson who gets to play something other than a pure hero for the first time in a good while this isnt your san andreas and walking tall good hearted dude colletserra aggressively flips the charisma pancake on its side with this iteration of johnson who he has worked with a lot over their respective careers seeing the rock roast a merc all the way down to the bone and mush is exactly what i wanted to see him do in his role break bad go for it and dont halfass the role of a guy who spends the entire movie ruminating on whether or not to save the universe or burn it all down its easily his most complete performance because he has to dip his feet in antagonistic waters while giving off the notion that his antihero hasnt been swallowed full by the dark side you still see johnson doing his thing and making magic out of a oneliner but its a different angle for fans seeing all the hard work he put in and the challenge of taking up a role in a much ridiculed world i tip my cap to him for the effort he has some good support its an equal thrill to see pierce brosnan and aldis hodge step into the world of superheroes as kent dr fate nelson and carter hawkman hall respectively as two of the four opposing forces of the justice society of america tasked with taking down a reckless adam the pair give solid performances that heighten the material and nothing more quintessa swindell and noah centineo put in good work as cyclone and atom smasher the younger members of the team that is easily way cooler than the egoinfested justice league the story may seem like standard procedure but the screenplay does have a few jewels packed within one of them is a riff on gunslingers and spaghetti westerns as adam employs an eastwood trick he watched on television with a band of goons the soundtrack and lorne balfes score keep the energy flowing amid adventures and showdowns but the unkempt pacing keeps the two hour film from feeling too long johnson wanted to reshape the hierarchy in the dceu universe but he really just helped make a highly entertaining and fun movie instead one that doesnt ask too much of its audience delivers the needed hits with aplomb and leaves you wanting more in the end its not a masterpiece but it really didnt have to be if comic book fans can check their ambitions for black adam at the door they can enjoy this rousing flick that doesnt take itself too seriously black adam is not all doom and gloom thankfully its not a dark dread of hollowed stoicism it has a tongue placed firmly in its cheek and a sly sense of humor never allowing the movie to get too light or dark just the right amount of entertainment and humor one thing it does produce is unexpected emotion with its characters which is not always a slam dunk in a comic book take like last years rollicking suicide squad black adam has its own brand of action and fun one that worked very well for mea fella with high expectations due to the rock at the center

Jan 20 2023,negative, warner bros slow tortured mishandling of its dc comics characters continues with jaume colletserras black adam dwayne johnson was confirmed to play the titular antihero all the way back in 2014 having circled the property since late 2006 and the confused and inconsistent mess that has emerged is typical of an overdeveloped production maybe there was a coherent film being developed at some point but those days are long gone black adam reeks with the stench of too many executives pissing in the punch to make it taste better for too many years 5000 years after he was granted the powers of the gods tethadam johnson is resurrected in modernday kahndaq  a middleeastern state controlled by the criminal organisation intergang his arrival is met by the justice society  dr fate pierce brosnan hawkman aldis hodge cyclone quintessa swindell and atom smasher noah centineo  who have arrived to capture adam and prevent him from threatening the world as a lifelong fan of dc comics it was a joy to see hawkman and dr fate in a bigbudget feature film both characters were well realised and solidly performed by hodge and brosnan it is worth getting that praise out of the way upfront because there is nothing else in the film to recommend the screenplay is generic and lazy plotted to hit action sequences rather than to tell an interesting story it has a poor handle on its title character who originated as a villain for captain marvel aka shazam but who is very tenuously linked to that heros movie adaptation it makes a superficial effort to make some sort of political statement about how superheroes tend to fight giant robots and psychic alien starfish when they could be liberating oppressed developing nations from criminal regimes  but fails to understand that acknowledging this problem tends to make superhero narratives collapse on top of that it does not to engage with the issue even after it has raised it  the occupying intergang regime is effectively ignored once computergenerated demon arrives on the scene there is also the issue of making a superhero protagonist an arabic man  which is in itself a bold laudable move  but then casting a hawaiian in the role it honestly does not quite know what to do with black adam himself he is a powerful ancient being when the script remembers that he is at other times generally random ones he may as well be from 21st century los angeles within 20 minutes he is practising catch phrases with his young human sidekick adam is presented as an amoral and violent figure and it is certainly impressed on the audience that he must be stopped but then his story is also packed with comedic bits about accidentally murdering criminals and henchmen johnsons flat performance does not help he just feels like the rock wrestling superstar wearing a superhero outfit once again it just seems lazy so do the computergenerated effects that are overused to the point of stupidity they give everything a weirdly fake sheen it all seems entirely artificial and therefore dramatically meaningless lorne balfes musical score ticks the standard boxes of the effectsdriven blockbuster although he appears to have unintentionally duplicated ron grainers theme to the prisoner a 1967 tv series in the process an early action sequences misuses the rolling stones paint it black in a stupefying manner the dceu is in sorry shape following years of indecision poor story choices and a relentless obsession with grim gritty takes on the most frivolous of heroes producers james gunn and peter safran were recently hired to reboot and rework the entire extended franchise and goodness knows the characters need it this film  situated partway between a vanity project and a stealth bid to rework dc  is definitely not the way to do it
Jan 14 2023,negative, black adam 2022 while dc might have produced the best superhero saga of 2022 with the batman take that marvel it was also responsible for the worst with black adam take that dc dwayne johnson plays the titular character a godlike figure who is awakened from his 5000year slumber and finds himself in the modern world since his demeanor and destructive ways make him appear to be a villain rather than a hero the members of the justice society including hawkman aldis hodge and doctor fate pierce brosnan are determined to bring him down there was chatter that thanks largely to an antihero at its center this 11th entry in the dceu dc extended universe was going to mark a departure and possibly a new direction for the franchise but wheres the evidence black adam is as boring as man of steel as overstuffed as justice league both cuts as visually clunky as aquaman and almost as stupid as suicide squad it feels much longer than its 125 minutes and it manages what i previously believed to be impossible it takes the perennially appealing dwayne johnson and strips him of all charisma and personality transforming him from a dynamic screen presence into a celluloid eunuch extras in the 4k uhd  bluray  digital code edition include pieces on the histories of black adam and the justice society featurettes focusing on the visual effects sets and costume designs and a look at the character of black adam the dunwich horror 1970 this adaptation of the hp lovecraft story proves to be a great disappointment its reputation as a minor cult item notwithstanding in the

washington post film critic desson howe wrote groundhog day will never be designated a national film treasure by the library of congress but in terms of vehicle selection this is one of the better ones bill murray has hitched himself to indeed while critical response was positive and box office was fairly strong 70 million nothing suggested that this comedy from writerdirector harold ramis and coscripter danny rubin would gather steam over time and emerge as one of the most respected comedies of the past 30 years yet at the end of the 1990s the movie found itself on several critics lists of the best films of the decade and despite howes understandable assertion to the contrary the library of congress national film preservation board did add the picture to its prestigious national film registry in 2006 murray is once again cast in the sort of role at which he excels the lewd selfcentered lout hes phil connors a tv weatherman who inexplicably finds himself living the same day over and over again trapped in a small town during its groundhog day celebration the film offers some cosmic ruminations beneath its comic exterior and murray and andie macdowell rarely so relaxed on film make a surprisingly compatible screen couple highlander 1986 critically dismissed upon its initial release and failing to recoup its production costs highlander found renewed life in the homevideo market resulting in a series of limp sequels a popular tv series and guaranteed cult status christopher lambert plays connor macleod a 16th century scottish warrior who learns hes immortal and can only be killed by having his head lopped off he survives through the centuries receiving early tutoring from a garrulous immortal sean connery and repeatedly butting heads with the most vicious of all immortals clancy brown its easy to see why many love this picture great premise fine action scenes a score by queen a charismatic connery but just as easy to see why many despise it chintzy production values stonefaced lambert ludicrous supporting characters thudding dialogue the 4k uhd edition contains the directors cut that runs approximately five minutes longer than the theatrical version extras include audio commentary by director russell mulcahy a makingof featurette deleted scenes interviews with mulcahy lambert and brown and a piece on the soundtrack missing in action trilogy 19841988 for those so inclined heres a new box set containing all three vietnam war yarns produced by cannon films and starring chuck missing in acting norris missing in action 1984 seems like such a blatant ripoff of rambo first blood part ii that its easy to forget that the norris vehicle actually came first but its also easy to overlook the fact that missing in action was inspired by the rambo script that had been making the rounds and it was indeed hustled into production and into theaters in an effort to beat the stallone starrer which kicked off the summer of 1985 not surprisingly both films are of equal value mindless mediocrities in which one lone american soldier returns to vietnam years after the war in an effort to rescue the pows still being held captive in mia its colonel james braddock who had himself escaped from one of these illicit camps and now seeks to expose the vietnamese governments coverup by producing more illegally detained prisoners norris devotees rank this one highly others might not be as charitable the following year found norris headlining one of his better pictures  unfortunately for missing in action 2 the beginning 1985 that would be code of silence the second mia flick is actually the first in a chronological sense a prequel illustrating the events that transpired while braddock was still a pow and how he subsequently managed his great escape while still falling squarely in the average category i do prefer this one by a smidgen over its predecessor due to norris being supported by actual characters among the pows and not just cardboard standups and while all the vietnamese villains in this trilogy are onenote caricatures soontek oh makes his memorably sadistic plus ya gotta love the chuck norris memeworthy scene in which a rat employed for torture gets tortured itself by our hero showing no shame norris and cannon films blatantly copied rambo first blood part ii by giving the third film a similarly styled title with braddock missing in action iii 1988  yes they even shifted from the numerical 2 to the roman iii to make the steal complete yet the end result is so wretched it makes the stallone flick look as accomplished as the bridge on the river kwai by comparison cowritten by chucky and directed by his brother aaron the frank to his sylvester this one finds americas greatest export returning to vietnam to rescue the wife miki kim he didnt realize was still alive and the son roland harrah iii he didnt know he had sired chuck norris movies generally werent kind to female characters or black characters for that matter  the death of the most sympathetic and most brutalized person is a tasteless sequence that stands out in the midst of all this juvenile jingoism but the whole movie operates at a junky level hilariously the primary villain aki aleong seemingly screams braddock even more often than the skipper bellowed gilligan over the threeseason run of gilligans island and ricky howled lucy over i love lucys six seasons each movie in this bluray box set includes audio commentary director joseph zito on the first director lance hool on the second and film historians on the third and the theatrical trailer the original mia also offers an interview with scripter james bruner wargames 1983 the summer of 83 provided director john badham a couple of opportunities to score as he had two highprofile films opening within three weeks of each other blue thunder earned only moderately good reviews and a middling box office take of 42 million a shame as its quite entertaining but wargames opened to rave reviews and enjoyed a robust 79 million gross matthew broderick in only his second movie in only his first year in film stars as a teenage computer hacker who believes hes playing a game called global thermonuclear war when in actuality he has tapped into the us department of defense and is about to inadvertently start world war iii wargames was a relevant picture not only in the manner in which it largely introduced the bold new world of computers to the masses but also because it led to politicians drafting legislation inspired by its cautionary warnings its a clever if occasionally farfetched adventurethriller buoyed by winning turns from broderick and fellow newbie ally sheedy one of the top grossing films of 1983  it was 5 for the year just under the eddie murphy comedy trading places and just above the 007 entry octopussy  it grabbed oscar nominations for best original screenplay lawrence lasker and walter f parkes best cinematography and best sound warning shot 1967 david janssens greatest claim to fame was playing dr richard kimble in the hit tv series the fugitive 19631967 its therefore amusing that warning shot a movie he made while still active with the show was promoted with the tagline the shot that made him a fugitive here he plays tom valens an la cop forced to fatally shoot a man in selfdefense the stranger turns out to be a highly respected doctor and philanthropist and even more damning no gun is found on the scene valens is therefore brought up on manslaughter charges meaning he has to locate and thereby prove the existence of said revolver like 1964s the killers aka ronald reagans final film warning shot was made for television one telltale sign being that the production company bob banner associates worked exclusively on boobtube fare but was instead released theatrically due to its violence its great fun in any medium with a mystery that only grows too obvious in the second half adding to the merriment  and the tv land roots  is the army of guest stars who appear throughout all about eve oscar winner george sanders silentscreen legend lilian gish ed begley see also the dunwich horror above joan collins a

Jan 2 2023,negative, if theres one thing you have to admire about the filmmakers at dc studios its the persistence to keep going despite a rather dreadful track record they press on in the hopes of being able to churn out something with the same quality as shazam or better yet the suicide squad and with james gunn now in cocommand hopefully thats exactly what will happen as if a good dc superhero film wasnt already difficult enough to develop the filmmakers behind black adam their latest outing decided to make it even harder by casting dwayne johnson in the lead will their persistence be nearly enough to stop dcs latest endeavor from being yet another disaster to add to the list teth adam immediately comes to the attention of amanda waller viola davis who dispatches the justice society dr fate pierce brosnan hawkman aldis hodge cyclone quintessa swindell and atom smasher noah centineo to bring him in an epic battle ensues but a new enemy is soon revealed one who wants to obtain the crown and literally release hell on earth forcing an unlikely alliance in an effort to stop this from happening when it comes to black adam there really isnt any beating around the bush its your very typical standard dc outing that seems to have had very little thought put into any of its most important elements you have a plethora of characters that are remarkably unengaging and sadly underdeveloped all trapped within a cliched plot that features absolutely nothing that we havent already seen before in the multitude of other superhero movies and so with no threedimensional characters to connect with and a story whose plotpoints anyone could lay out in their entirety in the first 30 minutes of the film you can begin to imagine what the experience of sitting through it is like that said the film has yet another major issue that while it may not be as detrimental as the films weak plot  characters still hinders it in a very significant fashion typically when you go to see a dwayne johnson film you already know in advance that the aforementioned elements wont exactly be topnotch but even so you can usually count on johnson being his usual self that is to say he tends to be a very charismatic actor whos rather fun to watch even if the film hes in is falling apart all around him so as to how anyone at dc thought it was a good idea to take him completely drain him of all that charisma and let him sleepwalk through a major film like this is one of those inexplicable questions that will likely never receive an answer suffice it to say that it was indeed one of the absolute worst ideas anyone could have proposed and carried out for featuring an emotionless dwayne johnson only serves to further diminish what little excitement the film has by the end we find that the film has had very little to offer in the way of entertainment value making the supposed 15year journey to bring this to the screen appear to be in vain one would think that if it really did take that long to develop then a lot more serious consideration would have gone into its most vital components there wouldve been an exciting story to get swept up in and intriguing characters to root for instead of a cacophonous mess that aims for the bare minimum in both departments black adam couldve been a fun thrilling experience if the filmmakers had cared enough to put the effort in where it counts but unfortunately they did not leaving us with yet another dc comic book outing that evaporates the second its over black adam arrives on bluray in a 2391 1080p high definition transfer of excellent quality the image is sharp and clear throughout the entire twohour runtime highlighting the films extensive visual effects work and designs likewise the dolby atmostruehd audio track is very solid giving you all of the dialogue sound effects and score in outstanding quality overall like most warner bros releases there are no complaints to be had in either area the plentiful extras include ten featurettes totaling a little over an hour focusing on various behind the scenes aspects of the film such as the characters costumes setting and action sequences  with its uninspired narrative paperthin characters and an uncharacteristically uncharismatic dwayne johnson black adam merely presents yet another dc dud that fails to excite entertain or even remotely engage
Jan 2 2023,neutral, the state of the dc extended universe dceu is hard to pin down because every few months something else shifts each release thus far has its supporters and its detractors but the one consistent thing is that the fans are hungry to see dc comics characters on the big screen in a recreation of tales that only jumped off the page in our imagination between the business and personal issues the separation within the fandom and the will theywont they appear again nature of the original zack snyderhired cast its difficult for anyone to get particularly excited about any new dceu project but then the first trailer for black adam the dwayne johnsonled project with aldis hodge leverage pierce bronson goldeneye and sarah shahi life in supporting roles and things looked like they were going to change the audience was going to be given a project with a lead who takes no prisoners suffers no fools and essentially poses the greatest threat to earth since the arrival of steppenwolf voiced by ciarán hinds in 2017s justice league or 2021s zack snyders justice league unfortunately what the audience receives is so bythenumbers that even the most diehard superhero fan will struggle to find a reason to view the film more than once in the country of kahndaq criminal organization intergang runs everything that comes in and out making as much money as they can in their quest to harvest a mineral known as eternium trying to combat intergang and what she fears is their real motivation for mining kahndag is former university professor adrianna tomaz sarah shahi who along with her brother karim mohammed amer and son amon bodhi sabongui stumbles onto a discovery that possesses the power to change the hierarchy of power not only in kahndaq but in the entire world she awakens legendary hero black adam dwayne johnson lr sarah shahi as adrianna and mohammed amer as karim in new line cinemas action adventure black adam a warner bros pictures release  2022 warner bros entertainment inc all rights reserved writing reviews especially for home releases when the film has been out for a while its nearly impossible to have your perception of the film not be influenced even minimally while all reviewers possess their own subjective view having knowledge of how a film has been performing and how that film has been received by audiences and other film critics will to some degree shape your consideration of it black adam is a great example because when a film like this is hyped so profusely prior to release and then not only flounders but basically gets cutoff at the knees due to a combination of audience response and an overhaul in division management at the studio its impossible to experience the film without all of that context thus it would be irresponsible to examine the film without this context to some degree as someone who grew up on dc comics the prospect of seeing any character hero or villain grace the screen small or large is an absolute treat unfortunately the runup to the dwayne johnsonled black adam was marred before it even hit production thanks to the bungling of warner bros pictures in their handling of first the dc extended universe and then second the sale to moneycentric ceo david zaslav who has undermined the creative side of wb pictures since taking the reins considering johnsons magnetism on screen and his seemingly unstoppable enthusiasm for the project black adam seemed destined to do as the former wwe star said and change the hierarchy of power in the dceu sadly the jaume colletserradirected jungle cruise superhero tale doesnt set anything alight let alone create an ember from which a flame could arise the film merely exists feeling like a throwback to the cape films of the 1990s when logic was little and jokes aplenty while this works in films like venom let there be carnage 2021 it all but diminishes what should be a powerful exploration of power who has it vs who wants it what it means to wield that power and the cost that comes with it that seems to be the film black adam aspires to be when one looks at the ideas within yet its so intent on creating literal blockbusting action sequences that all of the good stuff gets lost in the rubble lets look at two examples from the script by adam sztykiel scoob rory haines the mauritanian and sohrab noshirvani the mauritanian in terms of solid ideas left to fall by the wayside and interesting ideas that are uninspired in their execution the first comes in the form of adriannas necklace briefly mentioned when we meet her and karim and noted as being a family heirloom this necklace is seen in the flashbacks as being worn by teth adams wife creating the implication that the newly awakened powerhouse and the woman who freed him are related the script seeks to create pathos through the notion that teth failed his family his son specifically so with adrianna and her family comes an opportunity to make amends maybe its something that was to be explored in a followup but with the hiring of james gunn and peter safran to reframe the dceu moving forward combined with the lackluster public response to black adam its less likely that a sequel will happen anytime soon if at all the problem then is that the script as it exists decides to ignore this familial connection in favor of instead using a more fishoutofwater approach where amon guides teth through the modern world teaching him about jokes catchphrases and all the things the man from over 5000 years ago may not know teth doesnt really take to the boy until well into the film the script working super hard to sell the audience on the mystery of teth and the legend of him as the hero of kahndaq by shunting this small detail the film couldve shortcut a lot of the struggle to get teth to trust adrianna to bond with amon and allow the script to focus more on the sabbac storyline that moreorless feels like an excuse to get teth to teamup with hodgess hawkman and the justice society rather than to have an actual fight over what it means to be a hero and the ethics involved in that its an opportunity squandered likely made because the creators think they are giving the audience what it wants bombast when what they really want is a reason to be invested sabbac is the interesting idea that succumbs to the protagonist cape must fight inversed version of themselves to win the day trope venom fights riot constructed inuniverse to be stronger and bigger than venom kalel fights zod batman fights the riddler or joker and the flash goes up against zoom to this end teth should actually fight shazam or captain marvel iykyk which is mentioned in the bonus features as the original idea but that was scrapped in favor of giving teth his own film first as a result shazam fought doctor sivana who was portrayed as just a ruined version of billy batson and teth adam was put up against both the justice society and sabbac one with the opposing ethical code and the other the strength the match him in the comics sabbac has taken the form in different people each one imbued with powers that are fueled by hell demons that give the individual abilities to rival shazam in the script both king ahkton of the past and ishmael of the present both played by marwan kenzari seek out a mineral to create a crown which will grant the wearer the powers of sabbac first far as my research shows there is no eternium and the use of it here reeks of how adamantium was used in xmen origins wolverine 2009 as a means to erase logans memory its simplistic unimaginative and serves as little more than a shortcut rather than taking inspiration from the decades of comics that precede the film the film couldve taken the stance that power granted by wizards is little more than a shortcut negating any victory or that this kind of power however given corrupts the bearer yet it refuses to do any kind of interrogation at all it dances around it as hawkman and teth argue it hints at it as hawkman finds himself getting yelled at by the people of kahndaq who see him as just another outsider imposing his views on them and it suggests it when the reveal comes that teth was never the intended champion of the wizards of the rock of eternity and is therefore a false idol himself the film is dripping with possibilities that would have made for both engaging entertainment and philosophy but instead we get lots of slomo racist cinematography whys everything blown out to look yelloworange in khandaq and plenty of punchypunchy smashysmashy lr aldis hodge as carter hallhawkman and and marwan kenzari as sabbac in new line cinemas action adventure black adam a warner bros pictures release photo courtesy warner bros pictures perhaps the saddest thing about the home release and this is where the bittersweetness comes in strong is not just the number of ondisc materials and details but the way they are approached for instance sarah shadi actually hosts the history of black adam featurette and aldis hodge hosts who is the justice society each one given the production value and energy from the host that implies a certain expectation that this wasnt going to be a oner with each accompanying featurette the home viewing audience is reminded of the great work that went into the film on screen and off and how well be lucky if we get to see any one from this film onscreen in some capacity again there are no deleted scenes or gag reels the latter being a proper bummer as the featurettes indicate that this crew had a blast making the film but with nearly two hours of bonus materials covering everything from character history to costume design to production design for those who either enjoyed the adventure or just love to know more about filmmaking theres plenty to make one happy about the purchase earlier in this writeup i mentioned that its difficult for a reviewer who comes to a film late not to notice what happens around a film i think its also important to note that a reviewer should also only review the film in front of them not the one they wanted the issue here is that the script sets up a great deal that it refuses to pay off on and utilizes shortcuts that benefit no one but the characters this results in a lack of general investment or interest everything falling to who the audience is told to root for versus who they come to believe in now im a longtime fan of johnsons and will belly up to the table when he signs onto a project hes got chops and charisma and this role is a natural fit for him its an absolute shame that the film around him didnt utilize him to its fullest because black adam can be a meaty and complex role for an actor willing to walk the line its a shame that we may never see what comes next because in a sequel maybe hed feel free enough to go for broke well this is just disappointing i was really looking forward to bavs but gunn seems to have no interest in making that film black adam could have been pulled into the shazam universe so much they could do sigh with the poor management of the connected universe thus far the total clean sweep of material isnt too surprising especially for things that have not hit strongly with audiences thats why im not shocked that the suicide squad and peacemaker are rumored to be sticking around as those did well whereas most of the rest have not plus add in no patty jenkins for ww3 its less likely that gadot would stick around  personally i think too much blame is going on gunn and saffron and not enough on wb management they are just hired guns coming in to play with toys im just bitter they are getting rid of cavill and for the love of sanity keeping ezra miller that makes no sense to me keep the man who is adored by fans and just drop the guy with federal charges against him  can appreciate the frustration between the complications that arose during the filming and reception of justice league plus covid and the wb buy cavill got the short stick on a lot of things  got nothing to explain standing by the flash of all the things to scrap that would be the project given whats going on with miller 
Dec 29 2022,negative,its a slog to sit through a painfully dull and lackluster superhero movie that can never decide if its titular character is a superhero or a villain in the making

Dec 22 2022,negative, a wise dc comics character once noted you either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain in the case of the dceu no one quite fits this bill as aptly as dwayne the rock johnson once described as franchise viagra weve entered an odd place for the action star his movies are doing fine at the box office and his foray into the superhero world is no different spinning out of the shazam corner of dc black adam sought to bring new life to the universe however we are now less than 24 hours after johnson posted an instagram message indicating he will leave the franchise confronting what does not work about black adam is sadly an easy task and it begins with its star  for those who missed black adam the plot revolves around an ancient man fighting for freedom against those who enslave him as the powerful king is about to crown himself with a weapon known as the crown of sabbac tethadam johnson defeats his wouldbe slavers however because he lashed out with his powers a council of wizards traps adam in a tomb fast forward several millennia and adrianna tomaz sarah shahi an archeologist stumbles upon the resting place of the crown of sabbac when mercenaries attempt to obtain the crown adrianna accidentally awakens tethadam the stir causes the justice society led by hawkman aldis hodge and dr fate pierce brosnan to intervene before adam becomes unstoppable  johnson physically fits the part and that has never been the problem facing the movie star instead johnson has simply lost the sheen that allowed him to thrive as a star every aspect of black adam comes across as a vanity project instead of the film hes longed to make nothing about adam is approaching normalcy in fact he is so absurdly overpowered it is impossible to stop him even for a group of heroes with a varied skillset this all might work if johnson was playing a character audience were familiar with before the film  however adam is anything but mainstream despite some recent comics focused on black adam he has largely been an antagonist for shazam instead audiences are getting their first exposure to his godlike power with no stakes or antagonists that will even make him sweat this is not someone we inherently feel sorry for or have sympathy for instead black adam attempts to create a big twist which fails horribly in its execution whats worse is black adams unwillingness to let anyone besides johnson take center stage much of the action revolves around his t2 inspired story where a young boy teaches adam the difference between doing the right thing versus the wrong thing hodge and brosnan show their own star qualities but are almost entirely subserviant to johnson throughout the film when they are not literally bending over backwards to take his oneliners they are often relegated to the background  the visual styling of black adam does little to make the film a fun experience weve seen dozens of cg battles over the past year and many have evolved to show more than a man simply punching those who come up against him yet black adams stunt work and cg effects do little to bring the audience into the story director jaume collettserra seems to be stuck in blockbuster jail following johnson from project to project however these cg environments lack any tactility and thus lack any staying power its a shame to see a talented director lose what made him special working on films like the shallows  worse johnson lost his ability to play selfdepricating humor a long time ago if anything this is the ultimate step in his selfserious phase even when other characters try to lighten the mood he simply smolders at the camera and angrily asks for things to go his way this is thor without the humbling because black adam simply cuts through enemies like theyre butter without any challenges we cannot feel for johnsons depiction of the character  however this is not an issue exclusive to this film or this franchise johnson has turned into a something of an unbeatable force in every film the man once known to play into the joke as recently as pain  gain or fast five has turned that side off he fashions himself a comedian but rarely hits the jokes and oneliners the collaborations with kevin hart often involve hart debasing himself to further show johnsons size theres no vulnerability on screen anymore from johnson and as a result his career feels micromanaged to death  without critical support or audience support johnson will approach a crossroads he can continue to make blockbusters in his sleep and they will continue to feel like empty calories theres a reason that san andreas skyscraper and rampage have almost no cultural footprint however if johnson lets go of his ego he could still reverse course working with genuine auteur filmmakers or at least directors who will challenge him will extend his career for decades however if all johnson seeks is his quota and his power he may find himself struggling to make even middling crime films in the next two decades 
Dec 2 2022,positive, thanksgiving weekend is when the majority of fyc for your consideration screeners hit my inbox and mailbox so the rest of this years newsletters should be jampacked and since substack wont stop warning me that ive gone over the email limit for mirroring the below into your inbox i apologize for the length im working under the assumption one very long newsletter a week is better than multiple shorter ones clogging your notifications im more or less trying to hit titles in the order of their relevance to the current date whether it be that theyre hitting theaters becoming available online etc that means pushing women talking back a couple weeks to hit black adam instead for better or worse i figure i should talk about the ones everyone can see now before the ones you cant i may sprinkle some in anyway though as im anxious to finally watch many of those i missed at tiff ive never been a huge star wars guy the original films were part of my childhood and i enjoyed the spectacle of seeing them on the big screen upon rerelease as well as attending the prequels but disneys purchase for expanded universe ip earned little more than a shrug why because it was all the same skywalkers threatening and saving the galaxy wed seen it all before thats why rogue one left a mark was it as good as the franchises best empire strikes back maybe maybe not it felt fresh either way standalone in its action if not its mythology it was a film dressed with the star wars aesthetic rather than one more example proving star wars is solely synonymous with characters born from george lucas a new hope so its no surprise fans dislike andor and say its not star wars and its no surprise its also the best thing to come from the series in forty years credit tony gilroy and company for truly seeing what star wars was always about not the force but the struggle the struggle for freedom from oppression the war for justice and equality while we championed heroes who arrived at the eleventh hour to wave their hands the machine of rebellion turned and provided them the opportunity to become legends years before their arrival thats where the real drama is the boots on the ground espionage setting the stage and if rogue one whet that appetite andor gives it room to breathe it shows us how a thief can be radicalized into becoming a hero without magic or pedigree the people no matter their origins will rise give us the gray area of good with stellan skarsgårds luthen damning his soul and sacrificing his allies to advance the mission give us the ambition of evil through denise goughs pragmatic opportunist meero and kyle sollers impulsive opportunist syril add sage wisdom fiona shaw is a scenestealer as always gravitas andy serkis supplies a wonderful arc and tenacity genevieve oreilly and faye marsay might be my favorite characters of the whole as unlikely rebels and there arise subplots and layers to this complex web that allow it to enthrall no matter who leads an individual scene episode or the show itself for his part diego lunas cassian ultimately holds it together hes the catalyst intentionally or not he proves that the fight is always ours rather than theirs because it will arrive at our doorstep regardless of how far away it seemed beforehand every marvelous bit part kathryn hunters delightful turn as syrils mother is a showstopper augments the heavy pointofnoreturn atmosphere that a broken society builds until cassian has no choice but to open his eyes to the truth his participation was inevitable i did my best to go in blind with zach creggers barbarian and for the most part i succeeded besides knowing justin long was in it which is something to know considering the first fortytwo minutes of its onehourandfortytwo minute runtime end before hes seen singing along to the radio in a red convertible i sat back and waited for the chaos because it is chaos maybe not as crazy as i was led to believe but definitely full of outofleftfield twists and turns it needs them too considering everything starts rather generically as tess georgina campbell and keith bill skarsgård discover the owner of their airbnb doublebooked them is one of them a killer is there something else in the house has this whole ordeal been orchestrated by an outside party familiar questions with seemingly familiar answers until morning breaks i dont want to say too much but tess exiting the property in the light of day brings just the first jarring revelation cregger is very interested in playing with our preconceptions and shielding details from view long enough to throw them in our face with a sharp cut but even that isnt the half of itnot when you still have a monster matthew patrick davis overtaxed detroit police and misogyny to contend with delivering the latters messaging with comedy proves somewhat offputting but it does also help to keep us offbalance does the whole ultimately end up being just another overthetop horror film yes i was hoping for something fresh rather than freshly disturbing but i cant argue i wasnt entertained pick a messed up topic take it to its most messed up extremes and drop an innocent in the middle to see what happens the formula brings nothing new to the table but the packaging does enough to make you think it has oh and it will never not be funny that i had to go to disneys press site to get the above still thats what happens when you build a monopoly i guess ill never really get the hate for dc films theyre objectively not great and almost without exception worse than most marvel cinematic universe fare but theyre also fun you know like how comic books are fun so if youre going to drag a movie like black adam for no other reason than its not citizen kane you better drag every mcu installment too be consistent gatekeepy but consistent thats not to say dwayne johnsons antiheros origin tale doesnt have its issues how could it not when the studio didnt even want to give the character a standalone until he demanded it from them so rather than debut in shazam the ip sat on the shelf zach snyders dourverse ended james gunns irreverence was introduced and black adam was born in the middle if anything it should have been an unmitigated disaster i assumed it would be that by the word of mouth id heard i assumed theyd be milking the whole is he a hero or villain thing until the justice society became the real bad guys but that wasnt the case they let the conflict be teth adams alone which path would he choose hawkman dr fate and company were merely there to keep him in check so the people of kahndaq could help him decide jaume colletserra was there to provide a steadying hand like he has during an underrated career of memorable bmovie diversions the rock is really good in the filmthe straightmanoutoftime opposite everyone elses knowitalls aldis hodge and pierce brosnan lend legitimacy noah centineo and quintessa swindell lend comic relief and sarah shahi and bodhi sabongui lend heart add mohammed amers perfectly timed gags and its difficult not to sit back and enjoy the ride because it never tries to be more than it is the origin tale of a superentity that toes the line not because he might be evil because good isnt always enough to defeat evil alone never eat an eater thats the advice sullythe creepy talks about himself in the third person wannabe mentor played with panache by mark rylancegives eighteenyearold maren upon smelling her from miles away she had always thought she was the only one who craved human flesh the only biological cannibal who simply could not control her urges sullys fateful appearance proves otherwise preparing her for a comingofage adventure unfit for happy endings based on camille deangelis acclaimed novel bones and all follows taylor russells maren on a crosscountry journey to find the mother who left before she could remember now that her father andré holland has followed suit unable to keep protecting her when she slips and unable to turn her into the police this teen has nowhere to go but back to the beginning to try and figure out how to move forward luca guadagninos film adapted by frequent collaborator david kajganich works best when it focuses on that quest strip away the highconcept horror conceit and this is a poignant search for identity unfortunately however that conceit is also the draw and thus requires to be taken with the utmost earnestness to the point where its practically screaming monsters deserve love too i get it its as much a part of this template as anything else but that doesnt mean it doesnt feel goofy the moment maren finds that love with timothée chalamets lee both leads are very good rylance steals the show with his own fight for love and the destructive nature of being without for too long and michael stuhlbarg chloë sevigny and yes director david gordon green lend some unforgettable cameos the gore is subdued with most violence offscreen after the first couple bites or knife slashes until the climax which proves much bloodier and the romances heart is surprisingly pure i just wish i didnt constantly have to wonder if every other scene wouldnt have been better as straight farce leave it to vince vaughn to take the wellworn tropes of your usual hallmark christmas movie and drag them through the sexcrazed innuendo of a horny teenager growing up in the 1990s christmas with the campbells cowritten and produced by the actor is pretty much exactly that brittany snows jesse dodges a bullet when alex moffats shawn breaks up with her days before the holiday to help facilitate a new opportunity for bigger and better in nyc but his parents julia duffy and george wendt decide to invite her to their quaint little town to celebrate anyway because they consider her part of the family she meets their rugged nephew david justin long speaking in hokum metaphors elaine benes would have written for the j peterman catalog and starts falling in love just when shawn suddenly appears unannounced it plays out exactly how youd think complete with joanna garcia swishers becky diverting both mens eyes with her tasty treats jesse gets to hear everyone air their dirty sex laundry duffy and wendt are forced to say purple drank lean and sizzurp unironically in the same sequence when not talking about their overactive libidoes and were reminded how some people will never understand that comedic trends evolve its not easy to tell stories centering a relationship between a black man and a white man wherein the former is constantly having to teach the latter how not to fly so far beyond antiracism that he starts adopting the role of white savior as an identity trait its difficult because such depictions cant help but come off as pandering no matter how earnest the delivery or true to life the events that director jd dillard and stars jonathan majors and glen powell are able to allow devotion to speak from the heart despite this reality says volumes majors plays jesse l brown the first black aviator to complete the us navys basic flight training programan extraordinary feat considering the gauntlet of raciallymotivated challenges his character describes throughout the film powell plays his wingman tom hudner a lieutenant transferring into his squadron shortly before they are deployed for real action none of them have been to the show before too young to fight in wwii they wondered if theyd ever do more than drills and exercises when the korean war begins they prove up to the task while the firefights are obviously a draw in a blockbuster such as this devotion is never better than when it dials things back to portray the dynamics behind the scenes whether an impromptu invite to a party at the behest of elizabeth taylor or small moments such as jesse discovering his impact with old acquaintances joseph cross alabama ward or the black navalmen on his aircraft carrier who see him as a hero in the sky majors shows off his expansive range alongside a never better powell the drama can get pretty heavyhanded and expose just how sanitized and corny hollywood productions are compared to grittier indies but the emotional impact at its back is undeniable ryan whites good night oppy is a cute look back at the lifespan of rovers spirit and opportunity from the initial planning phase ten years of nasa declining steve squyres proposals only to have them finally accept when piggybacking onto another mission to two years of construction and logistical problem solving to their extended period of life on mars the planned 90 days reaching over 5000 it displays the feat of ingenuity and imagination mankind possesses the cgi reenactments were a bit uninspiring to me at first but the film eventually better late than never starts using sequences where the picture is built by the black and white images opportunity took before seamlessly transitioning to the color industrial light and magic footage they werent therefore just arbitrary animated sequences they were grounded in the data to approximate what the robot experienced the whole is informative and easy to follow the subjects mention how the adventure of it all was crucial to giving nasa a way to attract new generations without getting bogged down by the science the structure is conventional yet smooth and the bits where those involved in the project humanize the machines and compare them to their own lives and family members are touching someone has finally made a pandemic film that both taps into the universal fear of the moment and the unshakeable sense of futility felt by those of us who have yet to accept the lie that its over andy mittons the harbinger wields covid as a literal and figurative foe his characters are living through quarantine and doing everything they can to ensure their bodies remain free of the virus physically but their minds are also being infiltrated by a different invisible danger its so simple and yet so profound our collective wish to not be forgotten thats what has emily davis mavis so shaken enough that she calls her old college roommate gabby beans monique for help when it seems her fate has already been sealed because in many respects it has the instant our government decided that the economy was more important than human lives was the instant we forgot all those who had already been killed while also ignoring all those that still are if their absence wasnt enough to take notice they might as well have never existed at all thats what the titular antagonist here strives to make happen he enters mavis and moniques minds to hijack their dreams until the nightmare outside and the nightmare inside can no longer be separated it leads to some wellorchestrated scenes of terror and despair since even the bright spots of hope can be rendered as nothing but red herrings meant to sink his claws deeper we want to believe there are some people we simply cannot forget but a quick glimpse around my local grocery store to see no one wearing a mask proves the opposite davis is great as the catalysther fear palpable enough to transfer the idea of this monster to her old friend and beans carries the film with a strength of resolve built upon crucial yet organic exposition thats able to show why she can be the one to finally take him down except of course that nobody is immune tell someone everything is okay and theyll breathe a sigh of relief right up until the moment they realize it never actually was by then its too late the dash makes all the difference its a great line that epitomizes geeta gandbhir and sam pollards documentary lowndes county and the road to black power because of what that place meant both to the freedom march from selma to montgomery in 1965 and the civil rights movement itself right there in the middle was bloody lowndesa place that was 80 black with 0 registered black voters it was the dash between cities and ground zero for the evolution of a nationwide struggle for racial equality using fantastic archival footage so good that the filmmakers make a point to single out jack willis by name before the end credits to give thanks a ton of new interviews with people who were there on the ground in the 60s and informative context from historians the story of how this county came together to fight for its own justice enthralls from the first scene these are proud people who realized the ego of socalled outside leaders wasnt going to be enough as ella baker said strong people dont need strong leaders theres a propulsive energy to the whole with plenty of smiles and laughs in the recounting of stories about stokely carmichael his sncc helped organize and bolster the fight already being waged in lowndes or the realization that tilting the scales meant running for office as well as voting for it between the origin of the black panther logo in response to the national democrats of alabama having a white rooster with the words white supremacy for the right and the firsthand accounts of just what lowndes was up against the film enriches that which we know in generic terms with the specificity only livedin experience can provide that dry humor keeps us invested while also lulling us to sleep before genial smiles inevitably turn into coldblooded smirks and it culminates with a finale as satisfyingly cathartic as it is diabolically openended thanks to günthers unyielding naivete it will never cease to amaze me that emmett till was lynched in 1955 between the black and white photos intentionally meant to distort time and the way in which the civil rights movement is taught or not taught thanks to the white supremacist machinations of the republican party banning talk of injustice under the intentionally vague and politicized umbrella of critical race theory its easy to get confused and ultimately fool yourself into believing the world might ever be a better place bringing chinonye chukwus till to theaters in 2022 is therefore important not only must we be reminded of what happenedas well as mamie tillmobleys subsequent bravery in ensuring the world saw what money mississippi did to her sonbut we must also be aware that her fight to help pass a law to declare lynching a hate crime didnt end until march march 2022 sixtyseven years later nineteen years after her own death in 2003 by presenting emmetts story joyfully portrayed by jalyn hall through his mothers eyes i dont see any scenario where danielle deadwyler doesnt get an oscar nomination as her performance as mamie is breathtaking we can better understand the duality of life that continues today for americas black population its one thing to portray a teenager who doesnt know better making a mistake its another to portray his parents fear in knowing how that mistake could unfathomably cost his life the whole might be conventional on its surface insofar as how it presents the facts of what occurred before during and after its farce of a trial but theres nothing generic about the emotional weight at its back from deadwyler to john douglas thompson to keisha tillis to the childrentheres power in their reactions and reason why so much of the film depicts them as opposed to what sparks their reactions chukwu is intentionally centering the black experience with every frame we need only see the pain inflicted and the strength to endure it just like mamie with her sons body till ensures we cannot look away heres a fun one from the 6th day love that final zoom substack apparently cant handle an embedded gif so youll have to click over for a smoother experience or see everything at cinematicfbombscom the plane is in danger it cant land until a plan to alleviate that danger is made on the ground everything that occurs reinforces those two truths even so its never boring  full review at the film stage
Nov 30 2022,neutral,black adam also features the same issue as captain marvel introducing an impossibly invincible superhero with no emotion and is hard to connect to
Nov 30 2022,negative,for all the big fights glowing cgi and mean mugging the rock can do this film is startlingly lifeless for having been in the works for so long
Nov 23 2022,negative, the dc extended universe resumed with black adam now on vod streaming services like amazon prime video more than a year after james gunns the suicide squad wound up being the rare delightful dc excursion and several months after matthew reeves stunningly awesome the batman officially didnt count because alternate universes exist you know two tough acts to follow either way adam is a spinoff of 2019s shazam and precedes the dceu stuff under gunn who recently became president of such things so heres hoping he brings some fresh energy to upcoming flash aquaman shazam and blue beetle outings all due next year assuming they dont get delayed again especially since black adam feels so much like the old wearisome stultifyingly cgied dc movies weve endured  the gist once upon a time shit sucked well shit was good before it sucked kahndaq 2600 bce was the original great and mighty empire before rome and all those other empires the middle eastern city prospered until an evil king forged an evil crown with the help of six demons of the ancient world and a very rare mineral called eternium you keeping up this bullshit is essential he enslaved his people and it goes on and theres plenty of voiceover narration lets just say a slave named tethadam was gifted with godlike powers in order to save everyone from the evil jerks but he was enslaved in a tomb in a structure that still stands in presentday kahndaq which is a police state ruled by the intergang and a place where a hoodied kid on a skateboard radicaldudes his way through town to the tune of an old smashing pumpkins hit for the citizens of kahndaq the world is a vampire the kid is amon bodhi sabongui and his mom is adrianna sarah shahi and her brother is karim mohammed amer and theyre members of a resistance against the intergang adriannas idea is to find the old evil crown and do what with it now run around hither and thither with it like its a macguffin thats what anyway intergang baddies interrupt her foray into the ancient tomb and she utters an incantation punctuated with the word shazam and kapow with a mighty burst of cgi and a weird remix of paint it black tethadam dwayne the rock johnson emerges from the nether to murder the living piss out of the bad guys he uses his neverfullydefined powers to turn them to ash or skeletonize them or simply throw them over a mountain range with nary a thought or a signature the rock raised eyebrow so what does the shazam thing have to do with the shazam movie from four years ago something but also nothing because this movie doesnt get into it so you might ask black adam stands on its own then oh you silly strawpeople i set you up to knock you down of course it doesnt other dc characters must get involved in this nonsense since nobodys sure if tethadam is a good guy or a bad guy or what and those characters are the justice society of america sad trombone maybe they are hawkman aldis hodge the leader a badass with big wings and a goofy helmet doctor fate pierce brosnan a gent with a gold helmet that allows him to do things like see the future and replicate himself atom smasher noah centineo who can grow into a giant and cyclone quintessa swindell controller of mighty winds and bursting forth from this plot is a surely deep intricate and layered metaphor about the us political meddling in middle eastern affairs there is a butting of heads as adrianna insists tethadam is the new hero of kahndaq while the jsa folk insist hes a threat to all of everything no more extrajudicial killings is something hawkman likes to bellow meanwhile amon buddies up with the scowling and humorless tethadam giving him a catchphrase and stuff like that maybe the guys warming up a little i think he also has amnesia im sure your brain would be a little cloudy if youd been entombed for 5000 years anyway destiny intervenes when the real threat to all of everything shows up a devilhorned demonic freak named sabbac who can spurt the flames of heck from the occult sigil carved into his chest will sabbac rule the wasteland or will somebody stop him no shazspoilers what movies will it remind you of black adam is a teensy fraction better than the bilgiest of dceu dreck asserting that its more visually appealing than batman v superman dawn of justice and man of steel is to say that raccoons are cuter filthy diseaseridden vermin than sewer rats performance worth watching rough sledding all around here johnson gets no opportunities to deploy his genial persona the movie tosses a wet blanket on him so lets give this one to hodge who manages to give hawkman some gravitas from behind that ridiculous helm our take the who cares of it all is significant the rocks charisma hemmed in a parade of bland dc bleaguers fizzling comedy heaping cartloads of questionable cgi and action sequences designed not to thrill but to mercilessly barrage the senses the boy ends up kidnapped because what other purpose does such a character in such a movie serve the villain delivers a bloviating speech when he could be delivering the kill shot the hero who can move faster than a quark farts chooses not to during the very moment where it would most come in handy the bad guy has an army of minions that flop over as soon as central command goes out etc and i say all this assuming that quark farts are very very fast the best scene in black adam is one thats incredibly sobering with somber conversation and minorkey music punctuated with one deadserious utterance of a single word shazam this is the film in microcosm something that insists on being taken seriously but is impossible to take seriously somewhere in among the fringes of this overplotted overpopulated mess is a moral wrestling match in which selfproclaimed heroes who just want to stop a guy from killing  extrajudicially dont forget thats a key qualifier  are also preventing the oppression of an entire people its a mindyourownbeeswax plot thread that might carry some realworld implications if anyone involved gave more of a shit about actually writing things instead of jamming in extraneous underdeveloped characters and forcing a square rock into a round hole jaume colletserra jungle cruise four generic liam neeson thrillers never figures out what to do with his morally ambiguous central character so he surrounds black adam with flurries of junk and hopes we dont notice we did sorry our call skip it black adam is one of those movies where youre convinced the streaming progress bar is defying the laws of physics by making time move slower
Nov 23 2022,negative, there arguably isnt a single more riskaverse star in hollywood than dwayne johnson who almost exclusively dabbles in the realm of 100 million blockbusters where he only plays extensions of himself black adam may tick a couple of the boxes weve come to expect from the rocks filmography but the latest chapter in the dceus greatest strength is that its leading man fully embraces the rare opportunity to deliberately play against type having spent 15 years trying to get the movie made theres no doubting johnsons commitment to the cause however all that talk in the buildup of changing the hierarchy of power began to wear a little thin black adam isnt the gamechanger wed been conditioned to expect but nor is it an outright failure either it exists somewhere in the middle as a relatively safe and formulaic superhero story that runs through an extensive list of the genres cliches but is elevated significantly by a thumping soundtrack some interesting worldbuilding and a star seamlessly slipping into the skintight costume they were born to wear things dont get off to a particularly encouraging start though with an expositionheavy prologue set in ancient kahndaq establishing some heavyhanded backstory and motivations for the titular antihero replete with the introduction of the eternium macguffin  a magical element with properties that are every bit as mystical as they are destructive kicking off a 200 million comic book adaptation with a lengthy flashback that spends a very long time setting the stage is always a risky gambit and some may lose interest in amongst all this talk of eternium champions the council of wizards the crown of sabbac and the rest of the tablesetting required to introduce a brand new marquee hero to the masses but the pace thankfully picks up when the action shifts to the present day once sarah shahis adrianna and her cohorts complete with an accomplice thats so blatantly a bad guy wasting second act screentime on the reveal is a waste of everyones time visit an ancient tomb and awaken the legendary tethadam were off to the races in spectacularly violent fashion you can understand why black adam was initially given an rrating by the mpaa because for once a superhero spectacular lives up to the hype that it pushed pg13 to the very limit in his very first action sequence johnson delivers on his promise that adam isnt here to fck around as he decimates an entire unit of nefarious intergang members by way of frying them from the inside out ripping their limbs off stuffing live grenades in their mouths and throwing them as hard as he can through whatever surface is closest to hand its one hell of an introduction and sets things up nicely for a gnarlier and more envelopepushing story of costumed crimefighting than weve become used to naturally a 5000 yearold demigod awakening from slumber catches the attention of amanda waller a performance thats literally and figuratively phoned in by viola davis who tasks the justice society with stopping the allpowerful entity in his tracks again its understandable that the pacing would be slowed to a crawl as the jsa need to have their backstories filled in for audiences to care about them but the stopstart nature of black adam as a whole takes a little getting used to aldis hodges hawkman is the stoic dignified leader with the actor bringing a steely gravitas to the role that isnt there on the page given that the vast majority of his dialogue is ripped from superhero screenplay 101 noah centineos atom smasher and quintessa swindells cyclone dont fare as well although you get the distinct impression they may have had plenty of scenes left on the cutting room floor that leaves us with pierce brosnans doctor fate who is an utter delight every bit as charming and suave as ever the veteran brings a scenestealing mix of fatalism and dignity to an archetypal wizened sage turn generating sparks with virtually everyone he encounters the majority of the kahndaq natives feel underdeveloped beyond their onenote generalizations unfortunately but theres some interesting subtext involving adrianna her son bodhi sabonguis amon and the nation itself that occasionally bubbles to the surface  if not often enough she calls out the justice society for showing up in a country thats been under forced occupation for three decades for the very first time solely because another metahuman has popped up on the radar shes 100 percent right and the jsa are even willing to admit it but any hint of a deeper exploration on what would be a fascinating narrative thread for an allages dceu epic is swiftly jettisoned in favor of more punching and things going boom director jaumecollet serra throws plenty of neat visual tricks into the myriad of fastpaced and frantic showdowns but black adam can never escape the fact that its not exactly the genres most original effort a villain whos the evil mirror version of the hero check daddy issues check but not entirely how you might think a protagonist slowly learning to evolve through the life lessons imparted on them by the rest of the key players you betcha in true dceu fashion theres even a giant skybeam and a poorlyrendered cgi villain during the climactic showdown for good measure there are plenty of shortcomings to be found in black adam then but johnson is never one of them with his underrated acting chops compensating for the deliberate reigning in of his boundless charisma teth finds killing as easy as breathing and he doesnt quite get why the jsa are so bemused by him making the world a safer place by turning dangerous people into dust it may not be the dirty harry of superhero movies as we were told but the amorality that powers the main attraction is an intriguing wrinkle in a medium where almost every major name is colored distinctly in black or white black adam doesnt reinvent the wheel nor does it even tear a single page out of the superhero playbook instead of being completely dismantled the hierarchy of power has been slightly shifted but thats not exactly a bad thing the dceu needs an evolution as opposed to a revolution and the rock has introduced what might turn out to be the ideal candidate with which to lead the charge
Nov 23 2022,neutral, i generally like superhero movies i appreciate the escapism the nonsense i dont even mind familiar black adam 2022 not only feels familiar but it also borders on derivative and that doesnt bode well for dc in the northern african country of kahndaq treasurer hunter adrianna sarah shahi searches for the ancient crown of sabbac rumored to give the bearer great power while fleeing for her life she utters the incantation that resurrects black adam dwayne johnson from his 5000year slumber adriannas son amon bodhi sabongui believes black adam is there to be a savior of kahndag from the last 27 years of oppression by ruthless mercenaries calling themselves intergang amon spends a lot of time on his skateboard teaching black adam catchphrases meanwhile amanda waller viola davis has recruited carter hall aka hawkman aldis hodge and the justice society of america to subdue and contain black adam to prevent him from doing immeasurable damage to the world hall taps kent nelson doctor fate pierce brosnan and rookie heroes maxine hunkel cyclone quintessa swindell and al rothstein the atom smasher noah centineo to help bring black adam under control with decidedly mixed results so everyone is fighting for the magic crown the jsa is fighting the people of kahndag for the right to kidnap their chosen savior and hawkman and black adam have frequent staredowns meanwhile kahndag watches helplessly as more of its cultural artifacts destroyed by people who are claiming to help im sure this is a statement about how developed countries do more damage than good under the guise of liberation but theres way too much going on in this movie to pretend it also has a political statement and there is a lot going on just when you think the story is over theres easily another 40 minutes to go so this twohour movie feels like twoandahalf hours its around the end of the second act when the big climactic scene should be getting underway when another plot point or two get inserted and suddenly we have zombies setting aside the jumble of story issues we have a cast that feels tapped solely for name recognition and then slid into colorful costumes we forgive a lot of dwayne johnsons comedies because frankly the man is so charming and personable this is a large man with a large personality and his charisma carries a lot of unfortunate movies into watchable comedies because black adam is such an angry antihero johnsons personality is dialed all the way down to zero black adam could have been a completely animated vocaloid and we wouldnt have known the difference its as if johnson watched the first terminator 1984 and decided he was going to channel arnold schwarzenegger exclusively i would watch pierce brosnan smooth his suit and straighten his tie for two hours and to the studios credit he actually gets a little superhero action in but dispensing fatherly advice is not why i watch him on screen noah centineo and quintessa swindell feel like gen z afterthoughts and are wasted as atom smasher and cyclone since neither are terribly effective  he gets really big while wearing his uncles suit and shes really smart and makes strong winds yet none of those abilities are helpful against rampaging demigods its a poor reflection of hawkmans skills as a strategist but its only one of a few things that arent logical about black adam its a dc movie with solid dc canon backing it up but marvel has so completely dominated the superhero genre everything about black adam feels like marvel fanfiction we see hawkman and think falcon and a knockoff iron man we see atom smasher and think antman with a generous helping of spidermans awkwardness we see doctor fate and think doctor strange with a sprinkling of professor x we see cyclone and think rogue and neat cosplay kahndaq feels like wakanda with veins of the mythical element eternium running through its hills instead of vibranium it feels too familiar to really enjoy it bear with me because im not a comic book reader so i dont obsessively know the canon but we have had 24 years of marvel cinematic universe movies and even a few dc films that didnt completely tank in that span were all familiar with the justice league and i can even do a quick search on its precursor the justice society of america consisting of hawkman atom doctor fate and a few others and just as easily in that same search i see waller never worked with the justice society of america this is a dc comics multideck player set to random for all of the clever dialogue and twists black adam is very selfaware its a cinematic universe that doesnt want to be compared to its competition yet spends a lot of time copying that competition with the exception of shazam 2019 and birds of prey 2020 dc is striking out with both the oneoffs and the ensemble pieces thank goodness its not up to me to salvage it but if this is the best theyve got maybe hold out for shazam fury of the gods in 2023 its okay for a sequel to be derivative of itself black adam 2022 is rated pg13 for mild swears people getting gutstabbed people getting shot people thrown from great heights fatal concussive injuries internal immolation and explosions well darn i had hoped this would be somehow better  but your review confirmed what i feared dwayne johnson should never be dialed down  as you noted his charisma and larger than life persona need to channeled into a legit and likable character and all of these superhero movies  i guess these are the 21st century version of the western filmstv shows of the 50s and 60s and at some point they just become one big superhero thing with few distinguishing features
Nov 19 2022,negative, there was a time when superhero films were the exception they were new exciting and at their very best were playing with genre conventions and doing something unexpected now we get several superhero films a year not to mention countless tv shows on various streaming platforms theyve become the rule not the exception which almost automatically makes them less exciting at the end of the day most of them follow the same old formula of a heros journey they struggle with their powers and encounter a powerful enemy that nearly defeats them until ultimately tapping into something more profound to save the day tadah jaume colletserras black adam on the surface tries to offer something different its been a passion project for its star dwayne johnson who promised that the antiheros arrival would change the hierarchy of dc unfortunately black adam succumbs to the genres worst tropes and isnt aided by the baffling nearincompetent editing  the story takes place in the fictional land of kahndaq after a brief prologue that explains how teth adam hes not called black adam yet but patience dear reader was born the action moves to modern days adrianna sarah shahi is looking for a mystical crown that once divided the people and is incredibly dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands  adrianna manages to awaken teth adam from his slumber but boy is he pissed teth adam has no problem killing anyone and everyone in his way which sends the justice society  hawkman doctor fate atom smasher and cyclone  to kahndaq where they clash with teth adam obviously  first things first there is a lot to like in black adam dwayne johnson is impossibly likeable and has a magnetic screen presence pierce brosnan as doctor fate and aldis hodge as hawkman are also compelling especially brosnan who brings a sense of esteemed and renowned dignity into the film  but black adam feels incomplete its rushed narratively messy and badly edited director jaume colletserra struggles to find the right balance of tone and story beats to focus on and black adam often feels like one continuous action sequence and thats not a compliment the action too reliant on cgi tries to imply violence without fully committing to it  black adam has been posed as a more violent darker entry into the postzack snyder dceu but if anything this feels like a return to snyders style of filmmaking theres his signature religious imagery a lot of the action is played in slowmotion and the greyish colour palette meant to evoke angst and seriousness comes across as dull visually black adam might be one of the ugliest films of 2022  what makes it even more frustrating is the infinite amount of potential the film has black adams best scene is when adrianna tells the justice society off for storming into her homeland and kicking up a fuss now that teth adam is causing havoc but they havent done anything in the past 27 years that the country has been in conflict  it would have been a meaty angle to write your film from but its quickly abandoned colletserra an outstanding director when working with the right material struggles to let his style bleed through but there are some strong individual moments here more than anything black adam seems to just set up the future of the dceu but i must say it doesnt look very good   the sitting duck unveils the gripping journey of trade unionist maureen kearney brilliantly portrayed by isabelle huppert amidst harrowing political intrigue and personal hardship   the sitting duck unveils the gripping journey of trade unionist maureen kearney brilliantly portrayed by isabelle huppert amidst harrowing political intrigue and personal hardship
Nov 16 2022,negative, in black adam the eponymous hero is awakened after 5000 years by a professor in need of rescuing from ruthless mercenaries deep in an ancient temple of kahndaq  a fictional middle eastern country why have the producers gone to great lengths to cast actors with mena heritage to play the kahndaqi supporting characters but not the lead why do these kahndaqi characters have middle eastern accents but black adam does not its a brutal blackly humorous action sequence that pushes the bloody boundaries of previous 12a superhero movies and yet the first words this allpowerful kahndaqi utters then and throughout the film are delivered in an american accent now ive been pretty consistent with my frustration about dwayne johnson taking this role sure i could understand why he was cast 15 years ago after playing the mesopotamian villainturnedhero scorpion king in the mummy franchise he was big brown and it was a time before hollywood really started to listen to the demand for better more accurate ethnic representation so why in 2022 have we accepted the casting of a nonmiddle eastern actor as the first middle eastern superhero to get a solo movie star power why have the producers gone to great lengths to cast actors with mena heritage to play the kahndaqi supporting characters but not the lead why do these kahndaqi characters have middle eastern accents but black adam does not when a relatively unknown chadwick boseman was cast as black panther he fought to ensure he and his castmates playing wakandans could speak with subsaharan african accents they felt like it was maybe too much for an audience to take the late actor said in an interview with the hollywood reporter they felt like would people be able to understand it through a whole movie and if we do it now were stuck with it i felt the exact opposite  like if i speak with a british accent whats gonna happen when i go home given that boseman shared a similar african heritage to the marvel hero hearing him speak was certainly not jarring was johnson concerned that it would be awkward for him to use a middle eastern accent because he is not i wish i had the answers but so far in this press tour ive not read one interview where a journalist has posed these valid questions to the actor the american accent isnt just jarring because of the casting the thematic throughline of director jaume colletserras film about neoimperialist oppression in the middle east and the overreach of western superpowers is inconsistent and certainly doesnt hit as hard when the supersaviour sounds like the socalled foreign invaders hes fighting against this however is the tip of the iceberg for the ineffectiveness of a film that once promised to change the game for superhero stories in typical origin story fashion we begin in 2600 bce and are told the story of how tethadam gets his powers its changed to black later the tyrannical king of kahndaq has enslaved the people and forced them to mine for a special mineral called eternium he needs it to fashion a demonic crown that would allow him to wield dark powers and rain hell on earth when a slave boy rebels and faces execution the wizard shazam who also gave the dc hero shazam his powers picks him as earths magical champion and the fight begins this ancient world takes its cues from zack synders predilection for highlystylised orientalism but as we fast forward to presentday kahndaq it is drenched in the yellow filter hollywood loves to other middle eastern places with kahndaq is being occupied by a mercenary crime syndicate called intergang and they are brutally oppressing the kahndaqi people while robbing the land of its natural resources to fuel its arsenal resistance comes in the form of professor adrianna tomaz sarah shahi her electrician brother karim mohammed amer and her superheroobsessed son amon bodhi sabongui they bring heart to these side characters but they are mostly just there to humanise tethadam a sort of t2 judgement day relationship develops between amon and tethadam which has its funny moments as the kid teaches the ancient dude about modern life and catchphrases but johnson is too robotic honestly this was surprising to see from the normally hilarious and magnetic actor here johnsons line delivery is flat his brooding lacks charisma and his comedic beats are hitandmiss comedian mo amer manages to earn a few chuckles with his quips and sight gags but the script penned by adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani is bland its simultaneously too expositionheavy and yet doesnt tell us enough thanks to a glut of new dc characters it has to introduce a central conflict occurs between tethadam and the seeminglylong established justice society not to be confused with the justice league  where have they been all this time led by a nononsense hawkman aldis hodge it features heroes cyclone quintessa swindell and atom smasher noah centino who are cute but feel inessential to the plot apart from a couple of action scenes interestingly the writers chose to go with a younger version of atom smasher but not the younger version of fate khalid nassour an egyptianamerican medical student who inherits the title from kent nelson here played by the always charming pierce brosnan between this casting choice and the complete lack of backstory for either this magical hero or hawkman the mena elements are stripped away in favour of an overamericanised narrative it both wants to admonish these patronising heroes whilst also relying on them to save the day yet never having them do any significant selfinterrogation the justice society preach no killing but they are under the jurisdiction of task force xs amanda waller viola davis who famously pushes the killtowin strategy adrianna defends tethadam by saying hes willing to do the dark things white knights like the justice society cant do but two suicide squad movies and a peacemaker series have already played this song did we also forget that wonder woman killed terrorists in justice league that superman killed zod in man of steel make it make sense then we have marwan kenzaris ishmael whose tightlycoiled mullet 80s look lets us know that hes bad news i once tweeted johnson that id be unimpressed if they made kenzari a villain he said i would be and i can confirm that i am hes barely in it only to pop up in the latter half with a rushed generic plot twist to lead us into the big final battle once again i am asking hollywood to give this dreamboat a leading role worthy of his talent for a superteam that cares about human life theres a surprising lack of regard for the buildings ancient architecture and busy markets they help destroy in some rather repetitive slowmotion fight scenes against this vengeful champion if anything this movie has made me have more respect for filmmakers like ryan coogler destin daniel cretton and mohammed diab who enriched their superhero stories with cultural specificity here we have karim listening to old american hits amons room covered in batman and superman posters and a kfc kahndaqi fried chicken gag  would it have killed them to use a needle drop from a middle eastern artist moon knight is full of them  hanna flint is a film and tv critic writer and author of strong female character with bylines at empire time out elle town  country the guardian bbc culture and

Nov 14 2022,negative, black adam the latest in our current reality of multiple cgi superhero spectacles per year feels built on paradoxes some of those paradoxes are peculiar to this specific story and others emerge from general recurring issues with the films relationship to the dc empire and superhero films at large in this way black adam is rarely as egregious an example of superhero malaise as much as the general response to it suggests and yet its instructive to think of all the way all the things that might work  and occasionally do work  in black adam feel compulsively neutered by the things that dont work even as competing conglomerates marvel and dc feign progressive ideologies in their casting practices the current slate of superhero cinema still feels hegemonic whether in its whiteness or in its blinkered americana black adam offers a welcome rejection of both at firsta potentiality that the film finds itself grappling with to diminishing returns the story begins thousands of years ago when a tyrannical king creates the crown of sabbac to attain power over the rest of the kingdom a young boy resists and is given the powers of shazam becoming the champion to liberate the enslaved in presentday in the same kingdom in kahndaq a fictional middle eastern country the population is oppressed by intergang a crimesyndicate and neocolonial force stripping the formerly noble country of its glory the country needs liberation and adrianna tomaz university archaeologist and resistor along with three colleagues ventures in search of the lost crown for reasons that are somewhat vague they do find the crown but they also find the tomb of tethadam supposedly the liberating champion from millennia before when the search for the crown is foiled by mercenaries adrianna calls on to tethadam for assistance and he awakens but tethadam is a vengeful and mercurial figure  laying waste to the countrys oppressors with glee american agent amanda waller is troubled by the appearance of this seemingly unassailable figure and sends four superheroes of the justice society not the justice league to capture him from there things go awry for the characters but also for the film itself  even when it does though black adam is held together by the not unimportant reality of a superhero film that seems aware of if not actively engaged in an antiimperialist stance set primarily outside of the global north yes much of this is done vaguely in a way that ever so slightly avoids examining actual the complicity of contemporary superpowers in destroying middle eastern countries very similar to the fictional kahndaq but it is an effort that feels complex on its own so that one can immediately recognise and even appreciate the potential political commentary even when black adam declines to do very much with it a sharply specific tale of kahndaq and the dynamics of its contemporary characters trying to liberate themselves feels like a visceral possibility for a superhero film but then for black adam to justify its superhero existence it cannot be content with being sharply specific it must look outward because it must justify its existence with the larger lore of the dc context the screenplay credited to adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani justifies this by inserting the urgency of the justice societys need to neuter black adam these are consistently the worst parts of the film viola davis return as amanda waller feels dispensable and each of the four members of the society  pierce brosnan as the wizened illusionist doctor fate aldis hodge as the stern leader hawkman noah centineo as the obligatory young upstart in the form of atom smasher and quintessa swindell as the obligatory ingenue in the form of cyclone  bring the film to a grinding halt with forced banter that feels unnecessary and particularly incongruous with the actual life and death dynamics in kahndaq the story tries to confront that by some moments where the characters explicitly reject the presence of the americans but it feels counterintuitive even when the middle eastern and north african mena characters question the presence of the american superheroes noticeably absent when the country was being oppressed black adam is too bound to the larger machine of capitalism that is dc so it feels unable to really engage with the competing desire to be actually revolutionary even black panther a wholly better film that similarly engages with themes of antihegemony is not wholly successful as an antiimperialistic text cooglers film as good as it is has its own messy politics that seems uncertain how to deploy queries of wealth without falling prey to empty capitalistic thirst and black adam is no black panther for many reasons many of them to do with craft editors mike sale and john lee feel burdened with the conflicting plots and the films own convoluted structure and lawrence shers vision of this fictional middle eastern country still feels too gauzily yellow in the way that american contexts of these places tend to be and then theres the way that the film doesnt seem as exuberantly in step with the possibilities of its mena representation and its the mena dynamic where black adam finds another unscalable paradox dwayne johnson although conventionally and ambiguously brown he is half black and half samoan is not a mena actor and although ambiguous ethnicities have been par for the course for much of contemporary cinema with brownness whether from the middle east pacific island latin america being an interchangeable currency the casting feels unwieldy when the film so preciously contextualises johnsons tethadam as the champion sent to deliver the specific of this specific country from the foreigners this fact rests uncomfortably against the films central figure johnson johnsons own dogged interest in this story has been key to its development but it feels like such an unforced error that the film which explicitly speaks of identity and heroic representation casts an explicitly nonmena performer as this great figure of liberation it does not help that the performance is also not good johnson opts to play tethadams return after a 4000year entombment as a robotic figure he is a prehistoric god as terminator and in the face of sarah shahi doggedly devoting so much emotion to adrianna the leaden approach to characterisation from johnson feels like a vacuum of emotion why does adriannas brother spend so much of his time listening to american oldies why does the films own understanding and valuation of its native culture feel so ambivalent why does johnsons characterisation of teth adam feel confined to an american version of postmodern humour rather than something that feels meaningfully engaged with the films mena context there are too many questions that black adam shrugs at the muchvaunted cameo in the film which many know of doesnt inspire me to confidence no fault of the cameo performer but black adam is best when it turns in on itself keeping its story focused only internally the revelation of tethadams existence offers a moment of emotionality drawing a parallel across timelines to emphasise what parents might do for their children but every attempt to tie it to larger plotty banalities of superhero urgencies feel clunky and yet its those ties that have assured that audiences are seated it is compulsory entertainment you cant miss this if you want to understand the next and the next and so on but what happens when their ouroboros approach to its effect end up robbing it of the faint profundity it might create otherwise as i said black adam is trapped in a paradox
Nov 13 2022,positive, dwayne johnson is built like a superhero so it was no great surprise when he was attached to a comic book property back in 2007 the surprise came when out of all the characters he could have played the one he wanted was black adam fifteen years later amidst the resurgence of the comic book movie two questions remain 1 was it worth the wait and 2 has the hierarchy of power in the dc universe actually changed as character introductions go black adams is incredibly strong and dark released from his tomb after 5000 years he grabs a mercenary by the neck and using his powers proceeds to burn him from the inside out casually crushing his scorched skull to add an exclamation point on this vicious kill think back to the much debated killing of zod by superman in man of steel there superman killed because he had to black adam kills because he can the hierarchy of power has indeed been changed within the universe with black adam being presented as someone on an equal footing in terms of power and ability with kalel the problem this creates is adams position within it in the dc comics lore black adam is one of the main antagonists of shazam indeed the first shazam film hinted at the character as the champion who came before billy however given the long and winding road to this films release it is fair to say that johnson has his sights set a little higher as to where he sees even going as far as teasing it at the end of dc league of superpets in a scene where he voiced three characters the film flipflops between portraying him as a herp a villain and an antihero framed as a threat to the planet because of his power but seen as the potential liberator of kahndaq as doctor fate tells him you can be the destroyer of this world or its saviour part of that central crux is down to johnson himself in the role obviously he has an undeniable screen presence commanding ones attention albeit his trademark charm smile and eyebrow tempered by an intense brooding one of the most popular stars on the planet and someone who is incredibly protective of his brand it is not hard to see he would want to soften the edges a little where the mcu has gone from strength to strength under one singular vision the dceu has flipflopped between multiple approaches if there is one man who can course correct and bring everything together it is dwayne johnson this film comes at a pivotal moment for the dceu the main titles are suffering from offscreen controversy cancellations and delays while the most successful properties critically and commercially have been the stand alones joker the batman in many ways it feels like not a soft reboot but a hard recalibration it forgoes tying directly to shazam instead opening up the universe by introducing the justice society of america via amanda waller although not to the point of explaining why justice requires both a society and a league yet ripping up the established order of things literally in a fistfight with hawkman in a teens bedroom adam rips and punches his way through posters and memorabilia of the current members of the justice league it is a shame therefore that while it sets itself out as a fresh start the film feels like one that would have been made back in 2007 when johnson was first attached it has its moments lorne balfes score for example and the supporting performances of aldis hodge and pierce brosnan there is nothing here that elevates it above what has come before like the video game style fight scenes or the jsa operating out of a mansion that has a jet hiding under the gardens that feels very xmen circa 2000 the choice of his jungle cruise director jaume colletserra is like everything else a very safe choice  when it comes to superhero movies however the sequels are often better than the originals once the exposition and character introduction is complete the training wheels can come off black adam is not quite the superhero film we deserve but it might just be the one we need right now dwayne johnson has set the stage to be the saviour of the dceu from his time as a wrestler he has a great sense of being able to read an audience know what it wants and deliver accordingly 
Nov 11 2022,neutral,black adam has some amazing characters in the rocks black adam along with jsa members hawkman  doctor fate played by hodge  brosnan highlighting every seen they are in the human element and antagonist are on the weak side sadly bringing down the film
Nov 9 2022,negative, dont believe the promoted tweets that claim dwayne johnson is delivering a nuanced performanceblack adam is a terrible film and johnsons acting fulfills his nickname of the rock its a dull film even with the amount of blasts and fights and destruction present the film also does a pisspoor job of showcasing middle eastern culture and imperialism in a way thats informative engaging or even entertaining black adam is set in the fictional middle eastern country of kahndaq a country that seems like a cross between iraq and egypt the film wants the audience to be immersed in the world of kahndaq but the film could care less about the culture its trying to create or emulate even when it comes down to the accents every actor playing a kahndaqian has an accent except for johnson who sounds like himselfan americaneven though his character tethadam is over 5000 years old the lack of focus on khandaqian culture and worldbuilding leaves the film feeling empty even though if were going by the cuneiformstyle writing shown on khandaqian artifacts theres a ton of realworld culture the film could draw from since cuneiform originated in ancient sumer located in modernday iraq  with khandaq being reduced to one city center it feels more like a town rather than an entire country even worse that townscape looks like nearly every other representation of the middle east and north africa mena in american film and television it dehumanizes us he said according to comic book movie we are always naked we are always sexy we are always bad we are always over the top you never see cairo you always see jordan shot for cairo morocco shot for cairo sometimes spain shot for cairo this really angers us  i remember seeing wonder woman 1984 and there was a big sequence in egypt and it was a disgrace for us you had a sheik  that doesnt make any sense to us egypt looked like a country from the middle ages it looked like the desert he continued you can also see how the kahndaqian characters are all dressed as if the 1980s bringing to mind the era of indiana jones popularity characters drive old cars including the films main vehicle a van with a tape deck or have old hairstyles or are doing outofdate things like skateboarding in a way that reminds you more of 1990s radical culture rather than the x games even more damning look at how cairo egypt is portrayed under diabs watch on moon knight you see bright colors contemporary clothes and cars sophisticationeverything you dont see in western portrayals of the area more pictures found at mcu location scout to add even more insult to injury lets look at how modernday iraq looks note that its completely different from how kahndaq is portrayed in black adam  when the film does try to inject some commentary or authenticity its done in a laughable way female lead character adrianna tomaz sarah shahi rightly tells the justice society that they havent shown up at all to help kahndaq who has been terrorized by outside entities until the countrys champion shows up this is the strongest element of the film but because of the films lack of interest in worldbuilding we dont know why outside forces want the regions resources so much what impact they have on the wider world and why other forces within kahndaq havent revolted before tethadams arrival throughout most of the film the portrayal of kahndaqians has been as victims waiting on one man to show up the amount of destruction done to the country also undercuts any message the justice society might have even though they claim they are trying to save the area from tethadam they literally destroy priceless artifacts not to mention almost every building in the city center tethadam isnt any better since he and hawkman played by aldis hodge destroy isis home for no reason other than for audience laughs or for fighting set pieces in other words kahndaq doesnt matter as its own entityit only matters because of its relation to tethadam most of the worldbuilding that happens in the film comes from flashbacks and archaeological objects but again the sparse worldbuilding doesnt immerse ancient kahndaq is still portrayed with that same dusty filter the same feeling of victimization sadly there were glimmers of hope for what the movie could have been no character in the flashback scenes wear colorful clothingeverything is for some reason beige or cream even though people in ancient times wore tons of color as shown in this illustration of ancient sumer the architecture such as the zigguratlike structure where the king resided in the film also reads ancient sumerian but again the architecture would have had some type of color if not the outside then at least on the inside sources state that the very top of ziggurats the temple would have been painted indigo blue and like all ancient cultures ancient sumerian sculpture included color inlays as art in context writes sumerian pieces had decorative elements made from semiprecious stones like alabaster lapis lazuli and serpentine and also used metals including silver gold bronze and copper as inlays and designs on various objects but one hallway isnt enough if the filmmaking team were truly interested we could have gotten more of a sense of kahndaq culture since ancient sumer was a highly advanced civilization cuneiform for instance is the oldest recorded language in the world appearing around 3100 bc according to archeological records as reported by historycom the epic of gilgamesh still taught in schools today is the oldest epic poem on earth even older than the bible the civilization also made great strides in science engineering math architecture and more including developing the modern system for keeping time60 seconds to a minute 60 minutes to an hour etc sumerian music has also influenced the world with hurrian hymn no 6 as the oldest musically notated song in the world black adam could have used this film as a moment to truly embrace mena heritage similar to how black panther uses a fictional african nation to highlight and honor realworld african cultures but instead worldbuilding and character building came second to showcasing johnsons star power in the most vain light possible as a character black adam is only as engaging as the world surrounding himseeing the strongest man in the world destroy stuff and act stoically is boring if theres nothing there to provide context to that character for as expensive as it was to create this film it certainly could have done much more to not feel so cheap in more ways than one
Nov 9 2022,negative, lack adams venture onto the big screen had been in the works in various iterations since the mid 00s that might explain why the new black adam film feels like it belongs in the mid 00s although this explanation shouldnt have to apply  youd think that at some point someone would have realized how far superhero movies have come in the last two decades and then given this stodgy picture a sharp swift revamp but clearly they didnt so here we are  the newest addition to dcs generally unexceptional extended universe is an unexciting affair that needlessly gives its protagonist an uninspired drawnout origin story in this mostly unnecessary solo vehicle dwayne johnson stars as the titular antivillain a former slave bestowed with the powers of various egyptian gods who is awakened from his tomb after 5000 years and immediately gets down to business decimating baddies left right and centre an irked amanda waller viola davis reprising the role sees him as a threat and tasks the justice society  ruleabiding hawkman aldis hodge soothsaying doctor fate pierce brosnan windcontrolling cyclone quintessa swindell and sizechanging atom smasher noah centineo  to take him into custody resistance fighter adrianna sarah shahi  the woman responsible for adams resurrection  has in the meantime managed to find the crown of sabbac a relic that can potentially give its bearer immense power but that could cause massive destruction if it falls into the wrong hands that pair of hands belongs to ishmael marwan kenzari who desperately wants to obtain the crown and unleash its powers when things get dire black adam and the justice society must navigate their clashing views of justice as they try to save the world from annihilation  there is a world of potential in exploring vigilantism vengeance and the whole one mans terrorist concept and black adam has the perfect protagonist and setup to do just that but the film is too afraid to embrace the inherent darkness of its central character and the world around him instead the movie just sticks to a beige unexciting predictable story delivered through weak acting performances further decimating the tales impact  as a spinoff of sorts to 2019s delightful shazam this middling new entry feels like a step back for the dceu and might ultimately leave you wishing that someone would take this film back to the aughts and leave it there
Nov 9 2022,positive,what black adam lacks in originality it makes up for in entertainment value
Nov 8 2022,neutral, lightning seldom strikes the same place twice unless youre a dc character uttering the word shazam but i digress in this case im referring to the always charismatic dwayne johnson collaborating with director jaume colletserra the two hit it off with the enjoyable jungle cruise but their reunion leaves a lot to be desired black adam suffers from sloppy cgi effects overused tropes and a lack of empathy for any of its characters i enjoyed the dark overtones but theyre too little too late the rock didnt cook up this hot mess but he sure is served up as the main dish waiter check please set in 2600 bce the film opens in the fictional middle eastern country of kahndaq where its people have become enslaved by tyrannical king ahkton marwan kenzari who forces them to dig for a magical mineral named eternium with it he can summon the crown of sabbac which will give the wearer superpowers bestowed by the six demons of hell this isnt a guillermo del toro antihero film so the dark subject matter is unfortunately saved for the final reel the origins story written by adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani shows how a heroic young boy named hurut jalon christian became the peoples champion after the council of wizards bestow upon him the powers of shazam nice cameo by djimon hounsou reprising his role hurut is a straightup superhero who makes the ultimate sacrifice by transferring his powers to his dying father tethadam johnson who becomes black adam in a change from the dc comics story where it was his uncle hurut becomes a young boy again after transferring his powers and hes quickly killed by the kings guards black adam filled with rage kills ahkton and his men and in the process almost wipes kahndaq off the map the wizards deem black adam not worthy of the superpowers and entomb him where he lays dormant for 5000 years fast forward to the present where rebel mom adrianna sarah shahi goes searching for the crown of sabbac with her comic bookreading and skateboarding son amon bodhi sabongui whose bedroom is littered with posters of every dc superhero on a side note shahi who was born in euless texas went on to win the miss fort worth usa pageant in 1997 and then became a dallas cowboys cheerleader before moving to los angeles where she was encouraged to take up acting by director robert altman adrianna and amon are joined by her brother karim houston comedian mohammed mo amer and ishmael marwan keznari who looks vaguely familiar while searching for the crown they accidentally free black adam from his prison who is justifiably groggy with no coffee and 5000 years of pentup frustration what do you expect he immediately starts wiping out kahndaqs modern oppressors the foreign group intergang while reminding everyone that hes not a hero black adam is a supervillain in dcs comics here hes a watereddown antihero which only confuses the audience who arent sure who to root for when the justice society shows up to kill black adam after he just freed the people of kahndaq speaking of the justice society jsa this bteam of superheroes isnt as wellknown as dcs justice league jla which features batman superman and wonder woman still they are a force to be reckoned with in their own right thanks to dr fate pierce brosnan and hawkman aldis hodge the societys strongest members novice superheroes atom smasher noah centineo and cyclone quintessa swindell remain on standby until fate gives them the green light which happens a lot since all of them are needed to fight black adam the setting combined with dwayne johnson gives the film a stargate meets the scorpion king feel as it relies on one overplayed trope after another to drive the story the mindnumbing special effects are just a greatesthits package of blows crashes and explosions highlighted by inconsistent cgi which looks great one moment and shoddy the next jungle cruise was surprisingly an entertaining film even though it was based on a disney theme park ride its success was primarily due to johnsons charisma and emily blunts charm with black adam the beloved former wrestler is required to tone down the charm and humor his calling card so with just his physique to rely on johnson has no choice but to go directly from one fighting scene to the next occasionally he gets in a funny oneliner while brooding the final chapter gets dark as demon villain sabbac marwan kenzari shows up with an army of skeleton warriors who are about as menacing as benny the cabbie in halloweentown minus the humor and dad jokes to keep in line with the brooding theme dwayne johnson can salvage almost any film but black adam proves to be a far greater adversary than his star power can conquer make sure you stay for the postcredits sequence as a familiar face shows up that brings hope that johnson will get another chance to tackle the role in a much better film with a much better rival mailing address 2003 8th ave 300 fort worth tx 76110phone 8174059318email

Nov 5 2022,negative, years ago when i taught screenwriting i told students show me a story adding that good stories need solid characters both are lacking in jaume colletserras cacophonous liveaction dc cartoon the prologue introduces the ancient middle eastern kingdom of kahndaq where the ruler sabaac forces his slaves to mine for the magical metal eternium when a huge gemstone is found a young boy encourages others to revolt but  after hes captured and about to be executed  powerful wizards intervene transforming him into the titular champion dwayne johnson who topples the entire realm 5000 years later in kahndaq as archaeologist adrianna tomaz sarah shahi searches for the kings legendary eternium crown she unwittingly unearths the mythological spandexclad antihero teth adam  with a pentagram scar on his chest and a backstory with his son hurut thats where rory haines sohrab noshirvani and adam sztykiels origin script stops being coherent while adriannas skateboarding comicsobsessed son amon bodhi sabongui introduces disoriented yet ragefilled adam to the modern world smugly preening adam advocates violencedestruction as the only way to solve whatever problems occur meanwhile feeding into the concept of western imperialism amanda waller viola davis assembles four members of americas justice league  hawkman aldis hodge doctor fate pierce brosnan atom smasher noah centineo and cyclone quintessa swindell  to intervene in this world there are heroes and there are villains heroes dont kill people goldenwinged hawkman tells adam well i do adam retorts adding force is always necessary fyi when black adam says shazam its not the familiar shazam uttered by captain marvel although it also serves as an acronym to activate their superpowers  but thats never explained  and  if youve remained stoic through the perfunctory two hours  stay for the revealing credits featuring a cameo by a much beloved dc hero setting up a future franchise confrontation
Nov 4 2022,negative, if you appreciate dwayne the rock johnsons smolder director jaume colletserra with cinematographer lawrence sher have built this lackluster film around it but that alone cant fill twohours and five minutes of relatively flat acting and lackluster dialogue black adam may be doing well at the box office but the films content doesnt bode well for the continued unfocused dc cinematic universe in the distant pass the king of kahndaq ahkton marwan kenzari  was greedy for more power and decided to create the crown of sabbac he needed the rare mineral eternium and since it was normal for kings in 2600 bc to have slaves he had hordes of bald slaves digging and dying for him  a young man hurut jason christian discovers it and instead of marking the place to mine for a vein the young hurut runs around to celebrate the celebration doesnt last long because the guards like their slaves docile and silent  one of the slaves attempts to lead a revolt still the crown of sabbac will be forged but the king of kahndaq ahkton never gets to wear the crown he is killed by tethadam flash forward to contemporary times kahndaq is a land of oppressed people they have suffered colonization and ruthless gang rule  an archeologist adrianna tomaz sarah shahi believes she knows where to the find the crown she her brother karim mohammed amer and their colleagues samir james cusatimoyer and ishmael kenzari get past the checkpoint guards and drive out into the remote desert where they find a cave within a mountain that has obviously been carved out by men in there are ancient writings that only adrianna can read she finds the crown but they have been followed and are ambushed believing that she can awaken a hero to fight for kahndaq she recites the incantation that frees tethadam dwayne johnson who saves adrianna by killing the gang members tethadam save kahndaq and supernatural power and an ancient statue built of him  but this guy has been asleep for a few thousand years and a lot has changed luckily adrianna has a teenaged skateboarding son amon who is a big fan of the dc superheroes who can wise up tethadam first of all tethadam needs a tagline a motto he also needs to defend himself against the justice society hawkman aldis hodge doctor fate pierce brosnan cyclone quintessa swindell and atom smasher noah centineo tethadams slaughter of the men at the cave has caught the attention of the us government official viola davis as amanda waller who has sent the justice society to get tethadam into custody this film needs a dose of humor and a questioning if the audience or the world really needs righteous slaughter and the rationale of justified violence when you consider the talent assembled here who clearly have comedic chopsjohnson brosnan and hodge it is sad that the humor attempted here falls flat than wile e coyote after hes been smashed by a falling boulder barcelonaborn director jaume colletserra has an eye for action but for humor timing is everything and the timing isnt there despite the credited writing by adam sztykiel made of honor alvin and the chipmunks the road chip with  rory haines and iranianamerican raised muslim sohrab noshirvani the mauritanian at just over two hours the film feels long be sure to stay for the midcredits superman scene you might think that i and every other asian american should be rejoicing dc has been big on diversity with jason momoa as aquaman but the rock is overrepresented in asian american pacific islander roles already and since he and momoa share a body type this isnt really diversity when you realize that white guys like andrew garfield toby maguire and tom holland can play spiderman further the rock is a twofer hes both pacific islander samoan and african american momoa as aquaman is also hawaiian and european they both can come under racially ambiguous the casting of the principal heroes of the justice society  also leans heavily into the binary of black and white the justice society is composed of two white peoplepierce brosnan as kent nelsondoctor fate and noah centineo as albert al rothsteinadam smasherand two black peoplealdis hodge as carter hallhawkman and quintessa swindell as maxine hunkelcyclone al rothstein is supposed to be jewish but centineo is not further their commander is black viola davis as amanda waller its worth noting that carter hall has been played by a white person michael shanks in smallville and german actor falk hentschel in the arrowverse swindell is lightskinned but ebony is embracing her and she also brings representation for nonbinary people west asians are represented in the cast with sarah shahi who is of iranian descent mohammed amer who is palestinian american north africa is also represented with tunisiandutch actor marwan kenzari as ishmael gregorsabbac another pacific islander besides the rock plays a pivotal role uli latukefu as the superhero form of jason christians hurut but latukefu also plays the rock in the tv series what isnt represented is east asians and that is underlined by the side trip black adamtethadam takes to a picaresque valley with a thatched roof hut the dubbed in voices spoke mandarin that might not be apparent to most of the audience there is east asian representation in shazam with ian chen as eugene choi but was there an east asian wizard in the council of wizards  in shazam the last surviving member of the council was played by djimon hounsou who also appears prominently  in black adam what is also problematic here is that the rock may be part african american but african americans do not claim north africa where the majority of egypts land mass is located generally african americans are those who come from subsaharan africa north africans are effectively disenfranchised from the continent as a result similarly west asians are separated out from asia which in the us most commonly refers to east asia and in more recent times has also included south asia and southeast asia west asians are left without a continent in a manner similar to north africans as a result in the us theres been a movement to pull this population from the category of white into middle east north african mena and with the recent wars in west asia and the aftermath of the 911 terrorism it has become obvious that the mena american population does face prejudice black adam leans heavily into the binary of black and white diversity the socalled smashing of barriers by swindell seems more like an expansion of that binary definition of diversity and to a certain extent so does the casting of the rock should johnson be playing a character who is supposedly of north african or west asian how many west asian or north african superheroes are there and how many heroes are being played by actors of west asian or north african descent moreover if carter hall can be played by a black person then why not another ethnic minority including west asian in addition the one jewish hero is not played by someone who is jewish noah centineo as albert al rothsteinadam smasher although there are many actors of jewish heritage and some have shown up in the marvel cinematic universe eg jake gyllenhaal or andrew garfield  henry winkler who is of german jewish descent does play adam smashers uncle and supposedly the previous adam smasher but is that really enough is this any better than having the lead in prince of persia played by jake gyllenhaal shouldnt we want actors of west asian and north african have the opportunity to play something other than terrorists black adam should have been the opportunity for someone of egyptian or of arab descent and muslim to portray a superhero black adam fully uses the rocks smolder  but it could have been bolder by casting choices that would have smashed the black and white diversity paradigm under the direction colletserra the film is a bloated twohours and five minutes black adam could have been leaner and it continues the tone of meaner than the mcu i did not receive an invitation to a studio press screening and this seemed to be not uncommon black adam opened on 21 october 2022
Nov 4 2022,neutral, this week kevin is getting whipped up in a frenzy about halloween and he gets all excited over the box office because of all the horror films in the lineup then he looks at new trailers for m3gan and creed iii next he offers a rundown of the halloween options in the different streaming services later he reviews black adam ticket to paradise and tár finally he wraps things up with the homecinema roundup and a spotlight on william castles house on haunted hill disagree on tar film requires you to be attentive and does not give lots of answers your review of this was laughable  big thumbs down agree on tar too long too sluggish up front and pretentious just as you said i already knew cate blanchette could act conducting and piano playing scenes were cringe worthy
Nov 3 2022,neutral,the conundrum at the heart of black adam is how the film manages to render so many likable charming actors into forgettable clichés

Nov 2 2022,positive, while dc continuously changes its structure behind the scenes a project fifteen years in the making finally arrives in theaters and jaume colletserras black adam is full of charismatic action although time will tell if the studio is actually headed in the right direction this time dwayne the rock johnson leads a fun cast who have enough charm to carry what would otherwise be a generic super hero outing but the film successfully manages to keep the worldthreatening stakes personal enough to make the characters worth caring for an ancient powerful being has been unleashed in the dc extended universe with an origin story made to be enjoyed with the biggest popcorn bucket you can find while the movie was trapped in development hell for the better part of two decades dwayne johnson remained proud of the vision he and warner bros had for this story the result is not as earthshattering as promised but the performance delivered by the lead star demonstrates how much he cared about portraying tethadam on the big screen plenty of johnsons characters appear to have the same personality across his filmography but in this instance an effort for this antihero to stand out from the rest of the smoldering bike riders can be perceivedsource warner bros picturesalmost three thousand years ago tethadam is a slave in the nation of kahndaq after his

temple where he was banished  tethadam sees the light of day once againthe rock portrays adam with an unfamiliar gravity it was interesting to see the actor lean into a more serene presence onscreen the character doesnt need to look at the camera and remind us how powerful he is that is rather proven with his actions and with a very good notion of how someone who has possessed such abilities for a long time might carry himself johnson plays adam wreaking havoc with the mundane attitude of someone walking their dogthe humor doesnt overstay its welcomethe first two acts of black adam didnt have the right to be as amusing as they are adam is able to roam through the streets of kahndaq for the first time in millennia and he will do his best to understand how humanity has changed since then a fish out of water routine for characters who jump across big periods of time can get exhausting relatively quickly but in this case the movie doesnt dumb adam down and the humor shines because he can understand most of what he sees he simply doesnt care as long as it doesnt help him bring honor to his homesource warner bros picturesaldis hodges hawkman is the highlight of the justice society of america a team of super heroes who have existed in the dceu for a very long time but are only now appearing being mentioned or making themselves useful sketchy introductions aside the society is only

adores to hover randomly throughout the film to remind us that he can fly  thankfully noah centineos atom smasher functions as a way more likable version of deadpool and his heavyhandedness can

of course he is more than thrilled to get to know adam and show him the ropes regarding superpowered individual etiquette the two share very humorous backandforths and adam protecting the boy and

aside the society is only there to make adam look better but thankfully they are not thrown under the bus whether they are the antiheros punching bags or allies the jsa keep tethadam with his feet on the ground even though he adores to hover randomly throughout the film to remind us that he can fly  thankfully noah centineos atom smasher functions as a way more likable version of deadpool and his heavyhandedness can attributed to his youth and lack of experience instead of acting that way due to having an annoying personality but it is bodhi sabonguis character amon tomaz who has the best dynamic with johnsons electrifying protagonist amon is the young son of a university professor who happens to help adam and the jsa in their quest for an ancient relic since he is a huge fan of superheroes dc super heroes of course he is more than thrilled to get to know adam and show him the ropes regarding superpowered individual etiquette the two share very humorous backandforths and adam

Nov 2 2022,positive,been there done that  still its the rock and its all a lot of fun
Nov 1 2022,negative, a mostly intolerable dc comics adaptation black adam follows the title figure dwayne johnson as hes awoken from a centurieslong slumber and unleashed on the villains menacing his middle eastern hometown filmmaker jaume colletserra working from a script by adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani kicks black adam off with an almost unreasonably expositionheavy opening stretch that establishes a tone of pervasive selfseriousness and its clear certainly that the offputting vibe is perpetuated by a midsection overflowing with some of the superhero genres most generic runofthemill tropes and conventions  with colletserras reliance on computergenerated effects doing little to alleviate the predominantly uninvolving atmosphere and although there is some novelty in the central characters lessthanaltruistic behavior at least initially black adam with its assortment of hopelessly onenote periphery characters remains entirely unable to grab the viewers interest and attention for much of its wildly overlong and often interminable 124 minute running time  although to be fair the picture does boast a small handful of compelling setpieces and johnsons predictably charming work as the fishoutofwater protagonist pierce brosnan cast as a superhero named doctor fate undoubtedly walks away with the title of mvp however by the time the loud wildly overthetop finale rolls around black adam has cemented its place as one of the least impressive comicbook movies to come around in quite some time  which is a shame ultimately given the talent both in front of and behind the camera
Nov 1 2022,positive,there are specks of greatness within the midtier story but this dc flick is more entertaining than the past few mcu features which is saying a lot
Oct 31 2022,negative, these are all statements promoting the latest installment of the dceu black adam which premiered in theaters on friday theyre also all statements coming from the man portraying black adam dwayne the rock johnsonand the blockbuster king seems to be pushing a pretty clear agenda about his film shaking up the entire fabric of the dceu as we know it as johnson sees it black adam is positioned to be something of a rebirth for the interconnected superhero franchise at large its a unique time in the superhero genre where theres the introduction of fresh blood and new characters on both sides of the aisleat marvel and certainly at dc johnson recently told the new york times and the launching of black adam is converging with a time where they are also bringing in new leadership at warner bros and new leadership on the dc side is soon to be coming in i feel very confident about the direction of the dc universe it is going to require real strategy and real leadership and that requires us not to look at marvels success and say lets follow that blueprint thats marvel im very happy for them we dont want to be marvel in my opinion we want to be dc and we want to do it our way as johnson describes theres an ongoing shakeup happening behind the scenes at warner bros and dc entertainment thus black adam is one of the first opportunities to see what the future of marvels top competitor looks like now that zack snyders hold over the dceu seemingly concluded upon the release of zack snyders justice league the only dceu theatrical release between march 2021s snyder cut and black adam was james gunns the suicide squad which came out last august the batman which was released this march exists in a cinematic universe of its own but as much as johnson and the films marketing have teased a new beginning black adam feels both stuck in the snyderverse era and unsure of where the dceu is heading next although black adam was directed by jaume colletserra who previously teamed up with the rock for a ride on the jungle cruise i wouldnt blame you if you thought the new movie was snyders work the film carries many of the former dceu visionarys trademarks abundant use of dark cloudylooking cgi that makes it look like its going to rain at any moment a brooding selfserious protagonist and a lotlike a lotof slowmotion action sequences the first extended fight featuring black adam finds the antihero fresh off of a 5000year nap moving so quickly that everyone around him is operating at a glacial pace in comparison with all the bolts of lightning added into the mix it sure looks like the visual language snyder used to display the flashs movements but even more puzzling than the recycled visual style are the films attempts to be a worldbuilding platform for the dceu and its future projects along with its titular antihero black adam introduces the justice society of americaa team of superheroes with a comics history that dates further back than the justice leagues theres also the outsize presence of task force x the governmentissued name for the socalled suicide squad with amanda waller viola davis continuing her prolific role as something of a more ruthless version of nick fury then there are the expected ties to the shazam franchise with black adam alter ego tethadams originsand the source of his powersaligning with those of shazam alter ego billy batson and lastly theres superman well get to talking about superman dont you worry those are a lot of moving parts to fit into an origin story about a littleknown title character and as charismatic and superhuman even before the cgi as the rock is even he cant carry all the additional weight they bring into a narrative that spans thousands of years by no real fault of johnsons the jsa is the most interesting aspect of black adamand yet the team also has something of an odd debut its positioned as a new group in the dceu but given its ties to waller and the presumed experience of veteran members hawkman aldis hodge and doctor fate pierce brosnan the jsa also appears to have been active for quite some time the jsa effectively fills the vacuum left by the justice leaguebut the film never really addresses that either given how much effort black adam devotes to introducing the jsa it wouldnt surprise me to learn black adam v the justice society dusk of justice was a potential title at some point in the creative process meanwhile task force x appears multiple times in the film though only as an extension of the us government there arent any surprise harley quinn or weasel sightings here waller sends the jsa to black adams native land of kahndaq once she learns that the legendary figure has reawakened and her subordinate emilia harcourt jennifer holland returns for a brief cameo after last appearing on gunns peacemaker series however the film all but ignores the events of peacemaker which ended with wallers daughter adebayo revealing her mothers international crimes and the unethical nature of task force x for the entire world to see waller seems to have more power than ever in black adam and it appears that harcourts transgressions in the suicide squadwhich relegated her to working with a vigilante like peacemakerare either forgiven or forgotten it remains to be seen whether the upcoming shazam fury of the gods can replicate the success of its predecessor but the foundations are laid for black adam and shazam to meet down the road given their shared origins however the bigger crossover setup in black adam is centered on a different superhero superman the last son of krypton returns for the first time since the justice league films not counting the characters but not cavills cameo as a nonspeaking silhouette at the end of peacemaker although snyders slightly improved extremely lengthy version came out last year the messy joss whedon cut was released in 2017 the crossover appearance doesnt come as much of a shock after how much johnson has teased it but it is something of a surprise to see henry cavill back in the redandblue tights once again while were here remember the mustache debacle the films postcredits scene lays the groundwork for a forthcoming battle between black adam and superman as waller warns kahndaqs protector that she can phone in a favor from an otherworldly figure who stands as a worthy opponent to him with superman and black adam meeting face to face as the stinger comes to a close the showdown has already been set at this point its pretty much just a matter of when and where it will happen all of this is to say that black adam is a busy movie theres a lot crammed into a running time that barely eclipses the twohour mark and when you combine all the worldbuilding elements with an origin story that isnt as novel as it makes itself out to be the result is pretty messyanother trait this film shares with the majority of those in the snyderverse era that its supposed to be moving on from but when you consider that the justice league appeared during a cameo at the end of peacemaker earlier this year aquaman and the lost kingdom and the untitled wonder man sequel are both still in the works the flash is still somehow not canceled despite the evergrowing controversies surrounding ezra miller and a sequel to 2013s man of steel was recently announced the question is has the snyderverse era ended at all it doesnt seem like even those working at warner bros discovery know the answer and the real explanation lies somewhere amid the chaos behind the scenes of the volatile dceu as warner bros discovery ceo and president david zaslav explained during a company earnings call in august a longterm strategy is already in motion we have done a reset weve structured the business zaslav announced there will be a team with a 10year plan focusing just on dc its very similar to the structure that alan horn and bob iger put together very effectively with kevin feige at disney we think we could build a longterm much more sustainable growth business out of dc and as part of that were going to focus on quality were not going to release any film before its ready despite johnsons aforementioned comments suggesting the contrary black adam signals dcs attempt at creating the kind of longterm plan that marvel executed so effectively during its decadelong infinity saga the problem is this isnt a hard reset as zaslav and johnson are promoting you can call it phase 1 if you like but dcs previous snyderverse era is as alive as evereven if snyder is out of the picture and while the mcu has grown more inconsistent during phase 4 the multiverse saga at least has three phases of films and a number of wildly successful crossover events to build on dc entertainment is starting its reset with a multiverse approach of parallel cinematic universes despite a shaky foundation and the future of the dceu has never been less clear with the suicide squad its spinoffs and a secret project in the works james gunn has carved out his own corner of the dceu and the prominence of task force x in black adam seems to suggest that gunns role could expand following the success of the batman earlier this year director matt reeves is creating a batverse that exists on its own with a planned project centered on colin farrells penguin the first of several spinoffs to come and three years into bad robots contract with warner bros without a film or series to show for it jj abramss ambitious justice league dark plans may or may not ever come to fruition relatedly rip batman caped crusader we hardly knew ye the real issue looming behind zaslavs supposed 10year plan of course is the fact that there isnt a feigelike figure to lead the dceu into a new era in the first place with walter hamada quietly ending his tenure as head of dc films this past week theres a leadership vacuum that has yet to be filled despite warner bros discoverys best efforts producer dan lin was reportedly close to signing a deal to take over the position at dc films in august but the deal fell through and the search continues with warner bros pictures head michael de luca serving in the interim despite all the internal chaos including canceled projects like the batgirl movie the dceu is still pushing ahead and creators are seizing their chance to scoop up valuable ip in the process right now its the wild west an insider at warner bros discovery told the hollywood reporter everyone is trying to grab as much as they can and this is exactly what happens in a leadership vacuum its only fitting that black adam is as messy as it is considering its caught between the old dceu and whatever we could call this new era perhaps even more appropriate is the fact that in spite of a 39 percent critic score on rotten tomatoes at the time of publication the film just enjoyed the best domestic debut for any johnsonled blockbuster after previous critically panned entries like the original suicide squad defied reviews to fare well in theaters how black adam which has yet to receive a release date in china continues to perform after its opening weekend may be telling but johnsons star power alone seems to be enough to keep the franchise going as the rock becomes entrenched in the dceu theres a scene midway through black adam that serves as an apt almost onthenose representation of the limbo the dceu finds itself in and what this film is attempting to do in a classic superhero trope two good guys are fighting each other before inevitably finding peace through an alliance against a common enemy as hawkman and black adam bring their storied rivalry from the comics to the big screen for the first time this fight occurs in a childs bedroom covered wall to wall with justice league memorabilia as they duke it outin slow motion of coursethe camera lingers on posters and figurines of aquaman wonder man superman and batman with two new dc heroes literally tearing down the old guard black adam wins solidifying his case to sit atop the hierarchy of power in the dc universe before we can care about black adam taking on superman though warner bros discovery needs to figure out what it wants that universe to be rachel and callie discuss the bravo news of the week and dive into some recent episodes then jodi hops on to talk the valley and vanderpump rules
Oct 31 2022,positive, i was able to see this film opening night i was pleasantly surprised how much this film worked for me  black adam stars dwayne johnson who has been cast as the titular character for well over a decade and he made it a memorable one this film had some of the best action and visuals i have seen in a superhero movie in a while in an age where dc has been pushed and raked through the coals countless times by critics this was a breath of fresh air johnson commands the scene with every ounce of his body and it is seen here  another wonderful addition to this movie is the use of the jsa the characters were engaging with a solid casting of aldis hodge pierce brosnan and quintessa swindell taking on other superheroes in this film they added stakes and humor that was welcomed and needed in the always sullen dc films weve gotten in the past the only real issue i have are the non superhero characters who came off as one note or annoying going past all that though this film is absolutely a blast and should be seen in theaters dwayne johnson has shown that if we wait for him to don the suit he will deliver watch black adam on the biggest screen you can
Oct 31 2022,positive, yes black adam dwayne johnson has been freed from his tomb for almost 5000 years and is ready to seek justice for his people of kahndaq with his colossal powers black adam sets up the realm of the dc extended universe with a surprise during the middle of the ending credits i enjoyed the illustrious special effects and the nonstop action the film is playing in theaters now and is not for children due to its violence directed by jungle cruise and orphan filmmaker jaume colletserra johnson plays tethadam a former slave who was granted the powers of egyptian gods to protect humanity although his homeland of kahndaq is destroyed after he seeks vengeance for his murdered family hes awakened by an archaeologist searching for a powerful relic to free kahndaq from a vicious mercenary network tethadams explosive resurrection and the mercenaries slaughter soon puts him on the watch list of the justice society of america jsa a team of superheroes who maintain international peacetheir task is to decide whether tethadam is a potential enemy or ally to the world aldis hodge straight outta compton one night in miami costars as jsa leader carter hall aka hawkman along with pierce brosnan mama mia as the superhero sorcerer kent nelson aka doctor fate quintessa swindell voyagers as windswirling hero maxine hunkel aka cyclone and noah centineo to all the boys ive loved before as supersizechanging hero al rothstein aka atom smasher other key characters include sarah shahi sexlife portrays the archaeologist who awakens tethadam bodhi sabongui the babysitters club plays her son and comedian and actor mohammed amer mo plays her brother marwan kenzari aladdin plays the intergang member on the hunt for a powerful relic known as the crown of sabbac the tone of black adam is of comical superhero shenanigans although its also dark and gritty with cgfueled combative action at its core johnsons tethadam reminds us thats he not a hero johnson is one of the most adept combat actors in hollywood these days therefore its fitting he has his own movie although his tireless efforts to project himself as a family guy a dad etc conflicts with the violence of his character again the film is not for kids
Oct 31 2022,neutral,black adam is in a way a hero for modern times in america at least for those who want to take the law into their own hands tear down this country and remake it into something more like russia or china
Oct 30 2022,negative, the movie poses but doesnt follow up on interesting questions about good and evil such as who decides whats good and whats evil and is itok to cross the line between the two if good comes out of it also what if theres no such thing as absolutes the superheroes are all brave and try to do what they think is right even though they sometimes make mistakes and they all seem open to learning even if things are sometimes ambiguous adrianna is central to the plot both as a voice for moral inquiry about military occupation and political resistance and for family unity the setting of kahndaq is a fictional place but its populated by a diverse group of actorscharacters including star dwayne johnson costars aldis hodge and sarah shahi and many more women characters have power and agency especially adrianna who is a strong brave leader the main group of superheroes does include two white men but the movies story puts decisions in the hands of local people rather than white interlopers a heavyset character is portrayed as lovably comicridiculous high body count and lots of guns and shooting characters get shot and there are bloody wounds frequent fighting punching kicking bashing against surfaces hitting with blunt objects character grabbed by throat electrocuted turned into skeleton character sliced by blade child shot with arrow severed hand character stabbed and thrown over cliff with blood trailing after him a character thrown from a mountaintop lands with an icky thud cars and other vehicles crash zombies some symbologyimagery traditionally associated with satanism parents need to know that black adam is a dc extended universe superhero movie and a spinoff from shazam dwayne johnson stars as the title character who was originally a supervillain in dc comics the movie has a diverse cast and asks interesting questions about heroes and villains but it ultimately becomes a dull smashandbashfest without much time for character development or anything else expect largescale action violence with explosionsdestruction guns and shooting and lots of fighting many characters including women and children are killed sometimes in gruesome  though bloodless  ways electrocution stabbing etc language includes occasional use of st ass bastard piss damn and hell theres a bit of flirting and several posters and toys depicting other dc characters are shown in a boys room to stay in the loop on more movies like this you can sign up for weekly family movie night emails black adam begins 5000 years ago with the city of kahndaq ruled by a tyrant who works to build a magical crown that will give him great powers a boy sparks rebellion and just as the tyrant is about to don the special crown the boy is given the powers of shazam to save the day in the present day the crown resurfaces and tethadam dwayne johnson is summoned once again but rather than a hero he appears to be a killer dispatching everyone who tries to get in his way the crown temporarily ends up in the hands of powerful resistance fighter adrianna sarah shahi whose rebellious son amon bodhi sabongui believes that tethadam can be the citys hero meanwhile the justice society  comprised of hawkman aldis hodge dr fate pierce brosnan cyclone quintessa swindell and atom smasher noah centineo  has been called in to deal with what they see as a threat but something even worse is on the horizon occasionally exploring themes of what it means to be heroic or villainous with shades of gray in between this superhero movie collapses into a boring bashfest with barely any time to breathe like many other villainasprotagonist movies ranging from venom and morbius to maleficent and cruella black adam takes the opportunity to explore such questions as who decides who the good guy is and is it ok to hurt people if some good comes out of it unfortunately once the movie asks those questions it forgets all about them as the characters whiz around the screen hammering away at one another as well as any solid object that happens to be in the way in this movie bodies and debris soar far more frequently than viewers spirits its safe to say that the majority of black adams running time consists of fights chases or battles and sections of blocky exposition much is made of whats supposed to be a tender friendship between hawkman and dr fate but we never feel this its only told to us through dialogue and goopy music in rare moments between punches the same goes for a sweet friendshipromance between cyclone and atom smasher its just too scarce and fragmented to amount to much even the human characters are cookie cutters from the generic movie kid to the lovably comic uncle rotund and ridiculous though the actors playing both parts give them their all as far as black adam goes those who enjoy the rocks comedic chops and charismatic smirk may be surprised to encounter an antihero whos stoic in the face of loss and trauma unfortunately though viewers never really learn who he is or what he wants to be and that question is ultimately less intriguing than it is uninteresting families can talk about black adams violence how did it make you feel was it exciting shocking what did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect why is that important how does the representation in the cast of this movie compare to other superhero films youve seen why is positive

Oct 28 2022,positive, the latest origin story for the dc comics cinematic universe introduces a lot of characters has to thread the needle with its title character and sometimes suffers from the need to have a little too much exposition yet it all manages to work thanks to some solid action sequences and a game cast led by johnson black adam traces the title character back to his roots  beginning as tethadam who is given the powers of shazam and transferred into a super hero to save kahndaq from a tyrannical king fast forward 5000 years and kahndaq is still under siege this time by mercenaries with a local archaeologist named adrianna sarah shahi trying to locate a crown that is believed to have mystical powers her search leads her to free tethadam now ready to unleash his powers on the modern day as he learns the ways of the modern world tethadam interacts with adrianna her son bodhi sabongui and a group of superheros known as justice society of america  hawkman aldis hodge doctor fate pierce brosnan atom smasher noah centineo and cyclone quintessa swindell the journey to the screen for black adam has taken many turns with johnson originally slated to appear in shazam as the villain before plans were changed to give the character a standalone movie the justice society was added later in one of the final drafts to give the film another dimension all of these revisions are relevant especially in the first part as black adam tries to find its legs the character is now more of an antihero learning to be a good guy its a character development that could be tricky but johnson has the charisma and charm to pull it off the inclusion of the justice society also gives black adam a muchneeded boost i really enjoyed their interactions with black adam and look forward to possible spinoff films featuring these characters swindell is the standout in the quartet ill concede the final villain doesnt get the same kind of depth as the other characters and is a little too cgi reliant to be very memorable but it builds to a midcredit scene that could be a game changer for dc films to come its a perfect way for black adam to stick the landing the film might not always hit the right notes but ultimately it serves its purpose as a solid origin story that has plenty of room for growth and expansion
Oct 28 2022,positive, the latest offering from the dc comics movie universe explores the darkness that anyone can experience when facing betrayal grief anger or other anything else stemming from painful events or happenings in life with the right people to help and an open heart even those experiences can hold sparks of hope such is the story of black adam lets be honest from the very start teth adam dwayne johnson as hes called throughout the film is not a hero hes an antihero  with hero potential hes portrayed not as evil but as super angry and the anger causes him to do some really bad things welcome to kahndaq black adams home imagine a middle easternlike country that has been under oppression for centuries and the suffering people have been in rebellion against their oppressors for just as long in the present day the rebellion is led by adrianna sarah shahi an indiana jonestype who wants to find the crown of eternium forged by an evil king in days past  the crown and the right words  shazam  will call forth a longbanished champion what she gets is teth adam full of anger at his 5000year exile who immediately starts killing everyone in sight with his lightning bolts of doom enter the jsa the justice society of america whose mission it is to keep beings like teth adam in check dispatched to kahndaq are hawkman aldis hodge cyclone quintessa swindell atom smasher noah centineo and doctor fate pierce brosnan fate and hawkman have been around for a while and are the best of friends cyclone and atom smasher are the new kids on the block atom smasher is literally slipping into his superhero suit for the very first time his bumbling attempts at herodom provide some light in the darkness for a believing audience the ethics of this film present a quandry adriannas son amon bodhi sabongui idolizes adam after all hes supposed to be the champion the people have been waiting for meanwhile hawkman is trying to get it through adams thick skull that heroes dont kill people well adam is having none of that seeking only to wreak havoc on the current tormentors of his homeland intergang and their leader ishmael marwan kenzari but the jsa doesnt quit aiding in the fight against intergang but without the whole killing people thing casting someone as physically daunting as dwaye the rock johnson in the role of black adam was a stroke of genius but the script gives him little to do but scowl and look menacing pierce brosnan as doctor fate provides the best performance looking debonaire and put together even as he struggles to convince adam that he can become the champion that his people need that he can transform from seeking revenge to serving his people rather than himself parents be aware that this film is not for young ones theres quite a body count while black adam tries to get his priorities straight and in the prehistoric preamble to the film a boy gets stabbed and thrown off a cliff not pretty if you decide to let your older kids see the film it provides a great opportunity to have a conversation about what it means to admire someone for their wrongdoing and what it is that can attract us to such characters or people after all none of us is totally void of wrongdoing in our lives we all have had experiences of anger grief betrayal stemming from painful events or happenings what we do with those emotions is up to us just know that in the darkness there are always sparks of hope people or thoughts we can hold onto to get us through the dark times for us believers the glimmers that keep us going are gifts from our loving god who always holds us in the palm of his hand leading us from darkness into light sister hosea rupprecht is a member of the daughters of st paul a religious community dedicated to evangelization with the media she holds a master of theological studies degree from the university of st michaels college in toronto and an ma in media literacy from webster university in st louis  sr hosea is director of the east coast office of the pauline center for media studies based in staten island ny and speaks on media literacy and faith to catechists parents youth and young adults together with father chip hines she is the cohost of searchlight a catholic movie review show on catholic tv sr hosea is the author of how to watch movies with kids a valuesbased strategy released by pauline books  media  for the past 15 years she has facilitated various film dialogues for both children and adults as well as given presentations on integrating culture faith and media our mission the daughters of saint paul are an international congregation of women religious called consecrated and sent to evangelize in the spirit of st paul through our lives and all forms of media we are present in 50 nations with over 2500 sisters carrying out the pauline mission around the world 
Oct 28 2022,negative, the outcome of all this is never in question of course the plotting here is so basic any third grader could explain the story beats before they happen which is a shame because director jaume colletserra is a gifted craftsman who deserves much better than this because his talents are both wasted and buried beneath layers of ugly cgi an overbearing score and a story that makes the proverbial dull dishwater look positively vibrant  does anyone actually care about these movies how many times can you watch the same thing over and over before getting tired of it do audiences really not want something thats actually surprising or are studios just lazy continuing to churn out formulaic dreck because its tried and true and they know it sells tickets everything about black adam is bullshit  theres no heart no soul not an honest moment in the whole thing johnson does his best   and hes undeniably magnetic especially in adams early more ominous scenes that allow him to try on a new screen persona for a bit but by the time the villain finally shows up in the final act its almost impossible to care about any of it because weve seen it all before in movies that werent nearly so goofy black adam is as paintbynumbers as these things get
Oct 28 2022,negative, theres nothing so wrong with black adam that it should be avoided but nothingbesides the appealing presence of dwayne johnsonthat makes it worth rushing out to see the movies many small flawsand even its few small virtuesarise from its one big problem namely its positioning in the dc corporatecinematic empire it isnt worse than many of the bigbudget cgi superhero spectacles that have more or less taken over studio filmmaking but it accumulates the genresand the businesssbad habits into a single twohourplus package and only hints at the formats occasional pleasures black adam feels like a placefiller for a movie thats remaining to be made but in its bare and shruggedoff sufficiency it does one positive thing that if nothing else at least accounts for its success for all the churning action and elaborately jerryrigged plot theres little to distract from the movies pedestallike display of johnson its reallife superhero it begins with an immense backstory of mumbojumbo set in 2600 bce in a fictitious middle eastern or north african land called kahndaq where a tyrant named ahkton marwan kenzari enslaves his subjects to dig for a mineral called eternium with which hell forge a superpowered crown one young subject however rebels and exhorts his countrymen to revolt he is endowed with his own superheroic power thats summoned with the word shazam and in the resulting melee akhton is killed and his palace is blown to rubble flash forward to presentday kahndaq its occupied by a paramilitary crime ring called intergang and a trio of dissidents led by an archeologist named adrianna sarah shahi and helped by her teenage son amon bodhi sabongui are searching among remote subterranean ruins for the crown in the hope of its aiding their resistance when intergang follows and attacks them there she summons shazam the hero of 2600 bce tethadam dwayne johnson from his four thousandplus of years in an underground tomb he emerges and lays waste to the assailants but this seemingly invulnerable liberator who catches rpgs and hurls blue thunderbolts is viewed with suspicion by the american agent amanda waller viola davis reprising this role from the two recent suicide squad movies in order to stop him she unites the socalled justice societycarter hall aka hawkman aldis hodge whos endowed with wings and a beak kent nelson aka doctor fate pierce brosnan who by means of his golden helmet can see the future maxine hunkel aka cyclone quintessa swindell who swirls up devastating green windstorms and al rothstein aka atom smasher noah centineo who can expand to the size of a city walkup or taller als uncle gets a secondslong cameo and its one of the movies few highlights henry winkler thats where the movies philosophical dimension comes in tethadam is an angry man still seething over what happened in ancient kahndaq and his mores are atavistic with no compunctions about the use of violence the practice of killing the collateral damage of mass destruction he also sees a tv set for the first timewhich with primeval wisdom he blasts to smithereens but the justice society protests they believe as hawkman says in due process and they warn him to lay off the extrajudicial killings try as they might they cant rein the invulnerable fighter in by force but when he himself recognizes the danger posed by his rage he allows himself to be reëntombedand gaggedin order not to utter the magic word again then a brutal revenant from early kahndaq seekswith the aid of smoldering ancient zombiesto restore akhtons dynasty and the justice society needs tethadam back in contrast to the 2019 movie shazam which treats its premise with an apt silliness that yields an unusually amiable superhero comedy black adam sparked by its historical backstory and its enduring implications in currentday political conflict has a thudding earnestness that its specifics belie thus davis and hodge offer performances of grand severity daviss diction alone could smash concrete that belong to the shakespearean movie in which neither has yet been cast brosnan coasts charmingly in a role that offers him nothing but elegant manners swindell and centineo are part of a ya romance thats itself entombed in anticipation of a sequel as for johnson he has the star power and the physical prowess to hold attention with minimal fuss but the role itself with its tragic implications and mighty gestures is rote and empty im still waiting for johnson to find his way into another movie that offers him as exuberant a showcase as did pain and gain his talent is far greater than most of his vehicles no pun intended tethadams struggles with himself the weight of his memories the rise of selfawareness even the simple fact of his encounters with a new world trivialized in a single line of dialogue turn the hero into a mere plaything of the rickety plot which appears to add its byways as part of a justso story crafted to yield a franchise if the wry details that glitter on the movies surfacesuch as amons effort to teach tethadam the proper use of a catchphrase or tethadams introduction to the concept of sarcasmstand out in memory its because the substance that it attaches to dries up and blows away like the ashes of half the universe at the end of avengers infinity war what black adam lacks is the sense of a point of view even the russo brothers armchairarmy bluster in marvel epics suggests a greater sense of personality of personal commitment and aesthetic attitude than the synthetic enormity of black adam jaume colletserra the movies director comes off as a skillful coördinator whose connection to the very essence of superheroes their fantastic natures and outsized powers seems merely technical a problem to be solved rather than a realm of limitless possibilities those limitless possibilities are part of the reason that superhero movies aptly wore out their critical welcomes very quickly as ultrahighbudget tentpole productions meant for international consumption these films have production demands that tend to dominate the imagination of direction with only a few notable exceptions such as antman black panther and man of steel or for that matter brief exceptional interludes within unexceptional films such as doctor strange theres something morally deadening and aesthetically depressing about the bottomless toy chest of cgi being reduced to the toolbox of cinematic bureaucracy by signing up you agree to our user agreement and privacy policy  cookie statement

Oct 28 2022,negative, movies in the dc extended universe warner bros pictures superhero franchise usually suffer from selfimportance and uneven pacing the one exception was 2019s shazama movie about a kid who turns into an adult superhero when he gets magic powers from a wizard black adam starring dwayne johnson is supposedly a sequel to shazamdont expect to actually see zachary levis shazambut despite some attempts at levity the movie feels more like the dceus drearier films black adam is set in khandaqa fictional middle eastern country oppressed by a multinational criminal organization known as intergang adrianna sarah shahi an archeologist with anticolonialism views thinks she can save her country by digging up magical relics instead she unleashes an ancient superpowered being black adam johnson he has shazams godlike powers but adam used them recklessly so hes spent most of the last 5000 imprisoned by the wizard who granted him those powers adrianna along with her son bodhi sabongui and brother mohammed amer who might be the best part of the movie must convince adam to help khandaq before their oppressors become all powerful the united states government complicates the situation by sending the justice society of americanot to be confused with the justice league of americato neutralize this new superhuman threat the jsa making its cinematic debut comprises hawkman aldis hodge dr fate pierce brosnan cyclone quintessa swindell and atom smasher noah centineo black adam is somewhat entertaining but the movie feels like a missed opportunity a good film is hiding in this mess somewhere but director jaume colletserra just couldnt find it  the movie wants to say important thingsnever a good idea in the superhero genrebut the political messaging gets muddled in the clumsy script characters spout rhetoric blaming the worlds problems on colonialism good characters say khandaq needs freedom especially in the face of whats portrayed as police brutality the villain says khandaq used to be something better than freehe wants to make khandaq great again  the jsa and adam face a moral quandary the jsa doesnt kill but adam does adam intervenes on behalf of the oppressed but the jsa doesnt but tossing these ethical and political tropes into the script ends in empty signaling because the movie doesnt grapple with any of them the filmmakers use talking points from the political left but they arrange them so poorly that a farright viewer could interpret black adam as suggesting nationalistic uprising is the proper response to tyranny imposed by multicultural forces inept political subtext isnt the only thing that hurts black adam despite the action the movie gets boring only diehard comics fans have heard of black adam or the jsa so the movie wastes time on dc lore and backstory with tedious flashbacks and exposition the action sequences sound one notebig the big battle at the end isnt really any bigger than the big battle in the beginning or the big battle in the middle having a main character with limitless power lowers the stakes on fight scenes no matter how big i hate to say it because im a fan of the rock but the biggest problem with black adam is probably dwayne johnson johnsons one of the films producers and this movie has been a passion project for him in the comics black adam is something of an antihero but johnson attempts to turn him into a character who can carry the weight of the struggling dc franchise but the actor is a bad fit for the part johnson has spent his entire film career crafting the image of a likable goodnatured hunk who spouts witty oneliners in this movie he just growls and glowers and the effect feels discordant the film grim and pretentious makes a few feeble attempts at humor but they fall flat maybe johnson can lighten up in the next installment because of course there will be a sequel  collin is worlds arts and culture editor he is a graduate of the world journalism institute the southern baptist theological seminary and louisiana state university and resides with his wife and four children in sugar land texas

Oct 28 2022,positive,a straightforward action it starts and it doesnt stop 
Oct 27 2022,positive,dwayne the rock johnson as black adam is perfect casting
Oct 27 2022,negative, its been a long time coming and a passion project of the rock now the dc universe dcu has thrown a tonne of money into the cgi budget to bring this world to the big screen not to be confused with the justice league but confusing anyway here we have the justice society led by the man formally known as bond and his band of supes sent to smack down the unsmackdownable  the rock weirdly theyre not the enemy or are they and if they are why and if not who is and thanks to a hot mess of a story we are left with the even bigger question  who cares the rock does all the heavy lifting here and while he fills out the supersuit just fine somehow the script demanded he leave his trademark charm and charisma in his trailer big mistake i quickly lost the will to keep track of this convoluted plot only to fail even more miserably in my mission to connect with or care about one single character in this disappointingly messy lowhanging fruit of a blockbuster
Oct 27 2022,negative,  black adam has been a long time coming an idea for a shazam movie featuring dcs shadowy superman was tossed around throughout the 2000s with dwayne johnson expressing interest in both roles but ultimately gaining widespread fan approval for the popular dc villain that project ultimately turned into 2019s shazam and johnson stepped up as the producer and star for a black adam solo movie that has revealed itself as a fullblown passion project over the course of the press tour johnson has seemed keen to bill himself as a new major face of the infamously inconsistent dc extended universe his hilarious goto promo line being the hierarchy of power in the dc universe is about to change after all this time is it possible for black adam to truly be the film that convinces audiences of this being a viable cinematic universe   this absolute clunker of an introduction to the egyptian antihero is basically a frankensteined assemblage of dusty bits from other movies youve seen before with any of the idiosyncrasies smoothed out into a gray blob of brand extension its a film that reeks of studio notes and focusgrouping so much so im inclined to believe johnson ghostdirected the thing  a movie so devoid of personality certainly syncs up with his acting style   if theres something nice to say about black adam its that the character gets to kill bad guys with some occasionally admirable brutality this is mostly incidental seeing as its inherent to his antihero status but i did wake up a bit watching a guy disintegrate into a skeleton another guy getting his arm torn off and another guy getting ripped in half altogether i also commend that the story is largely centralized on the conflict of kahndaq rather than becoming explicitly another savetheworld superhero movie  a note to readers bold and uncensored the austin chronicle has been austins independent news source for over 40 years expressing the communitys political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene now more than ever we need your support to continue supplying austin with independent free press if real news is important to you please consider making a donation of 5 10 or whatever you can afford to help keep our journalism on stands
Oct 27 2022,positive, black adam should receive an award for its dazzling ironfisted impatience a dwayne the rock johnson vehicle since the dc extended universe was but a twinkle in warner brothers eye and since shazam was still known as captain marvel its a superhero film almost 20 years in the making but what should be a prestige cornerstone of a big screen franchise touted by the rock himself to change the hierarchy of power of the dc universe is instead a frenetic beat em up barreling its way through fleet superheroics and murderous melees whats most surprising though is that goofy unpretentious crowdpleaser mode isnt exactly a bad look for black adam  directed by genre journeyman jaume colletserra jungle cruise house of wax whose penchant for brisklypaced thrillers has singlehandedly propped up liam neesons latecareer transformation into an action hero black adam rockets out of the gate to dispense with exposition at lightning speed flashbacks color in the history of the north african kingdom of kahndaq which 5000 years ago was home to a ruthless tyrant monarch and the slave  tethadam dwayne johnson  who dared to defy him imbued with godlike power from the wizard shazam last seen in david f sandbergs shazam adam violently liberated his city and became a legend eventually becoming a symbol of hope for modernday kahndaq now fallen to foreign occupation from the globespanning criminal element known as intergang  colletserra is wholly uninterested in worldbuilding instead choosing to spend black adams opening salvo snapping pieces together with reckless abandon revolving its superheroics around archaeologist adrianna tomaz sarah shahi and a laughably stock game of hot potato for a powerful macguffin  the crown of sabbac  black adam wastes no time accidentally awakening its titular hero to crack some skulls even its big superhero teamup which introduces the very first big screen iteration of the justice society of america is written in amusing shorthand youd be forgiven to believe that the movie versions of these heroes  pierce brosnan as dr fate aldis hodge as hawkman noah centineo as atom smasher and quintessa swindell as cyclone  have been around forever its a crude and matteroffact setup thats either refreshingly cavalier or frustratingly lazy but the jsa vs tethadam showdown makes for a meaty center of an uneven superhero tale theres plenty of adrenalinepumping joy to be found as black adam routinely toes the pg13 border reveling in the jsas humorously futile attempts to stop the bloodthirsty antihero from roasting dismembering and pulverizing intergang goons if anything black adam finds its greatest strength in obliterating a line rarely crossed in superhero films the justification  nay endorsement  of violence in the face of oppression  dwayne johnson is clearly having a ball stepping into black adams lightningpowered boots but its a more subdued performance thats clearly missing his typical spark of charisma stoic and gruff johnsons tethadam is a far cry from the imperious arrogant demigod of the comics and black adam also suffers from many of the same flaws that plague almost every modern superhero film the visuals range from lush and beautiful to rushed and wonky and while the final showdown is a cut above the standard big beam explosion fiesta  mostly on account of adams brutality and some clever magical trickery  it still relies too much on its weightless cgi beatdown but black adam buoys itself with a shocking selfawareness never once pretending to be above its unapologetic goofy and deliriously violent yarn nimble and fleet in his contradiction of the mythologizing marvel way jaume colletserra just might have cracked the code on the disposable superhero crowdpleaser and with it the future of the dc universe
Oct 27 2022,negative, black adam is the latest entry in the dc extended universe with all the plentiful stories out there about godlike saviours and human heroics it would have to take a strong fresh and original hook to stand out from the pack in the case of black adam the hook is that the titular hero flouts himself as no saviour an antihero if you will the marketing for this film has been for a lack of better word laughable the titular role of a character that questions the fine line between heroism and vigilantism has been done to death and the touting posing and procrastinating about it is lunkheaded sic and thats where dwayne johnson fits in it is hard to believe that it has taken this long for johnson to play a superhero given the fact that it has taken fifteen years for the titular character to be filmed on screen it is because of that long interval from greenlight to the final product that johnsons performance is likably nostalgic it recalls his early acting career and is filled with fierce gazes preening and monotone line deliveries that would once again invite comparisons to him being the next arnold schwarzenegger so far though there is nothing fresh original or striking about black adam enter filmmaker jaume colletserra who specialises in directing midbudget studio genre fare from horror schlock orphan house of wax to throwaway thrillers with liam neeson nonstop unknown and most recently family adventures jungle cruise with dwayne johnson after examining his filmography colletserra has clearly never made an original film in his life consequently it only makes black adams marketing and the final product funnier the contrast provides constant if unintentional levity to proceedings enough beating around the bush does the latest dc entry succeed on its own terms to put it in one word no the storytelling is tedious and needlessly convoluted the bouts of exposition are delivered poorly through droning narration that will lose most people completely due to constant jargon there are moments of interest involving the contradictions of heroism and the follies of colonialism however these themes are swept under the proverbial rug when the action and superhero hijinks kick in does the films action redeem or pad out the storytelling that would depend on how much cinematic noise one can handle colletserra has always had a visual eye that elevates his humble genre fare with palpable energy however his direction of the action scenes leaves much to be desired the speed ramping and dollops of cgi become repetitive and tedious the bombastic score by lorne balfe does lend some rousing force into it but it just ends up being in the bag of both visual and cinematic noise cinematic noise can be fun but there must be a beating heart from the people that make the noise this is where the characterisations come in the actors try their very best to imbue life into their characters in a way that matches the visual compositions unfortunately the sparse script gives them little to do in terms of personality humanity and even levity the intrepid pair of noah centineo as atom smasher and quintessa swindell as cyclone barely show any spark while a pulse from pierce brosnan as dr fate is scarce aldis hodge is fun and imposing as hawkman the real downer here is marwan kenzari he is a talented actor in films like instinct 2019 and it is not his fault that his role in black adam is bereft of any qualities that would appear menacing it just goes to show that a convincing motivation for a villain is not enough to make it memorable black adam fails to be a memorable cinematic action film with haphazard storytelling increasingly tedious and repetitive action scenes and forgettable characters the latest dc entry lands with a heavy thud
Oct 26 2022,positive, jaume colletserras black adam has all the makings of a special disaster the kind of which youd expect the critical dunk contest backboards covered with twitter and stella artois sponsorship branding and racks of heliuminflated balls to be rolled out for the participants in whatever empty arena would even have an event so few people would show up to and pay for its a vanity project designed solely by the worlds lastremaining trueblue action draw that has been sitting on a shelf in development hell long enough that the rock still had hair when he first announced his intentions to bring the character to the screen colletserras last project jungle cruise also with the former rocky maivia was genuinely pretty miserable and you could feel him chafing against the dimensions of the project as outlined by his cage keepers at disney then theres the creative and financial turmoil that both dc comics and warner bros have endured over the last two or three years in plenty of selfinflicted ways  as a reminder this is the last tentpole film youll see from the studio for the rest of this calendar year  with many pointing to the lack of a stable guiding hand wristdeep within the dc extended universes sock puppet you can see aspects of the film some were expecting within the final product itself theres plenty of failed banter and halffinished cgi strewn throughout though admittedly it looks one thousand times better than anything in thor love and thunder and the occasional turn towards a cameronstyle bonding between killing machine and charge is about as clumsily executed as you might expect but black adam is surprisingly compelling both as a reactionary statement against the state of superhero cinema with geopolitical ambitions and a fun expression of all of the things its railing against and if i were a betting man i genuinely probably would have lost a decent chunk of change on this one formerly known as teth adam rocks lead was once a slave digging for rare and magical materials in the mines of the kingdom of kahndaq some five thousand years ago see the king of this onceprosperous state wanted to make a crown from that miracle material in order to summon a hellish power  known as sabbac from beneath and cement his rule on earth but adam stood up at the moment before his execution he was summoned away to the rock of eternity where he was granted the powers of the old gods in the very same way that zachary levi was in our modern time summoned up from the ether by the magic word shazam and with its transformative power unleashed through lightning adam put a stop to the kings ambitions and was subsequently sealed off in a kind of magical suspended animation buried deep within the walls of the very prison they sealed the kings enchanted crown within five thousand later kahndaq is a failed state run by the mercenaries known as the intergang an international group of assholes dedicated to finding all of the remaining materials and of course the crown itself theres only some amount of opposition among the subjugated who cant compete with the hightech devices of their invaders coming in the form of an archeologist sarah shahi some of her family members and her son bodhi sabongui all of whom are looking for the crown to prevent it from falling into the intergangs hands when they find the crown and the tomb theyre assaulted by the mercenaries and in a hail mary play she frees black adam from his suspended state its at this point that he unleashes hell itself upon the soldiers and draws the attention of amanda waller viola davis who realizes that this dude is one bad motherfucker with all the other bigleaguers not wanting to waste a contractuallybound appearance for this little of a paycheck she turns to the justice society a group of offbrand superheroes used as a publicfacing suicide squad who are keener to playing ball with the us government than the boys in blue tights theyre led by hawkman aldis hodge a winged warrior who is a kindof alien bruce wayne and the rest of their ranks  cyclone quintessa swindell who is basically a human tornado atom smasher noah centenio a legacy superhero who can manipulate his size but not control insects and dr fate pierce brosnan having a good time a sorcerer whose magic helmet gives him his powers allows him to see the future and actually speak with a british accent instead of the clipped fauxamerican of benedict cumberbatch  head to kahndaq to make the world safe for democracy from this weapon of mass destruction needless to say adams not too happy about this but he also doesnt know if he fits in this world his state is ruined his enemies are threatening to reemerge intergang still wants that crown to summon sabbac after all and he doesnt know if he really wants to keep his power given all of the pain and trouble it has caused him across the eons hes a man of the hammurabi code in a world governed by declarations of human rights and things which means hes more brutal than he has to be without a single thought otherwise and scares and injures those around him but kahndaq needs a hero and as the tagline goes they have black adam at this point it becomes clear enough that the film that has had the most impact on the direction of the dceus future is james wans aquaman which wisely positioned itself as a combination of throwback camp evocative of the days of krull the modern styling of blockbuster cinema and a reasonable amount of straightup metal imagery tossed in to boot shazam owed a great deal to what it had established even if their productions were concurrent and black adam continues the trend if marvels films now feel like ones sitting at the thanksgiving dinner table with an overlyexcited teen nephew trying to explain to you why the fortnite mythos or whatever is actually cool and meaningful and worth the effort to engage with even though you are a grownass man with a job and cats to feed dc seems to be aiming for the kind of doeeyed enthusiasm that same kid had about whatever subject he was obsessed with just eight or so years earlier theres a large difference  that kid only cares that youre going to take him to see the movie and doesnt particularly care whether or not youre going to enjoy it though he will demand that you nod your head when he shouts about his favorite moments  and black adam does a solid job of finding that niche it is so wholly goofy and colorful  the broad colors of the justice societys outfits and powers the fact that the bad guys final form is essentially tim currys satan from legend or the massive amounts of chaos that adam wrecks in the course of his asskicking  that it naturally sheds the pretentiousness of continuity this is after all a movie where within the first ten minutes the rock electrocutes a dude to the point that the skin and muscle sloughs off of his bones to say nothing of the absolute ridiculousness that comprises the films final half hour whats even more remarkable is the way colletserra goes out of his way to preserve elements of the dceu style that were once pilloried for their very presence  namely the influence of zack snyder on the action photography and aspects of the thematic inner workings of black adam with regards to the former many of the films best action sequences preserve snyders portrayal of the mythic intensity of superpowers and often evoke the best elements of his inuniverse work without coming across as anything other than loving tribute theres a lot of fun slowmo stuff here that is patently ridiculous much like all of the academy awardwinning however dubious that may be flash bits in his justice league opus though it substitutes the aforementioned wanstyle campiness for some of snyders portentous gravitas which to be perfectly fair works wonderfully in the emotional context of that particular moment in that film the way johnson hovers motionless aside from the space moving around him with his huge traps giving him a weighted hunch creates a fascinating feeling of power even when hes not shoving grenades in soldiers mouths or throwing hawkman into buildings across the way but the skepticism of superheroics also feels distinctly snyderian adam is not all hes cracked up to be as revealed in a midfilm twist and the justice society themselves are mere pawns in an imperialist scheme theres an outright element of fascist imagery here which is endemic to much superhero media but in colletserras rendering it becomes something far more interesting as muddled as it might be much of black adam is in direct conversation with other superhero cinema in a way that dc and warner bros have often specifically gone out of their way to try and avoid aside from one or two characters in james gunns the suicide squad which similarly skewered the kind of gungho adventures of governmentbacked clist superheroes being given the dirty work that the state would refuse to touch with obvious hard power but adam himself is a better analog for captain america  down to imagery from the first film in that series being lifted and recontextualized by colletserra at key moments  than gunns peacemaker ever was given that he is the representation of the soul of his nation past glory reflected through the lens of the present to offer a path forward in troubled times on the other hand its a fullthroated refutation of the utopian ideals of black panther where the precious resources of a fictional country led to their wholesale isolation and subsequent prosperity as opposed to their ruin by colonial powers the inherent contradictions in large corporations trying to make this kind of agitprop are of course present still its far more interesting to see ideas of selfdetermination and liberation  from ones past from ones present  than it is to see the importance of tradition maintained all the way down to blood combat for leadership while ryan cooglers movie is an intended fantasy of an imagined present and is successful as such colletserra has his eyes set to a kind of future where the founding patriarchs of a failed and exploited state war and then rend the foundations that led to their subjugation is it the same kind of muck and muddle that we often find ourselves in within the boundaries of the genre absolutely the coherence of the thesis only really sticks together while ones watching the film unfold though its ultimate prescription for the ills of this fictional country is still vaguely fascinating and quite endearing but as critique firmly entrenched within the language of bigbudget superhero cinema rather than pushed into nichegenre coding like gunns its undoubtedly provocative in a very real way emphasizing the consequences of imperialism both state and corporate and a kind of need for individual stability and safety  which can only come from within  before a nation can fully join the ranks of international society as a full and equal peer though of course without the guiding hand to enable that stability as literalized through the metaphor of adam that same international society will do whatever it possibly can to prevent that from happening in resourcerich nations given that the superhero boom truly kicked off with two war on terrorera works that established a kind of relevancy for a genre otherwise stylistically estranged from all geopolitical realism its a hell of a thing that weve some fourteen years down the line and finally have a fullthroated rebuke of the sort of post911 middle eastern adventure that the escapist trappings of iron man helped to found the mcu on for all of black adams messiness the fact that it can sell this to a primarily american audience and do so in an entertainingenough fashion is extraordinary to witness

Oct 26 2022,positive,while dc explores a darker overserious side of the comicbook superhero genre at least that adds an original tone to this actionpacked apocalyptic romp

Oct 26 2022,negative, after a week off erik childress and steve prokopy return to bring you their thoughts on the latest in theaters and on streaming and catch up on at least one film from the break another catch up is on their review of another great music doc that they recommended from sxsw this year the return of tanya tucker  featuring brandi carlile the horror anthology series returns vhs99 and jessica chastain has to stop eddie redmaynes reign of hospital terror in a truelife tale the good nurse ewan mcgregor and ethan hawke are halfbrothers reuniting to bury their terrible father raymond  ray and harry styles tries to ruin another womans life my policeman laurie strodes life could not possibly be more ruined except by appearing in one more film halloween ends and julia roberts tries to ruin another wedding this time with george clooney ticket to paradise finally dc gives it another go but dwayne johnson is no hero black adam
Oct 26 2022,positive,why the vitriol for what it an entertaining comic book movie it wasnt perfect the story is tangled but it reminded me of those memories when the hero comes around in the last pages of my 25 cent comic in the 1970s audience 90 critics 39 nuff said
Oct 25 2022,positive,the worldbuilding in the film brings in the justice society and some notable hero names but its still a bit boilerplate with the plot and while i enjoyed johnsons ba the character feels like it was written for ego not for growth
Oct 25 2022,negative, dizzying action dazzling visual effects and dwayne johnson supported by a cast of lively coactors lend black adam  the first feature devoted to the dc comics antihero  pace and power the films dynamism is however strictly superficial the longgestating action adventure certainly isnt greater than the sum of its parts the parts that work especially johnsons immense star power do the heavy lifting the genre tropes wrapped and delivered in shimmering packets do not quite pull their weight the focus of black adam is expectedly on the titular character and the star who embodies him on screen  both undeniably mighty the story takes a bit of a back seat in the process without being knocked completely out of the reckoning the spinoff from 2019s shazam wastes no time to jump into a prelude that spells out how adam teth a hero a champion a legend became black adam the film gallops at a steady clip from there on that makes the black adam markedly tauter than most superhero flicks it never loses momentum if anything there are times in the film when one feels that it might have done well to slow down just a tad it delivers information at breakneck speed which tends to overpower the surface inducements of a wellmounted movie with its share of highs the trimmed length  black adam written by adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani is a compact twohour affair  is one of its biggest strengths the nonstop flow of set pieces while seeming pretty familiar does not outlive its welcome dwayne johnson acutely aware that he is the prime draw and steps up to the plate with ease however try as hard as he may he is unable to paper over the superhero movie cliches that the character has to deal with as he fights his own wrath and the aggressive scepticism of the superheroes of the justice society deployed who confront him the actors who play the jsa members especially aldis hodge and quintessa swindell have their moments as do sarah shahi and bodhi sabongui cast as a mother and son duo pierce brosnans doctor fate too makes his presence felt but black adam is dwayne johnsons film all the way there is a nary moment that suggests otherwise the struggle of a tormented but invincible protagonist who walks a thin line between heroism and villainy is the principal conflict point in a spectacular tentpole production that while it serves up all that it is supposed to manages to articulate an antiimperialist stance advocating the cause of colonised people who have been exploited and robbed over eons of their resources but does black adam pave the way forward for a new dceu franchise that seeks to deliver megahits in the years ahead it looks and feels strong enough as a film that is meant to start a new era the fate of the movies that lie in the near future will rest squarely on what warnerdc can bring to the mix that would have to be significantly more than what black adam delivers black adam directed by jaume colletserra in a manner that obviates any possibility of the superhero flick playbook being recast in a new mould begins with an introductory flashback that takes the audience to 2600 bce and the fictional middle eastern country of kahndaq once a centre of power and enlightenment that is now ruled by a brutal despot king ahntok the enslaved kahndaqi population works in the mines to extract a magical mineral eternium from which the nations ruler derives unimaginable powers a slave boy rises from among them and stands up to the king he slays the tyrant and becomes a demigod to his people adam teth is granted the gift of invincibility by the council of wizards but because he driven by uncontrollable rage uses his godlike powers for the purpose of wreaking vengeance he is banished from the land and imprisoned the persona of black adam is born the film jumps 5000 years forward and using the voiceover of a young presentday kahndaqi boy amon bodhi sabongui who believes a hero will arrive one day to liberate a people under foreign military occupation for 27 years informs the audience that the misfortunes of the nation has never ceased amons mother adrianna sarah shahi a resistance fighter and university professor with great knowledge of archaeological remnants accidentally summons the longdormant black adam he proceeds to wipe out several armed men of the intergang the international mercenaries in control of the kahndaq as they try to close in on the crown of sabbac adrianna stands between the mercenaries and the prized artifact the return of black adam provokes amanda waller viola davis to send the justice societys carter hallhawkman aldis hodge kent nelsondoctor fate pierce brosnan albert rothsteinatom smasher noah centineo and maxine hunkelcyclone quintessa swindell to kahndaq to rein in the rampaging adam once the quartet lands in kahndaq black adam moves into top gear and unleashes a veritable torrent of twists and turns troubles multiply for adrianna and her son  the boy who wants his people to be saved finds himself in need of a rescue act when inimical forces kidnap him to force his mothers hand the duo with adriannas electricianbrother karim mohammed amir chipping in at crucial junctures seeks to prevent the crown of sabbac from falling into the wrong hands hawkman tries to stop black adam from continuing down the path of dispensing his brand of instant and destructive justice a descendant of king ahntok surfaces to lay claim to the priceless crown that everybody wants caught between the two doctor fate who has the power to see what lies ahead exhorts hawkman to use the time that they have to change the future later he appeals to black adam not to give up on us because the world needs you will the audience be saying the same when they are done watching black adam black adam is a whirlwind of a movie one just goes along with it it gives you no time to pause and wonder that in the dictionary of superhero movie fans would mean that black adam and the lead actor who holds the film together have delivered their moneys worth the question is would a little more have hurt anyone
Oct 25 2022,negative,will there be more black adam movies i dont know but it might be best to say shazam and hope for the best
Oct 25 2022,negative,a muddled mess of a movie
Oct 25 2022,negative,it raises big ideas honestly it would have been a really cool movie if they had done anything with them  instead they just take the path of least resistance
Oct 25 2022,negative, there is no soul or heart to this movie just fights spouting rhetoric and some hackneyed convoluted backstory that requires constant exposition and rulesetting throughout the

Oct 25 2022,neutral, from the indie darling to the tips you need for day one of the biggest games to classic cheats and codes cultured vultures has you covered when it comes to gaming join cultured vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling whether its wwe news or something from across the sea lets talk shop black adam looks more like a zack snyder film than any dc film not directed by snyder himself theres a great emphasis on slow motion the colors are wildly desaturated and in the films first sequence theres a thick grain over every image beyond the look theres the fact that the opening flashback to 2600 bce feels extremely similar to the opening of znyders 300 as voiceover offers a brief history lesson on the fictional nation of kahndaq it places the film firmly within the visual world of the dc extended universe that began with man of steel and yet manages to tell a surprisingly standalone tale all the more surprising because its so stuffed with characters theres a pretty immediate sense of youre either in or youre out with black adams narrative the voiceover explanation of how wizards imbued a young hero with the power of the gods to fight an evil king seeking the power of demons is high level superhero stuff and when teth adam dwayne johnson as the titular hero is known for most of the film is reawakened in the present the film wastes no time introducing us to four more supers who are sent to contain the possible threat adam presents its a comic book movie with broadly sketched comic book characters who are brought into the story with quick three sentence or less bios hawkman aka carter hall aldis hodge can fly and has a mace doctor fate aka kent nelson pierce brosnan can see the future and use magic atom smasher aka al rothstein noah centineo can grow to the size of a skyscraper and cyclone aka maxine hunkel quintessa swindell can manipulate wind together they form the justice society and remarkably unlike previous dc films these introductions dont feel like advertisements for other movies or tv shows these characters are here for this story and the movie clearly communicates what the audience needs to know before we can see them use their powers in action scenes while weve seen superpowered characters smash into each other and use firelightningmagicetc energy attacks countless times at this point black adams action scenes stand out cyclones genuinely visually novel to the screen power allows her to create you guessed it cyclones that offer a gorgeous mix of bright colors which pop against the otherwise chromey beige backdrop of the film the major focus on slowmotion in these action scenes offer us genuinely epic images of these largerthanlife heroes in action these near still images are essentially comic splash pages that allow us to simply drink in the splendor of the fantastical scenes in front of our eyes that those fantastical scenes are in part in service of a story about the importance and necessity of revolutionary violence against oppressive forces only makes black adam more special in the current superhero movie landscape the movie introduces kahndaq as a nation that has been ruled and occupied by invading forces for millenia evoking palestine and iraq with an early scene at a checkpoint a moment where adam points out that the justice society has never come to kahndaq to help its people and is only here now to maintain global stability without any care for the occupied people is downright shocking in a major superhero movie in the best way black adam is the rare movie whose component narrative parts work well but dont cohere into something as good as the sum of those parts the way the movie moves between its many plots is to be quite honest clunky as hell several scenes show us the burgeoning attraction between atom smasher and cyclone and while the two young actors are charming and have chemistry these scenes feel wholly unnecessary and out of place the introduction of the justice society is done mostly smoothly but the movie struggles to balance its three major conflicts leading the final battle to arrive rather abruptly after a genuinely bewildering lull in the narrative momentum theres also some issues with the score which mixes orchestral music and trap beats in an attempt to follow ludwig göranssons oscarwinning score for black panther but cant quite seamlessly bring the two together causing it to be awkwardly distracting also while much of the humor in the film actually works theres an extended bit about the necessity for a catchphrase that becomes annoying by the films end black adam is by no means a perfect movie or even a perfect superhero movie but it delivers exciting action scenes that feel unique in a blockbuster landscape littered with uninteresting superhero action scenes and its serious consideration of the moral grays of revolutionary violence feel well revolutionary and without spoiling anything its the first film in nearly a decade that has included a midcredits scene that feels like a promise and not a threat some of the coverage you find on cultured vultures contains affiliate

Oct 25 2022,negative, in development for nearly as long as its titular character lay dormant  black adam has finally been unleashed on the world for good or for ill dwayne johnson plays tethadam a man from the ancient civilization of kahndaq who is bestowed the powers of the very gods themselves by the mystical wizard shazam and his magical cohorts who reside at the rock of eternity using these newfound powers adam becomes the champion of the enslaved people of kahndaq and sets them free from their oppressive ruler in a climactic battle for the ages that foils the rulers evil plan to harness the power of untold horrors via a legendary malevolent crown known as the crown of sabbac both the crown and adam go missing in the aftermath of this fight at least thats how the story of tethadams myth goes modern kahndaq unfortunately has seen its people return to subjugation under the eyes of the intergang an international criminal organization partaking in some modern day colonialism in the country it is in this situation that university professor turned freedom fighter adrianna her brother karim and a pair of their close allies go into the desert in search for the crown of sabbac and tethadams tomb intergang forces catch onto adriannas group trying to pull off their best indiana jones impersonation and intercept them shortly after adrianna manages to obtain the crown the crown is conveniently in the same area as tethadams final resting place and in an act of desperation adrianna recites the incantation carved on the cover of the tomb unleashing adam and all of his godly might on the intergang soldiers the awakening of tethadam ends up drawing even more outside attention to kahndaq as the superhero team the justice society of america under orders from viola davis amanda waller sends a small task comprised of aldis hodges hawkman pierce brosnans doctor fate noah centineos atom smasher and quintessa swindells cyclone into the beleaguered country to subdue tethadam unlike the story of a beloved champion repeated within kahndaq the justice society has intel related to the real story of adam and are acting under the guise of preemptive global protection with a premise like that one that tackles how perspective can affect how events and people are viewed there was real potential for black adam to deliver some powerful messages unfortunately the films multiman writing team doesnt seem to be up to the task whether due to too many cooks in the kitchen or meddling from those with more power than them the resulting film is rather middling and by the numbers narratively speaking  black adam is also a weird film in that while tethadam is unquestionably the films main character the film at times doesnt feel like it is about him and outside of a handful of flashback scenes isnt even from his point of view the film also overstays its welcome just a bit by tagging on a big smash fest finale after what seemed like a good stopping point it is of course expected of the genre now that a superhero film needs to end on a big action scene and that is good or even bearable in films with stellar or even just serviceable action scenes sadly black adams fight scenes just left me wanting more dont get me wrong on paper the idea of seeing dwayne johnson just going on a whole hog tear through nameless mooks is a concept i would very much like to see but it is also a concept that one can easily overindulge in as well similarly i actually went into the film looking forward to seeing black adam take on the justice society of america particularly because i am a fan of both hawkman and doctor fate the prospect of doctor fate being properly let loose on the big screen in and of itself basically sold me on seeing this in a cinema but these fights end up also having a similar rinse and repeat feel to them the monotony of the action scenes could have been something i could brush aside if the acting made up for it and for me personally it just did not outside of pierce brosnan who now in hindsight decided to put on an acting clinic when he really did not need to do such a thing the acting in the film as at best inoffensive dwayne johnson in particular puts in a rather muted performance compared to what people expect the character of tethadam is the kind of antihero who is basically an absolute dick to anyone who isnt an explicit ally of his i was genuinely hoping for something more from johnson with his portrayal here as under his wrestling persona the rock he has excelled at being the exact kind of personality needed for tethadam instead he turns in a more serious effort that he just quite honestly doesnt have the acting skills needed to make shine ive gotten this far without mentioning bodhi sabonguis amon adriannas son and for good reason amon while not a bad character is at times rather annoying and at other times functionally a living plot device to move the story along visually the film is suffice to say a mixed bag as well on one hand you have some really great effects utilized with doctor fate and some but not all of the effects used when adam uses his powers are pardon the pun electrifying but then you get into some of the weirder visual choices multiple action scenes have some very questionably chosen slowed down or freeze frame shots this for whatever reason regularly happens when cyclone uses her powers but it applies to nearly everyone  i have also noticed that there has been some peculiar choices made in framing dwayne johnsons face in many shots i have already seen one of these shots spreading like wildfire online as a meme and of course there are just some downright bad cgi shots in this film it isnt often but when they happen they are impossible to ignore in the end black adam isnt an outright bad film there is clearly some potential at the heart of the film and i genuinely think the film is worth at least one watch just for doctor fate alone this film will undoubtedly have its fans but for me it is ultimately more bland than anything else and among one of the weaker superhero outings of this year
Oct 25 2022,negative, im sure the actor dwayne johnson aka the rock will despise me after i write this review for his new film black adam but i actually really enjoy him and his presence as a celebrity ive followed him on instagram for years and have always found him to be charming and endearing as a public figure so imagine my surprise when i saw his latest film from dc films and warner brothers and all that charisma has been sucked out leaving a bland shell of the man ive enjoyed for years others seem to be enjoying this film more than i did but i found it to be completely inert and lifeless especially his character its a real shame to because i actually love the whole cast im a big fan of sarah shahi and shes given nothing interesting to do i love noah centineo and think he is going to be a big star but hes barelyused comic relief  and pierce brosnan can be wonderful but he feels like a warmedover imitation of what benedict cumberbatch is doing in doctor strange the only performance that stood out is aldis hodge as hawkman he is given some diversity of expression not just constantly stoic and bland like black adam he can be light and engaging with centineos atom smasher but he can also be serious even tragic in other scenes the villain is completely forgettable i only saw it a few weeks ago and can remember little but a devillike creature they even have black adam off screen for a large portion at the end which is bizarre because thats when e are supposed to be getting invested in his story if i had never seen a comic book movie i guess id be impressed by some aspects of black adam but as far as developing characters in interesting ways and using its cast effectively it massively fails if you like it than knock yourself out why do you care what i think

Oct 24 2022,negative, there is no more discombobulated genre than the superhero genre right now marvel seems to strike as often as it hits these days and the dc extended universe dceu is all over the map while dc is sticking to its guns when it comes to tonally darker more mature fare the results are often mixed at best that said their recent spate has been surprisingly successful  james gunns the suicide squad was damn entertaining and matt reeves the batman was outstanding even the spinoff tv show peacemaker was a hit  other than those  things get a little spottier im not going to dive into the complicated morass of the snyderverse films other than to say it has its share of ups and downs but we can all agree that wonder woman 1984 was an unmitigated disaster the upcoming flash movie is mired in controversy and batgirl sadly will never see the light of day curiously one of the more unexpected delights was shazam with zachary levi as its naïve charming goofball of a hero  its from the shazam rogues gallery that we arrive with black adam landing in theaters this week veering back into the darker tones black adam stars dwayne johnson as a brooding vengeful antihero a millenniaold former slave imbued with godlike powers that are granted to him by a cabal of wizards who  you get the gist theres a lot of fantastical mumbojumbo and comic booky mysticism that works fairly well onscreen even if i have a hard time writing it out regardless black adam going by his original name tethadam for most of the film has been trapped in a magical prison in the fictional land of kahndaq a lawless place besieged by mercenary armies searching for the mythical crown of sabbac a relic of  you guessed it  untold power in the process of searching for it black adam is awakened only for the world to learn that hes not the hero of legend we thought he was and rather a rageful force of nature who kills without hesitation it lays the framework for an interesting concept  what would we do about a hero who is seeking justice in this case freedom for kahndaq but who does so without remorse or ethics what happens when someone with the power of superman seeks justice but has none of the restraint in this case black adams efforts are opposed by the justice society a loose collection of heroes who band together thanks to an enjoyable familiar face to stop his rampage there are the makings of a great many thematic strengths here  the overpowered antihero the concept of colonialist powers who abandon a country to ruin once its usefulness has run out the cultural trampling disguised as savior syndrome that first world powers have when it comes to impoverished brown countries  all of those threads are there but they get mired in the action and increasingly ridiculous plot and the film suffers for it none of those ideas are explored successfully beyond a few impassioned soliloquies and it almost makes you wish they hadnt even tried rather than to try and fall so dreadfully short this isnt to say that black adam is entirely without merit its oddly fun even within its often brutalist framework and design the action sequences are wellchoreographed and the vfx are surprisingly effective probably even better than much of the recent work weve seen from the mcu there are some standout characters too  the justice society features great work by aldis hodge as carter hallhawkman and pierce brosnan as kent nelsondr fate along with their younger sidekicks  noah centinoatom smasher and quintessa swindell as maxine hunkelcyclone theyre a fun combination and create a clever bright dynamic when compared to the unrelenting grimness of black adam that grimness is part of what drags the film down too  theres no denying that johnson is brimming with charisma  its what overcomes any shortcomings he may have as an actor but put him in a role where that charisma is largely absent and you start running into trouble weirdly that charisma does poke its head up periodically particularly when hes interacting with the kahndaq revolutionary adrianna sarah shahi and her superhero fanboy son amon bodhi sabongui yet at times the film feels like its overcompensating becoming a parody of the john carterterminator relationship of terminator 2 with amon trying to teach black adam catchphrases and modern culture  what ultimately makes the film a hitormiss is what afflicts many dceu properties  an inability to choose a tone it feels like their films work best when they pick a lane and stay there  fullblown seriousness the batman or unfettered zaniness the suicide squad shazam its when they try to blur the lines between the two that they struggle and thats clearly the issue here im sure it didnt help that black adam was held up by covid its inconsistencies are also right there in its history  the script was originally written by comedic writer adam sztykiel made of honor diary of a wimpy kid then rewritten by rory haines and sohrab noshirvani who worked together on the mauritanian and the british series informer throw in director jaume colletserra house of wax orphan the shallows and youve got an absolutely chaotic blending of ideas is black adam objectively bad no not really its got some fun moments and occasionally has the kind of deadpoolesque violence that can be just as amusing as it is twisted its a fairly hard pg13 in the sense that its protagonist kills a lot but its also mostly bloodless nonscary stuff though apparently the first cut was almost given an r unfortunately what heart there is in the film doesnt come from its main character and i dont just mean that hes not warm and fuzzy  this is the least entertaining least appealing role of johnsons career while that makes for great action it also makes for an antihero thats hard to get behind  not because hes an antihero but because its a poor uninspired depiction of one further dragged down by a script whose thematic reach far exceeds its grasp its balanced out by great performances from the jsa cast my son specifically said he wished they were more prominent in the film but the films inconsistencies make it a messy shallow and likely polarizing experience
Oct 24 2022,neutral, this is paul salfen with your klak movie minute in theaters this weekend is black adam the new dc superhero flick starring the rock aka dwayne johnson and what a spectacle it is for those that were fans of the comics this one will bring joy to see characters like this and hawkeye to the big screen but of course just like anything in comic fandom will also come with plenty of backlash because it doesnt look or sound like the source material that said johnson is a star and always a joy to watch on screen but add in the talents of aldis hodge noah centenio sarah shahi pierce brosnan and viola davis along with sharp production and direction and youve got box office gold will that mean critics will love it absolutely not but will you love it if you love big popcorn movies and the rock you bet is it the best dc entry no is is on par with the best of marvel no but its quite loud wild fun and for sure a crowd pleaser so take it for what it is and smell what the rock is cooking thats it for this week and join me next week and every week for another movie minute right here on 975 klak and amfm magazine
Oct 24 2022,positive, while the marvel cinematic universe veers off in countless strange and indulgent directions the dc extended universe sits suffering from a glaring identity crisis what exactly is the dceu whos running the dc ship is there a roadmap which movies and what characters are a part of it there was a time when i could answer those questions but not these days its all so convoluted and confusing which is frustrating considering the iconic characters in their catalog zack snyder had a well defined blueprint he was following unfortunately his vision was too dark too gloomy and too serious for many who cut their teeth on the mcu that along with the joss whedon debacle and a considerable amount of studio meddling insured that snyders vision would never be fulfilled so here we are still wondering where they go from here sure dc films has put out some incredible movies the batman joker etc that arent connected to their extended universe but what about the dceu enter dwayne johnson and black adam a pairing that attempts to bring balance and more importantly direction to the dceu the engrossing superhero epic zack snyders justice league aside black adam is the first dceu film since 2018s aquaman that genuinely feels a part of something bigger  im not knocking smaller and more individual projects but a sprawling universe needs interconnectivity and continuity with black adam it looks like the dceu is finally ready to deliver that once again one of the films biggest strengths was also one of its biggest question marks  dwayne johnson the wrestler turned movie star brings loads of influence and notoriety to whatever film hes in  but he also has a truly largerthanlife personality which begs the question would we be able to see beyond dwayne johnson to see black adam the answer turns out to be a resounding yes and its in large part due to johnson himself who gives a lightsout performance hes surprisingly restrained intense and menacing and slyly funny in some good moments of levity  directed by jaume colletserra and written by the trio of adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani black adam quite intentionally avoids heavy exposition within its origin story framework the most we get comes in a prologue where were taken back to 2600 bc in the country of kahndaq a despot named anhkot enslaves his own people forcing them to mine for a mysterious metal called eternium the corrupt king wants the metal to forge the powerful crown of sabbac but the people revolt legend says a champion named tethadam was granted the power of shazam which he used to kill anhkot and free kahndaq in the present day kahndaq is oppressed by a hightech organized crime syndicate called intergang who are seeking the location of crown of sabbac knowing the dangers if intergang gets its hand on the crown archaeologist adrianna tomaz sarah shahi tracks the artifact to a secret chamber deep in a mountain it also happens to be the tomb of tethadam when she and her team are ambushed by a squad of intergang soldiers adrianna recites an inscription that summons tethadam himself johnson an incredibly powerful being who immediately slaughters all of the intergang soldiers with adams arrival the people of kahndaq believe they have finally found their champion but his powerful presence is discovered by amanda waller viola davis a ruthless government official who dispatches the justice society of america to apprehend him with a team consisting of the nth metal empowered hawkman aldis hodge a master sorcerer dr fate pierce brosnan the wind controlling cyclone quintessa swindell and atom smasher noah centineo who can grow enormous heights by manipulating his molecular structure the jsa set out for kahndaq a big chunk of the movie operates within an interesting moral gray space as it wrestles with the questions is adam the hero longed for by the people of kahndaq or is he a dangerous villain who needs to be taken into custody theyre questions that shape the very battles between the jsa and adam as well as their inevitable teamup later on once a more sinister threat arises the movie offers no easy answers adams willingness to brutally kill his enemies clearly poses a problem for the jsa who are much more bythebook but where were the jsa and earths other heroes during kahndaqs centuries of oppression this opens up some of the films deeper themes and things only get more complicated as facts of adams past come to light all of that makes for the kind of compelling dynamic that superhero movies rarely engage these days but make no mistake this is a popcorn genre film throughandthrough black adam is the epitome of actionpacked with colletserra putting together several terrific set pieces every character gets their moment to shine with hodges hawkman and brosnans dr fate making intriguing new additions but this is black adams show johnson energizes things with his magnetic antihero grit and gnarly kills which push the pg13 rating yet are still very much in tune with his character in its noble effort to avoid the usual origin story trappings black adam bypasses a lot of meaningful backstory leaving us with a few too many questions i was hungry to know about the justice society and what is wallers connection to them that said black adam does a admirable job introducing new pieces and charting new courses for the dceu all within a mostly selfcontained story obviously those quick to roll their eyes at franchisebuilding or dceu movies in general will find plenty to nitpick but black adam accomplishes everything it needs to it offers big action and cracking new characters it puts its own unique stamp on the superhero origin story and it sets the dceu on an exciting new trajectory black adam is now showing in theaters i liked it i admittedly grade dc movies on a curve because they arewelldc movies its a big win for dwayne and for them i did think the character intros were a shade clumsy and could have been better done but it features nonstop action thereafter a little bit of humor and a genuine interest in what comes next glad you enjoyed it and i hope everyone gets out to see it in theatres if they can really glad to hear you enjoyed it too im a bit frustrated at the thrashing it has received from fellow critics its not without problems but i think its far better than how its portrayed its interesting to see how high the audience score is hardly a reliable measuring stick but in this case i think it fits everyone ive talked to who has seen it enjoyed it it almost sounds like some critics had their review ready and minds made up before they saw the movie it kinda sounds like it i dont get it i understand it not being for everyone but this type of criticism of a movie thats not nearly as bad as its being portrayed is puzzling ill wait for it on hbo max or something though im not really interested since i think the crock has become nothing more than a bland and gullible bitch who refuses to take risks as an actor and play it safe  its time for the tribal chief to make the crock acknowledge him dammit  its also time for the crock to do the job for the honorary uce in sami zayn  i love him as my honorable uce its crazy man im not sure what fellow critics were looking for but you could sense this was going to happen even before the first screenings its crazy  i 100 believe black adam isnt for everyone but its completely honest about what it is it doesnt overthink things it sets up some really cool possibilities for the dceu going forward it has some cracking new characters  and it also touches on some surprisingly rich themes such as colonialism foreign intervention or the lack there of and the questionable definition of a hero nothing deep but in a way that very few of these superhero movies do i dunno i had a really good time with it this one didnt work for me as well as i wanted it too but i still had a good time at the movies  i just wish it was lesssnydery ive been pouring through critic reviews trying to understand why black adam is getting harsh reviews whereas other superhero films have comparatively light on criticism in its reviews its annoyingly bias to me i understand this protagonist and style of movie might lend itself to disliking the film but it just feels like critics were shockingly lazy in their analysis of the film youre the 1st critic out of 12 that i found that were positive about black adam but also pointed out its flaws as well this review felt more balanced than the negative reviews i read thanks for that i try to be fair but always honest ill say this i really dont understand the disdain and dismissal from fellow critics i get it not being for everyone but this is far from a bad movie and when i look at some of the other superhero moviestelevision shows that has gotten wildly positive marks all i can do is shake my head finally had a chance to see black adam and from the perspective of all thats happened in the dceu  i really enjoyed it i thought johnson was understated  menacing and very good  the justice society was cool and overall fun to see  i dont get the negativity of most critics i enjoyed it more than most of the recent mcu movies and better than half of the rest of the mcu sadly the cameo of cavill which was so great  is wasted now with gunn taking over and wrongly in my opinion ditching cavill who i love as superman plus its a shame black adam looks now to be a possible footnote with the new directiontoo bad  i would like to see more  id give it too a solid 75  great to hear the mass criticism it has received has been frustrating im guessing much of it is the hyper promarvel sentiment sadly well never get another ba movie and probably no more justice society what a shame i am also surprised that dwayne john is starring in this movie i bet his character is very different than his portrayal of maui in moana hey steven thanks for reading im definitely at odds with the majority of fellow critics on this one and to be honest im not surprised some of the chatter prior to the movies release had me wondering if there was some kind of bakedin pushback to the movie im not saying thats the case because i certainly have no absolute proof but its far better than the criticism would have you believe i went and watched it a second time just to see it only reinforced my enjoyment of the film
Oct 24 2022,negative, black adam has a crisis of personality not just in the movies plot but in itself when were first introduced to tethadam he spends about five minutes throwing cgi characters around like rag dolls zapping them with electricity and generally being a superhero when confronted by sarah shahis character and her onscreen son bodhi sabongui he says that hes not a hero and never claimed to be one kahndaq the fictitious middle eastern country where the action is set needs one can he be that for them of course he can its all but certain that hes going to be that yet still he wants everyone to know that hes not a hero especially when hes being a hero black adam presents itself as this kind of antidote to the cookiecutter superhero movie weve seen dozens of times before that its hero is really an antihero that he kills people when others would let them live and that he fundamentally represents something different except this isnt really true batman captain america and iron man  theyve all killed people in the past sure they might equivocate over and dodge around it but thats really what they essentially do here in black adam however they want you to know that he does it and he doesnt care if you know it challenging stuff dwayne johnson is utterly miscast in the lead role sure hes a physically fearsome presence on screen twice the size of anyone standing next to him but he isnt able to exude the kind of danger and threat that the role seemingly requires of him more to the point were supposed to see this journey from griefstricken avenger to superhero but his performance is so onenote that it just cant get to either end hes just hovering around the place spouting trailerspeak dialogue and frowning at people the only one who seems to have a handle on things is pierce brosnan as doctor fate whos able to chew scenery like its a fresh piece of gum he even turns up in one scene wearing a nifty smoking jacket and a cravat before rattling through his lines and then disappearing into the sludge of cgi effects that surround the movie jaume colletserras made a career out of unremarkably entertaining movies perfect for an aeroplane screen jungle cruise was decent enough fun and undoubtedly the reason he got the job here nonstop the commuter and run all night were some of liam neesons action highlights and orphan is good trashy fun black adam however is clearly leaning on zack snyders visual language to translate a relatively unknown quantity in black adam to an audience theres lots of gold in the costumes theres a lot of handwringing over powers and there are slowmotion scenes set to spotify favourites like paint it black see what they did there and kanye west which will probably be swapped out for something else in the home release the reason for all this isnt that hes trying to blend black adam in with the existing dceu landscape  because that doesnt even exist anymore its probably got to do with the fact that jaume colletserra doesnt really have any unique visual style of his own hes perfectly happy to look at whats been done before take a few pointers and generally just play it again with his cast compared to something like shazam or even lesser entries like aquaman black adam is remarkably drab and bland the cgi looks cutprice and sloppy the dialogue is stock superhero schlock and the plot is equally so even when it tries to say something interesting about the role of interventionism or power structures it doesnt have the strength to commit to them in a meaningful way black adam blasts through the action but it ends itself at a logical point and then strings the action on for another half hour where a cgi villain in the shape of a sataninspired gigachad appears for no particular reason whatsoever all before it resolves exactly as youd expect
Oct 24 2022,negative, we are a society living under a rock as in former wrestlerturnedactor and entertainer dwayne the rock johnson  there are few times when his involvement in a project doesnt guarantee our engagement with a career in film and television spanning over 20 years johnson has built his brand on sarcastic humor whitetoothed charm and ultramasculine strength that hard work ethic and powerful fandom of fervent admirers have led to this johnson as the titular character in a dc comics feature film a sign of prestige popularity and above all else the studios confidence in his ability to rake in the ticket sales the heavyhanded caveat about his lead role in black adam however is that black adam a deviant ancient being with untenable superpowers mega physical strength and the ultimate impenetrability is also morally corrupt and operates as a rogue champion of his enslaved people in the timeworn city of kahndaq a nondescript middle eastern metropolis in laymans terms black adam is the villain not the hero one may expect given our association with johnson as the perpetual good guy it would be much easier to grasp him as a villain if he were explicitly bad or troubled the antihero venom found surprising cult status among fans who reveled in his charming transgression despite its subpar storyline and its abominable sequel in contrast black adam never firmly establishes tethadam his birth name as anything other than a misunderstood protector and at worst a selfconsumed alien deity  like a genie in a bottle black adam is released from his tomb in a moment of great need adrianna sarah shahi a scholar of ancient mythology enters an old cave of wonders in search of a mythical crown forged by demons her aim is to guard the dangerous relic from kahndaqs oppressors whose tyrannical control has forced the people of the ancient city to seek any means of liberation when shes cornered by the gunwielding military operatives adrianna speaks the words  ending in the now famous calling queue shazam  and demands the citys fallen protector to do his work namely blow up all the people hounding her and keep her resourceful son amon bodhi sabongui unlike robin williams ebullient genie johnsons black adam enters the stage with little fanfare stamping out the fight without hardly lifting a finger hes allpowerful and invincible a doozy of a combination played with monotone stoicism by a normally effusive johnson his flat delivery may call to mind another body builderturnedactor arnold schwarzenegger the difference between black adam and the terminator however is that the latter is a robot designed to kill without human ethics getting in the way and the former was a human whose personal backstory death of his family political injustice you know the drill should give johnson a much deeper complex character to dig into  it is the writing perhaps that muddies black adam to the point of near obscurity wiping away any proper establishment of character until all that is left is a meathead magician who can spar with jets of electricity and drop his foes from the middle of the ozone layer assigned to contain and detain the antihero is amanda waller viola davis and flying hawkman aldis hodge who leads the justice society team on a mission doomed from the start despite their combined powers  dr fate pierce brosnan some kind of mystical relative to dr strange atom smasher noah centineo the new kid with the ability to grow ten times his size and cyclone quintessa swindell a wind witch who can manipulate air into a tornado  black adam can flick them away like annoying ants putting his lack of weakness on repetitive display as the film progresses it becomes painfully clear that there is no epic villain to stretch black adam to his breaking point or make him realize that hes actually one of the good guys ishmael marwan kenzari one of adriannas collaborators has ambition for world domination and becomes a fairly generic horned devil king thanks to the plagued crown forging his reign on the backs of corpses he raises from the dead black adam and the justice society must come together to save kahndaq even if as a temporary collaboration and not a binding peace treaty black adam certainly isnt meritless centineos character is included purely for comic relief and even johnson sneaks in some dryhumored laughs there are enough different ways adam pulverizes his adversaries to retain audience attention for some a mildly interesting comic book movie may just be enough but for those hoping that a dwayne johnson superhero film will paint the town black itll feel a little colorless
Oct 24 2022,negative, with a seemingly unlimited cgi budget one of the most charismatic and one of the most high paid actors of our time plus viola davis and pierce brosnan i expected to much more i mean i love dwayne johnson just as much as the next girl maybe even more but from start to finish his signature panache is cloaked in a black shroud as he looms and hovers and glares one or two quips must get us through the entire twoplus hour explodeathon director jaume colletserra who did a decent job on jungle cruise has come up with a film that is ridiculous overcooked and disjointed from the start thats when black adam an original superjuiced mangod who has been out of commission for 5000 years is released and set free to ravage at whim or not he cant decide he has to contend with an unfamiliar world a pack of blist superheroes sent to reign him in and a corrupt regime that is oppressing the citizens of the fictional middle eastern country of kahndaq where black adam was born all those millennia ago throughout the film characters and audiences are relentlessly pummeled by lightning bolts fiery jolts and villainous dolts with such intense abandon that thumbs start subconsciously twitching for a fast forward button and yet it goes on and on with one ludicrous plot twist after another just when you think youre about to be released from black adams immortal coil the damn film starts all over again and theres an army of the dead to contend with please make it stop still it pays to endure to the end that postcredit scene that must be included in all super hero movies is one of the best parts of the film well intentioned to be sure its hard to find much to like about this unfortunate misfire so many resources and opportunities regrettably wasted how is the rock ever going to be elected president when hes involved in such an epic fail  products recommended by at home in hollywood are selected by our editorial team we often receive free samples of these products some of our features include affiliate or sponsored links if you buy something through one of these links we may earn an affiliate commission or other compensation
Oct 24 2022,negative, much like sonymarvels morbius earlier this year warner brosnew line cinemadcs latest cinematic superhero showcase black adam is nothing more than a splashy twohour comingattractions reel for future films its a better motion picture overall than that earlier one was and there are certainly a few moments that forced me to sit up slightly straighter and pay moderately more attention but that doesnt mean im giving this one a recommendation far from it im not familiar enough with the character created by otto binder and cc beck to know how closely director jaume colletserra jungle cruise the shallows and writers adam sztykiel rampage rory haines and sohrab noshirvanis the mauritanian mirror the source material not that it matters its like the team took a superhero storytelling 101 course and this is their final project its connectthedots filmmaking and precious little comes alive or ever feels emotionally authentic thats a shame there are plenty of commendable building blocks that colletserra and his team lay down as a foundation theyve populated their world with a talented crosssection of established superstars and promising newcomers theyve chosen a uniquely intriguing middle eastern setting for all the chaos and carnage they broach several complex topics that pertain to international peacekeeping and all that goes with it they just dont do anything substantive with any of it everything is rushed through and glossed over why the fictional country of kahndaq is under the thumb of a multicultural gang of surprisingly wellequipped thugs known as intergang isnt clear the leftfield connection of the mysterious big bad to the films 2600 bce prologue and the person who has been secretly pulling the strings of this countrys occupation is underdeveloped and poorly revealed these are only a handful of this productions issues its as if a new item springs forth every other minute to shake ones head at in annoyance for every terrific moment  and there are terrific moments  there are at least four or five that are either obnoxious or troublesome or both with rare exceptions there is no momentum to the action and even less urgency also the ancient magical crown the evildoers are trying to get their claws on is a throwaway mcguffin that serves zero purpose until the random second its needed  and then all hell literally breaks loose this comic book tale revolves around tethadam dwayne johnson having been asleep for 5000 years the fabled kahndaqian hero is released from his stone prison by adrianna sarah shahi a tombraiding freedom fighter who has been a major thorn in intergangs side a group of powerful wizards led by the original shazam djimon hounsou bestowed upon adam the power to overthrow an evil king but his anger got the better of him and he almost destroyed the entire country instead of saving it from tyranny few know that part of the story and this includes adriannas adventurous teenage son amon bodhi sabongui he looks at adam and only sees his countrys savior but amanda waller viola davis knows exactly who they are dealing with she sends the leader of the justice society or jsa carter hall aka hawkman aldis hodge and a small band of fellow heroes to kahndaq in hopes they can convince adam to surrender before he starts making an angry and vengeful menace of himself what follows are a series of disconnected scenes in which adam rips through intergang like butter bonds with amon as the latter tries to teach him how to be a superhero and has a couple of fights with hawkman and his compatriots dr fate pierce brosnan cyclone quintessa swindell and atom smasher noah centineo the latter two out on their first savetheworld assignment from waller there is also the search for that aforementioned mystical crown as the person who unlocks its secrets will tap into some seriously demonic potentially worldending powers the first fight sequence between adam and intergang after his awakening is borderline awful colletserra attempts to channel his inner zack snyder and fails miserably but the director redeems himself with the first confrontation between the awakened antihero and the jsa this is a nicely staged slugfest that does a solid job of spotlighting everyones various powers without the aid of individual origin stories from there one confrontation leads to another with spontaneous bits of mostly worthless exposition sprinkled throughout yet all of this leads nowhere and only sets up character motivations and scenarios destined to be explored in future adventures not this one even the climax doesnt resonate and no matter how final the decisions by some of the characters may prove to be these sacrifices carry no weight and even less meaning the cast does what they can especially hodge and brosnan both of whom are excellent but its not enough colletserras sojourn into comic book theatrics is tedious and never justifies its existence other than to suggest whats on the horizon for dcs catalog of heroes in all its zeal to expand this universe the film forgets about the here and now its going to be a hit there will be sequels this character will return but that doesnt change my reaction black adam is a superpowered misfire we are dedicated to creating a distinguished user experience and a website rich in content with solid execution our reviews aim for

Oct 23 2022,negative, the latest dc spectacular is a film conjured by the internet with dwayne johnson linked to the role by eager fans since at least the mid2000s the former wrestlers armour has been slightly dented by the failures of jungle cruise and red notice last year can black adam put him back on top set in the fictional country of kahndaq johnson plays teth adam a former slave bestowed with superpowers who is imprisoned for 5000 years when he uses those gifts for vengeance awakened in the present day he has little interest in being the saviour of his home but protects the mother and son who released him as they are terrorised by a military force with superhero team the justice society looking to imprison him on the orders of amanda waller viola davis teth adam must decide if he is the worlds reckoning or its guardian  the character is linked to the shazam films but clearly intended to reinvigorate the stuttering dc universe disappointingly theres little here that distinguishes itself from the many comic book movies already available theres more magical items more mythology to digest quickly and another vaguely foreign city to save director jaume colletserra plays it safe delivering a story that has explosions in all the right places but nothing distinct  the central moral conflict where we question whether the justice society are actually the good guys feels reminiscent of marvels falcon and winter soldier but nowhere near as nuanced being content with formula means that the scripts insistence that this is a new kind of hero feels laughable particularly when the film reportedly cut some rrated deaths intended to establish the characters vindictive streak like henry cavill in man of steel johnson is better than the film that surrounds him the most electrifying personality in hollywood is muffled by a deadpan persona in the first half of the movie only warming up as he bonds with likeable young costar bodhi sabongui the justice society give it their best with pierce brosnan the standout as dr fate  he may get hammy toward the end but noone can accuse the former 007 of not taking his role seriously newbie heroes atom smasher and cyclone noah centineo and quintessa swindell are a sweet duo while sarah shahi is the films heart as a resistance fighter who uncovers adams prison aldis hodges hawkman is burdened with a lot of moralising dialogue but gives the film purpose in between cgi battles  black adam is a standard superhero movie executed sleekly and designed to bring the most bang for your buck however despite the best efforts of johnson it may be a film thats only remembered for its explosive midcredits reveal 
Oct 23 2022,negative, weve all read the stories over the past few months dwayne johnson has arrived to save the dc universe from itself after years of meandering and uncertainty the dc comics film series has fallen into disrepair batman and superman have been left to stagnate aquaman and wonder woman are churning out sequels as we speak and the suicide squad and shazam movies seem to be living in completely separate universes black adam attempts to rectify these wider problems within the franchise and  for the most part  succeeds its just a shame the film itself is painfully dull black adam or tethadam as hes known for most of the film is an ancient being blessed with powers from the gods and is resurrected after 5000 years of slumber what is his purpose what does he want what master or fight does he want to champion unfortunately most of these questions are never answered whats worse is that johnson plays an unfortunately bland rendition of the memorable dc supervillain throughout the twohour epic while it certainly feels like he gives as good a performance as he can in the film the writing is completely lacking black adam as a person is paper thin and entirely gormless in many scenes where emotion and weight would have helped a lot on one side dc fans will be thrilled to learn the justice society are some of the best heroes ever shown on the big screen made up of cyclone atom smasher hawkman and doctor fate these newcomers are interesting flawed powerful and endearing throughout the entire picture surely some of this creativity and love could have gone into some of the other superhero romps from warner bros in the past few years on the other side the human characters helping black adam in their quest to save the world or something like that probably were just truly painfully irritating adrianna a university professor apparently and her son amon plague the movie with their presence in almost every scene nothing they say is really of consequence and a lot of their dialogue could simply be cut out thankfully the monotony these characters bring to the big screen is often split up by some exhilarating action sequences what black adam lacks in precision he makes up for in showmanship he is firmly brutal to all who oppose him and the cgi work on his powers  and doctor fates  are particularly spellbinding unfortunately as a viewer theres nothing to really get behind in the story the evil crown everyone is looking for feels like an absolute afterthought and the final 11thhour villain sabbac barely says two lines before inevitably being defeated ultimately the only thing more forgettable than his name is his secret plan for world domination regardless of how imperfect black adam is the film does have some brief moments of greatness pierce brosnan shines as doctor fate and hawkman has a powerful presence during every commanding moment johnson plays his role well but it isnt deep enough for my liking with a real battle on his hands and maybe even some stakes the antihero could be an excitingly memorable bigscreen character until then you can wait until this hits streaming services
Oct 23 2022,negative, cheaper trashier perhaps even dumber films have been saved by the presence of dwayne johnson so why is dcs latest so doggedly immune to the redemptive power of the rock the key is in the secret ingredient the priceless element that bestows unimaginable power on its owner in this story with its cobbledtogether disingenuously generic middle eastern backdrop its allegedly a rare stone called eternium but in fact this is a red herring the most valuable element the one that unlocks johnsons considerable appeal is rather more prosaic humour give the man a couple of jokes and he works magic starve him of gags  as this loud baffling screenplay does  and whats left is stonyfaced gravelvoiced posturing johnson plays an allpowerful entity called tethadam the saviour of the country of kahdaq but he has been interred in a sacred mountain for millennia meanwhile his country has been pillaged by invaders tethadam is reawakened by adrianna sarah shahi apparently some kind of scholar but who knows the film doesnt dignify her with much in the way of a backstory meanwhile viola davis has dispatched the justice society to neutralise adam the ancient archaeological sites of kahdaq take the brunt of it all
Oct 23 2022,negative, it turns out that 5000 years ago the city or country of kahndaq was ruled by an evil king anhkot who made his enslaved people dig for a magical crystal called eternium which would then be used to create the allpowerful crown of sabbac you can guess why the king wanted this particular crown since it would bestow upon him great powers etc amid a revolution against anhkot a slave named tethadam johnson lost his son but received the powers of shazam he then became a very powerful warrior who has been entombed ever since fast forward to the present and kahndaq is a modern city now occupied by invaders known as intergang we then meet archaeologist adrianna tomaz sarah shahi who is conducting a dig in search of the infamous crown of sabbac she also has a preteen son amon bodhi sabongui who worships superheroes inevitably adrianna accidentally reads an ancient inscription that awakens tethadam but just in time when interangers surround her decked in black with a yellow thunderbolt tethadam soon to be called black adam annihilates enemies with no mercy until the justice society a band of heroes supervised by the government drop in to stop him it quickly dawns on the viewer that a lot of black adam simply recycles everything that has been done before to an obvious degree dc is now turning into a big studio equivalent of those straighttovideo productions that would try to ape big hits in the 80s and 90s for every conan the barbarian you would get the barbarians this movie is obviously chasing after black panther instead of wakanda we get kahndaq and as in wakanda they covet vibranium here we get eternium light political allegory abounds in how both nations are threatened by fictional imperialist interests imagine a bolder black adam where kahndaq would be a commentary on iraq or gaza but were talking unabashed commerce here even the way black adam crashes into a mini crater and is found by adrianna and goofy colleague karim mohammed amer is almost a shotforshot redo of how natalie portman meets chris hemsworth in thor dwayne johnson is then allowed to flex some of his comedic chops by playing another take on the muscled dummy lacking a sense of humor but is expected to liberate his people from modern invaders he has no sense of irony and kills every opponent by throwing them high in the air because thats how it was done in ancient times he also flies a lot and smashes through walls  by now director jaume colletserra should be mentioned even if his style or voice is nowhere to be found in what amounts to another franchise forhire gig serra is best known for atmospheric thrillers like the shallows and orphan here hes chained to the drained aesthetic established by zack snyder for all dc movies since man of steel we also get the required slow motion action sequences where people leap impale others and fall off cliffs which could have been shot by snyder himself or lifted from his 300 theres little grace or originality to any of the violence in this movie as if were watching an automated system room also has to be made for the whole new superhero team thrown at us for yet another franchise expansion the justice society is just copies of copies theres hawkman aldis hodge in a costume where we admire his courage in delivering lines while wearing it dr fate a relaxed pierce brosnan who wears a gold helmet and can see the future atom smasher noah centineo seeming to imitate mark ruffalo who can grow very big à la antman and cyclone quintessa swindell who can control powerful winds but does little of that during the movie they are linked to the overall dc universe through viola davis who returns as government overseer amanda waller from the suicide squad theres another link in the bonus end credits scene which will either inspire a tired sigh or excited fist pump depending on how invested you are in this franchise the rest of black adam follows the playbook of everything else including wonder woman by giving us a villain ishmael marwan kenzari who turns into a flaming demon from hell black adam then proceeds to pummel through a lot of wreckage what is sorely lacking especially with an antihero story is the satire and dark humor of someone like james gunn who last year gave dc its most original burst of creativity with the suicide squad that one had its own aesthetic and wicked charm this one simply continues a stale line of factory films dc has been suffering from an incoherent form of worldbuilding where random art projects like joker swirl around with bigbudget spectacles like aquaman which is titanic compared to black adam none of it connects and even that should take a back seat to simply telling a good story with craft black adam at least features middle eastern characters at the forefront but in expanding representation it should also try harder at expanding horizons these are expensive productions for sure but it doesnt always have to be about the money
Oct 23 2022,neutral, reviewed by dennis schwartzspanish filmmaker jaume colletserra jungle cruisethe commuter directs this underwhelming bigbudget action superhero b film using the dc comics characters created by bill parker  cc beck its scripted with stilted dialog confusion over whether the black adam antihero character can overcome his anger management issues to be accepted as a superhero and theres little emotional impact created by the writers adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvaniit stars the miscast exwrestler dwayne the rock johnson who is not allowed to play his usual ridiculous cheesy character which is not a good thing for the limited actor  who seems lost here the rock plays the former slave the socalled villain teth adam a role he is not suited for and cant plausibly transform into a superhero that would make us care about himit begins with a narration going through thousands of years of history of the fictional middle eastern country of kahndaq we learn of its slaves the glowing demonic magical blue crown of power and of it being the place where a villain is someone who opposes the repressive regime tetadam dwayne johnson has accidentally been freed from being locked in his prison tomb for 5000 years because he led a slave revolt hes given super powers by the same wizards from the 2019 shazam here played by djimon hounsou and will rise in this  colony city floating above it to kill the evil king tetadam comes into the impoverished modern but futuristic world of kahndaq as a conflicted angry man with godlike powersthe adventurous freedom fighter professor adrianna tammis sarah shahi an artifact hunter searches for the demonic ancient crown with her bumbling brother karim mohammed amer and her heroworshiping son amon bodhi sabongui she meets the powerful tethadam who has no qualms zapping to death any baddie he encounterstethadam the slave who revolted against his oppressive rulers is considered by the downtrodden dwellers in kahndaq as their hero but he still thinks of himself as a villainadams arrival from the dead features an uninteresting secondrate superhero ragtag group of american characters who call themselves the justice society viewing themselves as the defenders of peace they include the team of doctor fate pierce brosnan cyclone quintessa swindell atom smasher noah centineo and the groups leader hawkman aldis hodge all of them conspiring to take down the angry loose cannon tethadam who is prepared to unleash his super powers without caring whether or not to do it in a reasoned way tethadam must decide if hes to side with a powerful demon sabbic sent by his ancient rulers or to save the modern kahndaq people from the countries still exploiting it by battling with the demon the justice society tries stopping the godlike teth from saving the world in the only way he knows how to act but cantits a soulless comic book film more interested in becoming a moneymaking franchise than in saying something special about its tragic story and in the end offers no payoff it disappoints with flat characters only sketchily drawn overwrought rotelike cgi heavy action scenes an unfinished debate on whats morally right or wrong about dealing with certain vital issues and offering little entertainment value or logic in its narrative too many gaps in its story to make things add up only the visuals are arresting and its fast pace at least keeps it moving alongthe  so called tethadam now is named black adam in the third act where he must learn how to be a superhero  the film repeats its message throughoutthe world doesnt need a white knight sometimes it needs something darker it also could use a better superhero film 
Oct 23 2022,negative,with a horrid script lackluster performances and a waste of potentially awesome characters black adam is an explosive 195 million antiheroic dud
Oct 22 2022,positive, set in 1823 the woman king takes us to the kingdom of dahomey in west africa a young new king ghezo boyega is threatened with the prospect of colonialism and annihilation by the mighty oyo empire but in his corner are the fearsome and unrelenting agojie  an allfemale tribe of warriors led by the formidable nanisca davis gina princebythewoods historical epic may not be entirely historically accurate but it carries many truths of the time and the spirit of the warriors with it partaction partdrama partcommentary the woman king manages to conjure the feel and spectacle of an epic whilst managing to retain an intimate atmosphere throughout the action scenes are captured and choreographed excellently and deliver a raw and realistic experience without ever feeling the need to stray into gory territory and how these sequences weave with the dramatic elements of the narrative are handled wonderfully the commentary revolves mainly around colonialism slavery and sexual abuse the warriors and women faced but the bulk of the drama focuses on a young girl nawi mbedu who is enlisted in the agojie after refusing her fathers wishes to marry an older man we follow her rise setbacks and eventual truths thanks to a superb performance from thuso mbedu who nearly outshines the spectacular viola davis who alongside her terrific acting ability is able to show off just how much of a badass she is seeing these two warrior women thrust together on opposing ends of their journeys was a highly intriguing element of the movie powered by two tremendous performances the rhythmic and pounding score from terence blanchard further accentuates the scope of the story and also provides a lift for the sequences or moments that dont quite feel as balanced or welldefined  though they are fairly few and far between the woman king exists to celebrate the brave warrior women of the agojie and to humanize them along the way there is no sexualization or slackhanded messages of empowerment here just strong yet vulnerable fearsome but not fearless fighters who fought back against their oppressors and stood up for their beliefs the woman king is a firstrate epic combining commanding performances and storming action with a powerful story david bruckner has such sights to show us well that was my hope anyway hellraiser a reboot of clive barkers 1987 genre classic becomes the latest horror staple to be reimagined for contemporary times though id argue that the hellraiser franchise as a whole isnt quite as revered as say the halloween series not to say that that brings less pressure but potentially less expectation  having said that this is how you reboot a franchise 2022s hellraiser is not a perfect film or a perfect horror movie but it goes out of its way to not simply be the original hellraiser whilst delivering new lore and fresh takes on an established world the narrative again focuses on the lament configuration being toyed with paving the way for the hellish cenobites to come to our dimension to deliver their unique brand of pain and pleasure  here odessa azions riley attempts to harness the power of the box in order to resurrect her brother who disappeared in mysterious cenobitey circumstances where barkers hellraiser was dripping in leather and sexbdsm bruckners instead deals with addiction loss and the lengths they send us to and it ends up as a successful combination alongside the more standard horror and gore that one would expect from a hellraiser affair in doing this bruckner ensures we spend more time with the characters ahead of the hellish headliners appearances and azion is very strong in her performance however the same cant really be levied at the supporting cast around her in terms of the nasties jamie claytons the priest pinhead is badass she manages to capture the characters ethereal evil presence whilst also delivering a unique spin on an iconic character all whilst being used sparingly  the overall design of the cenobites is excellent their fleshy wet sinewy appearance feels more unsettling than the biker gang approach of before and the character designs are spot on the production design of hellraiser also is strong this is a great movie to look at visually and technically the incamera effects holding up more often than not now hellraiser clocks in at around two hours and it probably didnt need to there are moments where it begins to run the risk of outstaying its welcome and whilst it never reaches that point it was definitely noticeable  and to be picky i would have liked a few more kills for the list here for a movie that could have easily gone the way of the more recent and awful straighttodvd franchise efforts hellraiser delivers admirable restraint at times and an exciting take on a flagging franchise  it has its flaws granted but theres also emotion mystery some great gore and an ace turn from jamie clayton as the priest the hierarchy of power in the dc universe is about to change thats according to dwayne johnson the star of black adam when asked to describeblack adam the milliondollar question is of course will the hierarchy of power actually change following the release of black adam in short probably not no but black adam is certainly not a disasterpiece  it may not be particularly special or unique but it has enough a lengthy opening exposition dump tells us that adam was once known as teth adam 5000 years ago and was a slave in the city of kahndaq before he was bestowed with godlike powers that led him to enact justice born solely from rage after being imprisoned sigh he is finally released by mother and son adrianna shahi and amon sabongui but his presence doesnt go unnoticed  the justice society titter comprising of hawkman hodge dr fate brosnan atom smasher centineo and cyclone swindell rock up to try and put an end to black adams rage whilst a group of angry gunwielding nuts are also after a demonicallyinfused crown that would grant the wieldergodlike powers its a bit heavy in terms of exposition and ott comic book lore and at many points it all started to feel a little silly but some fun action sequences and character interactions help prevent this from smelling like batman vs superman the majority of the movies success falls on the beefy shoulders of johnson his natural charisma carries the performance and despite black adam being an antihero of sorts its nighon impossible to dislike the rock  plus his introduction was a nice slice of badass similarly the connection between brosnan and hodge was strong delivering a solid doubleact performance that only made the sidelining of atom smasher and cyclone even more egregious on the other hand sabonguis amon was bestowed with every bad sequence line of dialogue and decision throughout the movie that character was not a highlight to be fair the dialogue throughout is mostly rough but the comedy outside of amon worked well many of the action scenes were satisfying though the repetition became noticeable as did some dodgy cgi but it was hard to shake the feeling of enjoyment throughout maybe it was simply seeing a new set of heroes that made black adam palatable im not sure but whilst acknowledging the movies flaws it still remained a fun watch even if the big bad of the movie was a bust i cant say whether the hierarchy of power in the dc universe has changed or not but i can say black adam delivers just enough to be on the right side of entertaining just 2022 has been a great year for horror movies except for you halloween ends jeepers creepers reborn dashcam and zach creggers barbarian is next up to the plate  but do we get a horror home run or simply a horror show the story revolves around georgina campbells tess who after arriving at her reserved airbnb finds bill skarsgårds keith already at the property  the issue is that she has no idea who he is she spends the night there with sociallyawkward keith only to later find that the property harbors nasty secrets that werent on the listing theres so much more to the story but barbarian is absolutely one of those movies where you need to go in blind and when you do youll be in for a treat barbarian is another 2022 horror home run and is packed with atmosphere tension grossout moments and surprises throughout  it falters at times in the finale but the vast majority is a dark delight the movies unpredictable narrative elevating what would have otherwise been a strong movie on its own given the setup the movie is full of twists and misdirects to ensure no one feels too familiar with proceedings and the dark sometimes satirical comedy that simmers beneath the surface only adds to the feeling of unease  cregger excellently balances any levity with real chills across the board the performances are strong at times playing on the audiences own experiences with the actors but generally just performers going allin for their characters  the impressive campbell especially another impressive aspect of barbarian is that it received a wide theatrical release as opposed to being dumped on streaming and respect goes to 20th century studios for having the confidence to go big on what is not a mainstream horror movie  the conjuring franchise this aint to say more about the movie would be to begin giving away too much about a cleverly structured affair but if youre a genre fan who doesnt mind it going a bit further barbarian will satiate your needs a constantly swerving thrill ride barbarian is one of the years strongest horror movies and one that is as wickedly entertaining as it is unnerving the boys are back in town well an island actually and a fictional one at that  inisherin the banshees of inisherin reunites director martin mcdonagh with colin farrell and brendan gleeson for a fantastic film that explores friendship anger depression rage and sadness but all doused with some deliciously dark mcdonagh humour the narrative revolves around brendan gleesons colm who one day decides he simply does not like his onetime best friend pádraic farrell the reason being pádraics apparent dullness is preventing colm from enjoying his final years and leaving behind a musical legacy hes a fiddle player pádraic takes umbrage with this alongside a huge dose of confusion and his attempts to regain his friendship lead to some dark places set against the backdrop of 1920s ireland in the midst of civil war the banshees of inisherin boasts two of the best performances youll see this year both farrell and gleeson delivering sumptuous performances that cover so many emotions  colm is both melancholic and menacing pádraic is appealing and frustrating all at once and their odd couple double act is intoxicating to behold both performances carry a sense of fortitude sadness and stubbornness that will leave you either smiling wincing or crying with the characters similarly kerry condons bookish siobhan also delivers excellently as pádraics sister who dreams of more than this small island that offers nothing but beautiful views those views are captured wonderfully by returning mcdonagh dop ben davis the rolling hills of inishmore doubling for inisherin and providing a beautifully rural slice of the world to set this hardhitting tragicomedy alongside the performances mcdonaghs fizzing screenplay further elevates the story and simultaneously allows for many scenes of laughter and moments of awe  every aspect of the film is simply strong and everything combines to create a starkly profound and sometimes devastating experience a story of alienation and mortality this meditative and dark dramedy delivers sensational performances high emotion and one of the years best films  if not the best
Oct 22 2022,negative, a needlessly dark pile of steaming genre trash that takes itself way more seriously than it should black adam is still pretty entertaining in parts it would be inaccurate to say that dwayne the rock johnson has never been in a bad movie hes almost never been in a good movie but hes the rock and that seems to be all that matters to the audience this is a dc comics movie so there are immortal gods an indestructible substance lightning bolts and fire coming out of peoples chests and people hurling other people into buildings the rock plays a slave from a society older than babylon thats old who acquires powers that he cant control so a bunch of wizards imprison him a tomb a determined anticolonialist college professor wellplayed by the appealing sarah shahi unearths him 5000 years later by saying a magic word and the game is on black adam winks and quips and bulges out of a spandex suit that can barely hold his massivity which was enough for the phalanx of chortling comic book guys who were in the theater with me in an early sequence he murders hundreds of people while paint it black plays on the soundtrack a mix of seriousness and irony that befuddles the rest of the movie as well meanwhile something called the justice society which has never before appeared in a dc movie product and which as is the dc way this movie barely bothers to introduce they zip off from headquarters mysteriously located in louisiana to the middle east to stop black adam these are the heroes that the movie deploys to  crank on its black adam antihero with increasing futility the murky script never gives them anything interesting to say fills in their backstories with expository dialogue and gives them very little to do other than kick ass based on their various powers fortunately for us theyre all pretty engaging to watch pierce brosnan plays dr fate basically dcs version of dr strange who has a golden helmet that allows him to bend reality and see through time brosnan brings dignity and gravitas to some ludicrous dialogue and has something close to a complete story arc though only because he gives us his origin story in a monologue aldis hodge last seen effectively playing jim brown in one night in miami is hawkman a top20 dc character the movie doesnt explain who hawkman is why he is the leader of the justice society why he has a super spaceship located in a secret louisiana headquarters or why he has magical hawk armor or wields a mystical mace weve never seen this character in another dc movie though he has shown up from time to time on tv so liking him requires a knowledge of hawkman and a willingness to say whoa thats hawkman considering that he basically exists for other characters to pummel into the ground constantly hodge still does a really nice job with hawkman leaving me and the comic book guys to think id see a hawkman movie the other two members of the team are atom smasher and cyclone both of whom are pretty cute but we dont know much about them other than that atom smasher got his costume from henry winkler and some evil scientist injected nanobots into cyclones blood they make a few quips and occasionally wink at each other in the last 20 minutes we meet the cgi villain who is a demon without a personality these characters are all basically props for black adam and for the rock unlike the rest of the characters black adam gets approximately three origin stories in this movie though the story keeps changing through a series of dusty and predictable flashbacks that allow us to see the rock in a loincloth which must be in his contract we also follow a boring but demographically necessary modern middle eastern family as black adam saves their city and their home by progressively turning it into rubble which they dont seem to mind for some reason they have more lives than the average superhero its one thing for superman to emerge from the rubble time and again its another to see a 12yearold skateboarding whiz survive an insane amount of supernatural abuse with barely a scratch but this is an approach that dc seems to take a lot when it comes to liberating foreign lands james gunns suicide squad ravaged latin america for laughs black adam pillages the arab world for our amusement though theres some sort of anticolonialist message hiding underneath this movies ample capes it exists mostly to serve a series of slowmotion fight scenes bland speechifying and murky cinematography in the end it doesnt really matter unlike ms marvel or moon knight which made excellent use of actual mythologies and histories to spotlight cultures that american entertainment has degraded or neglected black adam features a madeup country a madeup pantheon and madeup and generic problems the socalled third world exists in this universe for one reason alone to show off the rocks rack maybe given how much the world loves the rock and given an awesome end credits sequence promising much more thats enough book and film globe editor in chief neal pollack is the author of 12 semibestselling books of fiction and nonfiction including the memoirs alternadad and stretch the novels  repeat and  downwardfacing death and the cult classic  the neal pollack anthology of american literature a rotten tomatoes certified reviewer for both film and television neal has written articles and humor for every englishlanguage publication except the new yorker neal lives in austin texas and is a threetime jeopardy champion
Oct 22 2022,positive, at this point its reasonable to not realize the dc extended universe is still something in active development from its multitude of canceled or delayed projects to the nearconstant stream of controversies surrounding dceu films and shows to all of the wellpublicized studio dysfunction behind the scenes its amazing that any project makes it to the screen amid all of that chaos and yet black adam has finally arrived in theaters  a feat seemingly accomplished through the sheer force of will of its star dwayne johnson whos been dragging it toward production for more than a decade now its an ok film too  mainly due to johnsons boundless charisma  but it falls far short of being the coursecorrecting cinematic spectacle the dceu is desperately in need of directed by jungle cruise and orphan filmmaker jaume colletserra black adam casts johnson as tethadam a former slave who was granted the powers of egyptian gods to protect humanity only to end up destroying his homeland of kahndaq while seeking vengeance for his murdered family imprisoned for more than 5000 years by the same wizards who imbued him with nearinvincible power tethadam is awakened by an archaeologist searching for a powerful relic to free modernday kahndaq from a vicious mercenary network tethadams explosive resurrection and the resulting slaughter of the mercenaries soon puts him on the radar of the justice society of america a team of superheroes tasked with maintaining international peace who must decide whether hes a potential enemy or ally to the world johnson is joined in the cast by aldis hodge straight outta compton one night in miami as jsa leader carter hall aka hawkman pierce brosnan goldeneye as the superhero sorcerer kent nelson aka doctor fate quintessa swindell voyagers as windcontrolling hero maxine hunkel aka cyclone and noah centineo to all the boys ive loved before as sizechanging aspiring hero al rothstein aka atom smasher outside of the films superpowered characters sarah shahi sexlife portrays the archaeologist who awakens tethadam bodhi sabongui the babysitters club plays her son and comedian and actor mohammed amer mo plays her brother marwan kenzari aladdin plays the intergang member in pursuit of the powerful relic known as the crown of sabbac its a crowded cast but as the title suggests johnsons superpowered character is the focal point of the story and his performance often drags it back to center whenever the meandering overstuffed narrative begins to wander for much of the film black adam feels like a project uncertain of exactly what type of film it wants to be and as such it borrows elements from various dceu films before it that would be fine if the dceu films maintained a relatively consistent tone akin to their counterparts at marvel but franchise studio warner bros prides itself on letting each dceu film deliver a standalone experience the tone of black adam pinballs from the silly superhero hijinks of 2019s shazam to the darker filter of zack snyders grim and gritty heroaverse version of the dc comics universe to the cgfueled brawny action spectacle of 2018s aquaman over and over again allowing little time for any overarching aesthetic to take root johnsons tethadam  who is compelled to remind everyone that hes not a hero and is totally ok with killing people at least once every five minutes  bounces between angsty contemplation of his tragic backstory and trying to nail down a snappy catchphrase alternately injecting humor and bleakness in moments where they seemingly dont belong the films decision to make tethadams willingness to kill villains his primary defining characteristic is also puzzling given that wb and dceu filmmakers have spent a decade insisting that superhero characters killing people is no big deal superman batman wonder woman and countless other dceu heroes have killed hundreds of villains across their dceu films so the suggestion that tethadams approach to justice is somehow at odds with what the world understands superheroes to be feels forced at best in black adam and verges on laughably unaware the more often this sentiment is reiterated in the film black adam also borrows from one of the mostmaligned recurring elements of dceu films to date closing with a cgfueled villain battle that is so mired in digital effects that it would look just as if not more comfortable in a video game cutscene this is an issue that isnt reserved to just dceu films  the marvel cinematic universe has made that mistake more than once too  but its been a particularly disappointing element in some of the studios standout films so far wonder woman and aquaman two of the best dceu films to date both concluded with frantic confusing sequences of cg mayhem that ended otherwise entertaining adventures on a down note while films like justice league and suicide squad the 2016 film not james gunns 2021 reboot turned into glorified game cinematics nearly every time action unfolded johnson is one of the most capable action actors in hollywood these days so its a shame to see him reduced to a head in a motion capture suit all wrapped in visual effects as often happens in black adam johnson is endlessly fun to watch in just about anything he does and its his charm and charisma that elevates black adam above its long list of flaws hes the rare actor who can effortlessly pivot between heartbreaking pathos smirking humor and intimidating selfassurance and he puts all of these  and other  aspects of performance to frequent use in the film without him black adam is one of the worst dceu films to date but with him its an entertaining experience that sits somewhere within the highest tier of entries in a frustratingly disappointing cinematic universe while the crowded cast is light on standout performances from anyone other than johnson brosnan does deliver a memorable performance as the enigmatic doctor fate who feels like the supporting character most deserving of another appearance in the dceu both swindell and centineo are fun to watch in limited screen time too although that has more to do with the spectacle of their powers than their performances in the film which doesnt give them much to work with as characters when theyre not engaged in battle although black adam manages to be an entertaining film thanks to its stars performance even johnson himself cant manage all the heavy lifting required to turn the film into the franchisechanging project the studio seems to hope it will be flashy and fun at times but overly reliant on its star and a cohesive vision for the dceu that it neither projects nor even exists at this point black adam offers mountains of potential without much payoff audiences looking for an escapist adventure without any meaningful mental or emotional connection to the story  preferably with bright colors plenty of explosions and cringeworthy jokes  will likely leave black adam satisfied those looking for something deeper though arent likely to be as happy with the films return on their investment its no secret that the dceu needs something big to turn it around and unlock its potential and unfortunately black adam isnt that project it is however a relatively entertaining film for now it seems like that will have to do warner bros pictures black adam is in theaters now for a spoilerfilled overview of the film including the explosive ending check out our black adams ending explained article the black phone is at its best when its working with as little as possible a majority of the new film from doctor strange director scott derrickson takes place in a grimy basement but it manages to make the most out of its central confined space  filling it with intimidating shadows and secrets for its protagonist to discover over the course of the black phones 102minute runtime based on a short story of the same name by stephen kings son joe hill the film follows a young boy who gets kidnapped by a notorious child killer and has only a few days to escape before he becomes the mans next victim have you ever wondered why dwayne johnson has dedicated over a decade of his life to bringing black adam to the big screen as originally conceived black adam was just a villain who was the darker reflection of shazam back when he was still allowed to be called captain marvel within the last two decades black adams portrayal in the comics has shifted from an unrepentant bad guy to an antihero who isnt truly evil but its a real stretch to call him a good guy the first trailer for black adam shows off some of the title characters impressive powers after he is freed in modern times this may be one of the reasons why johnson was so drawn to him black adam has supermanlevel strength and no desire to hold back the man of steel may prove to be more powerful but black adams ruthless streak may place him on a higher plateau as the films tagline says the hierarchy of the dc universe is about to change in 2019 adam sandler proved he still has what it takes to be one of hollywoods most versatile and charismatic performers with his performance in the safdie brothers adrenalinefueled uncut gems not since 2002s punchdrunk love had sandler played a character so different from his usual goofball archetype and he earned some welldeserved acclaim for his turn as the films selfdestructive lead but uncut gems did more than just reaffirm sandlers status as a more versatile leading man than his filmography would have you believe the film also offered the promise of being the first entry in a new chapter in sandlers career one featuring more variety and legitimately dramatic stories from the happy gilmore star than viewers had seen in previous years while it remains to be seen if thats the direction sandlers career will ultimately take in the coming years hustle certainly seems to suggest that it might be upgrade your lifestyledigital

Oct 22 2022,negative, part of the beauty of the justice society of america in the nearly forty years since the genredefining comic book crossover event crisis on infinite earths erased their home planet earth2 itself largely a creation designed to differentiate older golden age heroes from their more modern silver age counterparts was the way that the team came together to fight the good fight even as the world had largely passed them by theres something inherently relatable in watching more obscure less powerful heroes battle back the tides of time and their own declining relevance ironically given the frantic explosionladen extravaganza that defines black adams attempt at a narrative the jsa represented a quieter time for superhero storytelling superhero filmmaking has come to embrace the obscure making household names of characters such as the peacemaker or the guardians of the galaxy that few people outside of diehard comic fans would have heard of just ten years ago characters like black adam and the jsa dont completely fit under this bill having achieved mainstream success back in the 1940s but the idea that shazamcaptain marvels archnemesis liveaction debut would come through a solo effort lacking billy batson entirely is still a bit hard to believe the champion of kahndaq has straddled the lines between villain and antihero for years a fascinating sly figure ripe for the greying morality of the post911 era dwayne johnson has largely avoided villaintype roles throughout his career his approach to black adam displays a puzzling amount of apprehension toward playing an antihero as well the kahndaq that tethadam is awakened into is occupied by a force called the intergang which the film essentially presents as a blackwatertype oppressive military force with an illdefined mandate in the complex geopolitics of the middle east leaning heavily into antipathy johnsons best effort to sell adams reluctance to rid the intergang with a snap of the finger is the fact that hes been asleep too long to care anymore a lazy excuse indicative of black adams larger shortcomings as a film black adam squanders the dceus meatiest moral quandary with an atrocious script hellbent on saying absolutely nothing interesting about its narrative or stacked roster of characters its quite astonishing how boring this movie really is johnsons wooden performance is largely a hodgepodge of the guardians of the galaxys drax the destroyer mixed with t2era terminator a god with too much power that sucks the soul out of his film director jaume colletserra has no idea how to balance the films large cast of characters the rapport between the jsa is established at breakneck speed veterans hawkman aldis hodge and dr fate pierce brosnan are joined by newcomers cyclone quintessa swindell and atom smasher noah centineo an awkward team dynamic especially in a movie serving as an origin story to a completely different character black adam spends much of the film alongside his liberators adrianna sarah shahi her son amon bodhi sabongui and brother karim mohammed amer a bloated collection of protagonists that leaves little room for the films breathtakingly underwhelming villain the humor in the film is largely a derivative mess johnson stumbling over his badly written lines whenever he tries to crack a joke brosnan is the only actor present with an understanding of the comedy hes expected to deliver hodge delivers the best performance of the film working quite well off johnson and brosnan though the film suffers from its emotional overreliance on carter hall in a narrative thats supposed to be black adams moment to shine the decent cgi is rendered moot by the lifeless fight choreography a further waste of johnsons immense talents as one of the most dynamic performers in the history of professional wrestling the politics of kahndaq are the films biggest failing the narrative comes close to hinting that it wants to take a side against americas propagation of the militaryindustrial complex a game of footsie that it never follows through on further puzzling the situation is the presence of amanda waller viola davis whose efforts in service to the exact same cause were scrutinized in last years the suicide squad there is not much difference between wallers antics in that movie and the intergang here not that anyone working at dc appears to notice or care after years of zack snyders ayn rand ramblings soiling the dceu its a little disheartening to see such a waffling from a film that clearly understands its leads antiimperialist ethos black adam is a disheartening failure for the dceu johnson embodies the awe and wonder black adam evokes but he doesnt do any interesting with his subject theres nothing at the core of this film besides tropes and plot holes a predictable third act that unravels the films earlier tight pacing the jsa is brought to life with obvious love though clearly established with the intention of setting up their own spinoff down the road its a sad kind of train wreck to watch words are easy things to write we shouldnt live in a world where expensive blockbusters are completely undone by atrocious screenplays black adam has plenty of talent and firstrate special effects neither of which can cover up just how bad this screenplay truly is the studio executives should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this easy layup to go completely off the rails words are easy things to write  a charming denigration of your craft and to an extent i agree with you alas stories arent easy to tell apparently i will still see this movie if only for a break from the plethora of movies peddling onthenose messages as storytelling maybe such sentiment accounts for the vast gulf between critical and popular opinion on this one what do you think ps i like your style bad news is always better received when you get the sense the teller was hoping to deliver good news five year estradiol illusions anniversary ian talks about what shes been up to this year mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup life is a tricky game best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things thank you to everyone whos listened to the show over the past halfdecade we dont do as many new episodes as we used to but its always fun to catch up
