"Oct 5, 2023",positive," The pump has been primed for a return to the Shrek universe with a lively sequel to 2011’s Puss in Boots. Are there sufficient numbers of fairy tales that haven’t already been mined for laughs in the four Shrek movies? Yes. It took over a decade for DreamWorks Animation to return to the franchise that built it. Shrek flamed out after four films, but its the spin-off Puss in Boots that spawned this latest incarnation. Bringing back stars Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek as the titular Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws respectively, we learn that Puss has squandered his nine lives by living recklessly and only now that he’s on his last life does it begin to sink in just how risky his lives and attitude have been. After seeking refuge with a cat lady and meeting the overly sweet therapy dog Perrito (Harvey Guillén), he learns of a fabled fallen star that will grant one last wish to the person who gets there first. He’s not alone in his quest as Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo), Kitty, and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) are also after the star. All deliver strong vocal performances, creating a rich aural tapestry against which the mostly strong animation can stand out. The narrative is densely packed, but easy to follow and filled with the kind of laughs that once made Shrek, Shrek 2, and Puss in Boots such highlights in their respective years of release. Guillén is the standout in this cast. The film’s biggest issues come down to the choice of animation techniques for fight sequences, which makes the events feel a little choppy and overly stylized, like we’ve shifted from a traditional computer animated film to a 2D Japanese anime picture. Those sequences are brief and the amazing animation that surrounds them offsets a lot of those concerns. It’s surprising that a character that has been shelved for so long (in spite of the Netflix series) could still prove to be so delightful after all this time. In a sea of imitators and the fading of luminaries Disney and Pixar, it’s nice to see some studios still trying to reach for the stars. Goldilocks and the Three Bears provides the characters and a few sight gags for this film alongside the nursery rhyme Little Jack Horner. All of them get fleshed-out treatments that feel more like a part of the Shrek universe than the stand alone, Zorro-inspired Puss in Boots series. Yet, it feels like a natural extension with The Last Wish and that’s enough to keep the franchise buoyant for the foreseeable future."
"Aug 16, 2023",positive,Puss N Boots 2 is a shockingly phenomenal movie tackling much deeper themes than one would expect from a kids movie. 
"Aug 9, 2023",positive," “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” Grade B+: This film is so good that your last wish should be that “Puss in Boots” tales have at least nine more cinematic lives. Puss in Boots – as perfectly voiced by Antonio Banderas – is living the carefree life of a scallywag hero. He has brazenly faced death so many times that he has gone through eight of his nine cat lives. The only way to protect his one remaining life is to go into retirement and hiding at the home of a very zealous cat lover. The script by Paul Fisher (“The Croods: A New Age”) has all of the basic elements that make this a fun film on a very elementary level while at the same time weaving in a very smart and sensitive story about life choices. It is designed that both young and old should find the tale equally as enjoyable. Banderas was always a great selection as the voice of Puss in Boots because of the swashbuckling tone he brings. The tabby hero sounds like a defender of men and a lover of women. The voice talent is flawless and the story emotionally solid but it is the animation style that truly elevates “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.” Director Joel Crawford (“The Croods: A New Age”) takes the solid computer generated visual style of DreamWorks Animation and gives it a jolt by blending both 3D and 2D. The overall look is the detailed 3D approach that has been used throughout the “Shrek” franchise. But, Crawford blends in the kind of 2D CGI style that has movies such as “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” so popular. After more than two decades, the “Shrek” franchise could have become very stale. Instead, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” proves that with a smart script, a great voice cast and a fresh approach to the animation, it is possible for a production that comes way down the line to be superior to anything that has come before it in the franchise. “Resident Alien: Season Two” Grade B+: The cable series based on the comic books created by Peter Hogan and Steve Parkhouse continues to shine because of Alan Tudyk. His work is a close encounter of the hilarious kind. He plays Harry, a crash-landed alien who takes on the identity of a small-town Colorado doctor. He slowly begins to wrestle with the moral dilemma of his secret mission on Earth. Most of the success comes through Tudyk’s work that includes the challenge of showing how an alien would react to suddenly having to deal with a human body. Then there is the alien language that would have left many tongue-tied. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance”: Mike (Channing Tatum) is recruited to stage a dance production in London. Will be released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 18. “A Man Called Otto”: Tom Hanks plays a widow who is looking for an emotional escape but must first deal with a new neighbor. Will be released on DVD and Blu-ray starting March 14. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Aug 6, 2023",positive," Shrek is a film, cultural phenomenon, and bizarre internet meme that has pervaded every crevice of the modern popular zeitgeist. From bumbling toddler to cynical adult, the animation wonder has nothing but adoration (both earned and misguided) hurled at it. It not only challenged the notion of what CGI animation could accomplish but demolished the mold of what children’s movies could be— cleverly subverting classic fairy tales with bracing irreverence. The farting, utterly vulgar ogre revived the floundering DreamWorks Animation, catapulting them from the pits of oblivion overnight. Shrek 2 introduced the alluring, Zorro-Esque, and Antonio Banderas-voiced Puss in Boots. The swashbuckling, D’artagnan hat-sporting ginger tabby cat became an instant fan favourite, garnering his own spin-off movie in 2011 soon after the main Shrek quadrilogy concluded with a thud. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a long-awaited sequel that could have easily coasted off its recognizable property to a handsome box office return. Instead, DreamWorks, and director Joel Crawford, refused to play it safe, crafting one of the most cathartic animated experiences in recent memory. Brimming with inventive ideas and kaleidoscopic visuals, The Last Wish, not only injects vigour into the long-dormant Shrek franchise but is one of the greatest films of the year, period. The fearless Puss in Boots (Banderas, as silky-smooth as ever) is synonymous with laughing in the face of certain death, spending the better part of his nine lives performing death-defying feats— all of which are gloriously showcased in the raucously gorgeous opening. Not concerned with being on his last life, he comes paw-to-paw with a foreboding wolf (Wagner Moura), a cloaked bounty hunter with two short scythes who has meticulously waited for Puss to be on his final life. Bested for the first time, Puss flees towards retirement, settling into a cat lady’s home and languishing in the mundanity of domestication (rendered as a great homage to Apocalypse Now). He comes across the existence of a legendary wishing star that fell to earth eons ago when he’s accosted by the cockney Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her family of bears (Ray Winstone, Oliva Colman, and Samson Kayo). Alongside the show-stealing, impossibly naïve dog, Perrito (Harvey Guillén), and his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), the three embark on a journey to find the star and reclaim a fresh batch of new lives. All the while, vying against the Wolf, Goldilocks’ bears, and the villainous, sorcery-obsessed Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney). The plot has all the makings of a familiar adventure, and in its framework, it absolutely is. However, its execution separates it from its maudlin contemporaries. Utterly dripping with style, this swashbuckling adventure enters the domain of the awe-inspiring with pure visual potency, painting its great lesson on appreciating the life we have now with an ingenious, emotionally invigorating brushstroke. The dazzling animation excels on all fronts, creating depth with both its astonishing world and multifaceted character design. From the nuanced, utterly frightening Wolf to the grizzled, huntress-like goldilocks to Puss’s visage of inner turmoil, each character is imbued with noticeable layers. The Last Wish not only continues the franchise’s jocular amalgamation of popular fairy-tale characters but underpins it with a surprising level of maturity, fearlessly provoking its young audience into heavy conversations surrounding death, fractured families, and shattered trust. The sheer assortment of fantastical personalities—all varied, eclectic, and wholly interesting—are never wasted, each satisfyingly fulfilling their own arcs in service of a greater one. Goldilocks’s reason for pursuing the wishing star is markedly unexpected, yet fits the narrative with grace, while the irredeemable and feckless Big Jack Horner transforms his famed nursery rhyme into a stark motivator. The Wolf is a vividly realized personification of death, whose piercing red eyes and ominous whistle unearth Puss’s deep-seated fear of the inevitable every time he appears from the shadows. Even characters like the scrupulous Talking Cricket make an indelible imprint, despite their brief time on screen. The ever-shifting, transmogrifying world serves as a wonderful playground for the dynamic, propulsive action set-pieces. Straying from the more realistic style of its predecessors, the storybook-like animation revels in unbridled creativity. Not satisfied with just one domain, the studio brings forth a bevy of environments that morph from perspective to perspective, colliding onto themselves and transforming into something else entirely, and even more staggering. The result is equally treacherous and resplendent, wringing everything possible out of its familiar concept. The Last Wish is a rare animation marvel that astonishes with its visual prowess while deftly delivering mature lessons to a young audience. From the complex character design to its transportive worldbuilding, the film’s stellar multitudinous quality coalesces in a wholly cathartic finale. Though the ultimate route is predictable, the numerous shifting pathways and transformations are what make it truly memorable. Come for the cute cat, stay for the deceptively deep character."
"Jul 25, 2023",positive,"FANTASTIC. Exhilarating Action, Phenomenal Animation, Perfect Voice Acting, & an argument could be made for the best animated film of 2022! "
"Jul 25, 2023",positive," Over the years Dreamworks has lost its notoriety for being an animation powerhouse. Scrapping its all-ages, edgy stories in favor of appealing to younger audiences.  The original fanbase of the animation studio is now adults, and it seems like they haven’t hit the right chord to usher in a new generation of fans. It has been 11 years since the first Puss in Boots and the Shrek franchise that ended in a flop but is still relevant in internet memes. It has taken a decade for the Dreamworks team to revisit the world of Far Far Away in a long-awaited sequel that revamps the entire Shrek franchise through Antonio Banderas’s sword-slinging cat.  Immediately jumping back into the world of Puss in Boots, the film gives the perfect reintroduction to the Spanish cat that feels like reconnecting with an old friend. The new animation style is in full effect with destruction and festivities.  Picking up a few years after the first film, Puss finds himself  at the top of life until he is hit with an existential crisis when he learns he has one life left.  For the first time in his life,  the invincible Puss is now fearful of death as it follows him around in the form of a wolf.   To keep a low profile, Puss moves into the stray cat haven of Mama Luna where he will waste the rest of his last life as an actual cat.  Hope is brought to him as he discovers there is a wishing star that will allow him to get his life back if he finds it. He is not the only one hunting down the star, a collective of characters including Goldilocks and the Three Bears and “Big” Jack Horner chase after him.  Add in Puss’s old Flame, Kitty Softpaws, to further complicate his task.  Puss, Kitty, and a scrappy dog Perro join forces to embark on a vibrant journey to get the star before their enemies do. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the literal wishing star Dreamworks has needed to fill the large gap created by its popular franchises ending.  Waiting over a decade to continue the story of Puss and his world was well worth the wait because this sequel delivers in every aspect. One of the most notable improvements is the animation style that is an into the spiderversification of Shrek with its changes between 24 and 12 frames to match the confidence of Puss.  The new style embodies the essence of who Puss is and allows it to take on a western style fitting the story of an aging hero facing death perfectly. Two styles of animation are combined, 2D hand-drawn and CG, that blend seamlessly together. This change makes the animation feel so exciting to watch as well as allows more creativity for the filmmakers behind the story to take the iconic character to gorgeous landscapes audiences haven’t seen before.  It is very comic book-esque that puts its audience right in the middle of the action through dynamic camera movement.   The darkness of the film makes it an outlier of Dreamworks Animation’s filmography by showing a visualization of the terror that haunts Puss.  The entire film is a gift for visual storytellers to pick up on different gags and details on multiple watches.  Animated films have been lacking recently with casting non-voice actors into leading roles. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish successfully avoids this by bringing back Antonio Banderas who has never been better.  He adds new layers to his character as he is experiencing emotions for the first time in his life. There is a sequence where Puss has a panic attack about his destined fate and it is handled with so much empathy by Banderas’s voice choices mixed with the imagery.  The new mix of characters from Florence Pugh, John Mulaney, and Olivia Colman are the perfect castings as they can bring their personalities into their roles that fit the context of the story.  For having so many characters, the script fleshes out each villain giving them their moments to shine. Whether it's Goldi and her family or the wolf and Puss, there is a lot of depth in these character decisions. Jack Horner is a traditional bad guy, but everyone else is given a chance for the audience to understand their desires or care for them.  11 years was well worth the wait for this animated masterpiece about making the most out of our lives and spending time with those we love.  This has become the blueprint for how to do an animated sequel that is not lazy but has heart and purpose. It is easily top-tier Dreamworks that will work with any age of moviegoer with its smart but not intimidating nature. "
"Jul 24, 2023",positive," “This story is a fairytale…” reads the opening title card of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. The spectacular adventurer, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), has returned to the silver screen. His life is as glamorous as one would expect for a swashbuckling feline, but all of that comes crashing down when a doctor (Anthony Mendez) tells Puss that he’s burned through eight of his nine lives. Puss hears of the famed Last Wish, a special fallen star that can grant one wish. Hot on his trail are other famed fairytale-characters-turned-villains: Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), her three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, & Samson Kayo), and Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Luckily, Puss won’t have to go on this journey alone. Accompanying him are an old friend, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and a new one, Perro (Harvey Guillén). The animation magically mixes the 3D style DreamWorks is known for with stunning elements of paint-like brushstrokes. By no means does this make Puss seem lifelike, but the strokes add warmth to the animation. The characters aren’t sleek, smooth, or perfect. There’s a rustic quality to the illustrations that proves Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is here to tell a different story. Something to separate itself from the rest of the DreamWorks portfolio and create a new style all its own. Like Puss’ own self-realization, the film and its titular character come into their own and stand far from the shadows of their origin.  Of course, the film is geared toward children and there’s a heartfelt message woven throughout the journey of Puss, Kitty, and Perro. The trials and tribulations of their travels are reminders of what’s important in life. It’s about friends, family, and love, and always has been. There are some throwback jokes to Puss’ signature pouty look and physical comedy that will surely delight the kids. Somewhat surprisingly, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish also has its creepy moments. Throughout the entire journey to the Last Wish, Puss is stalked by The Big Bad Wolf, aka Death, (Wagner Moura). The wolf is a looming force with bright red eyes who will not stop until he catches up to Puss. The audience’s hair will stand on end just like Puss’ in the scene that introduces The Big Bad Wolf. It’s the first time in the Shrek Cinematic Universe that this character is afforded the darkness of its fairytale origins. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the last-minute surprise of the year. The film has all the charm the audience has come to expect from the Shrek standout, but with a blindsiding amount of heart and humor."
"Jul 14, 2023",positive," Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (now on Netflix) was the first movie in the Shrek franchise in more than a decade, and by all means, should be nothing more than forgettable piffle for six-year-olds. But for the first time since Donkey first cracked wise and Shrek first cracked a fart, one of these movies is actually ABOUT something, and reaches a near-Pixar level of substantive achievement to boot. But unlike Pixar, this thoughtful kittycat adventure doesn’t prompt us to weep and dribble snot like mad, which frankly, has been getting a bit old. No, this Puss hits the sweet spot between thoughtful and delightful – something nobody expected in the least. The Gist: [WARNING: PENDING EXPOSITION] “This story is a fairy tale…” reads a title card, so I can lead off like so: Once upon a time, an actual star fell from the sky and created a dark, magical forest. And within that star was one wish, to be granted to whoever might find it. [END EXPOSITION] And now, to the adorable-kitten crap: The inimitable Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas, as ever) isn’t just a hero of legend and man-cat if infamy, but a bona-fide celebrity who can walk into a room and sing jaunty tunes and just be his own gigantically egotistical self, then devour the adoration like a wolf to a pile of BBQed sheep. His latest party is interrupted by a giant made of stone and moss and antlers and malevolent whimsy, and upon besting the towering beast with his pointy cutlass and pointier wit, Puss takes a bow and gets his bell rung. By an actual bell. DONG. It fell. And now he’s dead. But don’t worry! Cats have nine lives, y’know. Puss awakens and the doctor asks him to county how many he’s spent – there was the time with the bulls in Pamplona, and the other time when he cheated while playing poker with dogs, a drunken test of whether cats always land on their feet, etc. They’re adding up. Quickly. So quickly, he’s on his last life. Cue the oh-shit moment. And therefore, Puss pauses for a moment of self-reflection, which is something he really ain’t good at. He’s drowning his sorrows in a glass of the heaviest cream when a bounty hunter approaches him. He’s always got bounty hunters on his butt – blame notoriety and a little ethical compromise for that – but this one’s different. It’s Wolf (Wagner Moura), who appears with red eyes and a hooded cloak and a pair of sickles, and it’s pretty clear who he REALLY is. You know. The Big D. And for the first time in his lives, Puss is terrified, and runs away from a fight. All this is actually kind of funny in an existential-horror kind of way, and also in a cute-cat-acting-like-a-cute-cat kind of way. I mean, he gets drunk on heavy cream. It’s a balancing act. Anyway, Puss buries his hat and boots – the legend, the whole persona – and R-U-N-N-O-F-Ts to the home of Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), a crazy cat lady who’ll adopt any stray puddy who knocks on her door. She puts mittens and a bell on him and names him Pickles and he’s mortified and depressed and grows a big long beard, but at least he makes a pal in a chihuahua disguised as a cat, nameless but soon to be known as Perrito (Harvey Guillen). This is about when the plot really starts losing its mind, because a crime family consisting of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo) wants the bounty for Puss. And this is when the fallen star/wish exposition makes itself relevant, because everyone here decides to quest for it, competitively, and Puss motivation is, he’ll wish for his nine lives back so he can resume being his old self. It ain’t gonna be easy, because Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) and a bug that looks a lot like Jiminy Cricket (Kevin McCann) and Puss’ old nemesis Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) join the fray, making sure this all gets very complicated, much to our delight. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Rango. It reminds me of Rango. And yes, that’s intended to be a compliment. One hell of a compliment. Performance Worth Watching Hearing: Far too often, celeb voice work in animated films is little more than a marketing tool hoping to lure us into the theater to hear, I dunno, Woody Allen voice an insect or whatever, with underwhelming results. But as the voice of Puss, Banderas has true spirit and character, and gives one of the more lively voiceover performances in recent memory.  Memorable Dialogue: Wolf confirms our suspicions about his identity: “I don’t mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or in any other fancy way. I’m Death, straight up. And I’ve come for you, Puss in Boots.” Our Take: The Last Wish is ingenious in many ways: The character dynamics are richly layered, with Puss and Softpaws’ cynical me-firstisms countered by Perrito’s pure heart; Goldilocks and the Bears’ struggle to find happiness, you know, something that’s not too hot or too cold but just right; and Jack Horner’s concupiscence for power and fairy-tale artifacts, a never-ending desire for more more more that has incurably corrupted him. They all fight over a treasure map to the fallen star that offers everyone a different path through the forest, shifting its physical reality into psyche-traps for all parties – and this is where Puss stares down his mortality and wonders if he truly values who he is, what he’s done and where he’s headed. Heady stuff? Sure, but not always, and definitely not quite on the nose. Director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado take pains to make everything accessible to all audiences, a fairy tale with some classical Grimm underpinnings. The script is consistently funny, foregoing the snarky self-skewering that defined the Shrek franchise, swapping it for a more timeless sensibility consisting of whip-cracking one-liners and character-based comedy (although the references are still intact – keep your eyes peeled for nods to T2 and Sergio Leone’s spaghetti Westerns). Slapstick action is present, as ever, but not overdone, executed with crisp visual acumen and a welcome touch of experimentation (decelerated frame rates give it an almost comic-booky feel).  The film’s callow intelligence can’t be understated. Puss in Boots, infamous for his bloated sense of self-confidence, finds himself neck-deep in the quicksand of an identity crisis. We love the guy, but he needed to be taken down a peg for him to become someone of true depth and character. And so he becomes more than just a joke machine, blossoming into full, actualized personhood. Except he’s a cat. In boots. And a hat. With a little lappy tongue. And who can still do the poor-adorable-kitty thing with his eyes that’ll gooify you in seconds. But now we’re emotionally involved with his psychological well-being, something we surely never, ever thought would happen with a character in a Shrek spinoff. Who knew Puss in Boots could sink his claws in so deep?"

	                                    	Finally, an animated movie sequel that's worth the wait. One has come to expect little from computer animated franchise films these days – or any franchise films for that matter, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, a follow up to the 2011 film Puss in Boots, is both fun and thoughtful. Both Puss in Boots films have been directed by Joel Crawford with a stellar voice cast lead by Antonio Banderas as the sword-wielding showman, hero and fugitive cat. A spin-off from the ‘Shrek’ franchise, this is the story of a walking, talking cat who sings songs celebrating his own greatness. After he’s vanquished a menacing giant, a fallen bell sounds Puss’s death knell. A lifetime of shenanigans and adventures later, Puss learns that he has ploughed through eight of his nine lives. On doctor’s advice, he hangs up his hat and boots and opts for a sedentary and safe life as a pet, taking shelter with cat lady Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). He learns how to live as a domestic pet, eating cat food and sharing a litter with tens of other felines. “So, this is where dignity goes to die,” he mutters sardonically as he queues up for the communal litter trough. That’s until the cockney crime loving family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo) comes looking for Puss in Boots. They need his help to steal a map to the Magical Star. Fearing death and an end to his ‘legendary’ status, an invigorated Puss embarks on a quest to find the map, the star and make his last wish. A lonely but optimistic dog (Harvey Guillén), with aspirations of becoming a therapy dog, becomes his unsolicited sidekick. As they seek out the map, they also encounter Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss’s competition and former love interest. Screenwriters Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler build a fairy tale/ nursery rhyme multiverse into the story. Besides Goldilocks and the Three Bears, there’s also Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), a supersized avatar of Little Jack Horner who stuck his thumb in a pie and pulled out a plum. Big Jack Horner is malevolent, avaricious pie-maker and collector of prized artefacts from Excalibur to a flying carpet, Magic nanny bag and unicorn horns. Another dark force is the red eyed wolf (Wagner Moura) who haunts and follows Puss. On this ride-or-die adventure, Puss learns many lessons. Among them trust, kinship, and breaking down his own hubris. The banter between Puss and Kitty —Banderas and Hayek—is especially fun. As she ribs him, he responds, “Mock me quietly please.” Through the little dog, Perrito, they learn the value of stopping to smell the roses. Animal wisdom for the soul is peppered into an energetic and fast-paced narrative with colourful 3D rendering that creates an amusing family film voiced by a top-notch cast."
"Apr 14, 2023",positive," Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the second installment of the Puss in Boots franchise and is definitely long overdue and one we didn’t know we needed. Like the 90s cartoon theme songs, this film did not need to go this hard, but it did. This time around instead of flying through the air and playing all the local kitties, Puss is grappling with debilitating anxiety and commitment issues, all while dealing with the impermanence of life and literally facing his demons. Who knew Puss in Boots would have me leaving the theater wanting to sort my F-ing life out?  The premise is simple. Puss (reprised by the iconic Antonio Banderas) is, of course, a household name in the thieving business. His ego is on 1000, and he’s wanted all over the land per yuushh. This time his days are numbered. While it’s true cats have nine lives, Puss has run out and is now on his last life. Knowing this he decides to retire to the grey havens where it is safe because he can no longer take the uncalculated risks he is known for. But whispers on the wind say that the location of the elusive wishing star has surfaced. The wishing star grants any wish to the person who finds it. The star fell to earth eons ago and has yet to be found. With Puss’s life on its last strand, he feels this is his chance to get his lives and his confidence back.  The story is solid with a band of characters all going through their own bouts of anxiety, loss, a lack of belonging, and some serious control issues. Jack Horner for one, (voiced by comedian extraordinaire John Mulaney.) Now Jack Horner is giving – sadistic repressed boy man. The unhinged need to command more than just his destiny but all those around him is due to his childhood trauma (obviously). While he was the apple of his and his fan’s eyes as a child, the pressure to keep putting thumbs in pies and the ridicule turned him into a callous monster. While he is the keeper of the map to the wishing star, he does not care who he has to off to make sure he takes ownership of that star. Throughout the story, there are several people trying to control their situations by all means necessary. Except for newcomer Perrito (voiced by Harvey Guillén), he is really just along for the ride. (More on him soon). Even Kitty Soft Paws (Salma Hayek) who rejoins our protagonist Puss to steal her own wish. Kitty is hired to find the wishing star but obviously plans to double-cross her employer. You wonder why are Puss and Kitty not working together? You’d think she’s the one who got him to slow down and park his litter box. And she was! We learn later in the film he could not commit. (Contrary to his comment in the first Puss in Boots film). While everyone has a right to this iron throne of the wishing star one of the people trying to change their storyline and take back control of their narrative is Goldilocks (voiced by the one and only Florence Pugh!) Goldi is running around with her adopted family – the three bears. We got Mama Bear (Oscar winning actor Olivia Coleman), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo.) They are a band of grifters, a con family if you will. Goldi is promising this wishing star is their last big job to change their lives, yet she has other ideas to get back to her “real” family. She knows her true family is out there, and she deserves to be loved by her real parents and live a normal fairytale life. When I tell you I almost cried when Goldi revealed her truth and Mama Bear, with tears in her eyes says, “if this will make you happy let’s go get your wish.” DONE. This woman said flat out you raised me, but you’re not my family – and a true mama said, your happiness is what a mama is for! My unfertilized eggs gasped. Coming to the realization of your reality and taking stock of what you have has always been a tough spot for me. Not that I am shaming my family and looking for some other family, but the idea of always looking towards the future. Being in complete disbelief that I have everything now that I need to succeed and have the life I want. What’s the saying: it’s hard to see the forest through the trees? Now, this was only the tip of the emotional iceberg in this film.  What takes The Last Wish over the top is the introduction of Puss’s true villain. Puss doesn’t just retire when he recounts all his deaths, a character arrives ready to take Puss to his final grave. Wolf, the classic big bad arrives red-eyed and ready, wielding chained sickles with skills well beyond Puss’s abilities. Plus, he has an entrance whistle that could freeze the blood in anyone’s veins. This chills Puss to his core. This mans is terrifying. I found myself with goosebumps on my forearms every time he arrived. And I kept asking myself why? This is just a cartoon fictional character. I’m watching Antonio Banderas as a cat in boots for Bast sake! Why is this character so menacing and inescapable? Why is this so close to home? When you realize through the metaphor of is all, he is the reaper – death himself… the final chapter. The one you cannot beat.  I started to feel my heart rate rise and my breath quicken. I too have been struggling with the anxiety that comes with the thought of my final day on this earth. Death. It’s considered one of the five core fears in human existence. It’s “the fear of annihilation of ceasing to exist” –  Best Self. We cannot evade death, and for me it isn’t necessarily not knowing what is on the other side. It’s facing that big bad wolf, it’s the whistle on the wind and knowing it’s coming no matter what. Whether we go to heaven or see our loved ones once again is the self-soothing part for some. But the anxiety of the end begins with the imagination of my final moments, then I lose my breath and hot tears begin to well up and fall. It’s a wild thought that I saw this right in front of my eyes in the sweet, animated face of Puss.  In my life, I have been searching for ways to handle the anxiety of it all. As the Virgo I am, I analyze and rationalize my thoughts until it no longer scares me, or at least until it makes more sense and I reach acceptance. Puss ran from it as if a crafty escape would provide the freedom of relief. But in inexplicable ways, that whistle would creep in and hood shadowed red eyes would show up. For me, it came in the form of the Third Rail Project’s production of Grand Paradise. In an immersive live theater experience, I was guided around a number of storylines based on the promise of eternal life. In one moment, I was thrust into my own wake. Yes, I was asked to lay down, given flowers as four box walls were formed around me and visitors invited to look upon my body. At that moment, I was given a chance to analyze my final chapter. A glimpse into my funeral did not hurl me into a massive panic attack. It was calm, it was surreal, a true out of body experience and one that didn’t have the answers sway –  but let me peer through the veil into a universe unknown. I know that sounds epic compared to the Puss in Boots storyline, but it was one and the same. Puss was given the opportunity to truly understand and know the value of life itself and the value of the only life he has left.  So, Puss is walking through this labyrinth all the while pushing down and ignoring his anxieties. When those red eyes appear in the fray, Puss is hurdled into the clutches of death. At the final stretch when we’re so close to the star, Puss blacks out! He is running, just booking it. He’s trying to get away from something he knows he cannot escape. He’s hiding, he’s hyperventilating, and the hairs on his body are standing at attention. He’s gonna lose consciousness. Perrito comes running, and even he looks frazzled. He doesn’t know what to do. He just closes his eyes and lays his head on Puss’s chest. Puss pets him as his heart rate lowers, his breath regulates, and he comes back to reality. This almost made me cry. Like Toy Story 3 levels cry. It asked the question – what do we do when we are faced with our largest fears and self-soothing is not enough? The wolf came to claim Puss because his only treasure was the fact that he felt invincible. That he could just figure it all out on his own and had all the time in the world. This is the crux of his issues. He could not accept death and truly appreciate his life. We only have this one life, and we cannot spend it running from death or trying to beat it. We have to see the forest, enjoy the leaves, and see how the sun shines through the canopy. One day yes, this will fade, and all we have are the memories. People are what make life worth being alive. No matter how many lives you have. Ahh! It’s corny AF, but I care not! Puss in Boots is a teachable moment for all of us. Because even though all of the resources in the world are at our fingertips, we still find a way to ignore our needs and think we can do it all by ourselves. Now is Puss in Boots the reason I am able to get through panic attacks? No. Therapy and meditation is gonna have to come through too. But Puss in Boots telling this stories – right now brought a new level of acknowledgment to this Sh*t we’re all going through, and honestly, I’m thankful for that.  What a time we live in where our cartoon characters can give us the space to explore mental health and the importance of leaning on our community.

"Mar 5, 2023",positive," Home › Recommendation › Films To Watch › The bonus features included with “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” expound upon everything you might’ve noticed or secrets you missed entirely. Between Puss in Boots films there was an 11-year gap. 11 years where original voice actor Antonio Banderas (Desperado; Official Competition) played several supporting roles in other Shrek-related projects big and small, but not where the fearsome fighting feline took the lead. Rather than opt for a flimsy tale that would entertain audiences but would be ultimately forgettable, director Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) and co-director Januel Mercado with a script from Paul Fisher (The Croods: A New Age) and Tommy Swerdlow (The Grinch) made something that would push the boundaries of children’s entertainment, making that PG-rating bulge with each meticulously elaborate scene. Riding the line between the silliness of the Shrek Universe from which it came and something far more Grimm, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish explores the value of appreciating where you are and what you have as taking things for granted is an empty, lonely road. With the DreamWorks Animation adventure now out on home video, you can explore all this and more with the litany of included bonus materials. Though this is an initial review for Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, in order to discuss the home release properly, we need to dig in just a little deeper requiring spoiling specific aspects of the film. Now that you’ve been warned, read on, if you dare. Assassin. Mercenary. Lover. Hero. Swashbuckling tabby Puss in Boots (voiced by Banderas) has been called many names and has lived many lives. Eight of them, to be exact. Now on his last life, in order to escape the clutches of the seemingly unstoppable bounty hunter Wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura), Puss retires to an old cats home, intending for the Legend of Puss in Boots to die with his dignity intact. What he doesn’t plan for, however, is that the enigmatic Wolf isn’t the only one looking for him and that the crime family of Goldie and the three Bears (voiced by Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo) want him in order to track down a fabled fallen star. Seeing an opportunity to regain the lives he’s lost, Puss gets back in the saddle, unaware that all he could wish for might well be his already.

All Rights Reserved. Of all the characters that have teamed up with Shrek over the years, I’ve never quite gelled with Puss. Especially since I’ve been a fan of Banderas since Desperado (1995) and I enjoy his comedic, self-deprecating side quite a bit, I’ve always found it odd that it took me until late 2022 to finally watch 2011’s original solo Puss outing in order to prepare myself for The Last Wish. Amusing an adventure as that was, it’s still not something I’d likely revisit unless one of my kids asks to. So when it came time to watch The Last Wish, to describe my interest as near-zero is the closest to capturing the mood. What I was not prepared for was the mature narrative, a deep and dark look at the repercussions of vainglorious lifestyle as he’s literally hunted by Death in form of the Wolf. I couldn’t, for the life of me, figure out who this film was for — the adults who likely first met Puss in 2004’s Shrek 2 or their children whom might find the whole story a little too much? The mixture of expectation and reaction made for something volatile in my mind, making the film a harder watch as it went along. Yet, the online response has been incredible with critics and general audiences hailing the film’s beauty, its truthfulness, and its daring. My favorite animated films of 2022 include Pompo: The Cinephile, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, The Bob’s Burgers Movie, Unicorn Wars, and Turning Red (among others), so the medium of animation isn’t the issue nor is the exploration of heady topics. With this in mind, and the opportunity for a home release review having come up, I decided to revisit the film with tempered expectations and a grip on the narrative. I can’t say that I would queue this up for fun in the same way that I’ve replayed Pompo, Bob’s, or Turning Red frequently, but in the same way that one might find themselves in the mood for an adult, thoughtful investigation of complex ideas and therefore put on Unicorn Wars, so would I put this on. (Although the inclusion of Harvey Guillén’s sweet Perrito does endear the film just a tad more than even I am willing to admit.) So, with that in mind, I revisited the film with the feature-length commentary from Crawford, Mercado, producer Mark Swift, editor James Ryan, and head of story Heidi Jo Gilbert turned on. Listening to them discuss the process of breaking, shaping, and editing the story is eye-opening. The intention, hinted at with the words “This is a Fairytale” pasted at the start, is for The Last Wish to be a part of the Shrek Universe while also being something all of its own. They also discuss the intentionality of the darkness of the narrative and the application of the visual framework to convey that, using the painting motif to give it a different language from the Shrek films while also making it look like the drawings in a Grimm Fairytales storybook. With the exploration of intentionality, they point out the many times death is a major component of the story, either by placing a skull near Puss (such as in his opening musical number where it’s behind his head) or creating the illusion of one with blocking and set design, by hiding the Wolf out in the open for fast eyes to see, or intentionally using Perrito (he’s such a good boy) and a dog’s often soft, sweet demeanor as the perfect foil to Puss and Kitty Softpaws’s (Salma Hayek Pinault) cat-like independence and selfishness. My favorite thing about home releases is the opportunity to learn about the filmmaking process and the inclusion of feature commentary often feels like a rarity as more home releases include a trailer, perhaps a single brief behind the scenes featurette, and that’s it. Here, however, there’s so much to learn that where someone such as me found the initial watch discordant in seeing how the pieces fit, in learning of the intent, I can finally view the bigger picture and, at the very least, appreciate what is accomplished even if I can recognize that the film as a whole may not be for me.

Perhaps my favorite detail to learn relates to the sequence between the giant and Puss during the opening. As the music blares and the giant attacks, Puss’s movements (and the giant’s) are deliberately staged on beat with the music. I likely wouldn’t have noticed this on my own and it’s mentioned that this is a concept lifted directly from Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver (2017), a film whose entire blocking and choreography is built around the music and score. Details like this are what make commentary tracks so valuable, as they may be the only way that some film fans and cinephiles are able to get to learn about productions. The other bonus features offer their own rewards (looks at the cast at work or offering their thoughts on making the film, three deleted scenes with introductions, an all-cat cam for feline enthusiasts, as well as several artistic projects that may entertain younger fans), but the commentary is where you’ll want to spend your time after an initial watch. There’s so much that they share and this may be the only way to know it. For this review, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment provided a 4K UHD edition that included both a Blu-ray and a digital copy. Be advised that an issue I’ve had with other digital editions is present here when viewing bonus features through iTunes: all audio and no video. This occurred with several of the “A Cast of Characters” featurettes, the new short The Trident, “Jack Horner’s Line-O-Rama,” and a few others. When I tried to access them via the 4k UHD disc, there was no issue. Another lovely thing about the home release, the bonus features aren’t limited to one disc format. Often with combo packs, the bonus features may be on the Blu-ray only or somehow lock materials to digital or physical-only. That doesn’t appear to be the case here as you can access any and all no matter the format you prefer. Of course, I can’t speak to the DVD edition as that wasn’t included, so keep that in mind. As expected, though, the 4K UHD looks great with this release. I may not fully grasp the intention of using the style beyond “let’s make it look different because we’re telling a pseudo-outside the Shrek Universe story,” but I can’t argue with the at-home representation. Especially in the initial scene with the Wolf and the clown car of characters at the fallen star, the 4K UHD with HDR provides the kind of depth of field and appropriate shading of colors that make one feel that they’re watching something unique.

All Rights Reserved. I’m of the mind that not all films need to be “for me” to appreciate them. I like the overall concepts of The Last Wish more than I do the execution, but that seems to hinge more on how I feel about Puss specifically. If you were one of *many* who made repeat trips to the theater, who has discussed and analyzed everything from the initial musical number to the perfectly executed panic attack scene, who has sought after a stuffed Perrito toy because we know Universal has them: then snagging The Last Wish is an absolute forgone conclusion. For those like me who may need something more than being a completist and making sure you have all the Shrek movies under one roof, the bonus features are where it’s at."
"Mar 5, 2023",positive," THE BOXTROLLS (2014) / KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS (2016). With Coraline and ParaNorman both hitting 4K this past December, Laika’s other stop-motion wonders are now joining them in the format. Adapted from Alan Snow’s novel Here Be Monsters!, The Boxtrolls starts off employing a familiar and oft-used formula — i.e. the story of a young boy in the midst of various critters (everything from The Jungle Book to Where the Wild Things Are) — before eventually hitting its own unique stride. The title creatures are harmless trolls who are nevertheless feared by the citizens of the town of Cheesebridge. Wanting to be accepted by the ruling elite, the scurvy Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) promises to exterminate the meek monsters, a task that meets resistance in “Eggs” (Isaac Hempstead Wright), a boy who was raised by the Boxtrolls. Elle Fanning, sister of Coraline star Dakota Fanning, voices a girl who aids Eggs in his task, while Nick Frost, Richard Ayoade, and Tracy Morgan pipe up as Snatcher’s underlings. The final bit that seeps into the end credits — a philosophical discussion between Frost’s Mr. Trout and Ayoade’s Mr. Pickles — is a marvelously meta moment. Like Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls before it, Kubo and the Two Strings also nabbed an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature, and then did them all one better by also becoming only the second animated film (after The Nightmare Before Christmas) to compete in the Best Visual Effects category. Certainly, it’s a visually striking picture, drawing much of its style from various Japanese modes of artistic expression, both ancient (origami) and modern (Miyazaki). Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson) is a young boy who embarks on a journey to find the armor of the father he never knew. Accompanying him on his odyssey are an anthropomorphic monkey (Charlize Theron), a beetle warrior (Matthew McConaughey) with amnesia, and an origami samurai; standing in their way are insidious entities known as The Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) and The Sisters (Rooney Mara). This is the only Laika production where the length is felt, but even an occasional lull doesn’t dent the picture’s startling design and mystical aura. Each two-disc steelbook set (sold separately) offers the film on a 4K UHD disc and the special features on a Blu-ray. Extras are similar in nature, as each includes audio commentary (by co-directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi on The Boxtrolls, and director-producer Travis Knight on Kubo and the Two Strings); rare test footage; a piece on the puppets; feature-length storyboards; and photo galleries. DEVOTION (2022). Jonathan Majors has already been making a name for himself both on television (Lovecraft Country, Loki) and in film (The Last Black Man in San Francisco, Da 5 Bloods), but 2023 seems to be the year that he’s truly breaking out, thanks to his acclaimed performances as the antagonists in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Creed III. Slipping between the cracks of all these high-profile projects was Devotion, a $90 million naval aviation flick that crashed and burned with a $20 million gross. In the year of the thrill-a-minute Top Gun: Maverick, it’s easy to see how something so languorous would keep the masses away, but the truth is that this plodding and underdeveloped picture would register as a noble failure at any time. Centering on real-life figures who served as officers during the Korean War, this stars Majors as Jesse Brown, the first black aviator in Navy history, and Glen Powell as Tom Hudner, his best friend and wingman. For a film meant to inspire and invigorate, Devotion is an awfully timid endeavor, and the script (based on Adam Makos’ book Devotion: An Epic Story of Heroism, Friendship, and Sacrifice) is respectful to a fault, taking a muted, Masterpiece Theatre approach to a full-blooded tale whose messier elements included the racism that Brown had to confront on a regular basis. Powell, so dynamic in Top Gun: Maverick, is largely ineffectual here, and we never feel the supposed depths of the friendship that existed between his Hudner and Majors’ Brown. MARATHON MAN (1976). A powerhouse cast brings steely conviction to this atmospheric thriller efficiently directed by Midnight Cowboy helmer John Schlesinger and penned by William Goldman (adapting his own novel). Dustin Hoffman is excellent (if a tad too old) as “Babe” Levy, a graduate student and hardcore runner who doesn’t know that his older brother “Doc” (a superb Roy Scheider) is a government agent, and one who’s presently involved in dealings with Nazi war criminal Christian Szell (Laurence Olivier). Convinced that Babe knows the whereabouts of a stash of diamonds he himself had taken from executed Jews during WWII, Szell uses his knowledge of dentistry to torture the clueless Babe (leading to the film’s classic line, “Is it safe?”) and force the college student to employ his marathon training to extract himself from a harrowing situation. Tricky in its plot structure, the movie cannily plops a complete innocent in the midst of people who are smarter, stronger, and savvier and then requires him to outlast them all in order to survive. Only the climactic doubleheader (a confrontation in a desolate house and a scuffle in a Central Park maintenance facility) disappoints. For his chilling performance as a Nazi, Olivier earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination; two years later, he would nab a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his hammy performance as a Nazi hunter in The Boys from Brazil. Goldman, meanwhile, deservedly won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for his other 1976 credit, All the President’s Men. PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH (2022). Even though Antonio Banderas’ Puss in Boots owned the Shrek franchise from the moment he was introduced in the second film, that was no reason to hand him his own film. Or at least that was my thinking upon the 2011 release of Puss in Boots, a toon flick I found listless and lackluster. But Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, turning up 11 years after its predecessor, is a laudable vehicle for the energetic and egocentric feline. Frequently forsaking the snarky and occasionally tiresome brand of humor that defined the Shrek crop and carried over into the first PiB, this one does a fine job of balancing its knockabout humor with a surprisingly somber tale of how the specter of death can limit one’s ability to fully embrace and enjoy life. Having used up eight of his nine lives, Puss perpetually tries to stay a step ahead of Death (personified as a sickle-wielding wolf and  voiced by Wagner Moura), and he’s joined by former partner Kitty Softpaws (returning Salma Hayek Pinault) and a scruffy dog (Harvey Guillén) as he attempts to find the Wishing Star and regain all of his lives. Yet he’s not the only one seeking the Star, with his nemeses including Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and Jack Horner (John Mulaney). An Oscar nominee for Best Animated Feature Film, this may not be as original or innovative as fellow contenders (and front-runners) Marcel the Shell With Shoes On and Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, but darn if it didn’t move me the most. TRAINING DAY (2001). Despite formidable performances in the likes of Malcolm X and Fences, Denzel Washington’s only Best Actor Oscar to date (he earlier had won a supporting statue for 1989’s Glory) was for this gritty and initially engrossing cop flick. Washington is riveting as Alonzo Harris, an LA narcotics officer who gives rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke, nabbing a Best Supporting Actor nomination) one day to see if he has what it takes to work under his command. Jake is thrilled with the opportunity, but he soon realizes that Alonzo’s methods, which usually involve bending or breaking the law, fly in the face of his own idealism. The role of Alonzo Harris would allow any actor ample opportunities to chew the scenery, but Washington repeatedly refuses the bait — his performance is all live-wire mobility and coiled intensity. There’s also a delicious ambiguity in David Ayer’s screenplay that suggests Alonzo’s dirty deeds might be the only way for a cop to survive on the streets. Unfortunately, all philosophical musings about the moral dilemma in committing evil for the sake of goodness are washed away in the third act, as the movie sheds all lofty ambitions and becomes a police shoot-’em-up marked by contrived circumstances and convenient coincidences. Extras in the 4K + Blu-ray + Digital Code edition include audio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua; deleted scenes; an alternate ending; and music videos for Pharoahe Monch’s “Got You” and Nelly’s “#1.” Turkey Pick: METEOR (1979). The 1979 flop Beyond the Poseidon Adventure was covered in this slot last week; now here’s another of the expensive bombs that helped kill off the disaster flick at decade’s end. An asteroid five miles wide is headed straight for Earth, and if it hits, it’s the end of the world as we know it. A NASA bigwig (Karl Malden) taps a former colleague (Sean Connery) to help find a solution, but it soon becomes clear that progress will only be made if the U.S. pools its resources with those of the U.S.S.R. Yet even as the NASA brains feverishly work alongside a Russian scientist (Brian Keith) and his translator (Natalie Wood), smaller meteor chunks are already pelting the earth, causing mass destruction in New York, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. Meteor isn’t as cheesy as some of the other entries in the disaster cycle, but it’s also not much fun, with reams of dry dialogue, visual effects that run hot and cold, and slumming movie stars trying their damnedest to stay awake. Still, you do get to hear Connery ask government bigwigs forcing him to help out, “Why don’t you also stick a broom up my ass so I can sweep the floor on the way out?” The cast also includes Martin Landau (in the hammy portion of his otherwise stellar career; see also 1980’s Without Warning and 1982’s Alone in the Dark) as a Russkie-hating officer, cult favorite Sybil Danning as a skier who gets buried under a mountain of Styrofoam — excuse me, snow — and “Henry Fonda as The President.” The film earned an Oscar nomination for Best Sound, presumably for the whooshing noise the space rock makes as it hurtles toward our planet."
"Mar 1, 2023",positive," It has been over 11 years since our favourite cat in footwear swashbuckled his way through a big screen animated adventure, and now the man, the myth, the moggy returns to action… but is Puss’ latest daring tale truly worthy of our fluffy hero? The Last Wish catches up with our cream-lapping hero Puss (Antonio Banderas), as he reaches a scary realisation that he has used up eight of his nine lives. However, in this last life, he faces a dark threat that is calling for him. To escape his fate, Puss goes on a daring adventure to a mystical land to find the magical wishing star and have his wish for replenished lives granted. But he isn’t the only one who hopes to be wishing upon a star! Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a dazzling, creative triumph that shares many outstanding qualities with Gore Verbinski’s Rango. The Last Wish is not just an improvement on Puss’ first fun solo outing way back in 2011; it’s a mesmerising sequel that re-energises the Shrek-verse and ends with a tantalising tease. This film repositions DreamWorks firmly back into the conversation for the first time in years when it comes to the best major studio in mainstream animated filmmaking. Last year, they delivered an early winner with The Bad Guys, and this year they have repeated that remarkable feat and then some with a film that is already a strong contender for the year’s best animated feature. The whizz-popping wish-chasing story is fantastical groundwork for a far deeper and richer journey into the quality of life, finding the value in what has always been in front of you, grappling with mortality, and living with anxiety. There are so many carefully crafted textures to Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow’s screenplay, as director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado, let the film run free, unleashing a funny, poignant and exciting torrent of imagination, sword-swinging action, and meaningfully layered family entertainment. It really is the cat’s whiskers. Taking in an array of influences from anime to Zorro, and some other surprising genres, the film’s CG-meets-painted animation style is absolutely gorgeous. It provides a visual accompaniment that is just as impressive as the story, along with Heitor Pereira’s culturally explosive score. The screen is just full to bursting with ideas, emotion and lovable characters and is utterly impossible not to fall in love with Harvey Guillén’s ever hopeful Perrito the dog. He accompanies Puss on his journey, and is a heartwarmer and heartbreaker in equal measure, while Banderas’ ever-brilliant work as Puss expands the character in many breathtaking ways and Salma Hayek Pinault’s return as Puss’ former friend/flame Kitty Softpaws offers further unexpected narrative heft. Meanwhile, some of the newer characters (many who’re deliriously entertaining spins on classic fairy tales and nursery rhymes) are a joy, from John Mulaney’s memorably irredeemable ‘Big’ Jack Horner to Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo’s criminal gang take on Goldilocks and the three bears. Additionally, DreamWorks unleashes arguably its greatest ever villain (at least since Gary Oldman’s Lord Shen) in Wagner Moura’s genuinely terrifying, red-eyed, sickle-spinning Wolf, whom has an air of Tim Curry menace about him and steals every scene he is in. The Last Wish is a spellbinding, funny, and gorgeous piece of animated storytelling that restores this franchise to past glory. The real cat in the hat is back, and his boots are very much made for walking! Me-wow!"
"Feb 22, 2023",neutral," DreamWorks Animation succeeded in building its brand through the initial popularity of the Shrek franchise. While the entirety of the Shrek Cinematic Universe has earned the accolades of its first two entries, its most famous feline character's spin-off series has landed chiefly on its feet. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, with Antonio Banderas's signature rasp behind the swashbuckling orange tabby, has amplified the re-imagining of fairy tales through a grittier, visually stunning, and grounded narrative.  The sequel to Puss in Boots is brimming with vibrancy and life. Its rich creativity has been scarce in 2022's animation slate, and even if the story's resolution may feel fairly predictable, the charming nature of the central journey and the simple-yet-effective message hammers morality into the film's purpose. While it's not surprising that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish treads into more adult conflicts, it was unexpected that one of the best metaphors for death in animation would be found in Wagner Mourna's chilling Wolf. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish echoes the sentiment that we are to make the most of the one life we're given, but not to take it too seriously.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish takes necessary risks without losing subscribing to the assumption that all sequels lose their luster. 8.5/10. "
"Feb 20, 2023",positive," For her directorial debut, Michelle Garza Cervera decided she wasn’t going to play it safe. Instead, she presents a chilling dissection of the tribulations of pregnancy following a woman settling into a domestic life having grown up fighting against that very idea. Having prayed to a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Valeria (Solián) and her husband Raúl (Dosal) receive the outcome they desire as their lives are about to be blessed with a newborn baby. However, the following months for Valeria are plagued by sneering family members, a loss of profession, a husband who fears sex in case it harms their baby, a desire for her old partner, and, oh, a malevolent entity that wishes to possess her. In short, she’s had better times. Huesera portrays a slow-burning, subtle horror that has an alarming intimacy, it's far more focused on Valeria’s struggles against a culture that expects her, as a woman, to submit to motherhood than with traditional horror - but there’s enough of that throughout also. She spends her pregnancy trying to live up to what others want when its apparent she isn’t clear on what she wants, and these moments provide plenty of discomfort alongside scenes of a menacing presence that lurks in the shadows and torments Valeria at every given opportunity (this entity is based on actual Mexican folklore). Cervera shows plenty of flair in her direction and the combined cinematography and sound design are especially impressive - at times, the sound literally crackles throughout as sequences of silence are shattered by the sickening crunch of bones. As Valeria spirals further physically and mentally, the movie veers more into conventional horror as the third act begins leading to a visually striking and satisfying conclusion, but, crucially, the movie isn’t upended or disjointed tonally by this shift. With a super lead performance from Natalie Solián (in her feature debut), sharp writing, and a combination of sequences that get under your skin, Huesera is a triumphant debut offering. The pace and overall lack of ‘scares’ may not be to everyone's tastes, and, at times, it does feel sluggish, but Huesera delivers a powerful, engaging, and sometimes bruising experience. The Australian film scene is one that consistently delivers strong productions that often fall below the radar, and their horror scene has, in the past, delivered some excellent entries into the genre. With Surrogate, debutant director David Willing opts to foray into the supernatural with a story focusing on Natalie (Morassi),  a single mother and nurse who, after aiding a sick woman late at night, falls mysteriously ill. This illness results in immediate symptoms of pregnancy that quickly culminates in an apparent birth, though the baby is nowhere to be found. With the ire of doctors and child services raised, and her physical and mental well-being on a rapid downward spiral, Natalie must do everything within in her power to keep her family and herself from falling apart. Whilst not wholly original - the film does lean heavily on its influences - Surrogate is an effective and sometimes excellent low-budget horror movie that blends supernatural elements with mystery and thriller aspects. Anchored by a strong lead performance from Kestie Morassi, there’s a confidence that flows through Surrogate which is a testament to Willing and co-writer Beth King, and its competent production blends well with Mark Buys’ score. At times, the movie can feel solid if unspectacular but sprinkled throughout are some genuinely excellent sequences - a seance midway through the movie is perfectly framed and executed to deliver a deliciously atmospheric and tense situation - and the conclusion was unexpectedly bleak and striking, its an ending that really props the movie up satisfyingly. With the varying subplots, characters, and genre crossovers, the movie does sometimes threaten to derail itself, and whilst not every aspect is a success, at no point do the wheels fall off entirely. Surrogate is an assured debut feature that attempts to blend the old and new, and, more often than not, succeeds in doing so. The time of Kang is now. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is both the 31st movie in the ever-lingering Marvel Cinematic Universe and the feature debut of Jonathan Major’s Kang the Conqueror - described as the next Thanos-level villain for our Avengers heroes. Peyton Reed returns to helm the third eusocial-themed blockbuster as Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang, along with his daughter Cassie (Newton), the Wasp (Lilly), Hank Pym (Douglas), and Janet van Dyne (Pfeiffer), explore the mysterious Quantum Realm, and, in doing so, threaten to unleash a force that could take over the universe. How they get there is a bit ridiculous, as is the rest of the movie sadly. Quantumania is a disjointed, messy, and, frankly bland movie that basically serves as a setup for the next batch of MCU movies at the expense of…being an Ant-Man movie. Quantumania starts off feeling like an Ant-Man flick and it’s as breezy and fun as you’d expect, but once the Quantum Realm is introduced, everything begins to fall apart narratively. The need to move things along to introduce Kang and his backstory, at the expense of the story, is plainly obvious alongside some tedious foreshadowing of “HIM”, “HE” and “SOMEONE” - Michelle Pfeiffer is asked to lazily spend half the movie not telling her family information which would be deemed as crucial to their plight. Thankfully, Jonathan Majors saves the movie with his strong and menacing performance as Kang, each scene he is in is elevated to the point that the rest of the movie seems vanilla by comparison. That’s not to say Paul Rudd isn’t his usual charming self, he is and he’s doing what he does best here, but the rest of the cast…aren’t great - I assumed throughout that Michael Douglas had quit acting whilst filming this. The cast has to work with what they are given so that should be taken into consideration, but their characters end up becoming lost in the sheer glob of colour and sometimes toe-curling VFX. I’m fully aware that the Quantum Realm needs to be realised somehow but, even for a multiverse setting, it felt too much here, especially with the StageCraft usage that stuck out badly. The art department was afforded licence to have fun with their designs though with an abundance of aliens and funky background characters, even if it did feel a bit Star Wars-y at times, and this element allowed for some ace character designs to distract from the visuals, shallow script, and uninspired gags - though MODOK was, well, awful. As someone who dug the first two Ant-Man movies, this feels like a step back for the character in service of the now standard-MCU setups which is a shame. We get Kang, which is great, but it’s hard not to wish that he could have been introduced in a better movie. After an encouraging start, Quantumania succumbs to mediocrity when it had the chance to propel the MCU forward effectively. Jonathan Majors is great, but the movie is anything but. Oh, and Bill Murray appears for some reason. Everyone’s favourite swashbuckling feline is back in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish…but for how long? You see, Puss (Banderas) has long neglected the value of his nine lives and is now down to his final one. After a brush with a villainous Wolf (Moura) causes him to retire to a cat home, Puss is quickly drawn back into the fight when the chance to wish his lives back into existence rears its head - but he’s not the only one trying to reach the mythical Last Wish. 2011’s Puss in Boots was well received as a spin-off to the Shrek franchise but a sequel after twelve years seemed like an odd choice, specifically, where has the interest come from to suddenly release a sequel now? Well, I’m glad that Dreamworks decided to push forward as Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is wonderful. A movie about a marauding cat delivering some genuinely poignant themes of friendship, selflessness, mental health, and mortality was not on my bingo card this year but here it is. The movie offers some deliciously realised animated action set pieces, good comedy, unsurprisingly strong voice acting from Banderas and Hayek (plus a slew of newcomers including Florence Pugh and Harvey Guillén’s cutesy Perrito) and one of the better villains I have seen in years - Wagner Moura’s Wolf had such a sinister presence that never let up, his menacing smile and whistle was a real sign that it was about to hit the fan. Similarly, the movie follows suit in that it doesn’t condescend to the audience in delivering its narrative and messages which is something that cannot be levied at other animated movies in recent years (also, at one point, a dude has his skin sucked right from his skeleton..). Crucially, whilst the story does sag somewhat at the midway point, there’s more than enough on offer throughout to keep audiences of all ages engaged and engrossed in the adventure. Emotional and surprisingly excellent, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of Dreamworks' best and a real crowd-pleaser. When you see the surname ‘Cronenberg’ attached to anything, you should know that you’re in for a wild ride. The poster alone for Brandon Cronenberg’s latest effort Infinity Pool is odd enough, Alexander Skarsgård submerged in a red goo as Mia Goth looks on seductively/menacingly beside him - that would explain the ‘Pool’ of it all. The story centres on struggling author James Foster (Skarsgård) and his wife Em (Coleman), who, whilst, vacationing at a luxury resort on the reclusive island of Li Tolqa, meet Gabi (Goth) and Alban (Lespert). Whilst all initially seems pleasant, an incident outside of the resort (all guests are explicitly told not to leave the resort) involving both couples sends the Foster’s relationship into turmoil and James spiralling into an abyss of excess, depravity, and lust having witnessed…something…that initially repulsed him before becoming fully seduced by the idea. If you couldn’t tell, I am attempting to keep things as vague as possible so as not to drop spoilers for what is a fever dream packed with sex, orgies, urine, dark humour, and violence - it’s a lot. However, Infinity Pool feels focused narratively and in its direction - this feels like a step up from Cronenberg Jr’s previous movie Possessor - with its themes of depersonalization, hedonism, and the rich indulging their unkempt desires (money is the root of all evil, and all that). Skarsgård delivers a fine performance as he walks the lines between fear, anxiety, rage, lust, and acceptance and Goth provides yet another example of her exceptional talents (she again plays a scarily-genuine feeling psychopath), their interplay between them is fascinating to watch. The movie as a whole may not be fascinating for everyone to watch as it depicts graphic sexual scenes, drug usage, full frontal nudity, and blunt violence - it's not the heaviest movie I’ve ever seen but it may prove to be too challenging for some. Infinity Pool comes out of the gate fast with a strong first half before settling into a satisfyingly solid second half, though I never felt any real lulls throughout. The intrigue is enticing and there is enough black comedy to ensure proceedings don’t become too wild - there’s a real maturity to the storytelling here and provides another interesting addition to Brandon’s burgeoning filmography. Cocaine. Bear. The two words that have come to define cinema. This is cinema. This is Cocaine Bear. Right, enough silliness, I’ll leave that for the movie itself. Having taken the internet by storm simply due to its title and premise - that being, a bear feasted on a large amount of ditched cocaine in 1985 - could Elizabeth Banks’ latest directorial effort live up to the hype? Kind of. If you’re going into the movie expecting to see a coked up bear going on a rampage, then you’ll find yourself in luck but…bear…in mind that a hefty chunk of the ninety-five minute runtime is gifted to a host of human characters, most of whom aren’t particularly interesting. Now, this being called a true story comes with the notion that you take that with a pinch of salt, a major amount of liberties have been taken here, but, without those liberties, this would be a very boring movie. Did the real cocaine bear massacre a rabble of misfits? No. But why let the truth get in the way of a drug-fuelled story. At no point does the movie lose sight of what it is though, this is self-aware comedy horror and everyone here is game for the mission - O’ Shea Jackson Jr. and Alden Ehrenreich are both having a blast, as is Margo Martindale, and Keri Russell is dependably solid in her role as Sari, mother of young teen Dee Dee (Prince) who is taken by the bear when she and her friend Henry (Convery) ditch school for a days adventure in the national park. The issue is that the characters themselves don’t really have a lot to them other than their gimmick, and as the movie doesn’t lean in hard enough to each of them, they feel undercooked and underserved. Similarly, whilst the bear brings nothing but terror, the nagging sense that this could have gone harder or wilder never left me. It’s bloody, for sure, and there are some great gags, but I left my viewing feeling like the movie would have been more…fun. Had Banks trimmed some of the unnecessary subplots - including a sweet but unnecessary one about a dog - then the movie would have felt that bit tighter and allowed for more focus on the bear and the humans fighting for survival. For what it is, essentially a jacked up B-movie, Cocaine Bear is still a fun enough ride, however, for a movie called Cocaine Bear, to be left with the feeling that this was not crazy enough is, well...crazy."
"Feb 14, 2023",positive," “Do you find me disgusting?” asks Charlie (Brendan Fraser), who weighs 42st and spends most of his time beached on a sofa, scarfing down meatball subs and pizza. Sometimes he teaches an online literature course — on Moby-Dick, naturally — telling his students his webcam is broken so they won’t be alarmed by his obesity. Other times he masturbates to gay porn. Occasionally he rises, with an almighty groan, to waddle around his apartment on a walking frame, his vast gut dangling, before sinking back into his sofa with a whumpf. It’s a far cry from The Mummy."
"Feb 14, 2023",positive," ★★★★☆After an 11-year hiatus — he was probably curled up somewhere cosy — the swashbuckling moggy from Shrek returns. Voiced as ever by Antonio Banderas, Puss has got to the end of his nine lives — cue a pacy, witty romp in which he has to outfox (outcat?) Death himself. The latter takes the form of a sinister, sickle-twirling wolf with his own spaghetti western theme tune, and there’s even a touch of Bergman in his existential exchanges with the “stabby tabby”."

Básicamente no te gusto la peli y no pudiste apreciar sus cualidades como verdadero crítico. Hubieras dicho ""si la vi, no me gustó, nada mas para opinar"". If I had to rate this review: 0.5/10And that's being generous.You could have saved everyone the time by just stating that you didn't like the movie. Rather than going off with points that have nothing in the review to back them up past straight opinions. It's moments like this that those critical analysis and persuasive writing lessons in school come in handy as they actually give you something to stand on when you're critiquing. Bueno es solo mi opinión, pero a mí me ha parecido aburridísima, creo que sería divertido para los pequeños por el montón de acción sin pausa, y un humor muy simplón y fácil de captar. La primera me ha parecido muchísimo mejor con un mejor villano (el huevón) mucho más interesante, con una trama mucho más compleja donde el el gato traiciona a su mejor amigo para hacer lo correcto, etc. A mí también nueva peli me aburrió muchísimo, creo que es más para niños pequeños, la primera me ha parecido mucho mejor con el huevón como villano."

"Feb 9, 2023",positive," Puss in Boots faces an existential crisis in this riotously fun, Oscar-nominated sequel from DreamWorks. Having recklessly used up eight of his nine lives, the fearless feline is forced to accept that his roistering days are over - unless he can restore his vitality by wishing on a star. However, he's not alone in his search for the mythical land where it can be found, and so begins a race for the prize. As voiced by Antonio Banderas, Puss oozes charm from every paw, with his new-found vulnerability making his character all the more endearing. Among the rest of the fairy-tale supporting cast, Goldilocks and the Three Bears get a coarse, cor-blimey makeover courtesy of Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Samson Kayo and (naturally) Ray Winstone, while John Mulaney bags all the best lines as a truly monstrous Jack Horner. The animation particularly comes alive during the anime-styled action scenes, while the sharp script delivers gags galore and pleasing nods to The Wizard of Oz, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and the wider Shrek-verse. Coming 11 years after the original Puss in Boots film, The Last Wish proves a sensational, swashbuckling return for everyone's favourite costumed cat."

"
"Feb 8, 2023",positive," Expectations can derail a movie. There are times when you can enter a theater without them, but it’s harder than you think. A sequel doubles down on this theory. A sequel to a beloved movie is essentially going ALL IN from the jump. “Knives Out” was a spectacular hit because of a whodunit concept crafted to perfection, and a very good cast, led by Daniel Craig. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Ana de Armas, Christopher Plummer, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, and Chris Evans played fine parts in the mystery. Stacked cast, a dry wit sense of humor, and Rian Johnson unplugging after pissing in the cheerios of “Star Wars” fans. It was a beautiful, perfectly paced dark comedy thriller. Plummer’s rich novelist dies, leaving behind a mystery for his greedy family to unfold and solve–one designed by the departed soul. “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” takes that setup and spins it a bit. It’s Edward Norton’s uber rich Elon Musk-type dipshit who invites all of his oldest friends to solve his murder mystery. Craig’s famous Benoit Blanc also attends, bringing along his amazing slow-burn detective instincts to the fray of greed. Katie Hudson, Dave Bautista, Janelle Monae, and Kathryn Hahn sub in here for the intrigued party members who get to play a real life game of “C.L.U.E.” The concept of that game is sewn into Johnson’s films, and that gets you through the first half of the movie. But this sequel lacks the overall spark of the original. Losing some speed on the fastball is standard practice for this arena, but I left the film satisfied with what was received. However, I wasn’t jumping out of his pants wanting to talk about it, hence the three week wait until this review. What gets set up and revealed midway is ingenious. What follows afterwards is the softball part of the equation. Craig and Monae have the most fun and give easily the best performances. When they’re together on screen, it’s as if they are aloof to the rest of the movie and cast. Norton can’t give a bad performance, but he recycles his asshat from “The Italian Job” here, and it’s not as appealing. The rest of the cast goes through the motions of film personas they created before this movie. At times, I was very entertained. Other times, I wanted more out of what I was watching. Expectations can do that to a film, for better or worse. I’ll give “Glass Onion” a 2/4 rating. The world wasn’t exactly screaming for a sequel to “Puss in Boots.” Granted, the furry little fella stole a good chunk of the “Shrek” film, and the solo film made $555 million while scoring an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. Eleven years after the 2011 film, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” attempts the impossible: hitting the net on your third trip through the order. Overall, “The Last Wish” is a success. Coming in at a brisk 100 minutes and carrying enough pop culture humor to fill two movies, this sequel gives you the goods. It’s a ticket to the Antonio Banderas show. He puts in wonderful voice work, infusing the animated sword-savvy feline with charisma and passion. It’s not one of those “phone it in” voice performances; you can really tell Banderas loves this character. The story revolves around Puss running out of eight of his nine lives, finding himself on the run feuding off attackers. Along the way, he teams up with Kitty Softpaws (the lovely Selma Hayek) to help stretch out the clock. A supporting cast of Florence Pugh (pugh-pugh), Olivia Colman, Harvey Guillen, and John Mulaney doesn’t hurt at all. I would slot this in as a movie that keeps the adult’s attention while giving the kids a good eye candy session. It’s impossible not to root for Puss to run the gauntlet and get the girl, even if watching him sweat (and adjust facial hair on the fly) is a fun time. Let’s go 3/4 for PUSSSSSS IN BOOTS… 2! If I had to choose between the two, I would punch your pass to Puss and leave the onion in the kitchen. I’m more of a donut hole guy anyway. Since it’s Christmas Eve, I want to say one more thing. First, hey Meme. No, it’s not pronounced how you think. Before words on a picture went viral, young Lebanese boys called their grandmothers “Meme,” or May-May. She was a tiny ball of fire. Henrietta Bulus mastered at least five languages, spoke with Mother Teresa, threw more dinner parties than anyone on Blue Jay Cove, and loved her grandsons more than life itself. A lady who weighed less than 100 pounds could grab your forearm, and give you the impression that a bodybuilder was sitting next to you. She outwalked people half her age, and lived a long life. It just wasn’t long enough. Pardon me, but I am greedy when it comes to great family members. Meme passed away eleven years ago today, succumbing to an injury she suffered about two weeks earlier. Meme passed away on the same day, Christmas Eve, that she was married on to my late grandfather, Lawrence. It’s Larry who supplied me with my middle name, and most likely the writing gene. Pepe left us in 1989. Meme passed in 2011, around six weeks after the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series. A cruel yet bittersweet reminder that life can supply you with the most incredible people, but they won’t be here forever. Movies, thankfully, will be. Have some fun with the next one you choose. If it happens to be a French film, think of my Meme when watching it."

"Feb 6, 2023",positive," The Shrek universe expands a little more with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, another computer-animated family film from DreamWorks, with Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinnault reprising their roles as Puss and his frenemy Kitty Softclaws. Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado serve up a treat, one worthy of its Oscar nod for best animated feature. As with all the Shrek Cinematic Universe output, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish subverts fairytales and nursery rhymes while telling its story, and part of the fun is seeing which the writers Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler plunder and then reimagine for modern audiences. Some references are simply to make a gag (the movie is stuffed full of them), while others make a nod to serious points such as the importance of loyalty or how ageing and death are realities of life. The story centres on Puss, who with horror realises that he is on the last of his nine lives and, using a map filled with riddles, has to find a wishing star to restore them. But before he can reach it he is stalked by death, here given the form of a big, bad Wolf (Wagner Moura). Also involved in Puss's adventure are Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo) – reimagined as a cockney crime family – and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), as an immensely greedy hoarder of all things magical which might help the assorted cast get to the wishing star before Puss does. It's a clever conceit. The film starts with a lengthy sequence in which our hero performs yet more acts of derring do in defeating a giant and is everyone's hero. Then, because he's a player, he parties till dawn – keep that full-cream milk coming – but realises time is catching up with him. His journey begins to find the wishing star, but of course he faces any number of obstacles – with the Wolf stalking his every move. Along the way Puss teams up with former paramour Kitty Softpaws (cue some outrageous feline flirting), and Perrito (Harvey Guillén), an adorable runt of the litter who attaches himself to the two cats whether they want him to or not. His naivety is touching – he thinks being thrown in a rubbish bin was his family's version of hide and seek – but Perrito turns out to be strong and brave when Puss needs him most, one of the many life lessons subtly parlayed in this film. The animation style is warm and uses high colour, the film's visual richness giving the impression almost that we're stepping into a picture book. It's very appealing."
"Feb 6, 2023",positive," This Shrek spin-off is a breezily entertaining DreamWorks animation that harnesses the familiar appeal of the self-aggrandising feline (Antonio Banderas), while also adopting a distinctive and original graphic visual style. Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado both worked on the Kung Fu Panda films, and it’s perhaps this, plus the striking stylised action sequences of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, that informs the bold, peppy approach to Puss’s gravity-defying derring-do. The plot is basic: down to his final life, Puss sees an opportunity to restore the full nine with a magic wishing star. He’s not the only one seeking it: Goldilocks and her ursine crime syndicate are on his trail, as is the monstrous “Big” Jack Horner. And then there’s Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and wannabe emotional support animal Perrito the chihuahua (Harvey Guillén). It helps that the writing is as sharp as Puss’s claws."
"Feb 3, 2023",positive," There's nothing funny about morbid obesity, yet its depiction on screen is usually in the service of comedy — Terry Jones as Mr Creosote in Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life (1983) lumbers unavoidably to mind. Hugely fat characters also populate horror and fantasy films, but it's not often that you find one as the protagonist in a love story. Admittedly, Darren Aronofsky's The Whale isn't a conventional love story — it isn't a conventional anything — but it's about love nonetheless, both destructive and redemptive. Charlie (Brendan Fraser) weighs over 40 st and is not just housebound but practically chairbound. He is a middle-aged academic who teaches creative writing online from his apartment somewhere in Idaho, but is so crippled by his colossal size that he cannot get to the front door without a walking-frame. He picks things up from the floor with a grabber contraption like the ones children aim at furry pink rabbits in amusement arcades, and is sufficiently self-conscious about his appearance that when he teaches, he pretends that the camera on his laptop is broken. He can be heard over Zoom, but not seen. We enter Charlie's life with, it appears, very little of it to go. His fierce but devoted carer, Liz (Hong Chau), tells him that congestive heart failure will soon see him off, that he needs urgent hospital treatment to have any chance of survival. But Charlie doesn't want to pay expensive medical bills, not least because he has no wish to survive. When he does think his death is imminent, he rather oddly begs a visiting missionary (Ty Simpkins) to read him extracts from an essay about Moby Dick. The reason for this will emerge, but in the meantime Charlie is eating himself into an early grave with a daily intake of pizzas and sandwiches that would feed a hungry family of six. He wasn't always so fat, but the suicide of his male lover — for whom he had left his wife, Mary (Samantha Morton), and daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink) — triggered a spectacular binge-eating habit that he is neither able nor willing to control. Charlie's psychological demons become clearer when 17-year-old Ellie comes to see him for the first time in eight years. She is charmless at best, at worst vicious and manipulative, but Charlie, even though he has to bribe her to continue calling on him, sees only the good in her. Indeed, it is perhaps the chief irony in Darren Aronofsky's bold drama that Charlie has a generous, almost childlike view of humanity in general that he cannot apply to himself. I was no fan of Aronofsky's last film, the ghastly, voyeuristic Mother! (2017). But he is certainly anything but anodyne as a director, and The Whale — adapted by Samuel D. Hunter from his own 2012 play — deserves all the attention it will continue to have up to Academy Awards night next month. In many respects it is another exercise in audience voyeurism (you have been warned), and from where I was sitting, its intrinsic theatricality diminishes its value as a film. Apart from a couple of fleeting flashbacks, we don't move beyond the confines of his home any more than sweet, self-loathing Charlie does. But, with a nod for whoever looked after the fat suit and prosthetics, Fraser's performance is genuinely stupendous. He is the favourite to win Best Actor at the Oscars, and I can understand why. It's less easy to understand why M. Night Shyamalan thought Knock At The Cabin — an adaptation of Paul Tremblay's 2018 novel The Cabin At The End Of The World, a much better title — would be worth either his while or ours.  It's slickly enough written and acted, but it's a truly preposterous story about a gay couple and their adopted daughter whose holiday home deep in the Pennyslvania woods is invaded by a modern and curiously polite incarnation of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. This strange quartet, led by a kindly teacher (Dave Bautista) and also featuring Rupert Grint as a grumpy gas-fitter (with much to be grumpy about), must convince the family that they need to start sacrificing one another if they are to save the planet from impending doom. It's not really made clear why they've been chosen from 7.8 billion or so other people in the world, and I'm afraid the film is another dud from Shyamalan, who has never come close to matching his 1999 masterpiece The Sixth Sense. In this movie he has given himself a Hitchcock-style cameo role, selling fried chicken on television . . . but perhaps he should have chosen turkey instead. A sequel to the 2011 film Puss in Boots, itself a spin-off from the Shrek movies, this one gives us Florence Pugh as the voice of Goldilocks, with Olivia Colman and Ray Winstone as Mama and Papa Bear. As you'll have gathered, Joel Crawford's film, like the original, boasts an eclectic mix of characters from legends and fairy tales: Jack Horner (John Mulaney) is an obese, hunchbacked villain, and there are cameos for Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket, Excalibur and the Big Bad Wolf. Puss (brilliantly voiced by Banderas) is a swashbuckling, Zorro-style hero, fearless until the wolf ruins things by pointing out that he has used up eight of his nine lives. If he can find the elusive Wishing Star alongside his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss can get his eight lives back. But everyone else is searching for the Wishing Star, too, including, for more nefarious reasons, the monstrous Jack Horner and the crime family of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. It's very imaginatively done. As in Puss In Boots: The Last Wish (see below), there's a fairytale ending of sorts in To Leslie — but a lot of bleakness precedes it, as the title character (Andrea Riseborough) lurches, broke and homeless, through a miserable, alcohol-sodden existence six years after winning the Texas lottery. This low-budget film, a debut feature for British director Michael Morris, has been basking in some mostly welcome attention, after Riseborough (pictured) very unexpectedly landed a Best Actress Oscar nomination. I say 'mostly' because there are some crying foul, not to mention racism (the African-American actress Danielle Deadwyler, brilliant in Till, was overlooked), but there is no doubt it's a performance worthy of acclaim, at the heart of a tale Patsy Cline might once have expressed in song. Last seen gurning her way hilariously through the Matilda movie, Riseborough (a Tynesider, note) proves her impressive versatility by convincing utterly as a Texan deadbeat, who steals from her teenage son and seems beyond redemption before returning to her home town and, with the support of a good man, piecing her life back together."
"Feb 3, 2023",positive," It’s a pleasant surprise when the film that isn’t quite Shrek 5 turns out to be the best of that sequence. It’s an even bigger surprise to discover that Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is a compelling companion piece to Pedro Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory, in which a declining film practitioner (Antonio Banderas) ponders his mortality. The sequel to Puss’s 2011 stand-alone adventure sees the swashbuckling feline in fearful contemplation upon realising that he is down to the last of his nine lives. “My prescription,” says the cat’s doctor and barber, “no more adventures. You need to retire.” Thus, pursued by a glaive-wielding Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), Puss buries his iconic footwear and settles down to a life defined by kibble and naps at a cat lady’s refuge. The nicest-looking animation to emerge from the DreamWorks imprint takes cues from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and spaghetti western films – notably The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – as Puss takes up with his scorned old flame, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), and a cheerful unwanted therapy dog (Harvey Guillén) on a search for a wishing star that can recoup his lost lives. Kevin McCann’s Jimmy Stewart-inspired Conscience Cricket makes for fun commentary on last year’s many Pinnochios. The chaotic cod-fairy-tale references don’t always land – the Baker’s Dozen, anyone? – but few actors are as suited to their animated avatars as Banderas is to Puss. There is a lot to like here, not least Ray Winstone’s Papa Bear. The forests are Skittle-coloured. The set pieces are wild and kinetic. But it is Banderas’s star power that saves the day."
"Feb 3, 2023",positive," The second solo adventure for Antonio Banderas’s ginger Zorro grossed $309million before it even opened in the UK. Not bad for the follow-up to a Shrek spin-off from 11 years ago. This time, Puss must forgo the senoritas, the swashbuckling and the full-fat milk swilling due to an accident at work. After defeating a rampaging troll, a falling church bell cuts short the showboating. When he comes round, the doctor informs him he has just exhausted eight of his nine lives. So our once-carefree hero ditches his floppy hat and boots to wander naked into Mama Lana’s Cat Rescue for a life of tasteless cat biscuits and smelly litter trays. Forming a triple act with a clingy dog called Perrito (Harvey Guillen) and old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), he sets out to find the mystical Wishing Star. The quest will see them battle a fearsome wolf (Wagner Moura), cockney gangsters Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo), and the now-massive Jack Horner (John Mulaney) who appears to have outgrown his “good boy” days but stuck with the pie-eating. But the animation is gorgeous, the action is zippy and Banderas is brilliant. After a lean few months for family animation, kids and parents should lap this one up."
"Feb 3, 2023",positive," Until this year, my only Puss in Boots-related wish was that I would never have to sit through another film from the Shrek franchise as long as I lived. I must confess, the unexpectedly entertaining Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has entirely changed my mind! Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) squandered eight of his nine lives with a devil-may-care panache. He sang, danced and swashbuckled his way through a legendary series of adventures but his melodious pursuit of a giant may have seen the bell toll for the last time on those carefree days. Then a standoff with a foe who cannot be quipped into submission shakes the marmalade marauder to his core. What happens when the charismatic poster puss of living for tomorrow suddenly fears he will not make it through today? Mortality is a mighty foe. For Puss, the answer is to put his life of crime to rest; burying his broad-brimmed hat, cape and trademark Corinthian leather boots and any expectation of further adventure beside them. Soon his razor-sharp claws are sheathed in mittens and he is growing fluffy and docile in the home of Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) with dozens of languid cat brethren and an alarmingly optimistic chihuahua for company. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish does something refreshing for a children’s film, it takes a long, unflinching look at anxiety; exploring it with a frankness that people of any age who have been frozen with similar dread will appreciate. Dreamworks’ latest production is certainly not the first time animation studios have ventured into mental health territory in recent years but the vivid depictions of panic are singular and they truly captivate. The peerless Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse continues to be a force for good in this world, this time by inspiring The Last Wish’s tactile and visually-engaging animation; its vivid storybook aesthetic is a far cry from the CG monotony of this franchise’s last outing and helps sell the heavier moments. As is the way with family features, there are still some everything but the kitchen sink scenes but there are also moments of striking artistry in silhouettes, angular crystals, the stomp of a giant and the swish of a skirt. Plot threads get messy on the chase and here your mind will wander. With the least coherent character animation and a shoehorned story tangent, John Mulaney’s Jack Horner is surplus to requirement and his contribution drags. Still, he does have a Jimmy Stewart-esque cricket (Kevin McCann) in his dastardly bag of tricks so it’s not all bad. And the irresistible charm of the central friendship journey paired with Heitor Perreira’s buoyant score further wash away the tedium. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a heartfelt adventure caper that tackles anxiety with surprising empathy and wit. A few cast members should have been lost in the woods but overall this one’s a winner!"
"Feb 3, 2023",positive," Move over Brendan Fraser: you’re not the only noughties family film icon making a comeback this week. Eleven years after his last cinema appearance, here is Antonio Banderas’s Puss in Boots again – or rather Poos in Booze, as the name is rendered in the velvety Spanish purr that helped make the character a favourite in the later Shrek films. And clearly, the industry at least is glad to have him back, since the film has been nominated in the Best Animation categories at the coming Oscars and Baftas. After a long career of Zorro-like swashbuckling, The Last Wish finds Puss on the ninth and last of his lives, but in no mood to shuffle off to the franchise graveyard just yet. So when word reaches him of a wishing star that has fallen in a faraway forest, he sets out to retrieve it, in the hope its powers will allow him to postpone the inevitable for a little while yet. Other interested parties are also on the trail, however, including a Vivienne Westwood-esque Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three bear accomplices (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo), and also Jack Horner (John Mulaney), a no-longer-so-little fruit pie magnate harbouring an inferiority complex over his nursery-rhyme roots. This is supposedly a film about coming to terms with death – and Death itself even makes a series of deliciously scary cameo appearances, in the form of a wolf (voiced by Narcos’ Wagner Moura) whose red eyes, thin smile and silver sickles glint from beneath his black hooded cloak. But aside from the chills elicited by this genuinely spooky figure, the film is almost defiantly hopeless at emotion: the tone is teeth-gnashingly manic throughout, while the underlying point of Puss’s quest is obscured by continuous flurries of slapstick and quips. Sometimes it’s quite funny – the sequence in which Puss and Salma Hayek’s Kitty Softpaws try to out-cute one another by pulling increasingly adorable faces is a nice escalation of a series running gag. And occasionally it’s spectacular too, thanks to frequent…well, let’s be generous and say homages to classic action scenes from Japanese anime. (Buffs will recognise shots borrowed from Neon Genesis Evangelion and Attack on Titan within the first five minutes alone, in which Puss loses life number eight in a battle with a moss giant.) Rather than ploughing on with Shrek’s now dated visual style, DreamWorks has smartly adopted the stylish hybrid look pioneered by Sony Animation’s Into the Spider-Verse, which combines elements of hand-drawn and CG. There’s an entire pick ’n’ mix stand of eye candy here – more than enough to satisfy younger viewers. But alas, it’s all empty calories."
"Feb 3, 2023",positive," There he can grow a beard, eat disgusting dry cat food and avoid the bounty hunter wolf who is keen to get his dead body and claim a reward. And along with new friend Perrito (Harvey Guillen) — a dog who is dressed as a cat to enjoy the luxury of the sanctuary — and his old friend Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), they go on a mission to try to find it. The journey is a dangerous one, with entry into the black forest, and the trio are soon up against gangster family Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who are also on a bid for the wishing star. There are some incredibly daring action sequences, and Horner and the bounty hunter wolf are both dreadful enough to keep you fearing for our furry friend’s life. Banderas brings all the usual joy and energy to the character he made his own, and uses just the right amount of humour in the role, too. Loving couple Andrew and Eric are vacationing with their adoptive daughter Wen at a secluded cabin when four armed strangers (led by Dave Bautista’s Leonard) turn up. Tight pacing from the get-go maintains a nervy edge as these four individuals demand the family make a harrowing choice: Kill one of their family to prevent the apocalypse or let the world burn. Paired with moving performances that capture a huge range of emotions, this is one of the rare Shyamalan films not to require a plot twist to succeed. Just sharp, empathetic direction, acting and writing, which reminds you that he is a filmmaker who loves to play with good and bad, hero and villain and happiness and suffering to get audiences asking philosophical questions of themselves too. THE opening scene of this Darren Aronofsky film shows a super-morbidly- obese man surrounded by debris in his dingy room, watching pornography that gives him a heart attack. He’s a teacher of English, but only does this via Zoom, where he pretends his camera has broken so his students can never see him. The only other characters are those who visit, including his friend Liz (Hong Chau) who is a nurse but also his enabler, his spiky estranged daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), ex-wife Mary (Samantha Morton) and missionary Thomas (Ty Simpkins).  But it’s Fraser who is the outright star of this masterful film, giving such a powerful performance that it will leave even the hardest heart broken."
"Feb 2, 2023",positive," Nineteen years after his first appearance in Shrek 2, and ten after his first spin-off movie, Antonio Banderas swings back into action as Puss In Boots. The animated film’s financial success has sparked speculation about a fifth Shrek movie, but is there really anything more to be squeezed from this long-running series? We reunite with Puss In Boots (voiced by Banderas), who is going through an existential crisis. After a mishap means that he has used eight of his nine lives, he retires from adventuring and becomes depressed. However, he finds out about a map that leads to a magical wishing star. Stealing the map and reuniting with ex-fiance Kitty Soft Paws (Salma Hayek), Puss In Boots races to find the star. Considering how long the character has been away, it would be easy for the film to opt for a soft, easy subject that keeps the franchise going (looking at you, Minions). However, taking on as serious a subject as death, however whimsically, gives the story just enough depth to keep things interesting. Yes, most of the action is devoted to familiar slapstick and wacky side characters, but finding a reason to exist is the golden ticket for any sequel, and director Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) accomplishes it. While the story feels fresher, the characters are broadly the same. Hayek and Banderas have had great chemistry on screen for decades, and the added element of animation doesn’t change that winning formula. Recognisable voices like Olivia Colman, Florence Pugh, and Ray Winstone keep the giggles coming, while John Mulaney is a proven delight. If you are expecting something that will reinvigorate the genre, this will be a disappointment. However, what Puss In Boots: The Last Wish lacks in originality, it makes up for in laughs and heart."
"Feb 2, 2023",positive," Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a heartfelt, surprisingly mature look at life and death from one heroic cat’s perspective. Read our review of the Oscar-nominated animation.  Originally a character introduced in Shrek 2, Puss in Boots was an instant fan favourite. The character’s solo film, a little unimaginatively titled Puss in Boots, premiered in 2011, and it’s taken 11 years to get a sequel to that.  At the beginning of The Last Wish, Puss (voiced by Antonio Banderas) finds himself on the last of his nine lives. Even fearless, swash-buckling kitties will have to face death eventually, but Puss is keen on continuing his adventures and desperately needs some extra lives.  He sets out to find a magical Wishing Star which could grant him more time on Earth. Joining him is his ex-fiancee Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek). Still, the villainous Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo) are after the map to the Wishing Star too.  As you can see, the voice cast to The Last Wish is stacked, like really stacked. Oscar nominees and winners left, right and centre of it. There’s always something very giddy about hearing your favourite actor do a particularly fun voice performance. Florence Pugh is the highlight here, clearly having a ball doing a heightened Cockney accent that somehow never feels out of place in this world. Her Goldilocks is an excellent addition to the world of Shrek, firmly rooted in fairy tales but also given a surprising amount of depth here. Antonio Banderas, as per usual, is also pitch-perfect as the titular cat. His voice is sultry and seducing, so much so that it feels a little wrong for a kid’s film. The same goes for Salma Hayek. Their vocal chemistry is off the charts, making The Last Wish a treat for kiddos and adults alike.  Perhaps that’s the biggest strength of the film. It’s very clearly a kid’s film; most of the comedy is pure slapstick, but the storyline feels much more mature than previous Dreamworks animated efforts. It’s not exactly groundbreaking stuff plot-wise, but The Last Wish feels distinctly more ambitious than its predecessor.  The Last Wish also reaches for the sky with its animation style. The film mixes several different styles, which gives it a sense of prestige. The Last Wish clearly wants to hit the same notes that Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse did. Animation is a genre that is constantly evolving, and The Last Wish successfully blends different styles together for a dynamic end result, even if none of it is quite as memorable or zeitgeisty as desired.  There is also something uncanny about the human character design. In the first sequence, in which Puss is hosting a lavish party, the human faces look Disney-fied with unnaturally large eyes. This brings the film down a tad, but thankfully, the story is what really keeps The Last Wish going.  The Last Wish is funny enough to appeal to kids, but it’s also honest enough to entertain adults. There are plenty of references to other fairy tales, occasionally making The Last Wish feel like a game of bingo. The film also holds a potent, if uninspired, message about appreciating and living your life to the fullest.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a worthy sequel and Dreamworks Animation’s most ambitious, visually striking film in years. With stellar voice performances from Banderas, Hayek and Pugh, The Last Wish has cemented its place as a great sequel and a superb animated film.  ★★★★☆ The Sitting Duck unveils the gripping journey of trade unionist Maureen Kearney, brilliantly portrayed by Isabelle Huppert, amidst harrowing political intrigue and personal hardship.

"Feb 2, 2023",negative," Somewhat mystifyingly, some top-secret algorithmic function in DreamWorks Animation’s audience-reaction data analysis software has decreed that yet another comeback is in order for the sort of OK-ish and meh-plus character of Puss in Boots, smokily voiced by Antonio Banderas, originally seen in 2004 in Shrek 2, and then in the 2010 spinoff feature Puss in Boots. The numbers have come chuntering out of the side of some giant IBM-style computer, the suits have frowningly inspected them, and another tranche of Puss in Boots content has been greenlit. Once again, debonair outlaw Puss in Boots – a sort of cleaned-up southern European version of Jack Sparrow – is having sword-twirling adventures, again in the company of his paramour Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek); but now PiB must confront his own mortality, having used up eight of his nine lives. He is on a quest to put off the evil hour by finding the legendary wishing star which once fell to earth like a comet; he and Kitty join forces with the perky mutt Perrito (Harvey Guillén), but must battle other fairytale/nursery-rhyme honchos, including a Cockney crime family in the form of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo), and “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney) – to whom all the funny lines are given. Wagner Moura voices the Wolf, who is the grim reaper, wielding a couple of sickles. Really, this movie is a huge 102-minute additional scene, something that would go on the extras package of a Blu-ray edition of the previous Puss in Boots film, or possibly get its own video-on-demand release. It feels like something to put on your TV or iPad to pacify a toddler; nothing wrong with that, of course, and many stressed parents would call it the noblest artistic calling. But how bland and forgettable this film is, without in the smallest way harnessing the real performing power of Banderas, Colman, Pugh, Winstone et al."
"Feb 1, 2023",positive,"Funny, poignant, beautifully animated, an absolute delight for children and adults. Hands down one of the best films of the year."
"Feb 1, 2023",positive," After Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler and Black Swan, Darren Aronofsky takes his appetite for corporeal punishment to new levels with The Whale, a grim tale of compulsive self-loathing rendered as an Oscar-baiting redemption story. Brendan Fraser takes the lead as Charlie, a morbidly obese gay shut-in eating himself to death in response to the grief he feels over the unexpected death of his partner and the family he lost when he came out. Estranged from his ex-wife and teenage daughter, he lives alone, teaching college writing classes online, a gig that allows him to stay hidden from the world (he disables his webcam during Zoom classes) while feeding his excessive junk food addiction with daily take-out orders. That Charlie is a guy whose heart has literally and figuratively been broken by years of self-abuse, shame and guilt is made clear in the opening scenes: masturbating to gay porn, he has a seizure and has to be rescued by a door-stepping missionary, whom he coaxes into reading an extract from a student essay on Moby Dick that calms him down enough to prevent a full cardiac arrest. The significance of the essay will be revealed much later, though Charlie reads it again and again, treating it as an emotional crutch, as vital to his ability to get through each day as the actual walking-frame he needs to get around his cramped apartment. For the duration of the movie Fraser is buried beneath the sweaty folds and distended bulges of a 300-pound prosthetic suit, a physical transformation that all but guaranteed his Oscar nomination before the film even came out. He brings what dignity he can to the role; you can read the sadness in his eyes as a sympathetic reflection of someone trapped by the extremity of their situation. But there’s a whiff of freak-show leeriness to his presentation too – and the additional use of Charlie’s sexuality as a catalyst for his tragic situation is another well-worn Oscar trope. Aronofsky also revels a little too much in Charlie’s zoo or aquarium-like existence, deploying a boxy aspect ratio to accentuate the already tight confines of his apartment, and providing him with a parade of curious visitors and caretakers, among them his best friend Liz (Hong Chau, also Oscar nominated); Thomas (Ty Simpkins), the aforementioned missionary, and eventually Charlie’s daughter, Ellie (Stranger Things star Sadie Sink), whose unhappy life Charlie desperately wants to fix by sacrificing his own. Chau adds some spark here, but the subplots involving Simpkins' and Sink’s characters feel contrived. Aronofosky’s decision to embrace the film’s stage origins (it’s based on screenwriter Samuel D Hunter’s play of the same name) doesn’t help matters either – the stripped down aesthetic only adding to the suspicion that there’s not much more to this than the body horror spectacle of its central performance. M Night Shyamalan’s Knock at the Cabin begins in exquisitely creepy fashion with a little girl called Wen (Kristen Cue) happily playing in the woods as a stranger approaches. The stranger is polite but looks intimidating (he’s played by Dave Bautista) and Wen is savvy enough not to trust him, an instinct that will soon prove correct when the stranger and three friends force their way into the cabin Wen’s dads (Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) have rented for their vacation. This being a Shyamalan film, what follows isn’t a standard home invasion thriller. Adapted from Paul Tremblay’s best-seller A Cabin at the End of the World, it’s a twisty armageddon-themed horror with Bautista and his cohorts (played by Rupert Grint, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Abby Quinn) an intriguing spin on the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Shyamalan remains great at using his camera to switch perspectives and destabilise what we think we know of a story and though he doesn’t quite find a way to resolve the ambiguity of the premise without resorting to literalness in the hokey finale, this and last year’s Old suggest he’s very much back on form. Donkeys are currently having quite the moment in arthouse films, featuring in Triangle of Sadness, The Banshees of Inisherin and now EO, a surreal updating of Robert Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar designed to provide a reflective snap-shot of modern-day Europe by following the travails of the titular donkey as it changes ownership after being cut loose from the circus. Directed by veteran Polish filmmaker Jerzy Skolimowski, the film deploys impressionistic flourishes, point-of-view shots and even suggests EO has a romantic yearning for his former trainer. Mostly, though, this passive protagonist functions as a placid barometer of human civility. Isabelle Huppert co-stars. Donkey doesn’t feature in Shrek spin-off Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, but given this belated sequel to 2011’s original Puss in Boots sets up a future return to Far Far Away, don’t rule out his re-appearance at some point. This film, though, finds its Antonio Banderas-voiced feline swashbuckler reckoning with mortality after using up eight of his nine lives. The plot thus finds him on a quest to find a wishing star in the hope of restoring the lives he’s recklessly frittered away, a quest complicated by other fairytale characters intent on securing the wish for themselves. In the tradition of Shrek, the film has fun deconstructing fairytale lore, though what really distinguishes it is the animation, which has a more painterly and pleasingly hand-crafted feel. Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman and Salma Hayek Pinault are among new and returning voice cast."

After more than a decade, the feline favourite is back on the big screen, fighting, flirting and… feeling the cold breath of death on his furry shoulders. This fun, frenetic and fleet-footed sequel to Puss in Boots (2011) explores depths undreamed of in recent sweet-natured Netflix series spin-off The Adventures of… It isn’t afraid to stray over to the dark side, as when Puss’ fatal opening scrap with a tree troll leaves him with just one of his reckless lives left. He also has an unbeatable Big Bad Wolf bounty hunter on his tail (Wagner Moura, growling out Narcos-worthy menace). Consigned to the daily litter-box-and-kibble torment of Mama Luna’s (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) cat sanctuary, Banderas’ gato macho sinks into a hilariously deadpan existential crisis. But co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado’s storytelling soon has him chasing a map leading to the fabled Wishing Star, desperate to restore his nine lives and legendary status.  Puss forms a bickering trio with old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) and clingy therapy-dog Perrito (a scene-stealing Harvey Guillén); setting off to rob the map from ‘Big’ Jack Horner (John Mulaney), our heroes’ quest becomes a family-friendly spaghetti western: The Good, the Bad and the Cuddly, basically. In high Shrek-franchise style, the filmmakers cram The Last Wish with galloping action laced with sly, knowing fairytale gags. Take Florence Pugh’s grasping gangster Goldilocks and her quarreling cockney Three Bears crime family, who are also in hot pursuit of the Star in the Dark Forest. And then there’s Mulaney’s magic-snatching Jack Horner, a mobster so immoral that his Jiminy Cricket-style ‘Ethical Bug’ (voiced by Kevin McCann) can’t find his conscience. Though there’s much to chortle at here, Paul Fisher’s smart scripting also provides notably chewy characters and themes for a comic romp whose warm, painterly animation suggests a classic storybook. As Puss, Kitty and Goldilocks wrestle with their wishes (and the Dark Forest’s trippily animated carnivorous plants and mind-bending glades), the story offers some graceful, understated lessons about the difference between ‘wants’ and ‘needs’. However, what really elevates this sophisticated sequel is Banderas’ rich voicework, which reveals that, under Puss’ suave bluster, there’s a moody moggie discovering fear for the first time. For once, as he faces up to the Wolf’s ferocious blades, the stakes are as big as the laughs for the stabby tabby. Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is out in UK cinemas from February 3.

"Jan 30, 2023",positive," ‘My compliments to your cobbler,’ says the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) to Puss In Boots (Antonia Banderas) is the latest cartoon caper from Dreamworks. Given that this is the first sequel to a spin-off to the Sherk franchise, which is pretty much played out since igniting the CGI animation world back, check notes, 22 years ago, anticipation was pretty limited for this one. Expectations aside, it’s a light, fluffy adventure with plenty of knowing gags; whether you love cats or not, Joel Crawford’s film is not a load of old cobblers nor one from the bottom of the litter tray. A lavish, quick off-the mark action set piece shows us that Puss in Boots is getting old; a giant bell falls squarely on his furry little nog and a doctor suggests that he has now used up eight of his nine lives. A chance encounter with the Big Bad Wolf makes a cowardly cat of our hero, who buries his heroic garb and decides to sit out any potential conflicts. But Puss is being sought after by Goldilocks and the Three Bears, who are seeking the Wishing Star that can grant one single wish; of course, Puss in Boots wants nothing more than to get his eight lives back, and goes off in search, accompanied by Kitty Softpaws, voiced by Salma Hayek. As a Dreamworks animation, this is still a cut above most; Florence Pugh is Goldilocks, and Olivia Colman and Ray Winstone are Mama and Papa Bear respectively. But the MVP here is comic John Mulaney, who brings a louche yet manic energy to Little Jack Horner, one of several nursery rhyme characters who get pressed into service here. Appreciating what you’ve got and not betting it all on imponderables is the clear message here, and The Last Wish just about delivers it with some lively voice work and a rather more dynamic animation feel than the previous entry in the franchise. Given the films striking box-office success as counterprogramming to the Avatar sequel, it’s unlikely that this will be the last we see of Puss; while a little darker than the other Shrek films, it’s charming and cute enough to satisfy family audiences. Gags like Puss claiming ‘I am a master of the baking’ suggest a little of the old Shrek humour for adults creeping in, and while the formula is aging like the furrball protagonist, Puss in Boots is the cat’s pyjamas as far as comfort food for kids goes.

"Jan 29, 2023",positive," Once upon a time, there was a cat who was hired to get rid of an ogre. However, he was no match for the ogre or his ‘trusty steed’ so it joined them on their quest to live ‘happily ever after’. Little did they know that this boot-wearing Hispanic cat would become a hero in its own right while expanding the world of fairy tales for audiences worldwide. 12 years after his first solo film, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) returns in an overdue sequel, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Starring a star-studded cast, the swashbuckling feline ventures on a quest through the mysterious Dark Forest to find a Wishing Star – but he is not the only one. Ever since we first met Puss in Boots in Shrek 2, his character has been all about the ‘legend’ that is, Puss in Boots. However, this latest instalment sees his legacy claim eight of his nine lives through his own amusing arrogance. Worried about what his life will become if he died or worse, was a normal cat, he chooses to hide away from death (or a Big Bad Wolf voiced by Wagner Maura) and resign to the mundane life of a house cat. But when Puss hears about a wishing star that can replenish his lost lives, he decides to take on Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo), as well as magic collector Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), to find it – with the help of a new canine companion (Harvey Guillén) and love interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault). As we enter the sixth instalment of the Shrek franchise, audiences have already seen a lot of well-known fairy tale characters reimagined during its over-20-year history. But Puss in Boots: The Last Wish seem to continue the series’ magic of reviving famous characters in a mostly villainous and hilarious way. In this instalment, Goldilocks and The Three Bears are reimagined as a crime family (think the Mitchells from Eastenders) and nursery rhyme character Big Jack Horner has grown up to run a huge pie corporation with a grudge against fairy tale magic. Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow’s screenplay allows the characters to find their way without being heavy-hearted. Everyone is quite selfish regarding their respective wishes, whether it is new lives, a family or their own ‘happy ever after’, but everyone, along with Puss and Kitty Softpaws, is relentless in their pursuit of the Wishing Star to comical effect. The screenplay also allows them to display some vulnerability and frustration with their own circumstances, enabling them to slowly appreciate what they have, rather than crave something superficial. Although Goldi and the Bears allow their family dynamic to sometimes dampen their effectiveness as fairy tale gangsters, one of the other new additions is a consistent scene-stealer. Referred to as Purrito, the over-excited, sock-wearing pup offers buckets of enthusiasm and charm without delving into over-sentimentalism. But it is his empathy that makes him such a great addition – in a franchise where a lot of characters are all about their own desires, Purrito is happy to appreciate what is in front of him despite his ignorance of his tragic puphood. His ambition to be a therapy dog also delivers sweet moments and makes him a great buffer between the anti-social, bickering yet adorable felines. The vast array of characters allows director Joel Crawford to make the most of the film’s eclectic voice cast. Mainstays Banderas and Hayek Pinault are consistently brilliant with Pugh, Colman, Winston and Kayo amping up the Cockney gangster vibe as Goldi and the Three Bears. Additional credit goes to Guillén, Maura and Mulaney for their respective performances as their characters help bring complexity to the table. Following last year’s The Bad Guys, Dreamworks continues to incorporate a grittier animation style after the success of Into The Spiderverse. This sees less detail in the intricacy of the characters but elevates the action scenes to a comic book style while retaining the fantastical elements worthy of a fairy tale. Overall, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a brilliantly entertaining instalment of the Shrek franchise. With dazzling colours, great characters and jokes galore, it is unadulterated family entertainment."
"Jan 28, 2023",positive," You’d be forgiven for thinking that the Shrek franchise was on its last life by now. While the 2001 original and its even-funnier 2004 sequel shook up the status quo with their sharp Disney-fairy-tale satire, diminishing returns saw the anarchic ogre’s impact dwindle over time. It’s fair to say, then, that Puss In Boots: The Last Wish — a sequel to a spin-off that graced cinema screens over a decade ago — doesn’t arrive with much momentum behind it. That it frequently explodes into sequences of vital, visually dazzling, capital-c Cinema is a truly unexpected delight. In its opening 15 minutes, it’s clear that The Last Wish is fighting tooth and claw to exceed expectations — kicking off with a kinetic kitty versus kaiju set-piece that re-establishes the legendary status of Puss In Boots for an audience who have likely long moved on. Antonio Banderas (who originated the role way back in Shrek 2) returns to voice the Zorro-styled, leche-lapping swashbuckler, whose diminutive stature belies feats of highwire heroism. Taking on a moss-covered mountain beast with only his rapier, it’s an eye-boggling, pulse-pounding sequence, gorgeously animated in striking digital-paint brushstrokes, and intentionally stuttering Spider-Verse-esque frame-rate effects. The effect is dazzling — once again, it’s apparent that Spider-Verse has upped the game of every animation studio in town. The Last Wish capitalises on that with visual flourishes that bring real dynamism to its action scenes, breaking away from the homogenous stylings of late-’00s 3D animation to deliver ultra-expressive, impressionistic imagery. That boundary-pushing extends to the themes explored here, too — if younger viewers won’t necessarily be familiar with Puss In Boots himself, they also likely won’t be expecting a treatise on mortality and PTSD. But that’s The Last Wish’s central preoccupation, as Puss realises his nine lives have dwindled down to one (capped off in a hilarious moggy-murder-montage), and that death itself is rapidly approaching. With stakes this high, notions this existential, and a superhero this hairy, it often plays like a kid-friendly Logan. Everything exceptional about The Last Wish makes the more generic elements stand out, such as the supporting characters, some of which don’t quite sing. A gangster-family Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) wring few laughs, while villain Jack Horner (John Mulaney) also feels like a distraction. But in most regards, The Last Wish is a minor miracle — visually daring, frequently funny, and surprisingly emotional. Against all the odds, it could bring the Shrek series back to all-star status."

"Jan 22, 2023",positive," One of the great surprises of the 2022 movie season, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish  is a fun sequel we never knew we needed. Blends comedy, action, and some tender moments (the panic attack scene is a powerful memory), while also reuniting Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinault in a winning and wonderful way. I suppose if you were not a fan of Shrek films or the previous Puss in Boots film from 2011, this may be of little to no interest to you. Though it has near unanimous acclaim, some feel the film is convoluted, borrows from other film concepts, and is thin on plot and story. Not my take, but it is a take that is out there. Sometimes you just have to tip your hat, and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the sequel I never thought I needed. Though a fan of the first Shrek films, where the Antonio Banderas-voiced “Puss in Boots” character first debuted, I was rather lackluster on the Banderas-led spinoff in 2011. Puss in Boots had a couple fun moments: some fun banter between Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinault’s Kitty Softpaws and the “Oooohhh Cat,” who became a meme for a number of years on social media. However, the 2011 film is largely forgettable and nothing I have revisited since watching it all those years ago.And so, imagine my surprise when minutes into the sequel I am laughing rather heartily. Or stepping back and admiring the different animation techniques used to establish characters and distinguish between feelings of fear, arrogance, and the normal look-and-feel of the Shrek and Shrek-adjacent movies. Banderas’ performance is full of energy and vitality. The movie begins at a brisk pace, packed with grand enthusiasm. Suffice to say, this film feels a whole lot different than its predecessor.In The Last Wish, Puss learns he must live more carefully and with less brazen risk. After he is brought back by his doctor, following an unfortunate encounter with a massive bell, Puss realizes he has used up eight of his nine lives. With only one life left, Puss begins to rationalize changes he needs to make, while also encountering a Grim Reaper-style wolf (Wagner Moura), who haunts him seemingly at every turn.Though it can feel intense, and younger viewers may have a need to snuggle up with someone they trust when the striking, menacing wolf arrives on screen, The Last Wish is largely a breeze. To hide away from the wolf, Puss hides out in a cat sanctuary, run by the sweet-tempered Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). One of a few dozen cats overseen by Mama Luna, Puss resigns himself to being a housecat, giving up his swashbuckling, adventurous life for that of a plain old domestic. Over time, a new arrival, a chihuahua in disguise named Perrito (a scene-stealing Harvey Guillén), becomes an ally. The stakes amplify when Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) shows up, along with her Three Bears, to claim a ransom on Puss. When Puss learns that the opportunity to gain a wish comes in the form of “The Wishing Star,” he seeks to find the star, even if it means he runs up against another potential danger in “Big” Jack Horner, the large, grown-up version of “Little” Jack Horner, voiced by John Mulaney.  Sometimes you just have to tip your hat, and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the sequel I never thought I needed. Though a fan of the first Shrek films, where the Antonio Banderas-voiced “Puss in Boots” character first debuted, I was rather lackluster on the Banderas-led spinoff in 2011. Puss in Boots had a couple fun moments: some fun banter between Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinault’s Kitty Softpaws and the “Oooohhh Cat,” who became a meme for a number of years on social media. However, the 2011 film is largely forgettable and nothing I have revisited since watching it all those years ago. And so, imagine my surprise when minutes into the sequel I am laughing rather heartily. Or stepping back and admiring the different animation techniques used to establish characters and distinguish between feelings of fear, arrogance, and the normal look-and-feel of the Shrek and Shrek-adjacent movies. Banderas’ performance is full of energy and vitality. The movie begins at a brisk pace, packed with grand enthusiasm. Suffice to say, this film feels a whole lot different than its predecessor. In The Last Wish, Puss learns he must live more carefully and with less brazen risk. After he is brought back by his doctor, following an unfortunate encounter with a massive bell, Puss realizes he has used up eight of his nine lives. With only one life left, Puss begins to rationalize changes he needs to make, while also encountering a Grim Reaper-style wolf (Wagner Moura), who haunts him seemingly at every turn. Though it can feel intense, and younger viewers may have a need to snuggle up with someone they trust when the striking, menacing wolf arrives on screen, The Last Wish is largely a breeze. To hide away from the wolf, Puss hides out in a cat sanctuary, run by the sweet-tempered Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). One of a few dozen cats overseen by Mama Luna, Puss resigns himself to being a housecat, giving up his swashbuckling, adventurous life for that of a plain old domestic.  Over time, a new arrival, a chihuahua in disguise named Perrito (a scene-stealing Harvey Guillén), becomes an ally. The stakes amplify when Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) shows up, along with her Three Bears, to claim a ransom on Puss. When Puss learns that the opportunity to gain a wish comes in the form of “The Wishing Star,” he seeks to find the star, even if it means he runs up against another potential danger in “Big” Jack Horner, the large, grown-up version of “Little” Jack Horner, voiced by John Mulaney.  Though kids will navigate this pretty easily, having a large number of villains threatening Puss becomes a bit much to manage. Goldilocks and the Three Bears (including Olivia Colman as Mama Bear), the Wolf, and Jack Horner all want to take Puss’ last life. I suppose something can be said about the deck being stacked against our proverbial feline hero, but the movie bogs down quite a bit when it tries to give weight and meaning to each villain’s story and journey towards ending Puss in Boots once and for all.Hayek Pinault’s spitfire return as Kitty Softpaws, a love/hate love interest for Puss, is fun and Guillén, who you may know from the FX series, “What We Do in the Shadows,” is tremendous. The animation is especially impressive, mixing different styles and looks, depending on the nature of the threat and the scene. While Jack Horner looks bulbous and large (a bit over-the-top though, if being honest), the Wolf has a stark, intense presence that feels different than anything else in the film. The Shrek franchise certainly has its distinctive presentation, which is visible here, but the backdrops and the details are much more enhanced than I remember. Even when the story lags, or much of the action takes place in the center of the screen (a constant frustration with American animation), letting your eyes wander around and take in what’s in the background reaps some great rewards.Maybe the bar was set low, but even with too many villains and a reliance on a few too many action and fight scenes, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is quite the fun surprise to uncover at year’s end. Director Joel Crawford, and co-director Januel Mercado, have found a way to make this character matter, and the adventures fairly meaningful, as we potentially find Puss and his friends reconnecting with some of their “old friends” again in the future.

"Jan 20, 2023",positive," There, I said it. I may get criticized, I may get canceled, I may get banned from Shrekfest for life. But I needed to speak my truth. The “Puss in Boots” movies, both the 2011 original and the new sequel “The Last Wish,” run circles around the “Shrek” movies they spun off from. Much of the charm of ""Puss in Boots"" is due to the voice acting of Antonio Banderas, whose rum-bottle-wrapped-in-velvet purr is hilarious. He's an orange tabby who’s also a swashbuckling adventurer very much in the vein of Zorro (who Banderas played in 1998’s “The Mask of Zorro”). Puss even carves a “P” into the shirt of one of his adversaries with his sword, in case you missed the connection. “The Last Wish” opens with Puss at the top of his game, singing, swinging and slashing his way through bad guys (including a lumbering giant) in the colorful opening sequence. The animation style has even upped its game as well — the computer-generated 3D is given colorful textures that look like they were made with a paintbrush. During the fight scenes, the frame rate of the animation drops a little, making the action a little choppier but more dynamic to watch. Puss does get smashed by the giant — but he’s got nine lives, so what does he care? Except that his doctor has been keeping score, and informs Puss that he’s already used up eight of them. (There’s a funny montage of all eight of his deaths, including ignoring a shellfish allergy.) Now a wolf Grim Reaper is stalking Puss, patiently waiting for Death No. 9, which leaves Puss not feeling so footloose and fancy free. Puss tries retiring from the swashbuckling game and gets adopted by a cat lady (Da’vine Joy Randolph), but the simple life doesn’t stick. Reunited with his old love interest/rival, the master thief Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss heads off on a quest to find the “wishing star” that can restore his spent eight lives. Also on the trail of the star, in a “Treasure of the Sierra Madre”-style plot, are Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo), who seem like storybook characters as written by Guy Ritchie. And Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who has turned his love of pies into a criminal enterprise, is also on the hunt. Directed by Joel Crawford and co-directed Januel Mercado, “The Last Wish” consistently delivers good jokes for young and old, dazzling visuals, and an earnest message about living the life you’ve got. Banderas and Hayek have been screen partners from 1995’s “Desperado” to this year’s black comedy “Official Competition,” and they have a warm chemistry here as the feuding cats. But the two feline thieves almost have the movie stolen from them by Harvey Guillen of “What We Do in the Shadows” as a guileless mutt named Perro who latches onto the pair’s quest. It might be time for a spinoff of the spinoff featuring Perro. Share your opinion on this topic by sending a letter to the editor to tctvoice@madison.com.

"Jan 19, 2023",positive," PLOT: Puss in Boots is back, and this time he is nearly out of his nine lives. Thankfully he may have an answer. With the legend of a lost star that can grant a single wish, he and his pals seek out this magical item in hopes to prolong his kitty lives. REVIEW: The cat is back. Over a decade after the first cat-centric adventure, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish makes a swashbuckling return to the big screen. Antonio Banderas is back as Puss, along with his on-and-off romantic interest, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). This time, the cast includes a good-hearted undercover puppy played by by the scene-stealer Harvey Guillén. Florence Pugh as Goldilocks, and her three bears (Olivia Coleman, Samson Kayo, and Ray Winstone) are all terrific. John Mulaney shows up as the adult version of Jack Horner – if you remember the nursery rhyme – and he embraces it rather well. And William Moura is delightfully wicked as the Big Bad Wolf hunting down the legendary furball. And yes, animated adventures are in season with this delightful family film from Dreamworks. After an impressive opening celebration in the town of all things Puss, the cat faces the fact that he is on the last of his nine lives. Having been warned that he must end his adventurous ways, he is convinced to become a lapcat. However, Puss’ fate is not with cat lady De’Vine Joy Randolph. Unfortunately for him, the Big Bad Wolf, a bounty hunter, is hot on his trail to take him in. However, you can’t keep Puss down. When he runs into an old friend, the sly Kitty Softpaws (Hayek), the two find themselves hunting for a legendary star that will grant one final wish. With only one life left, Puss is desperate to find a magical gift to grant someone the legend of the “last wish.” Yet Kitty, Puss, and their adorable companion Perro (Harvey Guillén) aren’t the only ones on the prowl. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish starts with a bang. The opening action sequence is surprisingly exciting. And yes, it all leads to many humorous adventures. Even still, the Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado-directed feature is just as thrilling as it is charming. The entire premise of searching for what could grant the most potent wish brings a sense of wonder and thrills. Within the world, the characters must follow a map that leads them on dangerous roads which appear impossible to maneuver through. Yet the way they find their destination is decidedly exciting. The Last Wish works on many levels. It’s a visual treat with a sweet script, and it also mixes humor and big blockbuster moments rather well. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek make for a great on-screen duo once again. The two balance each other perfectly with their terrific vocal performances. One scene where they try and out cute each other had me laughing, quite literally, out loud. That happened a few times, and that’s an absolute joy to feel while watching an animated flick. The side characters add to the fun. Harvey Guillén brings on the adorableness of Perro. Florence Pugh is a firecracker as Goldilocks, along with the three bears, beautifully done by Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo. And if you want a couple of solid Shrek-like bad guys, we got em. Wagner Moura’s Big Bad Wolf and John Mulaney’s Jack Horner offer clever villainy for a movie like this. Ultimately, the sequel brings the visual flair and the enjoyable characters to the forefront. The script manages a return to the charms of the Shrek-inspired franchise. Way back when, Mike Myers brought an edge to the fairy tale come to life. And with this, there’s much for adults as well. Even the premise within the script written by Tommy Swerdlow and Paul Fisher handles aging in an entertaining, yet heartfelt way. The final act has a sweet message that will charm even the most cynical viewers. The Last Wish is a sequel that manages to bring back much of the magic from before. All the way back to when we first were introduced to this fantastical Far Far Away. And yes, the new film does tie into that in an inspired way. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a solid return for the imaginative and comedic fairy tale world. As a sequel to a film from 2011, the magic holds up better than one may expect. The cast is great, and the visuals are wildly impressive. The sequel may not change how we see animated cinema, but it will undoubtedly bring laughs aplenty to the whole family. I was smiling ear to ear for most of this feature. And yes, even I found myself curious to see if we can have yet another good sequel from the land that is Far, Far Away. If you still long for Shrek and friends, you’ll be happy to hear that this is a witty and action-packed return to that quirky and comedic magic. We have compiled a list of everything we know about 28 Years Later, a trilogy of sequels to Danny Boyle and Alex Garland’s 28 Days Later. The Fall Guy just hit CinemaCon for a victory lap after premiering at SXSW. Does it live up to the hype and give Ryan Gosling a clasic role?"
"Jan 19, 2023",positive," A sequel to 2011’s Puss in Boots, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish follows Antonio Banderas’ title character as he teams up with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) and Perrito (Harvey Guillén) to track down the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star. It’s clear, ultimately, that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is at its best in its lighthearted and frequently funny opening stretch, as filmmaker Joel Crawford, armed with Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow’s screenplay, has suffused the proceedings with a brisk, tongue-in-cheek sensibility that’s heightened by a smattering of agreeable jokes and digressions (eg a montage of exactly how Puss lost eight of his nine lives) – with the watchable vibe heightened by Banderas and his various costars’ amusing voice work. (John Mulaney’s larger-than-life turn as the villainous Jack Horner remains a highlight, to be sure.) There’s little doubt, then, that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish‘s overall impact is hindered by a hit-and-miss midsection that places far too pronounced an emphasis on loud, over-the-top action sequences (ie it’s all just so frenetic), and the movie, which admittedly does conclude on a relatively satisfying note, does feel like it might’ve benefited from both a shorter running time and a more low-key execution – with the final result a decent-enough animated endeavor that could (and should) have been so much better."
"Jan 19, 2023",positive,Will lessons imparted about the appreciating what we have fly over the heads of younger kids? Possibly. Will off-handed references to drowning puppies? Possibly not.
"Jan 19, 2023",positive," The Shrek franchise is a muddled one at best. The first film is fantastic and Shrek 2 is decent while Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After just drain a tired ogre’s swamp for everything it’s worth. The overall disappointment with where the franchise headed in later sequels put off the desire to ever see the 2011 Puss in Boots film. However, it may be worth a visit now since Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is so exceptionally great and the best animated film of the year.  Directed by Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado (The Croods: A New Age) with a story by Tommy Swerdlow (The Grinch) and Tom Wheeler (Puss in Boots) and a screenplay by Paul Fisher (The Lego Ninjago Movie) and Tommy Swerdlow, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has an animation style that is drastically different from the realistic style you’ve come to associate with Shrek and Puss in Boots. Utilizing drastic perspectives, action sequences that slow down to emphasize major blows before speeding up again, and different frame rates to give characters and enemies unique movements, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is visually similar to the likes of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and The Bad Guys. The film is essentially a race to the star to see who can get the wish first. Puss is accompanied by a female cat named Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). Their troubled past keeps them in constant conflict. When Puss briefly retires as a hero, he meets a therapy dog named Perrito (Harvey Guillen) who is now convinced they are best friends, is happy about everything, and doesn’t want to wish for anything. Standing in the way of Puss and his wish is the criminal masterminds Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), Mama Bear (Olivia Colman), and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo) and the relentless and magic-obsessed Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Like Shrek, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish toys with being more adult than the average animated film. Visually dark at times with flashes of red and orange and constant close encounters with death, The Last Wish also deals with more mature dialogue with both, “crap,” and, “hell,” being muttered on at least one occasion and Baby being referred to as a “dingleberry.” Perrito also gets bleeped for his heavier use of vulgarity. One of his more memorable sequences is when a long line of bleeps covers up his insults about the three bears. Hearing John Mulaney as a villain of any film, animated or otherwise, is a bit odd and takes some getting used to. Mulaney is no stranger to animation as a regular on Big Mouth and as the voice of Chip in this year’s Disney+ exclusive film Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers. But this is the first time Mulaney hasn’t exaggerated his voice into that nasal tone you’ve come to expect from Andrew Glouberman or even Mulaney’s own standup. Mulaney is more relaxed here as Jack Horner, which only makes his angry outbursts all the more unsettling. Bits of comedy still drip through Horner’s dialogue, but the character is mostly heartless and Mulaney delivers a startling performance to match. Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio explored a familiar tale with a different concept; the wooden boy never wanted to be human. Pinocchio is the only character in the film not controlled by strings. In a conceptually similar fashion, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish dives into loving the life you have and appreciating every day as if it’s your last rather than relying on a wish to make everything better for you. While the humor is often laugh-out-loud funny, Puss actually goes through some severe character development over the course of The Last Wish. He matures and goes in an unexpected direction. The way the film reopens the door to future installments is masterfully subtle in a way that doesn’t feel like obvious sequel bait, as well. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is stylish and fun with sleek animation, a thrillingly adventurous story, off-the-wall humor, and fantastic writing that is penned in a way that rejuvenates what was thought to be a dead CGI animated franchise."
"Jan 19, 2023",positive," Kids may pick up some words in Spanish if they don't already know them. From Perrito's model, they can learn the value of positive thinking and of supporting your friends. Family is where you find it, who you make it. If we only have one life to live, we should make the most of it and surround ourselves with those we love. Fame can be lonely and its pursuit ultimately meaningless; true connections with others are more valuable. Puss ultimately realizes how much he cares for others in his life and makes sacrifices for them. Kitty Softpaws sets resentment aside to rescue Puss and Perrito and work with them as a team. Perrito's positive outlook makes his life's path much easier; he's a good and loyal friend. Goldilocks and the bears seek out trouble but are a strong family unit. Jack Horner is a clear villain, but his backstory does attempt to give him some relatability. Voice cast is led by Spanish and Latino actors (Banderas, Hayek, Guillén, etc.) who mix Spanish words and phrases into their dialogue and singing. Other lead characters are voiced by international actors, mostly from the United States, England, Brazil. A minor character (a woman who takes in stray cats) is Black. But ""fat"" is used as an insult, and Jack Horner's size/shape is suggested to be part of what makes him unappealing. Characters face frequent threats, including death in the form of a scary assassin wolf. Puss is killed in an early scene but comes back to life because he's a cat. He then reviews the (comical) ways he was killed eight previous times (including being shot out of a cannon, being squashed by a heavy weight, falling from a significant height, etc.). Animated action sequences involve swords and knives, ominous journeys through menacing settings, fights, falls, explosions, fire, crashes, and so on. Jack Horner is cruel, intimidating, and quick to risk others' lives. One of his minions is eaten by a plant; his skeleton is shown. Puss has a panic attack. ""Hell,"" ""crap,"" ""wuss,"" ""butt,"" ""pooping,"" ""idiot,"" ""freaking,"" ""stupid,"" ""weird,"" ""bull,"" ""jerks,"" ""fat"" (as an insult), and words (seems like mostly ""s--t"") that are bleeped out. ""Dingleberries"" are mentioned. In one of his death scenes, Puss is staggeringly drunk (revisited via flashback a couple of times). Puss also laps up milk in a bar. Parents need to know that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish -- which centers on popular Shrek 2 character Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) -- ratchets up the franchise's peril a notch. Puss is down to the last of his nine lives, and he's pursued throughout the movie by a creepy, whistling manifestation of death in the form of a wolf who wields two sharp crescent-shaped swords. In his pursuit of the mystical Last Wish, which could restore his squandered lives, Puss encounters a series of other menacing characters, ominous situations, and violent fights (with swords, knives, and other weapons). But he also learns lessons about the value of positive thinking, working with others, and prioritizing loved ones over selfish pursuits. The voice cast, led by a Spanish and Latino cast, peppers the dialogue with Spanish. Language includes ""hell,"" ""crap,"" ""wuss,"" ""butt,"" ""pooping,"" ""idiot,"" ""freaking,"" ""stupid,"" ""weird,"" and some bleeped words. Puss is shown staggeringly drunk in a couple of scenes that are played for humor. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. Fearless hero Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) is enjoying the spoils of his fame when he's unexpectedly killed at the start of PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH. As he's brought back to life, he's warned that he has now run through eight of his nine lives. The reality of his mortality fills Puss with a newfound fear of death. This is amplified by the menacing wolf (Wagner Moura) who begins pursuing him, promising to take his last life. Puss goes into hiding at a cat rescue home, where he meets an innocent and lonely chihuahua, Perrito (Harvey Guillén), who clings to Puss as his new best friend. One day, the three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo) and Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) show up at Puss' hideout, and the cat overhears their plans to make off with a magical map that will lead them to the mystical Last Wish -- which could perhaps be the secret of regaining his immortality. Puss takes off, Perrito on his tail, to find the map and make his wish. En route, he encounters more threats, especially Jack Horner (John Mulaney), and runs into old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault). Shrek's charismatic cat buddy is back in fine form in this action-packed sequel. But Puss in Boots: The Last Wish might have done well to focus more on its characters, both familiar and new, and less on the nonstop action. The chase and fight scenes are visually impressive, but, narratively, they get old quickly. What doesn't get old is Puss' smug confidence in his feline fierceness and ""fearless hero"" status -- or adorable newcomer Perrito's innate goodness. It's almost a letdown when the fantabulous opening musical number gives way to a traditional chase and fight scene. The voice cast -- led by Banderas, love interest Hayek, and newcomer Guillén as the charming chihuahua -- is once again purr-fect. And the movie throws in quite a bit of Spanish in ways both natural (exclamations) and complementary (the soundtrack). The music is one of the film's standout elements. Overseen by Brazilian composer Heitor Pereira, the soundtrack ranges from original pieces sung by Pereira and Banderas or Latin American stars like Gaby Moreno and Karol G to reworked classics, like a Spanish-infused version of The Doors' ""The End"" (Puss' own Apocalypse Now?). The story's blend of fairy tale characters can be a tad confusing -- menacing villain Jack Horner, a selfish Goldilocks sometimes confused for Bo Peep, and a big, bad wolf. It's part of the Shrek franchise's personality, but unrecognized characters could have functioned just as well and maybe have been less muddied, allowing even more focus on the fanciful felines. The reality is that many viewers will come for the cat -- and this latest adventure does assure that they'll stay for the cat. Families can talk about what Puss learns over the course of his adventures in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. What do Perrito and Kitty Softpaws show him through their own actions? How do they all learn to work as a team? How did the scary/violent scenes in this movie compare to those in the other Shrek and Shrek-related movies? What's the impact of media violence on kids?

"Jan 18, 2023",positive," Oh, the joy of walking into a movie with no expectations, as I did for “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” and coming away with a big goofy grin, because of the abundant humor and attention to the animation detail that combine for a surprisingly delightful gem. For those who don’t remember, Puss — as charmingly voiced by Antonio Banderas — was a supporting player in the second “Shrek” movie, the adventuresome cat repurposed as a Zorro-like swashbuckler. He got his own movie in 2011, and apparently the minds at DreamWorks thought he should get another one. I don’t really care how it happened, but it’s wonderful that it did, because “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish’ may be the best movie in the “Shrek” franchise. The movie starts with Puss doing what he does best: Battling bad guys, saving townsfolk, and looking debonair doing it. At the end of this particular adventure — rendered with full action-movie adrenaline by directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado — Puss gets crushed by the town’s massive church bell. Well, no problem for a cat with nine lives, right? Well, maybe not, when Puss counts up his past lives (a clever montage of mishaps and misplaced bravado), and realizes that he’s down to his last life. Puss decides to retire his sword, and enter a nursing home for cats — but there’s only so much soft living a cat of adventure can take. Then he hears there’s a map that can show him the location of the legendary wishing star, and Puss is back in action. But he’s not the only one looking for the map — which was purchased at great expense by the evil head of a pie-baking conglomerate, Big Jack Horner (voiced by comedian John Mullaney). Puss goes to Jack’s lair to steal it, and finds he’s competing for the map with his nemesis and ex-girlfriend, Kitty Softpaws (again voiced by Salma Hayek Pinault, giving us the “Desperado” reunion we always wanted). Puss and Kitty reluctantly join forces, accompanied by an overeager chihuahua they call Perro (and voiced by Harvey Guillen from “What We Do in the Shadows”). Also on the scent of the map is one of the area’s toughest crime families: The Three Bears (voiced by Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo), with their adopted daughter, Goldilocks (voiced by Florence Pugh). And Jack has assembled his goon squad, the Baker’s Dozen, go get his map back. Puss also has to worry about someone who’s chasing him: The Big Bad Wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura, Pablo Escobar from “Narcos”), who’s both a bounty hunter and the embodiment of Death.  There’s a tactile roughness to the computer animation that’s surprisingly energizing, as if the filmmakers decided the action was moving too fast to render too many details. The look matches the pacing, which is usually as fast as Puss’ swordplay and his verbal quips. (Puss’ defiant catchphrase, “Fear me, if you dare!,” will never cease being funny to me.) “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is one of those split-level animated movie that serves up a fun story for the kids, and jokes that will sail over the children’s heads and land with the grown-ups. That approach doesn’t always work on both levels, but when it delights the way this one does, it’s pretty special."
"Jan 18, 2023",positive," Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is rated PG for action/violence, rude humor/language, and some scary moments. The running time is 1 hour and 40 minutes."
"Jan 15, 2023",positive," Whereas most remakes hold some reverence for what came before, the newest House Party movie just lets its fun flag fly. It takes a pretty novel concept (House Party, but at LeBron James’ house) and executes it without too much unnecessary self-seriousness and a bevy of smart stunt castings. Some of the jokes here are mercilessly funny, including one NFL star cameo that has to be one of the best gags in a studio comedy in eons. It’s a shame that this one isn’t getting the best reception, if only because it’s yet another studio comedy that does exactly what you need it to do. What is the bar we are rating these movies with? Do they all have to be sophisticated enough to appeal to the most demanding audiences? Every now and again, it’s just nice to get a soundly written, genuinely funny, admirably silly comedy that doesn’t ask too, too much from its viewer. This is the first movie I’ve ever seen where the main character is based on someone whose Office recaps I used to read pretty regularly. It’s about what you’d expect. Michael Showalter is competent enough to make the real-life drama sink in, and the cast is good enough to sell it. I can’t say all of the stylistic choices worked, and the first act takes some time to really take root. But, y’know, only a jackass could watch the third act and not feel something. A pretty study February chiller with snow everywhere and Henry Melling doing his best Foghorn Leghorn impression. I’m not sure why Christian Bale did this movie since his role doesn’t really ask much of him. But if Scott Cooper is his boy, then you be there for your boy. I’m a sucker for showbiz docs, and I quite liked this one because I think it’s the best thing we’ve gotten in a long time that actually deals with the VFX revolution. This would make a hell of a narrative feature, but they’d never be able to get Disney, ILM or LucasFilm to sign off on anything that this doc deals with (understandably). Steve Williams was a genius, but damn, it sucks to watch a guy realize later in life that he pissed away his success trying to stick it to the man that really wasn’t, y’know, all that bad. Dennis Muren kind of takes one on the chin here, and I think it would’ve been valuable for him to try to explain his side of the story. However, it’s easy to see that it takes a silent village to make these movies, and that the folks winning the Oscars always have people behind them making this all work. That’s true of all jobs on a movie set, but a good reminder all the same. The Puss in Boots movies are much better than the last two Shrek films, which were kind of dumb and greedy. The Spider-Verse animation style is certainly a diversion from the classic DreamWorks format, even though I thought The Bad Guys used it to better effect. Puss’ reckoning with his mortality is much more engaging than the wishing star McGuffin, but it’s all pretty fun and emotionally surprising. We’re probably past due for another Shrek movie, and this was a good reminder that there is more to do there now that DreamWorks seems like it’s actually trying again with the golden goose. Quite enjoyed this. I wasn’t crazy about the stage show, but this was electric. “Revolting Children” is one of the best scenes of the year, full-stop. Emma Thompson is a hell of a Trunchbull, and Alisha Weir and Lashana Lynch are perfect for the material. This is just a thoroughly good stage-to-screen. Feels like it’s going to find its audience and stick around for a while. Better than the 90s one! Clearly ridiculous, but damn it, we didn’t know what we had. This was a blast, and startlingly emotional by the end. The Aerosmith song is still a bop. It’s the affable hangout movie that I kind of expected it to be, with a delightful George Clinton cameo, a great Robin Harris performance and one of the most “oh…oh dear” dated comedy bits of the early 90s. Kid ‘N Play could spit, though! I still don’t know if this is quite the Dadaist masterpiece people make it out to be, whereas a movie like Hot Rod accomplishes the purposeful absurdism with a lot more consistency. I’d love to have seen the Warner Bros. executive who lost his everlasting mind after sitting down and watching millions and millions of dollars shoveled into a furnace for the Vince Vaughn Christmas comedy they were assured would be a laugh fest for the whole family. What a weird ass movie. It’s not really for kids, it’s not really for adults, it’s not really for anyone who enjoys Christmas. It’s a movie that your newly divorced uncle goes to see by himself because Vaughn was in Wedding Crashers and he heard someone at work say they liked it but they were actually thinking of Elf. It’s just got this salty underbelly that doesn’t mesh with the festive nature of it, and Fred Claus is not an interesting character. Vaughn doesn’t ever seem like he wants to be there. Nobody does except for Paul Giamatti, who is wasted as Santa. Why did we waste Paul Giamatti as Santa? Grumpy: Oh, to have been a senior citizen at the height of the Grumpy Old Men films. What dreams may come. This was good! Very nice. Walter Matthau was the all-time grump. They don’t make ‘em like they used to. Grumpier: Burgess Meredith lives his damn life in this one. It’s not quite as efficient as the first, but it’s much better than whatever the hell those reviews were in 1995. Those movie critics had no damn idea what was coming in the streaming age. My Fellow: James Garner reportedly described Peter Segal as “a self appointed genius who didn’t know his ass from second base and Jack and I both knew it.” So I’ll let him speak for the movie."
"Jan 13, 2023",positive," A sequel to a spinoff of a sequel to a storybook mashup—that’s Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Even though the tricks of the Shrek franchise aren’t new, this latest installment still has a lot to offer fans of the cracked-­fairytale genre. The swashbuckling Puss in Boots (voiced again by the incomparable Antonio Banderas) finds he’s buckled with a little too much swash. Fairytale cats might have nine lives, but Puss wasted his first eight in a series of ridiculous misadventures. Now afraid of losing his last life, the once dashing feline has become a shadow of his former self. With help from his sometime-­rival-sometime-love-interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and a new doggie friend Perrito (Harvey Guillén), Puss goes in search of a wishing star that can restore his lost lives. But a couple of criminal gangs are also after the last wish—Goldie’s (Florence Pugh) Bear Family and Jack Horner’s Baker’s Dozen. Despite being marketed as a family movie, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish isn’t for everyone. Many younger children won’t care for the scary scenes in which a wolf-like Grim Reaper pursues Puss, and some of the characters die in comically gruesome ways. The film also pushes the boundary of its PG rating with some unfinished expletives and a bleeped-out tirade. But folks who appreciate the Shrek franchise’s offbeat humor will enjoy Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. The animation is smooth, beautiful, and action-packed. The excellent visuals complement a witty script with a virtuous message. Puss and his friends learn the power of sacrificial love, and many characters in the movie become convicted of their selfishness, learning to be content with what they already have.

"Jan 11, 2023",positive," It’s 18 years since Antonio Banderas’ dashing animated Puss in Boots first appeared on our screens in Shrek 2 – which is 88 cat years. After such a span, one might not expect the fabulous feline to come crashing onto the screen with quite the panache he exhibits here – but then again, cats are said to have nine lives. The problem for puss, as he discovers after his latest bit of derring-do lands him in the mortuary, is that eight of his have already been used up. The opening is overdone, Wonder Woman 1984-style, but is swiftly followed by a magnificently entertaining scene in which we find out what happened to those other eight lives, setting the bar for the rest of the film. The only thing for Puss to do now, the doctor advises, is go into retirement and try to eke out that last life for as long as he can. The character being inspired by the mariachi films in which Banderas first made his name, there is ample precedent for this, and before long he has buried his iconic costume, grown a long white beard and furrowed his brow in a permanent expression of gloom. In keeping with that tradition, Puss soon discovers that retirement isn’t easy. There are some dangerous people still on his trail. Hiding out with a cat lady, he acquires a perky, unreasonably loyal companion in the form of Perrito (Harvey Guillén), a small dog who has disguised himself as a cat to get free food, but it’s not long before his is discovered by his sometime true love, sometime arch enemy Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and the three of them set out in search of a fallen star which Puss hopes to use to restore his lives. Of course, nothing is straightforward. Notorious crime gang Goldilocks and the Three Bears (Florence Pugh, Ray Winstone, Olivia Coleman and Samson Kayo) are also after the star, at the behest of scheming villain and pie magnate Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), whilst Puss is being stalked by Death himself (a big scary wolf voiced by Wagner Moura). What’s more, Kitty is bitter and Puss full of guilt about something that happened in their shared past, and Perrito has no idea what he’s supposed to be doing, though we quickly get the impression that life has always been like that for him. Where earlier Shrek spin-offs depended heavily on retrodden fairy tales and became more and more self-referential, haemorrhaging energy, this one is a real return to form, a fully developed story in its own right. There are no plot points which newcomers to the franchise will be unable to grasp, and although it’s too long for really young children to sit through in one go, there’s humour suitable for all age groups. Entertaining use is made of the idea of feline reincarnation; there’s a moment when Puss is trapped in a cave with his past lives and it all goes a bit Doctor Who. Both he and Kitty need to get past their egos to rediscover their romance, and the chemistry sizzles between Banderas and Hayek as always. Goldilocks has a lesson to learn about family (Pugh clearly relishes a much more aggressive role than she’s had access to before), and little Perrito has to develop a sense of self worth. In the meantime, there’s lots of adventure, with daring heists, kidnaps and rescues, high speed chases and dangerous stunts – all made more nerve-racking by the knowledge that Puss is on his last life. By far the strongest entry in Puss’ solo film career, this doesn’t do much to innovate with the quest framework, and it could stand to lose ten minutes in the midsection (such are the woes of middle age), but it knows its audience and plays its hand well. The self-consciousness of earlier entries is gone. There’s a sense that the creators know they can’t spin out the franchise forever, and that they have realised, at this late hour, that what matters is to have fun with what remains."
"Jan 9, 2023",positive," El Gato con botas, uno de los personajes (sidekicks) de la saga de Shrek, que ya terminó y reiniciará con un reboot, regresa con una película propia, tras El Gato con botas (2011). Los años pasan para todos, y también para el felino aventurero, que puede conmover con sus ojazos.  Y en El Gato con botas: El último deseo, en la que Antonio Banderas vuelve a prestarle su voz, apenas arranca muere aplastado por una enorme campana.  No sería problema para quien tiene nueve vidas como Gato, pero sí si la que acaba de perder es la octava. La visita al médico es esencial: así advierte que murió tantas veces, y el doctor le recomienda dos cosas.  La secuencia en la que Gato recuerda sus ocho muertes -no todas heroicas- es uno de los momentos más hilarantes de esta comedia de acción, al mejor estilo de otras producciones de DreamWorks Animation (¿recuerdan el comienzo de la primera Minions, cuando recuerdan su prehistoria?).  Y antes de tener una crisis de mediana edad, Gato descubre una posible salvación: con la ayuda de su exnovia Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek, otra que regresa) pone el GPS y va para la Selva Negra, en búsqueda de la mítica Estrella de los deseos, a ver si puede recuperar vida.  Llegar hasta la Estrella y no perderla no será sencillo, y en el camino se sumarán personajes (un perrito sarnoso), Ricitos de Oro y una familia de osos delincuentes. Y también, claro, un cazarrecompensas con forma de Lobo, que no sería otro que la Muerte que viene a buscar a Gato, y lo persigue incansablemente.  Hay muchos guiños a clásicos del cine, con mayoría a los spaghetti westerns, y un elenco de voces de estrellas de Hollywood (sumen a Florence Pugh como Ricitos de oro, y Olivia Colman, como Mamá Oso), mientras que en la versión en castellano los talentos locales son Julieta Nair Calvo, Axel Kuschevatzky, Patricia Echegoyen y Mariano Chiesa.  Dirigida por Joel Crawford (Los Croods 2: Una nueva era), El gato con botas: El último deseo es tal vez más oscura que las anteriores del universo de Shrek, en buena parte porque involucra el sentimiento y el temor genuino de perder la vida de una manera, si se quiere, más realista, y las apariciones del Lobo pueden asustar, apenas, a los espectadores más chiquitos que miren la pantalla en vez del balde de pochoclo.  No se preocupen si piensan que ésta será la última aparición del Gato con botas: la imagen final les hará, a los más fanáticos, erizar la piel un poquito. Animación/Comedia. EE.UU., 2022.

"Jan 5, 2023",positive," A decade on from our last brush with Puss, he's back to purr and poke his sword into our hearts and The Last Wish is so worth the wait. Our furry feline finds he's down to his final life - as they say, death comes to us all, even when you have nine lives to live. His fear of dying turns him into Wuss in Boots. And he will need to face that fear and more than a few home truths with the help of old friends and new to be re-born a legend. As a self-confessed crazy cat lady, Puss purred his way into my cinematic affections long ago and I just loved him jumping back onto my lap again."
"Jan 5, 2023",positive," **** Through the cash-grabby muck of soulless animated sequels and uninspired adaptations comes “El Macho Gato,” swooping in like Errol Flynn to save the day. In the Shrek universe’s first offering in over a decade, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) has frittered away his previous eight lives—and the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) has come to claim his last, compelling the once fearless feline into a cozy life as a domesticated house cat. But Puss kicks off his kitten mittens and redons his boots when he hears of a magical MacGuffin that can restore his lost lives. He’s joined by a heartwarmingly hilarious dog, Perrito (Harvey Guillén), and reunites with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), facing down the likes of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears and Jack Horner (John Mulaney) along the way. The big-ticket voice actors offer an unexpected level of characterization, and the film features dynamic animation akin to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Kids will be swept away by a fairy tale that sincerely and movingly evokes the power of family and friendship, while adults will admire how forthrightly the film confronts life beyond the endless hope of youth. And all audiences, no matter their age, will appreciate the film’s conviction that one beautiful life matters as much as nine. PG. RAY GILL JR.

That’s the movie in a nutshell—sweet, slightly insane and irrevocably romantic. It’s true to form for director Damien Chazelle (La La Land), who is enamored with the romance of things lost. This time, the subject of his jubilant-mournful gaze is pre-talkies Hollywood, as embodied by a swaggering, fading star (Brad Pitt), an exuberantly vulgar it girl (Margot Robbie), and a naïve striver (Diego Calva), whose evolution—from eager chauffeur to cynical executive to rueful family man—brashly illustrates how Tinseltown makes and unmakes its denizens. Even at 188 minutes, the film can’t fully illuminate the inner lives of everyone in its vast ensemble (which includes Jovan Adepo as a trumpet player caught in a maelstrom of success and bigotry). Still, to drink in Chazelle’s mad brew of screwball vignettes and nostalgic yearning is to experience a transcendent high. Babylon’s Hollywood is callous and cruel—two behind-the-scenes deaths are greeted with nonchalance by the film’s “heroes”—but it can also be frantically glorious, as Calva’s character learns when he steals an ambulance to get a camera to a set before the sun goes down. He makes it in time for the director to get a shot of Pitt, in medieval garb, smooching his co-star as the light fades from the sky. What a town this was then, Chazelle seems to sigh, though not without defiance. Despite being about a cinematic age long dead, Babylon is blazingly alive. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

Presented publicly as a near-mute, suffocatingly corseted doll, Elisabeth (Vicky Krieps) leads a double life in 1877 Vienna. In private, she’s an expert equestrian, gymnast and fencer, and an advocate for the institutionalized (not to mention a skilled flirt). Her duality flawlessly suits Krieps (Phantom Thread, Bergman Island), who excels in roles that withhold a rich inner life just beyond a patriarchal view. But director Marie Kreutzer (The Ground Beneath My Feet) stretches Elisabeth’s subjugation into a thin, melancholic silence. Corsage aimlessly repeats the notes of Elisabeth’s quiet, failed rebellions to diminishing returns. Considering all that the film ahistorically invents for the character, there’s ample room to make more joy, more passion, more fireworks from Elisabeth’s individuality and desires (without reaching for the opulent heights of a cinematic cousin like Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette). NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Bridgeport, City Center, Fox Tower. ** Tom Hanks has officially entered the curmudgeonly phase of his career. In A Man Called Otto, based on the Swedish-language film A Man Called Ove and the novel by Fredrik Backman, Hanks plays a retired widower who loses the will to live until a new family intrudes into his neighborhood (and, gradually, his life). It’s a story built on the most tired of tropes: the supercilious old white man reluctantly offering sage guidance to today’s incompetent youth while finding his purpose in the process. Worse, Hanks isn’t even right for the role; he seems unable to shake his established persona to sell the emotional journey of a “mean” man we’re supposed to grow to love (an archetype Bill Murray and Clint Eastwood portrayed to near perfection in St. Vincent and Gran Torino, respectively). It doesn’t help that the film never colors outside the lines in its depiction of an elder’s enduring relevance in a changing society, only taking a view from the cheap seats at the story’s more urgent dynamics (including storylines dealing with suicide and gender identity).

"Jan 5, 2023",positive," Gato con botas: El último deseo (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Estados Unidos, 2022). Dirección: Joel Crawford y Januel Mercado. Guion: Tommy Swerdlow, Tom Wheeler, Paul Fisher. Edición: James Ryan. Música: Heitor Pereira. Voces en inglés: Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Patricia Etchegoyen, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo. Distribuidora: UIP. Duración: 102 minutos. Nuestra opinión: buena. Nacido de las entrañas de Shrek, una vez que aquella franquicia quedó concluida en 2010 con Shrek 4: Para siempre, su primer spin-off, bautizado Gato con botas (2011), eligió al personaje más astuto y seductor para continuar ese delirante universo salido de los cuentos de hadas tradicionales. Y como en toda relectura de las viejas tradiciones, la pizca de ingenio y autoconciencia se desplaza de los creadores a los mismos personajes. Por ello Gato con botas es fiel heredero de las aventuras del personaje literario, del glamour de los espadachines cinematográficos –sobre todo del exquisito Tyrone Power en La marca del Zorro (1940) de Rouben Mamoulian, con sus calzas apretadas y su sonrisa llena de dientes– y de la picardía de Antonio Banderas, quien le brinda su voz teñida de acento y aire español. Luego de la presentación con ojitos acaramelados en Shrek 2 y de la pesquisa de los huevos de oro de una gansa en Gato con botas, esta nueva aventura lleva al gato forajido a replantear su vida –o sus vidas- y a luchar con la mismísima muerte. Es que tanta temeridad y displicencia hizo que las nueve vidas que ostentan todos los felinos se escurrieran de sus manos de la manera más banal y absurda, y llegada la última en el carretel es imprescindible encontrar la forma de recomenzar el conteo. Resucitado y provisto de su última oportunidad, Gato con botas deberá seguir un mapa que esconde el destino de una estrella fugaz y el cumplimiento de su anhelado deseo. El viaje hacia esas nuevas vidas recién comienza. Codirigida por Joel Crawford y Januel Mercado –integrantes del equipo creativo de las Kung Fu Panda-, Gato con botas: El último deseo resulta mucho más ágil y divertida que la primera, más cercana al universo del cine de aventuras y destinada a un público infantil un poco más grande (de hecho hay un lobo cazarrecompensas que tiene varias apariciones terroríficas). El carisma de Gato se complementa con el de su inesperado ayudante, un perrito callejero, maltrecho y algo cargoso (con voz de Harvey Guillén), que se convierte en el Sancho Panza de ese alucinado Quijote. La peripecia se completa con el regreso de Kitty (con la voz de Verónica López Treviño reversionando a la original de Salma Hayek) como compañera de aventuras, y la carrera contra reloj junto a Ricitos de Oro y la familia de los Osos, también ansiosos de quedarse con el codiciado deseo. Si bien el espíritu de la película se arraiga en los personajes de los cuentos de hadas y la estructura narrativa se remonta al cine “de capa y espada” –el llamado subgénero de los swashbucklers, cultivado por estrellas como Douglas Fairbanks o Errol Flynn-, es evidente la influencia del animé en las escenas de acción, algo que Dreamworks ya había ensayado en la saga Kung Fu Panda, y el despliegue de un humor que marida perfecto con la autoconciencia de su personaje, y la que añade el propio Banderas y su historial vestido de Zorro. En esa astuta unión está su verdadera magia. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Jan 1, 2023",positive,"Director Joel Crawford (The Cross: A New Age) with Januel Mercado create a tech updated, and more colorful, action-packed animated story. The script by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow brings a more edgy and satiric kind of comedy."
"Dec 31, 2022",positive," Actors spend a lifetime wishing, hoping and praying that role or project that will change their trajectory for life.  No one can ever predict when a franchise become successful or when a role one may inhabit becomes iconic.  For Antonio Banderas, playing Zorro (1998) turns out to the the gift that keeps on giving – when his later ego was turned into animated form for the Shrek franchise and re-invented as Puss In Boots for Shrek the Third in 2007. Puss was such a delightfully popular character that he got spun off into his own individual storyline simply titled  –  Puss In Boots. Now, nearly ten years later Banderas is back and reunited with Salma Hayek (Kitty Softpaws) igniting the scorching hot chemistry audiences were introduced to with them in Robert Rodriguez’s action, crime thriller Desperado back in 1995. In Puss in Boots: The Last Wish – Puss  discovers his passion for adventure has taken its toll while realizing  he’s burnt through eight of his nine lives. In the process of outrunning Death aka The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), this one fearless felinesets out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish in order to restore one last life. Directed by Joel Crawford and co-directed by Januel Mercado, the opening sequence complete with catchy tunes, stunts and choreography is joyous, fun-filled and sucks the audience right in. Florence Pugh as Goldilocks is ruthless with a heart only second to Olivia Colman as Mama Bear.  But, the characters who steal the show are John Mulaney as Jack Horner and Harvey Guillén as Perrito.  They are corny, hilarious and engaging all at once. Most importantly, the lessons for children revolving around the importance of sharing and sometimes placing others needs above your own coupled with making the best of the life you have been given are invaluable and poignant. There couldn’t be a better, more family friendly film to for the holiday season,  You will laugh.  You will cry, but most of all your heart will swell with happiness and joy at seeing our beloved Puss having one more chance to continue being our fearless, over confident, swashbuckling hero."

Written By: Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow, and Tom Wheeler
Runtime: 100 minutes
MPA Rating: Rated PG for action/violence, rude humor/language, and some scary moments. It only took 11 years, but a new solo installment for the fearless, swashbuckling feline hero, Puss in Boots, has finally arrived with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Despite initial skepticism due to the decently average original Puss in Boots movie, it’s obvious that filmmakers Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado overcame the shortcomings of the first film and delivered a rousing, yet heartwarming, animated adventure that lights a greatly needed fire underneath this Shrek spinoff. The initial Puss in Boots film was fairly successful, but the character never truly felt like one deserving of a solo animated adventure until now. A solo Puss in Boots movie was first discussed when the character appeared in a breakout role in Shrek 2. In Shrek 2, the joke was that Puss does not exactly live up to his reputation. He was certainly not a legitimate threat to Shrek and Donkey, but he soon befriends the heroes and becomes a benevolent cohort to their ragtag band. At the same time, the character never felt strong enough to carry his own story. The Last Wish puts Puss (Banderas) at a dire crossroads. After living a frivolous, freewheeling, devil-may-care life of a swashbuckling outlaw/rogue/vigilante, the “fearless” feline now faces the last of his nine lives. Puss must now contend with the fear of death, which terrifies him to his core. Puss is stalked by a deadly bounty hunter, the Big Bad Wolf (Moura), so his fight or flight instincts kick in, and he seeks retirement in the refuge of cat lover Mama Luna (Randolph).  Puss begrudgingly accepts his new mundane existence, and perhaps finds an answer to his troubles in the form of a magical wishing star. Evading the pursuit of the Goldilocks (Pugh) and the Three Bears Crime Family, Puss sets out on a new adventure to find the wishing star to get more lives back. He unwittingly finds a new sidekick in the form of a stray aspiring unnamed therapy dog (Guillén), and he’s thrust back together with his old flame, Kitty Softpaws (Hayek), who is also searching for the wishing star. However, they aren’t the only ones searching for the star’s magic. Goldilocks wants that magical wish, as does the nefarious Jack Horner, who wants to use the wishing star to gain control of all the magic in the world. Puss must now come to grips with what could be his last adventure. The Last Wish finds its groove and delivers a strong, yet emotional, story for the fearless feline. As Puss faces his mortality and fear of death in a gripping conflict, he is stripped down and hits rock bottom before he recovers. The introduction of the Big Bad Wolf, who may or may not be the Grim Reaper, is a constant, visceral presence throughout the film. The Big Bad Wolf’s visual design is impressive, chilling, and terrifying. He makes for a striking silhouette and a worthy adversary that Puss must eventually find the courage to face.  Banderas stretches his vocal acting muscles a bit more in The Last Wish. His performance as Puss in the sequel is less one-note and more vibrant, and he performs a complex moral dilemma for Puss. Puss must overcome his narcissism and come to grips with his mortality. At some point, even his legend must come to an end. Puss is never more alive than when he constantly stares death in the face, but now that he is down to his last life, he can’t let go. At the same time, Puss is miserable living in self-imposed exile. The film depicts Puss’s vulnerability as an aging hero who is nearing the end of his story, adding an appealing layer of drama to his character arc. While the animation budget for The Last Wish looks limited compared to other big-budget, CG-animated productions, Crawford and Mercado work around that, opting for a more heavily stylized look. Considering the story is framed as a fairytale, the more painted edges of the animation and the new visual style lend a more whimsical storybook quality to the film. When the action ramps up, it moves at a lower framerate, and the CG models almost seem to be moving in stop motion. These moments happen are sparse, when the stakes are at their highest, and the effect does not feel too overused.  The Last Wish introduces updates for familiar roles that fit like a glove in this wacky world of fractured fairytale characters. Mulaney is great as the story’s key antagonist, Jack Horner. He’s re-imagined here as a gargantuan, spoiled rich kid heir to his family’s baked goods empire, who has taken to collecting various magical antiquities and items. Other new standouts are Goldilocks and Three Bears, who are reimagined as a cockney crime family of British gangsters, with Pugh’s Goldilocks as the ringleader.  Despite introducing all the new characters, the writers maintain all of them rather well. Each party goes on their own unique journeys through the Dark Forest in pursuit of the magical wishing star. Goldilocks and the Three Bears also receive a rewarding, emotional character arc that supplements Puss’ journey.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of the year’s most surprising, exceptional, satisfying, and emotional cinematic experiences. It overcomes the odds and delivers a much more well-rounded, rousing adventure for Puss. The only drawback is that DreamWorks Animation might have waited too long to deliver such a sequel for the favorite, fearless hero, Puss in Boots. Copyright © 2024 411mania.com, LLC.

"Dec 30, 2022",positive," One remark that helped ensure former Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek's stint at the top was short was his casual observation that animation was for children. While tots do love cartoons, Chapek seems to have forgotten that for every child's ticket sold, a parent has to buy another one. As a result, even the most child-friendly entertainment is often loaded with jokes kids might not get until they reach a certain age. For example, the new DreamWorks offering ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" has more dynamic and interesting characters than most live action films have. Screenwriters Tommy Swerdlow and Paul Fisher make the fearless feline more engaging by taking something away from him. In the ""Shrek'' movies and in his own films, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) thwarts larger foes by mere audacity. He's not very big, but his cat reflexes enable him to survive duels that would kill larger creatures. As ""The Last Wish"" begins, however, he's in for a rude awakening. It turns out his endurance is due to the fact that he had nine lives, but stupid accidents have now squandered eight of them. He briefly lets himself go to seed with crazy cat lady Mama Luna (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), but ends up reluctantly befriending an overly friendly dog named Perro (Harvey Guillen). While he may now be mortal and now lacks a proper fencing foil, Puss in Boots is too proud to simply remain in seclusion. In the dark forest, there is a wishing star that can grant a single longing for whomever finds it. Getting his lives back is already a powerful draw, but he has to compete with Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo and Olivia Colman) and the monstrous Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who isn't little or good anymore. Did I mention that the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) and his former lover Kitty Southpaws (Salma Hayek) are also trailing Puss and the mysterious star? As Banderas wrestles with a cartoon cat's ego and mortality, he finds new opportunities to hone his craft that haven't existed when he's on camera. It's not hyperbole to say that academics could write worthwhile essays on the cat's struggle. It's also rewarding to hear Banderas both woo and spar with Hayek. The two have a spirited rapport that makes their love-hate relationship consistently involving. While kids will get their share of delightful eye candy, adults can giggle at all the clever nods to Sergio Leone's Italian Westerns and to other fairy tales. One of the reasons that Jack Horner is so tyrannical is that he's mad that he has only a nursery rhyme when Puss in Boots has his own fairy tale. I'm not sure why director Joel Crawford (""The Croods: A New Age"") decided that all the confrontations should be staged anime-style, but he and his collaborators exceed their quota of delights for a film that runs barely over 90 minutes.

"Dec 30, 2022",positive," Despite efforts to diminish its value, the medium of animation has turned out some stellar films this year. And it only seems fitting that one of the best closes out this year with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. As its title would suggest, The Last Wish finds Antonio Banderas‘ titular feline at the edge of his rope. Years of dangerous exploits have taken their toll on Puss, and he’s down to the last of his nine lives. After resigning himself to living out the rest of his days as a pampered feline, Puss soon learns about a fallen star that grants wishes. Determined to regain his lives as well as his legend, Puss chases after the star. But he isn’t the only one seeking its powers. There are a number of figures who want the star’s power, from Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three bears to the malevolent Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Throw in Perro (Harvey Guillen), a lovable but dimwitted dog, and his former flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and Puss has his work cut out for him. His journey will take him through a magical forest and bring him face-to-face with his own mortality in the process. DreamWorks has constantly turned out amazing animated adventures over the years, whether they involve dragons, ogres, or trollhunters. The Last Wish is no different. Its opening sequence features Puss throwing a party in a corrupt governor’s house that descends into a fight with a massive stone giant. That’s just a taste of things to come. In the same fashion as the Shrek franchise that it spun off from, The Last Wish features twisted takes on fairy tales. Horner isn’t as “little” as the nursery rhyme that describes him, having gathered immense girth over the years. Goldilocks and the Bears are mercenaries. And there are plenty of jabs at other fairy tales, including a brilliant running gag that has to be seen to be believed. But in true DreamWorks fashion, there’s a deeper message. Puss has lived his life—or rather, lives—recklessly, pursuing adventure and fame above all else. After all, if you had nine lives, wouldn’t you live them to the fullest? However, once he learns that he’s literally living on borrowed time, there’s a marked change in his demeanor. He lets himself go, growing a “beard” full of whiskers and burying his boots and hat. And he constantly pushes away Perro’s attempts to befriend him. In short, we are dealing with an animated movie that shows an anthropomorphic cat having a midlife crisis. And I love it. The Last Wish also boasts a stellar voice cast, especially where Banderas is concerned. Banderas has the chance to portray multiple versions of Puss: the swashbuckling hero, the man dealing with his own mortality, and the person struggling with an inability to form connections. It’s the most layered performance he’s delivered as the feline swordsman, and it’s the center around which the movie revolves. The rest of the cast also gets their moment in the spotlight. Pugh is a scene stealer as Goldilocks, and Guillen is extremely charming as Perro. Seriously, I dare you to walk away and not fall in love with that little dog. And the animation definitely deserves to be talked about. Much like The Bad Guys, The Last Wish has a mix of 2D and 3D animation, which results in some of the most creative fight sequences ever put to the screen. Whenever Puss hits someone or uses his sword, impact lines spiral outwards. And a montage of his past lives weaves numbers into the background in some surprisingly creative fashion. There’s even a haunting sequence where a lupine hunter (Wagner Moura) pursues Puss through a crystalline cave. As the wolf closes in on Puss, the walls grow as red as his eyes, leading to a haunting effect. It’s just another example of how a certain film about a certain webslinger continues to influence animation, and I hope it never stops. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish delivers a swashbuckling adventure that boasts some amazing animation, as well as a solid message about embracing life in all its forms. It’s the perfect cap to the year, and it continues to prove that animation is a medium that can thrive when people give it a chance. Let’s hope this isn’t the last chapter of Puss in Boots’ adventures.

"Dec 30, 2022",positive," I saw three great animated films this year: GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S PINOCCHIO, MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON, and the holiday release PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH. I loved the feline character when he first stole the second SHREK movie back in 2004, but who’d have thought after numerous iterations, from films to TV specials, including Puss’s own stand-alone film PUSS IN BOOTS in 2011, that this long-down-the-road sequel would be so splendid? Making it all the niftier? In many ways, it echoes much of what was done by Antonio Banderas (Puss’s voice) in Pedro Almodovar’s PAIN & GLORY in 2020. Both that film and this one concern an aging protagonist reflecting upon his past while trying to reckon with his limited future. How cheeky is that? Even cheekier? Puss isn’t just looking back on one life, but eight of ‘em. Cats have nine lives, of course, and that’s the jokey premise at the center of this sequel. And devil-may-care Puss has lived such a life of adventure and antics, his carelessness has cost him an octuple of mortality. Now, he’s got one life left and he’s feeling the need to slow down and take it easy, especially when death starts hounding him in the image of, well, a hound. Death (voiced by Wagner Moura) has red eyes and wields circular blades like he’s a ninja of death, and he’s quite scary. Thus, Puss isn’t just worried about what pitfalls may lie ahead of him, but he’s continually looking over his shoulder too. That becomes even more of a problem for Puss when he’s pulled back into the world of derring-do when he’s forced to fend off Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three bear crime family of bounty hunters (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo) out to get him. The quartet is also after a special map that promises a Wishing Star to be found in a magical forest, promising immortality.  Puss realizes that’s just the ticket he needs, so he joins forces with a cute and worshipful dog named Perrito (Harvey Guillen) and his ex-flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) to find the Star first. Of course, as everyone from Tom Wolfe to Marty McFly discovered, you can’t really go home again. And the more adventures Puss’s trio discovers as they follow the map into a secret forest, a treacherous mountain, or an icy glade, the more Puss realizes he cannot go back to being the cavalier cat he used to be. He’s now seasoned, a mature old salt who’s forced to mentor the youthful Perrito, not to mention own up to the damage he caused in his past romance with Kitty. A lot of this is played for pathos, pulling at our heartstrings and affection for the adorable Puss, but a lot of it is utterly hilarious too as Puss battles his age, his fears, his foes, and crazy obstacles in the forest. Amongst his new enemies is Little Jack Horner (John Mulaney), a chubby villain who could give Brendan Fraser’s THE WHALE a run for his money. Jack’s after the map too. It all makes for a crackerjack adventure, albeit one that is also a mature story about regret and loneliness, as all the characters here are lost souls looking for love. Each of the slate of characters is brought vocally to life by the game cast, particularly Banderas, Pugh, and Mulaney. The animation and production design are impressive too, taking a page from the look of the SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE film and its mix of cartoon styles, montages, and jump cuts. Director Joel Crawford, working from a script by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swedlow, and a story by Swedlow and Tom Wheeler, finds the perfect balance between escapade and character development. Colman and Winstone aren’t slumming here, they’re parts get bigger as the show goes on. The production design is lovely throughout, and the pop culture references are sprinkled in throughout without becoming groaners or too obvious. And Banderas dots his performance with genuine sadness and aching maturity,  cleverly echoing what he did in PAIN & GLORY.  (Perhaps that film and this one would make for a unique double bill someday.) Ultimately, the exploration of Puss’s pain and glory (Remorse the Cat?) made this more than just a sharp and lovely cartoon film. It made it one of the year’s best films, one to be treasured by any age."
"Dec 29, 2022",positive,"This year, there have not been many top quality animated films, unlike 2021, when there were more excellent animated films. This movie is one the top five best animated films of 2022, and it should get an Academy Award nomination."
"Dec 29, 2022",positive," If you're looking to escape the summer heat by heading into a movie theatre — or if you just want to veg out at home with some Christmas ham and a flick — there's plenty of new release movies that are worth your time. Whether you're into Daniel Craig as a well-dressed detective, or a frizzy-haired Greta Gerwig with a child on her hip; looking for something joyful to watch with the kids or with your friend who can't stop quoting The Trip; there's something on the plate that's just for you. Our critic Luke Goodsell says: Who can resist a 9-foot, 300-pound computer-generated crocodile with sad eyes, a natty scarf and the mellifluous pipes of Shawn Mendes? Not Constance Wu (Crazy Rich Asians), whose extremely flirtatious song-and-dance duet with the titular lizard nearly tips this amiable kids' movie into the realm of something truly outré. (She even draws him like one of her French girls, and can you blame her? He's kinda hot.) Fun tunes (from The Greatest Showman songwriting team) and a typically irrepressible turn from Bardem (as a flamboyant impresario) give this take on the 1965 picture book some pizzazz, but the rest is mostly mild, post-Paddington kindness schtick – with the obligatory Elton John singalong. Noteworthy because: It's the prince of mumblecore's take on a postmodern classic by Don DeLillo, starring Adam Driver (as a professor of ""Hitler studies"") and Baumbach's partner Gerwig (as his pill-popping wife). That's sad lit girl/guy bingo. Our reviewer Michael Sun says: For the majority of its run time, Baumbach's work hews too closely to its source material. The result is a film that feels both stuffy and overstuffed, lending credence to the long-held belief in White Noise's unadaptability … To his credit, Baumbach films the supposedly unfilmable with great gusto – which, at least initially, sustains a winning union between author and adaptor.

"Dec 27, 2022",positive," Please bear with me while I reveal my callow youth. I grew up with the original ""Shrek."" I was in middle school when it was released in 2001. And I'm old enough to have neck pain and heartburn now that ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is out. Life is funny, but not as amusing as this latest offering from DreamWorks. ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is so much more than a spinoff from ""Shrek."" This is a story that stands on its own four paws and offers more than one would expect from a narrative that originated in 2004. In April, DreamWorks released ""The Bad Guys,"" which I had a blast with. And while I should appreciate an original story more than a spinoff sequel, I can't help but admit ""The Last Wish"" is still two steps ahead of the animated heist flick. The story starts off with Puss (Antonio Banderas) throwing a huge party in San Ricardo full of drinks, music and dancing. It immediately establishes the egotistical thief, whose noise drives a nearby giant to attack. With bountiful action and a fresh animated style that updates the story for 2022, Puss leaps into action, taking out the giant and unexpectedly dying in the process. Afterward, Puss wakes up on the table of a town doctor and discovers he has used up eight of his nine lives. The doctor informs our hero that he needs to retire. But no! Puss in Boots will shake this off like he has so many other challenges. While drinking alone in a bar, Puss is greeted by a bounty-hunting wolf (Wagner Moura) who intends to kill the feline once and for all. The little swordsman tries to fight off the wolf but is easily rebuffed, and sensing his impending doom, the cat scurries off, leaving his sword behind. I cannot express how chilling the wolf is as a villain, and I don't want to spoil his true identity. But the setup, the performance of Moura, and the deviously dark way he's never far away from Puss all combine to make the best antagonist since Fairy Godmother. Burying his trademark cape, boots, and hat, Puss retires and moves in with an elderly cat lady named Mama Luna (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and a house full of voiceless felines. With every last shred of dignity taken from him, Puss assumes his new identity as ""Pickles"" and lives as a typical cat, growing a depression beard and losing all track of time. As days go by, Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears break in, having tracked Puss to the house. They trash the place, wanting to hire Puss to steal a map for them to a magical wishing star. But they don't recognize the downtrodden former hero and instead come upon his grave, where he buried his clothes. Believing Puss dead, they head off to steal the map. Determined to take the map and claim that wish to restore his nine lives, Puss sets off with a little dog named Perrito (Harvey Guillen) to claim the treasure. Along the way, they run into Puss' former love interest, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). The cats and dog begrudgingly find themselves all on a team to locate this fallen star and claim the wish. But hot on their trail are Goldilocks, her bears, and a villain named Jack Horner (John Mulaney), armed with a bag of magical weapons. The film keeps a fast pace, never allowing the story to become tedious or dull. And yet, it finds reflective moments to develop each character. ""The Last Wish"" even manages to deliver a surprisingly tactful display of mental health concerns. Puss repeatedly faces his mortality and finds his hair rising and his heart racing beyond control, leaving him physically exasperated and trapped in a panic attack. Thankfully, therapy-dog-in-training Perrito is there to show everyone exactly what service these extraordinary animals provide to their patients. To my shock, Perrito ends up being one of the best parts of the film. And this little dog who could have easily been relegated to an annoying comedic relief role instead becomes the soul of this movie. It's all thanks to smart writing and a pure-hearted performance from Guillen, who has plenty of experience serving as the manager of morale and compassion in a show I love, ""What We Do in the Shadows."" The narrative offers plenty of riffs on fairy tales as ""Shrek"" became well known for. But the movie utilizes them in clever, refreshing ways that ""Shrek the Third"" and ""Shrek Ever After"" wish they could have. DreamWorks knocks the animation out of the park for ""The Last Wish,"" with a hyper-stylized blend of beautiful textures and sketchy action scenes that feel lifted from a kineograph. The colors are vibrant, and a wide variety of magical settings allows each scene in the story to play out with strong authority. I was wowed by the refreshing creativity of the dark forest, in which the world changes entirely depending on who is holding the map that leads to the wishing star. That's the kind of out-of-the-box thinking I love to see in fantasy films. And the fact that it's all woven together in an exciting multi-layer chase? Stupendous. ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is an energetic film that's bolstered by a surprising amount of heart and clever writing. What a fantastic way to end 2022 in film. Next week, I'll release my 10 favorite movies of the year. And odds are pretty good this will make the list.

"Dec 27, 2022",positive," Moviegoers shouldn’t have to rely on a sequel to a Shrek spinoff from 11 years ago to discover dazzling spectacle, but here we are. Just days after Avatar: The Way of Water finessed and stretched the photoreal CG language of James Cameron’s original to greater heights (depths?), a frickin’ Puss in Boots movie swings the action pendulum in the complete opposite stylistic direction, while remaining on Cameron’s audacious wavelength. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, the latest DreamWorks Animation film, steals mercilessly from the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse playbook, and you know what, thank god for it — the result is a fairy tale adventure that complements genuine laughs with splashy, impressionistic art.  I have absolutely no memory of what happened in 2011’s Puss in Boots, nor the Netflix show The Adventures of Puss in Boots, but am happy to report a lack of Puss knowledge did not negatively impact my time watching an Antonio Banderas-voiced cat scurry around with his sword. When we pick up with Puss, he’s a milk-drunk legend realizing he’s wasted eight of his nine lives. Wolf, a physical manifestation of death who wields two scythes and is voiced by Narcos’ Wagner Moura, could not be happier — all he wants is to cut down the arrogant feline as he begs for mercy. But when Puss catches wind of a fallen star capable of granting a wish, he sets off with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and a tiny dog named Perrito (What We Do in the Shadows’ Harvey Guillén) to seize the opportunity. On his fluffy tail are Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her Three Bears Crime Family, and the Shrek-verse’s version of the Collector, “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who also want the star.  Talks of a Puss in Boots 2 began just after the first movie’s success. Executive producer Guillermo del Toro teased in 2012 that a script was already in the works, and by 2014, Banderas was making promises about the character’s return — possibly alongside Shrek. None of this came to pass, and DreamWorks saw creative-team shakeups. Eventually Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) stepped in to helm the movie, with Januel Mercado as co-director, with the MO of completely rethinking what a CG-animated movie had to look like at DreamWorks.  “When the Shrek movies came out, CG animation was in an interesting space,” Last Wish production designer Nate Wragg recently told Animation Magazine. “Part of the spectacle of it was, ‘Wow it looks so real, even though it’s not. Look what the computer can do.’ We’ve now been able to swing the pendulum back into a space where animation originated, which was an artistic expression. Bambi’s backgrounds were watercolored. It was beautiful but it didn’t have to be photoreal.” As an animation fan, this has been a long time coming. Spider-verse’s arrival in 2018 felt like a bullet-speed pebble lodging itself in the windshield of mainstream Western animation. The cracks were immediate, and between DreamWorks’ The Bad Guys, Netflix’s Arcane, and Pixar’s upcoming Elemental, the rules might be fully shattered. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish giving the crude Shrek franchise a facelift in every imaginable way is a reason to hope. The Last Wish is the closest I’ve ever seen a movie get to emulating hand-painted concept art. On their way to the wishing star, Puss and company traverse prismatic backdrops — from bright pinks and green forests to the rustic interiors of a cat-lady prison — that feel dabbed on by the artistic team. Their encounters with beasties use color, linework, and kinetic camera moves to bring viewers deeper into the battles, and like The Way of Water, regularly shift frame rates to jolt the senses. Puss, looking more oil-painted than ever, may be monologuing about his legendary skills one second, animated “on the ones,” then find himself in a cacophonous skirmish with a towering troll the next, which the team animates “on the twos.” The sensation builds on the work of Spider-verse and drags the Shrek franchise, of all things, into the territory of high art. It’s stunning. The movie’s also really funny? Having recently revisited Shrek 1 and Shrek 2, I can’t say I walked into The Last Wish with an open heart/funny bone — pop culture hijinks and fairy-tale riffs were dusty then and petrified now. The Last Wish team, including credited screenwriters Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow, reinvent the humor just like the animation. While the movie offers a few nostalgic nods to Shrek, with brief appearances by Gingerbread Man and Pinocchio, and Jack Horner’s endless supply of fantasy literature collectibles gives Mulaney plenty of joke fuel, the movie’s comedy stylings more closely resemble Groundhog Day. Banderas, it turns out, can do the Bill Murray mumbles-to-self one-liner thing. A recurring bit finds Puss reliving his past deaths, and the versions of himself (Showman Puss, Swole Puss, Drunk Puss) that led to each demise. In this sequel, a somewhat obligatory poop joke is actually a litter box joke about Puss faking his own death and “burying” his body. Good! The Last Wish might just be the best thing DreamWorks Animation, a studio that isn’t as known for pushing the limits of the medium, has produced in the last decade. 2010 gave us the emotional thrillride of How to Train Your Dragon and 2011 had Kung Fu Panda 2, a martial arts odyssey bursting with imagination that asserted director Jennifer Yuh Nelson as a top-tier action director (even if Hollywood never made good on it). Maybe How to Train Your Dragon 2 tops the original with bigger action — I’ll leave that to the hardcore fans. The Bad Guys was definitely a step in the right technological direction earlier this year. I will not be engaging with Boss Baby discourse. Whatever the case, the achievement glimmers with hope. DreamWorks Animation, a studio that has bounced from various homes, never found its footing against Pixar, and struggled in the shadow of the Minions, may have found a new mode. If this level of artistry and cleverness is what the studio brings to future films, hell, I will get in line for Shrek 5. There is so much animation can do, and Hollywood finally seems ready to grant its artists permission to do it."
"Dec 27, 2022",positive," Una divertida película de aventuras que no pretende ir dando lecciones morales, sociales, culturales y vitales a cada paso y que, sin embargo, las acaba ofreciendo: la de la necesidad del entretenimiento efervescente, la de la importancia del arte en la composición visual, y una moraleja sutil y sencilla, pero profunda. El gato con botas: el último deseo llega sin las ambiciones éticas de otras recientes producciones animadas, unas mejores que otras, pero cumple a la perfección con algo que se olvida demasiadas veces: el sentido dionisiaco de la existencia y su terrible espejo deformante, que las vidas, incluso las de los gatos, que tienen siete o nueve, según sean latinos o anglosajones, se acaban. Y además Antonio Banderas ofrece un recital. Nacido en la división animada de la productora DreamWorks como personaje secundario de Shrek 2 (2004), e inspirado naturalmente en el cuento clásico de Jacques Perrault, el Gato con Botas logró tener proyecto propio con la película homónima del año 2011, un spin off irresistible, aunque algo corto de vuelo, que destacaba sobre todo por el espectáculo vocal de Banderas, por los ecos de aventura clásica reelaborados para chavales de nuevas generaciones, y por el evidente ramalazo chulesco procedente de La máscara del Zorro, de Martin Campbell, que también había tenido al actor malagueño como estrella. Pero el hecho de que se haya tardado más de una década en recuperar al personaje, y en un tiempo en el que las secuelas se multiplican como los virus, demuestra que la insolencia del personaje había quedado un tanto olvidada. Quizá por todo ello sean tan sorprendentes los frutos creativos de Joel Crawford —con codirección de Januel Mercado—, hasta ahora en productos menores pero festivos como Los Croods: una nueva era, en una película de corte crepuscular, como en ciertas películas del Oeste, aunque solo en la trama y no en las formas, mucho más luminosas que esos westerns en los que el tiempo de los personajes se agota, y que van acompañados de una luz expresionista o incluso tenebrista. El engolado, soberbio y jocoso gato está obligado a tomar conciencia de que su tiempo se acaba. Hace cuentas y resulta que lo han matado ya ocho veces y únicamente le queda una vida, lo que le lleva no solo a una crisis existencial sino a algo mucho más relevante en su caso: al miedo. Ya no está para heroísmos, engreimientos ni audacias. Está para la calma y, si vienen mal dadas con sus enemigos, para la huida. Y no es tanto una cuestión de evitar riesgos como de falta de sentido vital. En dos palabras, está hundido. Sin embargo, pese a la dramática situación, la película de Crawford es divertidísima y jocosa. El humor es constante; el ritmo, trepidante; hay puntuales canciones que poco aportan, pero en nada molestan, y la cadencia de los planos en algunas secuencias, imitando el ritmo de las viñetas de los cómics en imágenes de inspiración pictórica, una gozada. Así, hasta un desenlace con un cristalino mensaje del que podrían aprender otras historias para críos: está bien pedir deseos, pero su cumplimiento nunca va a venir dado por la magia, sino por lo que nosotros mismos hagamos para conseguirlo. Capítulo aparte merece el trabajo de Antonio Banderas como protagonista, tanto en la versión en inglés como en la doblada al español. Un espectáculo cargado de gracia, encanto, articulaciones con el acento, jugosos matices en su vanidad herida, y maravillosas inflexiones de su única herramienta interpretativa en este caso: la voz."
"Dec 27, 2022",positive," In 2005, a star took over a young franchise on the come-up. While 2001’s Shrek won the first-ever Best Animated Feature Oscar, the arrival of Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas, became a watershed moment for Dreamworks. Rather than rest on the laurels of the first film, their new character stole Shrek 2 from its established stars. He added his own brand of humor, the beautiful singing of Banderas, and new storytelling possibilities. It was no surprise when Dreamworks spun him off into his own starring film in 2011. Despite the success, it took more than a decade for Puss in Boots: The Last Wish to arrive in theaters. However, the long break helped The Last Wish establish itself as one of Dreamworks’ best films.  After an accident, Puss (Banderas) discovers he is on the last of his nine lives. Puss goes into hiding, where he meets a strange dog named Perro (Harvey Guillén). When Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) & the three bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) recruit Puss to steal a map leading to a wishing star, Puss takes matters into his own paws. After stealing the map from Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), Puss partners up with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and Perro. The three race to the wishing star, with Horner, the Goldilocks, and a mysterious wolf on their tail (Wagner Moura).  Crawford and Mercado infuse these new visuals with blasts of color and absurd storytelling. The pacing of The Last Wish quickly pushes audiences into the visual language of action films. There’s barely a moment of fat in the film, with many of the “slower scenes” chewing through background and exposition to set up emotional payoffs. Nearly every aspect introduced throughout the film is paid off by the end. The tight script, combined with the new visuals, allows Puss in Boots: The Last Wish to take flight.  The voice cast provides stellar work as well. Banderas and Hayek bring back their witty banter, which is as perfect as ever. Guillén provides much-needed comedic highlights, bringing the raw energy and naive nature of a dog to life. Pugh, Winstone, Colman, and Kayo steal long stretches of the film, imbued with cockney accents and witty banter. Moura instantly becomes the most frightening in a Shrek franchise film and earns a place in Dreamworks’ hall of fame. If there’s a complaint about this voice cast, it might be that Moura is too scary for children.  The new animation will bring in many new audiences, but not for everyone. Admittedly, it takes a minute or two to adjust to the Spider-Verse style, which will benefit younger animation fans but may disorient more seasoned viewers. Combining multiple art styles will help Dreamworks under Universal regain its status as a powerhouse animation studio.  One can already see this in action based on the themes of The Last Wish, most notably those about mortality. The animated feature has plenty of key moments that will make the kids laugh, and Puss’ journey will help deepen their emotional attachment. For parents, it may take on a more personal feeling, and as such will keep their attention far more than other Dreamworks films have in recent years. This, along with Trolls World Tour seem to indicate a pipeline of more complex stories for legacy characters. It bodes extremely well for the studio that has begun facing competition from LAIKA, Cartoon Saloon, and Netflix.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish never needed to be so creative or funny to capture audiences. However, The Last Wish stands a legitimate shot to be among Dreamworks’ very best films. Brilliant and bold animation helps propel extenuate the pace of the caper adventure. The surprisingly great cast also performs the heck out of their dialogue. While the story will be predictable to many audience members, there’s enough here to celebrate the return of our favorite feline hero. Perhaps it bodes well for future entries from Far Far Away. "
"Dec 27, 2022",positive,"A visual joy, as bright-hued animation brings the witty characters to life. Meanwhile, the snappy dialog includes some underlying emotion to make the film entertaining for all ages. Even if it feels rather hyperactive."
"Dec 27, 2022",positive,"Unlike some of the Shrek sequels, this film has a lot more life & a lot of good jokes, mostly at the expense of Puss and the weird characters. And amazingly, there is a third iteration of Jiminy Cricket in 2022. Also notable for its eye-popping animation!"
"Dec 27, 2022",positive," “Do you ever get the feeling that people are incapable of not caring?” This is a line from Darren Aronofsky’s newest, The Whale, delivered with a mix of pathos, sincerity and hopefulness that could rend the hardest heart. The speaker is Charlie, a shut-in English professor who tells his online students that the camera on his laptop is broken. The reason he lies about the camera is because he weighs 600 pounds, and he doesn’t want them to see him. The reason for that question is – more complicated. But the journey to its delivery is very much the point of The Whale. Imagine how boring Moby Dick would be if they never went to sea. Melville’s novel looms large through the film, adapted by Samuel D. Hunter from his own 2012 play. Charlie keeps a dog-eared and (let’s be blunt) poorly written essay about the book that he sometimes reads aloud as a way of calming himself down. The opening scene finds him in either a fit of onanistic ecstasy, a heart attack or a panic attack. His reading of the paper lets us know it’s the latter, though his blood pressure – 238 over 134, not even numbers I can understand – suggests option B might be a possibility as well. The whale was Ahab’s prey and nemesis. You can read it as a substitute for one of Charlie’s goals in his life – chiefly reconnecting with his estranged daughter, Ellie, played by Stranger Things’ Sadie Sink. You could even sink to the lowest level of metaphor, and assume it’s a stand-in for Charlie’s obese corporeal form. Just don’t think of him as Brendan Fraser in a fat suit. The prosthetics the actor wears to take on this career-redefining role are nothing like the costumes worn to comedic effect by the likes of Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers. And he is revelatory, prosthetics or no. Fraser wrings more pathos out of his eyes and mouth than many actors manage with their entire bodies, delivering deep reserves of sensitivity and vulnerability. But notice also how he flinches and shies away from Ellie’s anger, or from that of his friend and amateur caregiver, played by Hong Chau. He is like a horse that knows only the whip. Everything looks like a threat. I haven’t mentioned the religious themes in The Whale, personified by a young door-to-door missionary played by Ty Simpkins, trying to save Charlie’s soul, and amazed that the man has already read the Bible, more than once in fact. “I thought it was devastating,” he tells the kid levelly. Aronofsky has worked through issues around faith before, with decidedly mixed results. Look at 2014’s Noah, a bonkers retelling of the story of the great flood. Or mother! from 2017, its punctuation and lack of capitalization a warning of things to come. The Whale is decidedly more New Testament gentle, set at the intersection of caring, forgiveness and acceptance among imperfect people with complicated motives. But if it has a parallel among the filmmaker’s works, it is 2008’s The Wrestler, which featured a similar where-did-that-come-from performance and a filial reconnection subplot, this time by Mickey Rourke as a washed-up wrestler looking for a kind of comeback. Like Rourke’s character, Charlie has been knocked down more than once. Watching him get back to his feet represents a moment of sublime inspiration, even transcendence.

"Dec 26, 2022",positive," After his latest derring-do, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) learns he has squandered eight of his nine lives, and any swashbuckled misstep could spell curtains for the legendary outlaw. Convinced to hang up his cape and stow his beloved boots in exchange for an early retirement, a chance to restore his lost lives launches Puss on what could be his final adventure. With an unwanted but trustworthy companion (Harvey Guillén) and his former romantic interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss must reach his goal ahead of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), her three bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo), and a not-so little Jack Horner (John Mulaney), but his real fear is The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), an experienced hunter by trade whose interest is more than a mere bounty. Since his first appearance in Shrek 2, Puss in Boots has been in every following Shrek adventure, his own prequel movie, a short film plus a television series. One would think there had been another full-length film since 2011, but considering Shrek Forever After was the last appearance of the fairy tale gang in 2010, a decade has passed. Sporting a new Dreamworks logo (and reminding audiences that The Bad Guys was a big hit earlier this year), rumors of a fifth Shrek film positions The Last Wish as a tasty appetizer. Co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado have all the latest animation tools at their disposal, but is the interest still there for a fractured fairy tale cat on his last leg? With an unmistakable nod to Sergio Leone and wallowing in Spaghetti Western tropes, The Last Wish is surprisingly solid and perhaps the best entry in the Shrek universe to date. The hair-raising off-screen whistling of The Wolf moments before his appearance has its roots in any number of Westerns, most recently by the villain Negan and his followers in “The Walking Dead.” Juggling an ensemble of characters and tapping into darker themes — including actual blood in a PG animated flick — even the animation ups the ante in a stylized way reminiscent of Kung Fu Panda’s edits. Juggling so many protagonists, antagonists, and subplots would be a chore for any director(s), but common themes coupled with a tight script and vivid characterizations make it look effortless. Banderas’ Puss is the best of his career characters all magnified into a single wonderful entity, and Salma Hayek remains his perfect foil as Kitty. Heroes are only as good as their villains, however, and a trio of heavies herein are each their own treat. Florence Pugh’s Goldi appears like a Cockney-accented throwaway until her repartee with the three bears adds complexity and empathy; Mulaney’s Jack Horner revels in his villainy, giving Jim Carrey’s Dr. Robotnik a run for his money. Harvey Guillén’s “perro” is a warm and fuzzy scene-stealer, but Moura’s Wolf manages to upstage everyone, casting a solemn shadow over the entire story as the perfect nemesis for Puss. With a brisk runtime and something for everyone, the timing of the release for The Last Wish is no accident; it’s only real competition in the animation award space is Dreamworks’ adaptation The Bad Guys (with Sam Rockwell as The Big Bad Wolf) unless there’s an upset by either Guillermo del Toro’s fascist-fighting Pinocchio or A24’s darling Marcel the Shell With Shoes On. With apologies to both Disney and del Toro, The Last Wish arguably owns this year’s most tolerable Pinocchio appearance, especially coupled with Kevin McCann’s dead-on Jimmy Stewart-esque “Ethical Bug.” Counting our blessings, thank the movie gods Roberto Benigni didn’t release another Pinocchio this year."
"Dec 26, 2022",positive," Or maybe it’s the cat’s meow. However you want to put it, the latest entry into the “Shrek” series is the finest so far. Its dialogue is claw-sharp, its story line fresh and fun, and the animation is glorious. Antonio Banderas once again voices the heroic kitty whose tale begins with lots of action and humor. Puss has lost none of his bravado over the years … after all, he has nine lives, right? But hold on there. Just how many lives has Puss used up in his adventures? He has only one left, it turns out. And Death, aka the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura – kids might not recognize his voice from his role in “Narcos,” but grownups certainly might) lurks nearby, waiting for the chance to claim the previously fearless feline once and for all. He figures he can stay safe if he discontinues his wild ways. He becomes one of a number of felines in the care of a lady has dozens of cats. In her home, Puss meets the goofy dog Perrito (Harvey Guillén) who becomes a sort of Sancho Panza to Puss, although Puss thinks he doesn’t really need a sidekick. Puss also figures there may be another way out: He needs to get his hands, er, paws on a Wishing Star that might grant him another life or two. An old acquaintance, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) appears. She’s also looking for the Wishing Star, as is the not-so-little Jack Horner (John Mulaney.) To add to his challenges, Puss also must avoid a group of criminals familiar to Shrek fans. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."

"Dec 24, 2022",neutral," The film allows Puss in Boots time to shine. But far too many characters and a lack of heart prevent The Last Wish from reaching its full potential.   Everyone’s favorite animated cat returns in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. With a new adventure and an inspiring animation style, the sequel — directed by Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado from a screenplay by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow — is more superior to, and has more depth than, its predecessor. It allows Puss in Boots, who was first introduced in Shrek 2, time to shine and assess his inner life. But far too many characters and a lack of heart prevent Puss in Boots: The Last Wish from reaching its full potential.   Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is in a bit of a bind. Having been on so many adventures and fought bravely in exciting battles, Puss in Boots is down to the last of his nine lives. He’s also being hunted by the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) in a twist on the classic tale the character is usually in. Terrified of death, Puss in Boots joins forces with old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and Perro (Harvey Guillén) to find The Last Wish to reclaim his nine lives. The only issue is that he must beat Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears — Olivia Colman as Mama Bear, Ray Winston’s as Papa Bear, and Samson Kayo as Baby Bear — and the villainous Jack Horner (John Mulaney) to get to it before they do.   Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has bouts of humor, and when it happens the film can be deeply funny. The animation style is also spectacular — one of the year’s best. The Last Wish changing its animation style from the first Puss in Boots was a good decision. The sequel’s animation is clearly influenced by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and anime to bring its visual palette to life. To that end, the animation style is made more intriguing and unique, bringing together 2D and 3D animation instead of sticking to one style. It adds richness to the animation and the world it creates.   The film’s themes are wonderful, as Puss in Boots grapples with his mortality and what to do with the one life he has left. Though the film retcons certain aspects of his character, it’s to the benefit of the story, with Puss in Boots coming to the realization that he doesn’t have to face everything on his own, nor does he have to be alone when there are those who care about him. Puss can be very selfish here, and he is driven by fear and the need to run away, so it’s a nice lesson that he learns as he lets Kitty Softpaws and Perro in despite his reluctance to do so initially.   Where The Last Wish falters is in its lack of heart. Too focused on the thrill of the adventure, there is little time spent on properly developing the supporting characters, which leaves the film’s final moments rather devoid of the feeling it was likely aiming for. There are also too many characters vying for attention, taking away from the main character and his journey. The animation includes a plethora of fairy tale stories in one, and the result is bloated and messy, with far too many unnecessary subplots — like that of Goldilocks and the Three Bears’ personal journey — that ultimately don’t add much and are underwhelming. What’s more, The Last Wish’s antagonist is frustrating and unneeded in a film where Puss’ mortality and a persistent, terrifying bounty hunter already serve this purpose.   Puss in Boots: The Last Wish will surely entertain younger audiences. The animation is beautiful, the script occasionally funny, and there is plenty of adventure to excite audiences. For the adults, however, The Last Wish leaves a lot to be desired. With underbaked supporting characters and a bloated story that, while sometimes entertaining, isn’t entirely heartwarming or memorable, the animated sequel could have been a lot more than average.   Puss in Boots: The Last Wish released in theaters December 21. The film is 100 minutes long and rated PG for action/violence, rude humor/language, and some scary moments.

"Dec 24, 2022",positive,"The plot's a hoot to boot, including an ending that gives hope to Puss and pals reuniting with the ""Shrek"" franchise that started it all."
"Dec 23, 2022",positive," It’s been over a decade since Shrek 2 debuted in 2004 and introduced us to a new, snarkier version of a fairy tale character we all know and love: Puss in Boots. The fierce feline, played throughout the Shrek franchise by Antonio Banderas, has returned for his first solo film in 11 years. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish could have easily been a disappointing cash grab, working on nostalgia for characters who have become iconic to a certain generation of movie-goers. Thankfully, the movie gives us a nice surprise: a sequel with plenty of humor and heart for new and old friends of Puss alike.  At the beginning of the film,, we find our furry hero, Puss, thriving in his life as an outlaw and adventurer. He’s untouchable, until he realizes, after a close encounter with a giant, that he’s down to the last of his nine lives. After initially trying to brush off this new information, Puss runs into a bounty hunter who might actually be Death incarnate (Wagner Moura). Their encounter is genuinely terrifying, and so Puss goes into a full existential crisis. So, he decides to retire from adventuring and become a full-time housecat, landing him in the care of Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), a de facto crazy cat lady who takes in cats with nowhere else to go. There he meets Perrito (Harvey Guillén), an unwanted chihuahua who’s eeking by at Mama Luna’s in a cat costume. The pair strike up a reluctant friendship, and all seems tame until a crime family, made up of Goldilocks and the Three Bears crashes in, looking to catch a bounty for Puss and revealing the location of a wishing star in the Dark Forest. Inspired to try and get his 8 lives back through the wishing star, Puss and Perrito set out on a new adventure. The Last Wish is better than it has any right to be. From charming animation that combines digital and analog sensibilities and takes cues from fairytale books to performances that are pitch-perfect, it works! It would be a mistake to write it off as a late-in-the-game sequel or nostalgia cash-grab when it’s clear there’s true craftsmanship behind the work. Banderas is welcome in a return performance that is fun and sweet, as is Salma Hayek playing Kitty Softpaws, but the new cast shines as well. Guillén brings real heart to the movie with his take on Perrito, an outcast who manages to see the bright side of life and aspires to be a therapy dog one day. Goldilocks and the Three Bears crime family, played by Florence Pugh, Olivia Coleman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo are a funny and warm addition to the film, even if they’re some of the villains Puss is trying to outrun. Similarly, John Mulaney enters his villain era as “Big” Jack Horner, the true big bad of the film who is irredeemably (and hilariously) evil and has fun with it to the benefit of the film. The magic combo of this cast helps the humor and heart land with pleasant ease. With a lot of options for what to watch over the upcoming holidays, you could do worse than Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Come for the return of a familiar feline friend, and stay for a surprisingly fun and wholesome time! "
"Dec 23, 2022",positive,Not as good as its immediate processor but enjoyable enough.
"Dec 23, 2022",positive," Is it any wonder anymore that kids’ films often include more mature themes that resonate with parents? Not really. Pixar has set the standard for years, and others have followed the money. Still, it’s noteworthy how Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is all about coming to terms with the fact that your life must eventually end, seeing how this franchise owes its existence to making fun of our most beloved fairy-tale traditions. More than ten years after his last feature, Puss is back and still voiced by Antonio Banderas, who sounds like he’s having way too much fun playing a character he’s brought to animated life for nearly 20 years. Puss has brought the fiesta as usual, sticking his whiskers in a local governor’s digs and fighting a sleeping giant he happened to bring to life in the process. The adventure goes awry when Puss dies, and he’s forced to realize that years of careless heroics have left him with one life left, and Death (Wagner Moura) is licking his chops in anticipation of claiming him for his own. But Puss sees a chance to reclaim the legend he’s built his life on by finding the mythical Wishing Star.  Along for the quest is an adorable comic-relief dog Perrito (Harvey Guillén), Puss’s old frenemy Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), new obstacles in Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears Crime Family, and the irredeemable Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who’s looking to steal the world’s magic for himself. Pick your fairy tale and you’ll find a reference, with astonishingly fun, creative action sequences in an animation style that owes more to anime than CGI. If things are resolved a bit too quickly and predictably, the sheer charm of the journey and the stellar voice cast make it nearly unnoticeable. PG, 100 min. "
"Dec 23, 2022",positive," Studio underling: “We offer a whole new anti-photorealistic animated look and existentialist narrative. We bring back the vocal gravitas of Antonio Banderas as Puss, now a middle-aged feline who goes to live in a cat assisted-living facility run by Mama Luna, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph. Meanwhile, Puss is on his ninth and final life, and constantly pursued by Death, played by 'Narcos' boss Wagner Moura as a scary wolf who wants to cut up Puss with a pair of sharp sickles.” “Oh, the kids will love it! We give them hilarious cat antics, incredible action sequences, blinding speed edits, superhero posturing and extreme camera angles, just like in comic books. Plus, we borrow some cool stylistic flourishes from Japanese manga.” “Manga. As in popular Japanese graphic novels and comic books. And we throw in lots of pop-culture references, including a clever showdown done in the style of a Sergio Leone spaghetti western. We'll even hire Heitor Pereira to compose some Ennio Morricone-esque music for the segment. It'll make a fistful of dollars!” “Of course. We'll get Banderas' former co-star Salma Hayek to play the sultry Kitty Softpaws, who shares a checkered past with Puss. Turns out his boots were made for walking away. He suffers from arrested adolescence and fear of commitment.” “Covered. We'll get Harvey Guillén to voice Puss' nameless, straggly canine sidekick, an ultimate optimist who will win your heart. Plus, we'll hire the amazing Florence Pugh to play Goldilocks, who leads a criminal family of bears searching for the same thing everyone in the movie wants: a magical shooting star buried in the Dark Forest. Whoever finds it will be granted a single wish. But can they locate it before that good-boy-gone-bad Jack Horner, played by John Mulaney, nabs it?” “Hmmm. I'm not sold unless the movie has some kind of moral, such as the hero learns to grow past his own egotism and selfishness to become a better person, uh, cat.” “Done! We'll even throw in a Jiminy Cricket clone named the Ethical Bug, played by Kevin McCann, sounding like a mash-up of Don Knotts and Jimmy Stewart.”"
"Dec 23, 2022",positive,"This is an entertaining movie that asks a question all viewers might pause to think about: if you had just one wish, what would it be, and who would it be for, yourself or someone else?"
"Dec 23, 2022",positive," Eleven years after his swashbuckling solo adventure, the orange tabby voiced by Antonio Banderas returns in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, a lively sequel with an earnest message as comforting as warm milk.  When an actual sleeping giant awakens, Puss leaps into action, slicing his trademark “P” into the dirt much like Zorro (another famous adventurer Banderas played back in the day). Although he manages to protect the townsfolk, he loses one of his nine lives in the process.  Thus begins a clever wake-up call for Puss, who is so cavalier, he hasn’t counted the other times he’s died (though an amusing montage does). Shaken to realize he’s down to his last life, Puss tries to retire as a housecat before talk of an enchanted map to a wishing star puts a spark back into his green eyes. If he can wish all his lives back, he can be the fabled legend of songs once again.  Death comes for us all, but here, he’s a red-eyed wolf who wants to swipe Puss’s last life early since the reckless cat squandered what he had. Brandishing twin sickles and whistling a tune right in line with Ennio Morricone, the wolf is a formidable opponent who triggers panic in Puss, then humility.  While the voice cast is enjoyable overall, Banderas, Hayek, and Guillén are especially top-notch, with Guillén giving the nameless dog a sweet eagerness and naivete while Hayek’s Kitty shifts between taking Puss down a few pegs and teasing him playfully. As for Banderas, he imbues Puss’s swagger, vulnerability, and wisdom with an obvious love for this character. Even when Puss hits a low point, such as trying to eulogize his cape, boots, and feathered hat early in the film, he sounds like he’s delivering lines about the “stabby tabby” and “leche whisperer” with a smile.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish might not have been on viewers’ radar, but it’s a gift for families this time of year seeking a sprightly and satisfying tale.

"Dec 23, 2022",positive," Eleven years since his first solo adventure, Puss in Boots is finally back and quick to introduce his audience to a new fairytale. Joel Crawford’s and Januel Mercado’s Puss in Boots: The Last Wish finds the Zorro-inspired feline seeking the last wish granted by a wishing star that fell from the sky. Coming face to face with Death, and realizing that this is one opponent he may not be able to defeat, he believes this wish will save his life. It’s not the only animated film this year to touch on themes of mortality, but it’s especially interesting to explore when centered around a character who attempts to appear so fearless. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an endlessly entertaining and colorful action-adventure neo-Western about a desperado attempting to understand what living truly means. Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is, above all, an entertainer. With Wild West-inspired cues in Heitor Pereira’s score, the film’s spaghetti western nods create a tone matching the suave, quick-drawing lead. Puss is wanted dead or alive, but that doesn’t stop his outlaw antics. Even when his carelessness wakes a destructive giant, his bravado earns him praise - a tip of his cavalier’s hat and a swoosh of his blade is all he needs to do for applause. Singing of being a fearless hero, he treats fights like a song and dance. Eventually, though, he misses a beat and finds eight of his nine lives spent. He’s laughed in the face of Death (Wagner Moura) before and has never been touched by a blade, but Puss finds that this is the most skilled and terrifying opponent he’s ever faced.  His swashbuckling days seem to have come to an end as he checks himself into Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph)’s cat rescue. Domestication as a housecat doesn’t suit him no matter how hard he tries to fit in, but Puss seems to accept his new role as a “geriatric bag of bones,” as one character puts it. However, his cape, belt, and hat come back on quickly as he learns of a map leading to the wishing star, becoming determined to get his nine lives back.  Banderas excels at bringing Puss to life again with exuberance. There’s a real fervor in his voice performance that captures vulnerability in the often macho character. He’s incredibly skilled at capturing the feline’s bravado but also the true fear he experiences on this adventure. Banderas once again brings some real humor to the film as well, successfully embodying a character written to be so dynamic and colorful to match the film’s gorgeous animation. The animation fully commits to embodying the character’s style and spunk, especially with its thrilling fight scenes that emphasize every quick movement and clash of blades. The stunning and grand production design and ever-changing environments match his big personality and unpredictability nature.  On the way to getting his wish, many characters are hot on Puss’s tail with the same idea. There’s the cockney crime family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo); Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who’s turned his love of pies into a successful business; Puss’s old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), now in the role of rival cat thief; dog sidekick, Perro (Harvey Guillén), who is an annoyance at first to both Puss and the audience, but grows on both as he teaches the characters many lessons along this journey. (There’s also a Jiminy Cricket-type character, voiced by Kevin McCann doing an uncanny Jimmy Stewart impression.) The film provides a dose of magic when exploring fairytale and nursery rhythm characters in new, even dark ways. It’s also a treat to be able to pick out the references in both the dialogue and easter eggs onscreen.  Death proves to be a fascinating opponent, creating a viewing experience that’s both fulfilling and unpredictable. What’s also fulfilling — and in the end heartwarming — are the lessons that the characters are presented with. In our current hustle culture, consumer-driven society, we, like Puss in Boots, are always looking for the next thing to keep us busy or the hottest new toy to get our hands on. As a result, we forget to stop and appreciate what we have and forget that life is more than those things. Perro is able to stop and smells the roses, something that Puss has never done before. He has taken life by the sword. It’s been a life full of adventure and admiration, sure, but a life that’s been lonely, too. Love and friendship turn out to be the biggest discovery on this quest for Puss’s wishing star. But it’s not just a film about love and friendship, though, it’s about how it’s okay to be afraid. It’s a foreign emotion to Puss, but he learns how to face it, no matter the result. And what’s life without a bit of risk, anyway?"
"Dec 23, 2022",positive," Burned through a bunch more FYC screeners this week with still more to go. My GWNYFCA picks are in with the complete list of nominations being announced later today (12/23). And since my OFCS ballot isn’t due until 1/15, next week will consist of catching all the GWNYFCA nominees I haven’t yet seen to try and make my final vote as close to 100% as possible (although I might have to try and sneak out to AVATAR in theaters in order to do so depending on how the ballot shakes out). I’ll hopefully fit in a few Christmas films too since it’s the season for Muppets and Michael Caine. But for those uninterested in yuletide favorites, it’s also the season for awards contenders finally being made available to the masses thanks to Santa’s annual gift of a staggered Wednesday/Friday release schedule. I’m a big fan of Joanna Hogg’s films, so I was really looking forward to THE ETERNAL DAUGHTER both because of its connections to her previous two films (THE SOUVENIR and THE SOUVENIR: PART II) by way of its characters and its foray into the supernatural (of sorts). She’s created a haunted house thriller wherein the ghosts arrive within the baggage of the visitors rather than the old mansion-turned-hotel itself. Julie Hart’s (Tilda Swinton) mother Rosalind (also Swinton) used to stay there often as a child when it was owned by her aunt, so the former thinks it a nice birthday destination for the latter to let those joyous days flood back. With them, however, are also bad days. This place held both the playful fun of adolescent adventures and the horrors of trauma. Julie didn’t plan on that darkness. She only wanted to give her mother a glimpse into happier times and perhaps use the stories sparked by the memory in a new film she’s writing (Hogg simultaneously delivering its creation and result in a meta play on time). Finding that despair leaves a mark by ensuring Julie retain her own anguish of discovering those truths and the images of what Rosalind looked like when relating them. It casts a pallor on the entire proceedings wherein Julie cannot sleep or work. The wind, fog, and sounds of “ghosts” keep her trapped in a loop of her own making. The film looks great and Swinton is great as the doting daughter and increasingly troubled mother whose spiraling demeanor brings with it a reveal that’s less surprising than it is welcome (Hogg casts one actor in two parts to render her compositions as the solution to a technical problem while also solving a narrative one). Does its discovery warrant ninety-plus minutes of what often feel like repetitive motions confirming what we already know? I sadly lean towards “No.” That’s not to say the messaging and metaphor don’t resonate, though. I simply posit that they still would if pared down to a thirty-minute short since I couldn’t stop checking my watch. As one son tragically dies in the water every superstitious fisherman on this remote Irish island refuses to learn to swim, another returns. Brian (Paul Mescal) has been gone for years, telling everyone he’d moved to Australia despite never sending an address. It’s thus a dream come true for his mother Aileen (Emily Watson). Children who leave rarely come back and those who stay often find themselves drowning like Brian’s old friend Mark or languishing in what becomes a prison of the soul. So, she lets him pick up where he left off working her father-in-law’s oyster farm now that he’s unable and her husband, Declan Conlon’s Con, couldn’t maintain it alone. It’s not what Brian ever wanted, but Aileen’s never been happier. That high doesn’t last long, however. This perfect façade Aileen hopes might come to fruition starts stalling when father and son argue about the latter risking his life by working the farm at high tide and threatens to deteriorate once and for all when she’s called to the police station to answer a question: Was Brian with her the night of an attack? We know what she does, namely that she left him at the bar with his old high school flame Sarah (Aisling Franciosi). And considering the events that transpire the next morning, Aileen has to know something isn’t quite right. But can she throw this dream away so soon? Her instinct is to lie. To protect her perfect son at the cost of everything. GOD’S CREATURES is co-directed by Saela Davis and Anna Rose Holmer (writer and director of THE FITS, respectively) with a similar sense of tension. Written by Shane Crowley (from a story by Fodhla Cronin O’Reilly and himself), the plot unfolds with a quiet yet hopeful intensity as we meet the players in this close-knit community that’s as quick to mourn a loss as throw the living under the bus to maintain the status quo. We can feel a reckoning approaching once the honeymoon of this prodigal son’s return starts wearing off, but we also want to believe Aileen’s image of her son is pure. By defending him without even talking to Sarah, however, she can’t help but let reality finally come into focus. It’s a fantastic piece of storytelling with an authentic air of emotion that never feels unearned or embellished. This is a “boy’s club” world wherein abuse has always been ignored or accepted due to generations of embedded misogyny. And while it’s one thing to look the other way or let it happen to you, conscious complicity in someone else’s abuse is different. What does this choice do to how Aileen looks at her son? At herself? To lie is to let the entire town turn Sarah into a pariah. And for what? More toxic male rage to come? More silence for women like her own daughter Erin (Toni O’Rourke) to endure their pain alone? The film’s second half (the lie occurs exactly at the midpoint) is tightly wound to ensure we cannot look away no matter how certain we are something even worse is on the horizon. Watson and Franciosi are amazing, their early friendship contrasted by their wordless glaring as though embroiled in a game of chicken that always finds the former’s Aileen turning in shame first. But what I loved the most is how the filmmakers never pretend this culture isn’t an intrinsic feature of the landscape—that the way forward won’t also be driven by dark secrets. It’s a somber, heart-crushing affair where dreams must forever remain unfulfilled fantasy. Tobias Lindholm’s THE GOOD NURSE is a pretty solid true life drama that I believe works as well as it does because he and screenwriter Krysty Wilson-Cairns didn’t try and turn Charles Graeber’s non-fiction novel into a thriller. We know Charlie Cullen (Eddie Redmayne) is killing these people. That’s not up for debate. And humanizing him through his genuine friendship with Amy Loughren (Jessica Chastain) doesn’t negate that fact. I’d argue he becomes scarier as a result because it proves he is good at his job. He has the capacity to save lives. You could almost read his story in a way that makes him a warped activist trying to expose the hospital system’s penchant for caring more about their financial liability than human lives. Maybe that’s why he’s never admitted “why.” That aspect is admittedly the most interesting. All the stuff between Charlie and Amy is familiar territory as far as “he was such a nice guy” hindsight is concerned. Where the filmmakers really hit their stride is the investigation headed by Noah Emmerich and Nnamdi Asomugha’s detectives and how their every move is obstructed by the hospital’s risk manager played by Kim Dickens. She’s impeding their progress because she needs time to get Charlie off her payroll before they can charge him with a crime. Talk about evil. And you can’t even put all the blame squarely upon her shoulders since she represents the ninth hospital to do so. Redmayne is great in the role (the only reason I watched was because he keeps being mentioned as a potential Oscar nominee). Until a few instances later on when things begin to finally unravel for him, he’s a walking exemplar of empathy—so much so that we never fear for Amy or her daughters’ well-being, even when Lindholm tries to pretend we should. As such, I’d argue that it’s Chastain who leaves an even bigger mark. Between her heart disease, the pressures of being a single mother, her job responsibilities, and navigating the realization that her best friend is a murderer, her character is put through the ringer and more. She’s the “good nurse,” after all. The only one who finally did something. Every time Chef Slowik (Ralph Fiennes) claps his hands to mark a new course, the entire dining room jumps in fright. And that’s before they discover they should be afraid. Because this exorbitantly-priced, exclusive seat at Hawthorne comes with a twist … but I’ll leave that to director Mark Mylod and screenwriters Seth Reiss and Will Tracy since the reveal proves an unforgettable moment of confusion insofar as believing whether what we’ve seen is real or part of the show. We want to assume the latter due to the theatricality and surreal absurdity of it all. Yet the longer we stay with these characters (guests and chefs alike), the more we understand that intent is everything. THE MENU delivers a brilliant tonal mix of suspense thrills and humor considering how meticulously matter-of-fact the inevitable horrors and woefully up-their-own-asses the clientele prove. Between the table of “bros” (Arturo Castro, Rob Yang, and Mark St. Cyr), the washed up actor (John Leguizamo) name-dropping the chef as a personal friend, the elitist critic (Janet McTeer) and her editor (Paul Adelstein), and the aging couple (Reed Birney and Judith Light) treating this apparently magical (and bank-busting) event like just another Tuesday, there’s plenty of fodder for kitchen vs. customer antics. Restaurant host Elsa (Hong Chau) is only happy to comply. But there’s also the pathologically oblivious Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) and his date Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy). He’s practically orgasmic the minute they land on the private island knowing his palette will shortly be tasting the world’s greatest food. She couldn’t care less because she was a last-minute addition—one that has thrown Slowik and his staff for a loop. The reason is crucial to the insanity to come and her background methodically constructed to allow the expository themes of service industry rage to grab a foothold for their explanation rather than merely screaming it into a void populated by those immune to its point. Is the whole a bit too perfect in its plotting as a result? Perhaps. That precision is actually one of the best parts of the first hour considering how much comedy is born from it. Fiennes, Chau, and the restaurant staff are impeccable in their deadpan deliveries to offset the mounting frustration and shock their actions provoke from the “eaters.” This juxtaposition is so good that the whole suffers a bit when the truth of what’s happening and Margot’s presence are finally reconciled. The third act proves somewhat rushed and messy, the joke finding its limits with apparently nowhere to go. Thankfully, however, Mylod and company do stick the landing, pivoting back to cold, calculating finality with just a hint of earned (albeit conveniently) compassion. Brett Morgen’s MOONAGE DAYDREAM is by all accounts a sensory experience rather than your usual idea of a documentary—rock, biographical, or otherwise. Sanctioned by the late David Bowie’s estate, Morgen comes in and hyper-kinetically edits together a two-plus hour epic of archival footage and interviews to juxtapose our assumptions with his public image and artistic prowess via an overarching representation of the icon’s “essence.” It’s not going to be for everyone due to its nonlinear linearity, expressionistic aesthetic, and over-long runtime, but even its detractors must admit the audacity of the enterprise is worth a look. I enjoyed it. I didn’t love it. Would that opinion have changed had I seen it during its IMAX run? Maybe. It’s definitely built for a large screen and deafening surround-sound, so those attributes are perhaps a requisite for the so-called “transcendence” that many are quick to describe. That’s not to say it isn’t effective on a 50-inch television with a soundbar too. As a fan of the artist and the music, it was a treat to see and hear what Morgen did in the edit bay (although the repetitive footage was a distraction) to breathe new life into the artifacts. Would I prefer a more straightforward biography? Yes. These things can often trend towards the realization that we let celebrities/artists talk too much rather than simply letting the work speak for itself. Because rather than clamor to watch this specific interpretation again (in many ways it says more about Morgen’s relationship with an enigma than Bowie himself), my first thought upon its completion was to fire up a couple albums and YouTube a few music videos—those that were included and, especially, those that weren’t. What if, before intentionally earning a court martial at West Point, Edgar Allan Poe helped solve a murder that ultimately drew thematic parallels to his later work with the assistance of prophetic poems told to him in dream by his dead mother? Well, Louis Bayard sought to answer that question with his novel THE PALE BLUE EYE, presently adapted by writer/director Scott Cooper for the big screen. Poe (Harry Melling) is but a cadet who fancies himself a poet—a bystander with an aptitude for problem solving that intrigues lead character Augustus Landor (Christian Bale) enough to hire him on the sly as his “man inside.” The victim: an apparent suicide whose body was later relieved of its heart post-mortem. With a sprawling cast that relegates Robert Duvall and Charlotte Gainsbourg to only a couple scenes each so as not to bog down the proceedings, Cooper drops us into the Hudson Valley’s isolated militarized zone with everyone on-edge about rumors of Satanic rituals. Landor is hired by the school itself to try and keep matters in-house, his reputation as an investigator of renown enough to gloss over his recent bout of alcoholism as a result of the death and disappearance of his wife and daughter respectively. He and Poe strike up a infectious rapport as they try to uncover a mystery that gets more complicated by the day … and rising body count. Marked by a finely-tuned narrative progression that dabbles in the occult to keep the players and us on our toes, there’s really nobody on-screen who doesn’t set off our radars at least once. The Captain (Simon McBurney) who’s always watching with a skeptical eye from the fringes. The school doctor (Toby Jones) who’s either careless or conniving as far as his current coroner work. His eccentric wife (Gillian Anderson), their ill daughter (Lucy Boynton), and brashly confident son (Harry Lawtey). The latter’s peer group of other cadets speaking in riddles and inside jokes (Fred Hechinger and Joey Brooks). Heck, even Poe himself (Melling is very good) once lies are revealed. Landor must absorb it all. The film starts down a suspense thriller road before settling into what becomes a rather straightforward murder mystery, complete with long-winded recaps and brainstorming sessions between Landor and Poe that ultimately lead towards a grand Poirot-esque unraveling of hidden truths. Cooper keeps a tight ship with some well-placed imagery of what haunts Landor (Bale is also great), setting the mood and also the stage for what’s to come. It gets much darker than I anticipated and excels at maintaining an air of sophisticated drama while also delving into some horror corners. And despite the denouement not proving too difficult to guess, it never feels forced. A solid piece all-around. Eleven years is a long time to wait for a sequel, but here we are getting PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH anyway. I guess you can justify it when you’re talking about a spin-off to what was Dreamworks’ flagship animated franchise—especially with a planned reboot of SHREK also on the docket. You cap your quadrilogy with PUSS IN BOOTS in 2011, bide time to ride the HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON wave, and then dip your toes back into the fairy tale universe housing Far Far Away with a standalone lark first. Give us another adventure with swashbuckling hero Puss in Boots (Antonio’s Banderas) to set the table. You could say all those years passed for the characters too considering screenwriters Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow position mortality as the central theme of our return. Puss is back at his usual antics dripping in ego and invincibility when he suddenly wakes upon a doctor’s table to learn he’s just lost his eighth life. That means he only has one left—a fact he initially brushes off with a shrug before coming face-to-face with The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura). Is the latter’s bounty hunter truly skilled enough to take Puss down and finally pierce his skin with a blade? Or has all this talk of dying shaken Puss into losing his edge? Either way, retirement seems his sole alternative to oblivion. Rather than end the story in anonymity, however, CROODS: A NEW AGE director Joel Crawford and company introduce the myth of “the last wish.” With Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her Bear Crime Family (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo), and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) all on its trail, it’s only fitting that Puss would join one last thrill ride in the hopes of wishing his lives back. And while they all crave something they think they need but might already have (save Jack as he’s literally just a self-aware soulless ghoul), along comes little Perrito (Harvey Guillén) wanting for nothing but friendship like all the best dogs do. It’s a kitchen sink-type, chaotic race through the magical dark forest with life lessons, flashbacks, and the irreverent humor we’ve come to love from this franchise. I could do without the anime-style, herky-jerky fight aesthetic shifting from 3D to a faux-2D perspective, but otherwise enjoyed the animation upgrade. The bear family is auditioning to be Guy Ritchie’s latest band of hapless wannabe thieves, Mulaney is having way too much fun as a psychopathic nursery rhyme (opposite his Jiminy Cricket facsimile “conscience” voiced by a Jimmy Stewart-channeling Kevin McCann), the Wolf lends a legitimate sense of urgency with a dark foreboding and Omar Little whistle, and Puss, Kitty, and Perrito teach us that a life of love beats legend any day. While the calls for RRR (RISE ROAR REVOLT) to get an Oscar nomination as Best Picture (since India chose LAST FILM SHOW for International Film consideration instead, ultimately making the shortlist) are akin to the people who wanted SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME to get one last year—namely that the shiny new toy you just saw being fun and exciting doesn’t mean it’s a masterpiece—I can’t say S.S. Rajamouli’s epic isn’t still an absolute blast. With crazy choreographed fights, a ton of romance and humor, wall-to-wall computer effects (including wild animals that probably didn’t need a full disclaimer to tell us as much in case we were worried real tigers, etc. were used), and the most homo-erotic leading duo since POINT BREAK, what’s not to love about this historical-set fantasy? Hardly original in narrative with adversaries accidentally becoming best friends only to realize it too late and have to choose between “brother” and “mission,” it is wild in its orchestration with one climactic fight unfolding fully on piggyback. There’s some big brain insanity in that respect to offset the otherwise over-the-top theatricality of caricatured villains (Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody as the governor and his bloodthirsty wife leave little scenery left after chowing down every time the camera places them in frame) and swooning score. But that’s Tollywood for you. It’s all a heightened state of reality with musical montages, interludes (“Naatu Naatu” made the Oscar Song shortlist), and supernatural-esque sequences imbuing men with God-like powers. And why shouldn’t Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) and Ram (Ram Charan Teja) become Gods? These are two men who would laugh in the face of danger if they weren’t so gosh darn serious every time danger rears its head (it’s often, very often). The former is his peaceful village’s champion, sent to Delhi to rescue a young girl the governor “bought” by any means necessary. The latter is an ambitious royal officer in the governor’s army looking for a promotion by single-handedly jumping into a violent gang of Indian civilians to arrest someone who dared to throw a rock, earning a couple concussions for his trouble. They were rendered as Gods well before the plot (and music lyrics) caught up. Gods, patriots, lovers, and friends-to-the-end. Who better to start an explosive revolution? Why doesn’t Rama (Kayije Kagame) want her family to know she’s pregnant? That’s the central question I took from an extended prologue of sorts wherein she and her white husband Adrien (Thomas de Pourquery) visit her Senegalese mother and sisters for a meal before leaving Paris on a work trip. Everyone exchanges their usual pleasantries, asking what they’ve been up to, etc. Adrien is careful with his language when explaining that they won’t be vacationing this year because of a “major project” to complete at the house. He looks at Rama to deliver the news and she avoids the subject, dismissing the implication completely. Why? Alice Diop and her co-writers (Amrita David and Marie N’Diaye) set the stage for SAINT OMER to deliver a simple answer: that Rama is nervously unsure of what’s to come. From an opening dream calling out for her own mother to the obvious strain in their present-day relationship, we can assume she fears becoming that which she now resents. And it’s not without reason once memories of conflict and emotional repression rear their head. How much of who her mother is will rub off once she’s a mother herself? Is giving birth a mistake? Will attending the trial of a young woman accused of infanticide help her to see that things could be worse? Or will doing so prove they already are? The juxtaposition is ultimately a heartbreaking one since the reality of Laurence Coly’s (Guslagie Malanda) case proves much more complex than the news reports her very conservative and white community of Saint-Omer depict. They paint her as a murderer. A monster. And she doesn’t necessarily disagree since she admits to the crime. But not to the guilt. Her defense is sorcery—that her aunts cursed her. Her attorney’s defense is insanity. The truth lies somewhere in-between once details reveal that Laurence’s circumstances are so heavily steeped in cultural bias and racist imperatives. People ask how this “intelligent” and “eloquent” Black woman could do such a thing? But how do either of those attributes matter? Laurence’s parents put undue pressure upon her to be unimpeachable in white society. She moved to France to get away from that unspoken oppression only to find herself in Saint-Omer with an older white boyfriend (Xavier Maly’s Luc Dumontet) and an increasingly hostile air of “otherness” that led to an unhealthy seclusion. Her entire life was thus dictated by this idea of manufactured perception—to be that which others demanded rather than finding that which she embraced. Rama sees her own insecurities projected throughout the courtroom. The preconceptions. The assumptions. The casual disregard for the fifteen-month-old victim in lieu of deciding which adult was more at fault for her death. Reading that much of the on-screen scenario was born from lived experience (Diop, like Rama, sat in on a real infanticide trial herself) makes sense considering how meticulously rendered and performed the courtroom scenes are. But also because of the emotions Diop imbues via her actors’ performances and her decision to splice in Rama’s silent memories of a tired mother struggling to survive under the weight of unjust expectation. The comparison allows for a refocused understanding of who this woman was. Because while motherhood is inherently scary and the past, present, and future of one’s own DNA and environment exacerbate that terror, knowing this truth can also be a blessing. No matter how alone you may feel, you never truly are. I think it’s official: Ruben Östlund films just aren’t for me. While I enjoyed FORCE MAJEURE a lot (yet still not as much as it seemed everyone else around me did), THE SQUARE was simply too scattershot and on-the-nose to really enjoy it as more than a lark. I feel the same about TRIANGLE OF SADNESS, probably because it’s pretty much the same film—skewering the fashion world and capitalism instead of the art world. Both have memorable dinner scenes. Both possess a game cast with some genuinely hilarious moments. And both are way too long. Östlund has some great ideas, but it almost seems his goal is to intentionally push the joke beyond its limits of insufferability. I love the idea of satirizing the wealth gap by having outlandishly rich patrons on a yacht juxtaposed against the overworked and fearful help desperately seeking a big tip they probably won’t get (rich people are often rich because they are the most frugal people alive). I’m not sure Östlund actually brings anything new to the table on the topic, though. He pokes fun at those who earn their wealth with filth (Zlatko Buric’s “shit salesman” is an unhinged riot), weapons, and influence (the late Charlbi Dean’s Yaya and Harris Dickinson as her boyfriend Carl are the straight men and thus de facto leads), but only for gags. Even Woody Harrelson’s comedic timing can’t save an underwritten role that’s only here as a socialist American foil to Buric’s capitalist Russian. And the help rarely get more than directions to look awkwardly uncomfortable. Act One intrigues because of its intimate scale and conversations about gender roles where it pertains to money (it’s just Dean and Dickinson arguing about financial intent when it comes to dating). Act Two widens the scope by putting them on a cruise well out of their price range (Yaya got tickets in exchange for some Instagram posts), but it quickly pushes them to the background to let the caricatures around them act like fools. Act Three flirts with true commentary by leaving a handful of passengers shipwrecked on an island with the yacht’s “toilet manager” (a wonderful Dolly De Leon) flipping the table to become their leader as the only person who can survive with her own two hands, but it never takes the next step. Östlund is an expert at writing gags, but I just can’t buy that they add up to anything like so many others apparently can. Watching Darren Aronofsky’s cinematic adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter’s play THE WHALE doesn’t make me wonder how it works on-stage as much as how it might work under the guidance of a more sympathetic director. That’s not to say Aronofsky is unsympathetic. I think he and Brendan Fraser bring the character of Charlie to life in a way that objectively humanizes him and allows his pain—created from an unyielding anguish and depression—to be understood. Unfortunately, however, you cannot deny that Aronofsky doesn’t also lean into the external, horror-infused perspective that people like Charlie are often dismissed as grotesque, pitiable monsters. It’s therefore tough to reconcile our desire to empathize with the tempest of emotions surrounding him against an adaptation that seems hellbent on preventing us from doing so. It’s a slippery slope. You do need to depict people’s heinous persecution of him since it’s a part of his story. A lot of what Charlie has become stems from the stigma that society places upon obesity (and homosexuality). The trick is thus not using that depiction in a way that, intentionally or not, normalizes that reaction. We spend almost ninety minutes with Charlie as he bares his soul while the facts surrounding his struggles (fatherhood, sexuality, religion, mental illness, etc.) are revealed. Why, after all that, do you then create a scene wherein he’s “caught” in public in such a way that the person who sees him runs away? What does that add? It’s one thing if the film was about said reaction en route to judging society’s shortcomings. But it’s not. It doesn’t. So, choosing to portray it anyway feeds into calls of exploitation. You don’t need that shame to then catalyze Charlie’s subsequent decision to voluntarily be seen. Thinking you do is lazy. What a shame too considering the performances Aronofsky receives from Fraser (the fat suit, while problematic, was always going to prove necessary for financing since this film doesn’t get made with an unknown entity who’s naturally that size) and Hong Chau as his friend/nurse Liz. They imbue a bottomless wealth of compassion and history to these characters—so much so that the love they share easily outweighs the cruelty of others sneaking in. Their tenderness provides the leeway to let Sadie Sink’s Ellie (Charlie’s estranged daughter) be so vicious. She has every reason to be that way after all. His obesity is merely an easy target with which to package her justified rage. It does beg us to ask the million dollar question, though: Why make Charlie obese at all? Because being able to narratively use it as a means of manifesting his self-loathing and guilt isn’t good enough. That renders it a stunt and ultimately feeds into the stigma rather than combat it. You can argue that it’s just one example of many instances of psychological trauma on-screen, but it’s the only one that takes physical shape. Ellie’s issues don’t utilize a fat suit. Thomas’ (Ty Simpkins) don’t either. At a certain point, Charlie’s disability stops being a character trait to become the entire character. And yet the film continually refuses to acknowledge it because it would rather just use it as a trigger for Charlie to want to get his affairs in order. That way Hunter can ratchet up the drama via more secrets couched in a not-so-deep commentary on Red State politics without ever confronting the sickness itself. Because without Fraser and Chau's performances, that's all this really is: a shallow plea for kindness in a world so cynical that people have grown less accepting than they already were in hopes that God gives them a reserved seat at the apocalypse. “And in that gaping silence was the real horror.” What a line. It’s spoken via narration towards the beginning of Sarah Polley’s adaptation of Miriam Toews’ novel WOMEN TALKING—words born from hindsight by one of the young girls residing in the strict Mennonite colony where it is set. She’s providing context for the meeting that’s being held in a hayloft between the women of three families attempting to decide the fate of all women in their community. The “silence” is their lack of language, education, and privilege to fight back. The “horror” is their subsequent inability to band together and stop the atrocities committed upon them by their men while also allowing themselves to become involuntarily complicit to that violence. It’s the product of a power void those same men created and continue to enforce to maintain their control. And the time has come to fill it with righteous fury. While the events on-screen are fictional (and described as such by a clarifying caption), don’t be fooled into believing its exercise isn’t based in truth. I’m certain there will be some viewers who discover that it takes place in 2010 and scoff, ignorant to the fact that Toews loosely based the scenario on real events that occurred in Bolivia circa 2011. There, like here, saw the rampant and unchecked domestic abuse and rape by men from the community against their wives, sisters, daughters, and neighbors with the assistance of animal tranquilizers. The women in the film were told they were hallucinating. Lying for attention. Victims of ghosts or demons. Only when one caught her attacker and forced him to name names were they finally arrested. So, the colony leaders did the only thing they could do: threaten the women to forgive their abusers or lose their place in Heaven. In another of many brilliant lines of dialogue, it’s explained that these women who cannot read or write quickly teach themselves how to vote. There are three choices to decide between while all the men are in town trying to bail out their brethren. Stay and forgive. Stay and fight. Or leave and never return. The narrative premise is that the democratic process ends in a three-way tie pitting three of the most well-respected families against each other to hold a debate. Frances McDormand’s domineering and scarred Janz won’t be swayed from forgiveness. Salome (Claire Foy), daughter of Agata (Judith Ivey), wants blood. Her sister Ona (Rooney Mara), impregnated by her rapist, sees leaving as the freedom to witness a world that’s been kept from them. Add Greta’s (Sheila McCarthy) desire to at least try finding consensus despite her daughter Mariche (Jessie Buckley) angrily interrupting and refuting the others’ points and the stage is set for a rousing dialogue that moves between indignation, introspection, pragmatism, unbridled emotion, and even a few well-placed hints of humor. We hear their respective cases, watch as they alter minds and change their own, and get transported back to their individual traumas with effectively rendered flashbacks that always prove contextually relevant to the current topic of conversation. Faith. Pacifism. Education. Love. Autonomy. It may just be eight women and their minutes-taker (Ben Whishaw’s recently returned August) arguing in one room for the duration, but it’s the most dynamic and tense film I’ve seen all year. Because you don’t know how things will shake out. The narration teases that some of these women leave, but says nothing about the nightmarish drama that could potentially occur beforehand—whether by the men’s early return or the women passionately defending their right to not back down. Foy is a force of nature. Buckley is heartbreaking in her nihilism. Ivey and McCarthy deliver steadying maternal hands of wisdom earned from decades of knowing what “forgiveness” has already wrought. And Whishaw, along with August Winter’s Melvin, devastates as a masculine counterpoint that strengthens the women’s resolve. We’re witnessing a reckoning—a rebellious cry to erase that silence once and for all with tears of sadness for what’s left behind and joy for what’s to come. And above all else: relief. Here’s a fun one from KUFFS wherein Tony Goldwyn says the f-word so many times that they have to bleep all but one to keep a PG-13 rating. A solid gag.

"Dec 23, 2022",positive," Luego de perder su octava y penúltima vida, el miedo se apodera del simpático Puss in Boots, personaje que conocimos por primera vez hace casi dos décadas en la popular secuela de Shrek. La muerte parecía un concepto muy lejano para el intrépido felino, quien ahora contempla cabizbajo su inevitable destino. Sin más remedio que aprovechar al máximo la última oportunidad que le resta, el legendario héroe decide retirarse por completo de su peligroso oficio, dejando atrás su característica capa y espada para mantener un perfil bajo. No obstante, la inesperada llegada de Goldilocks y su familia de osos a la casa de reposo donde éste habita lo llevará a emprender una nueva aventura: encontrar una estrella mágica que posee la facultad de conceder un solo deseo.  En compañía de Perro, un encantador sabueso que observa el mundo con gran positivismo, y la audaz Kitty Softpaws, quien fuera el amor de su vida, el peludo protagonista deberá armarse de valor para enfrentar al temible Jack Horner, un personaje salido de una rima infantil, y evitar que éste halle el camino hacia la estrella de los deseos. Un viaje lleno de grandes hazañas que le hará comprender el verdadero significado de la amistad y a valorar los pequeños detalles que llenan de felicidad el fugaz recorrido por este mágico universo.  Tras una década de ausencia, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (El Gato con Botas 2: El Último Deseo) nos re-introduce exitosamente a la tierra habitada por seres de cuentos de hadas con el peculiar humor de la saga de Shrek, sirviendo como preámbulo para un próximo episodio protagonizado por el ogro verde y su secuaz burro. Antonio Banderas y Salma Hayek retoman los roles que interpretaron en el 2011 y son acompañados en esta ocasión por Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Harvey Guillén, Wagner Moura y John Mulaney. Todos realizan un fantástico trabajo, pero es Guillén, conocido por la serie televisiva What We Do In The Shadows, quien se lleva la película como el hilarante y tierno Perro.  Como suele ser costumbre, la animación de DreamWorks Animation es de primer nivel. Desde la minuciosa labor para lograr que el pelaje del felino protagónico sea lo más realista posible, hasta las emocionantes secuencias de acción al mero estilo de Mad Max: Fury Road que sorprenden por su ingenio. Hablando de ello, la película está llena de chistes que deleitarán al público de todas las edades. Por ejemplo, el ajuste de Puss in Boots a su jubilación, o el intento de Perro por imitar la tierna mirada que popularizó el personaje principal. Asimismo, los breves cameos de personajes del universo de Shrek satisfarán a los fanáticos del reino de Far Far Away.  A pesar de que la cinta animada sigue una estructura narrativa convencional, el mayor acierto de Puss in Boots: The Last Wish radica en la fuerza de su mensaje. Uno que resulta ad hoc para la época decembrina de celebraciones familiares y de propósitos de año nuevo, al recordarnos que solamente tenemos una oportunidad para vivir plenamente y que debemos aprovechar al máximo cada momento que se nos regala junto a quienes nos quieren y aprecian. Una bonita reflexión para chicos y grandes que nos invita a examinar nuestras prioridades, recapacitar, e invertir el tiempo sabiamente en lo más valioso e importante. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (El Gato con Botas 2: El Último Deseo) estrena en cines a partir del 23 de diciembre del 2023."
"Dec 23, 2022",positive," Typically when it comes to films, and sequels especially, spending years in development hell can be a very bad sign. The difficulties in getting the product completed can reflect too many creative energies clashing or a lack of clear direction. It can lead to countless script revisions, studio interference, and perhaps worst of all: indifference from a public who no longer care about the property. But sometimes, a wait is very much worth it if the product is visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and entertaining as hell despite some minor weaknesses in the story. I’m talking of course about Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. Set after the events of the Shrek films, we open on Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) discovering that he’s down to the last of his nine lives. After a brief stint laying low at a cat shelter, he decides to seek out a legendary wishing star to get the rest of his lives back. But he’s not the only one seeking it. Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears Crime Family also want the star, as does “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Then there’s the alpha wolf bounty hunter (Wagner Moura) tracking Puss to take him in dead or alive…preferably dead. Puss enlists the help of Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and a wannabe therapy dog (Harvey Guillén) to get to the star before anyone else does and before the Wolf can take him out. As someone who doesn’t care much for the Shrek franchise as a whole, I found the original Puss In Boots to be a breath of fresh air. It was less concerned with fairy tale satire and far more focused on telling a fun story; in fact, the fairy tale elements were the least enjoyable parts of it. It was just a thrilling adventure with great animation, excellent voice acting, a tight and committed cast, and one of the best dance battles I’ve ever seen on film. The Spanish setting gave the film an infectious energy and distinct identity separate from the fantasy grab bag of the Shrek films.  But The Last Wish isn’t simply a recreation of what made the first film sing. This is an evolution in nearly all ways, from the visuals to the story to the voice acting. Nearly everything here is better the second time around, and even the flaws of the first film are less pronounced here.  The film’s animation is probably the most obvious change here. Inspired by the phenomenal animation of Into The Spider-Verse, the visuals in The Last Wish have a distinct style separate from what’s come before. Instead of aiming for more realistic textures and movement, the animation here is designed to more closely resemble a storybook. There’s a remarkable painterly vibe to the animation, giving it a look that’s both innovative and oddly, sweetly vintage. Some of the action scenes are also highlighted by a change in frame rate and speed, adding a kind of anime-style hyper-reality accent to set pieces that are already full of tight, precise choreography. That includes the adrenaline-fueled opening that has Puss going up against a tree giant and using a church bell as a weapon. The visuals have matured and grown, divorcing themselves from the shiny, sleek approach of the Shrek films. I really can’t stress how appealing and intriguing the animation here is. From the perspective of a lifelong animation fan, seeing a unique animated approach from a mainstream studio makes my heart leap just a little. It’s a level of care and commitment that shows through in the final product. The stunning visual palette is perfectly echoed by Heitor Pereia’s dynamic, multi-colored score that blends acoustic and electronic and is capable of both sun-soaked, kinetic action and graceful, elegiac emotion.  The vocal performances have also matured in more ways than one. It’s not just a matter of the returning cast having themselves aged. Whereas the original film took place before the events of Shrek 2, this is set at some point after the last Shrek film. Hearing a gruffer, deeper, and more wonderfully aged voice coming out of Puss is highly appropriate, and Antonio Banderas does not disappoint. Puss has become an iconic character almost entirely based on Banderas’ charming performance and clear love for the role. Compared to the previous Puss film, the character here is just as full of bravado and daring-do, but that’s underlined by a world-weariness and (as we find out) paralyzing fear of death that he’s only barely able to hide. It’s a multi-layered performance that’s beautiful to see and hear. Banderas isn’t alone, though. In general, the voice cast is entirely on their game and knocking it out of the dark forest. Salma Hayek’s Kitty Softpaws is the definite yin to Puss’ yang, her energy just as anarchic but much more controlled and subtle than Puss’ exuberance. Hayek is a fantastic counterpoint to Banderas, and just like in the first film, the two play off of each other perfectly. They’re complimented even further by Harvey Guillén’s “Perrito”, who’s earnestness and innocence always comes off as endearing and not annoying. It’s almost impossible to dislike the character, even as his wide-eyed approach to the world gets under the fur of the more cynical and pragmatic Puss and Kitty. The antagonists here get just as much screen time as the good guys, and that’s for the most part a good thing. Florence Pugh’s Goldilocks is just a fun time, and her being at the head of a crime family of bears taps into a very specific form of logic. The family dynamic is balanced well, and Pugh is capably backed up by Olivia Coleman and Ray Winstone, who plays affable thuggery like a fine art. However, the most intriguing character by far is Wagner Moura’s Wolf. He has a legitimately terrifying design, with his glowing red eyes, intimidating build, and a super-sharp sickle in each hand. Moura’s performance is chilling and hypnotic in equal measures, and his mere presence gives the film a deliciously uncomfortable undercurrent of threatening, inescapable darkness. That might seem like an odd quality to compliment in an animated film, but it makes perfect sense here. This is a story about facing your own limitations, and in the case of Puss, your own mortality. It’s an very adult existential crisis, but it’s handled with care and attention. For the first time in a long time, Puss has come face to face with his own fears, no longer able to hide them with his heroic persona. This is sometimes literal; whenever the Wolf draws near, every hair on Puss’ body stands on end. Seeing Puss in such a vulnerable way gives him new dimensions and depth, making his adventures more than just a fun time.  A strong theme in the story here is appreciation for what we have instead of focusing on what we lack or (more importantly) what we think we need to be happy and how we discover the truth between the two. The topic itself might not be terribly original, but the execution of it is handled well. When the characters reach the pocket dimension where the wishing star is kept, they discover that the land itself shifts based on who’s holding the treasure map and what obstacles they need to face to realize their inner truth and confront their own self-doubt. The film mines some deep psychological depths but packages them in a very digestible, colorful way.  Not every part of the story works as well as it should, however. Despite John Mulaney’s solid performance, Big Jack Horner is a poorly-sketched and fleshed-out character with the most basic motivations and backstory of the cast. He wants the star just so he can have all the magic power in the world, and that’s it. He’s your average sociopath bully, but armed with a bag of holding full of pilfered fairy tale artifacts and magical creatures (he uses a phoenix as a flamethrower at one point). There’s a reason he’s the least highlighted character in the trailers, and especially compared a genuinely compelling villain like the Wolf, he comes off as almost completely unnecessary. The threat he poses comes off as too basic compared to the Wolf and especially to Puss’ own inner demons. Jack’s continued presence in the film gives it a feeling of it being slightly overstuffed and the inescapable feeling that time spent with Jack could be spent better by focusing on literally any other character. Regardless of Jack horning in on the plot, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a refreshingly and surprisingly complex film disguised as a lighthearted animated adventure. And that’s a very good thing. While still thriving on the swashbuckling vibe of Puss’ previous exploits, this film frames them in the context of maturity and the holistic nature of our life’s path. This isn’t just a fun, exciting quest; this is a fun, exciting quest with a highly relatable, highly emotional candy center. Who knew that a sequel to a Shrek spin-off would be so damn satisfying on so many levels?"
"Dec 23, 2022",positive," “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is the sequel we didn’t know we needed. With a fairy tale-inspired animation style that differs from the more realistic look of the previous “Shrek” films, this second theatrical outing for the title feline distinguishes itself from other franchise offerings. When Puss (Antonio Banderas) vanquishes a giant monster threatening a village, a large bell crashes violently down on top of the swashbuckling hero. The shocking death is met with some joking when the famous cat breathes again, looking no worse for wear. But this death, his eighth in his lifetime, is cause for alarm. Puss in Boots is on his last life. After a visit from a frightening bounty hunter named the Wolf (Wagner Moura), Puss realizes one more death might really be the end of the line. And Wolf is more than capable and plenty happy to usher Puss into the nether world. Determined to stay alive, the eternally self-absorbed Puss hangs up his hat and cape, burying them in the yard of Mama Luna (“Only Murders in the Building” star Da’Vine Joy Randolph), with whom he seeks refuge in his retirement. But an existence as a house cat proves to be a daunting undertaking. As the weeks pass, Puss grows a beard and gains a companion, a dog (Harvey Gullién from the series “What We Do in the Shadows”) masquerading as a cat. But when retirement is interrupted by a call from Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three protective bears, Puss begins to rethink his choice to leave the adventurer game behind. He surreptitiously learns from Goldi that there is a wishing star out there that might restore his lost eight lives. Puss and his little dog then set out on a journey to find the magical treasure. “The Last Wish” is excellent family entertainment. Banderas is in fine form delivering his character’s lines with droll confidence. Just the way he refers to himself, “Puss in Boots,” gets a recurring giggle. It rolls off the tongue infectiously, making it an instant earworm. And the story is populated with many colorful fairy tale-inspired faces that subvert their classic origins. For example, “Little” Jack Horner becomes “Big” Jack Horner, voiced with an acerbic wit by comedian John Mulaney. He’s armed to the teeth with magical weapons retrieved at will from a bottomless nanny bag. And, naturally, his relentless henchman makes up the “Baker’s Dozen.” But embedded with all the zany comedy bits is some effective pathos. Puss rekindles a romance with Kitty Softpaws (the voice of Salma Hayek, of course), and his faithful dog becomes his comfort animal as Puss copes with the anxiety associated with only having a single life left. However, Florence Pugh’s Goldilocks might warm your heart. Since three rough-and-tumble bears raised Goldi, she’s lost something of her delicate human identity. And while the bears have done the best they can to accommodate the young woman, she longs to harness the power of the wishing star to return to her own kind. Goldi’s relationship with her bear family is quite endearing. Olivia Colman and Ray Winstone are excellent choices for Mama and Papa Bear, which only adds to the depth of the bond. Even though Goldi and the three bears are initially revealed as thieving villains, it’s hard not to root for them. And when the film concludes, I suspect we’ve not seen the end of this foursome in any future installments. “The Last Wish” borrows the animation style we saw earlier this year in “The Bad Guys,” which might remind viewers of the look of the Oscar-winning “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” The images are very fluid and pleasing to watch and don’t have the strange, uncanny qualities that marked the earlier “Shrek” films."
"Dec 23, 2022",positive,"While most of the passively enjoyable first film eludes memory, this sequel packs a solid story that should hold the interest of all ages, terrific new characters, big laughs and the endless joy of Antonio Banderas voicing our now more mortal hero."
"Dec 23, 2022",positive," Twelve years after the “Shrek” spinoff “Puss in Boots,” the sassy Spanish feline voiced by Antonio Banderas has returned for another fairy tale-busting adventure, directed by Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado and written by Paul Fischer (with a story by Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler). Crawford, Mercado, and Fischer all worked on the DreamWorks Animation favorites “Trolls” and “Croods: A New Age,” and the trio bring a similar “chaotic good” energy to “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” which remixes a new set of familiar nursery rhymes and beloved children’s fables to entertaining ends. Our titular tabby is living a swashbuckler’s life, swilling leche, singing songs, saving towns, raking in the adoration and accolades, when he dies his eighth death, landing him in his ninth, and final, life. Spooked by a visit from the grim-reaping Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), Puss decides to hang up his hat and boots and head for retirement in the home of a crazy cat lady, Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). The Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the CDC and local health officials. But he can’t escape adventure, and soon Puss is caught up in the quest for a magical wish, which is in the possession of a greedy, pie-producing hoarder of enchanted trinkets, Little Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Remember him, with the Christmas pie and the plum on his thumb? Jack, now quite big, also is pursued by Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her Cockney crime syndicate family of bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, Samson Kayo), who want the wish to make things “just right,” of course. With his former flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and new pup friend Perro (Harvey Guillén) joining in on the race to grab the wish, Puss learns how to cherish his one precious life by making a new friend, or burying the hatchet with Kitty. This is all explicated with fast, funny dialogue and therapy-style lessons delivered by an actual therapy dog. Blissed-out chihuahua Perro is more than happy to stop and smell the roses, and as it turns out, that’s a good way to make it through this maze called life. The irreverent twist on familiar characters makes “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” entertaining (the fact that it doesn’t overstay its welcome at a brisk 1 hour, 40 minutes helps too). What makes it great is the experimental and creative building of this world. The animation is dizzyingly fast and crisp, but it’s the production design by Nate Wragg and art direction by Joseph Feinsilver that sets this film apart. The backgrounds upon which Puss and pals traipse reference Candyland and Francisco Goya, with a rough-hewn painterly quality  that evokes a warm, appealing texture, as if you can see brushstrokes. Other settings are Technicolor hallucinatory fantasy-scapes, while the Big Bad Wolf’s angular lines and grayscale palette set off his gleaming red eyes and call to mind the aesthetic of a noir graphic novel. Banderas’ purring Puss has long been a favorite “Shrek” character, and he has great chemistry with Hayek’s Kitty, but the rest of the cast brings charismatic vocal performances as well, including Pugh, with her distinctive low tone, and Moura (known for his role on “Narcos”), who makes his Wolf singularly scary. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is one gorgeous and dynamic fractured fairy tale."
"Dec 23, 2022",negative," PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH. With the voices of Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Florence Pugh, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura. Written by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow. Directed by Joel Crawford, Januel Mercado. Rated PG for action/violence, rude humor/language, and some scary moments. 100 min. In theaters. Daniel M. Kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of film-related books. His most recent novel is Banned in Boston. He is the 2018 recipient of the Skylark Award given by the New England Science Fiction Association. He lives in Somerville, Massachusetts. No, it’s not a terrible review. It’s a review you disagreed with.  I found the animation and storytelling creepy, inept, and offputting.  You didn’t.  You’re entitled to your opinion, as I am entitled to mine.  Learn that people can have different opinions than yours.  That’s what makes them opinions. Completely disagree with this review. The animation was striking (inspiration from the amazing Into The Spiderverse methinks) the action scenes often breathtaking. The voice acting top drawer. The story full of heart. The MAIN bad guy terrifying and created genuine jeopardy.  Maybe it sags a little in the middle but man I really wish all animation had this ambition. I’m 47 years old. My 7 and 8 year olds both thought it was a 10/10 also. Loved it. It’s not Family Feud, and your job isn’t to guess what the survey says. Your job is, indeed, simply to say whatever crosses your mind. But a critic’s value relates to how in-tune they are with reality and with the public’s general taste. An opinion so out of touch is frankly worthless. It does not help prospective viewers in making a decision, it does not provide a reliable feedback for the creators, and it does not reflect the world’s views. So I would ask, what IS your job really? What kind of value do you provide, if you can’t even recognize a good movie when you watch it? And I’m not just saying that, it’s statistically objective. It’s hardly objective. My job is not to validate the box office.  Audiences bought tickets for the “Transformers” movies.  That doesn’t require me to “reflect the world’s views” or “the public’s general taste.” My advice has always been to find a critic you’re on the same wavelength with and listen to him or her, not to insist that a critic must reflect back YOUR views. Your review is weak, I normally try to understand others perspective. But you give so little definition to your opinions. I just can’t agree with this review, please 🙏 give me an better understanding why you would give this movie such a low score. It feels like you didn’t watch the film, or squinted through you fingers whilst watching it. The animation was top tier as cartoons and anime go, the storytelling was on point teaching others about their own mortality for Puss, what a real family is like with goldilocks, how to trust with Kitty and that some people really are just scum inside with Jack Horner. It feels like you don’t understand that people can have different opinions and both are valid. I’ve never told someone they were wrong if they saw a movie and had a different take than me. Critics are not here to validate your opinions. Just watched it and I completely agree with your review, albeit we appear to be in the minority. It’s a mess of a film, forever trying to move forward the action through surreal twists. This somehow worked for me in The Croods: A New Age but not here. It was just flat, the dog was annoying, the bears even more do.  Redeeming it somewhat are a few genuinely good jokes and a few decent meaningful interactions between Puss and Kitty, and Goldilocks and the bears, before we lurch off again into a “look at this, isn’t it zany?!” acid trip. Thanks. There are several Oscar nominations I don’t get including several for the horrible “Triangle of Sadness.” It’s okay to be in the minority on a film.  It’s the rare film that scores either 100% or 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. What people need to understand is these are opinions and they’re not wrong simply because mine is different from yours. Absolutely. I’m in the minority on several other films cough cough Batman Begins cough cough. Still, I was surprised by the volume of positives for this dog’s breakfast of a film on Rotten Tomatoes. Hence spotting yours! While I do love this movie, I understand that we aren’t a collective hivemind that all have to think the same way about it. With that being said, do you have any thoughts on how they could have improved the movie in your eyes? Also, your comment about the movie’s animation being grotesque has made me curious. What style of animation would you say that you prefer? Artistically, this is gorgeous. The story is simple, but has a great flow to it. The characters are fun to watch, their growth explored. The score hits familiar bests and could be better at some points, but nothing is boring.  The animation is groundbreaking, grotesque *characters* nonwithstanding. Grotesque is welcome and appreciated, befitting the role. Scar was a grouesque lion. He was perfect. Exaggerated proportions are key ingredient to characters in most animated movies.  Sure, I bet there were people who did not love The Lion King. Who did not appreciate The Secret of Nimh. Who hated Felidae. Who were appalled by every classic in existence. And that’s fine. But when they tell others of these experiences for a living, they should try to explain better how their opinions were formed. And hopefully go deeper than saying X was “bad”."
"Dec 23, 2022",positive," The Spanish actor debuted in the second ""Shrek"" film and has supplied the voice of suave, confident Puss in several more, as well as in his own ""Puss"" features and shorts. Banderas stole scenes in every one because his characterization is so cartoonishly self-assured and because, when he wants sympathy, the way animators shift him from Latin lover to big-eyed kittycat is hilarious. It's surprising, then, and surprisingly delightful that ""The Last Wish"" is willing to shake up the formula. Puss dies at the beginning, for instance, leaving him with just one of his nine lives. And having multiple lives seems to have been the source of much of his bravado. So he spends the rest of the movie in a sort of purgatory that's similar to the world he came from except he can't assume that everyone will bow down to him anymore and he's stuck with a dog sidekick who annoys the heck out of him (voiced by Harvey Guillén). It's fun to see Puss laid low and in need of help from others, so both story decisions are great. So are the primo actors in the cast. Olivia Colman adopts a working-class accent to play the Mama Bear whose bed Goldilocks once occupied and Florence Pugh is the golden-locked ingrate, who seems to have been hanging out with the dimwitted bear family for at least a decade longer than she'd like. The bright script hands out zingers to both of them, and to Salma Hayek as Puss' will-they-or-won't-they. It's easy to recommend all of that stuff to fans of Banderas or of the off-kilter fairy tale universe of ""Shrek,"" but the visual aspects of the film are not as strong. The main characters have the clarity and detail of the ""Shrek"" movies but much of the rest of ""Puss"" is substandard, particularly when early scenes call for lots of background characters, all of whom have the blank, bland look of low-budget animation. Those scenes look like they were completed hastily, or with small screens in mind. So maybe it would be wise to wait a couple of months until ""Puss"" is available to watch them on those screens, at home."
"Dec 23, 2022",negative," Not sure what to see on Boxing Day? Our critics rate the new releases, including (from left) I Wanna Dance with Somebody, The Banshees of Inisherin, Matilda, Triangle of Sadness and the new Puss in Boots. There’s no bigger date on the Australian movie calendar than Boxing Day and, as always, there’s a rash of new releases on December 26 promising something for everyone. Well, for almost everyone: with every other distributor seemingly running scared in the face of Disney’s Avatar: The Way of Water, there’s a surprising lack of blockbuster action this year. The end of the year is typically when the big Hollywood studios release what they hope will be their awards contenders. So it is that The Banshees of Inisherin, Triangle of Sadness (which won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May) and The Lost King make their bows, with another big contender – Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans – to follow on January 5. But if this is a great time of year for lovers of serious cinema, it’s also a treat for families, with an animated Puss in Boots adventure, the live-action/animated hybrid musical Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile and Netflix’s film of Matilda the Musical all arriving. And for fans of music divas, there’s a must-see biopic of Whitney Houston. There’ll be plenty more over summer, too, and our team of film writers and critics will be covering all the big new releases, so stay tuned. But for now, here’s our guide to the Boxing Day movies. Enjoy. Barring a prediction or two from a local soothsayer, The Banshees of Inisherin contains no element of fantasy as such. But this latest bucolic tragicomedy from writer-director Martin McDonagh (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) has a quaint otherworldly flavour that suggests the chronicle of a squabble between hobbits. Though born and raised in London, McDonagh has made his Irish heritage go a long way. The action takes place in 1923, just off Ireland’s west coast; the fictional Inisherin is “played” by the real-life island of Inishmore, pictured as a jigsaw puzzle of lush green fields encircled by low-lying dry stone walls, much as it was in 1934 when Robert Flaherty arrived to shoot his pioneering docudrama Man of Aran. Famously, Flaherty was engaged in the kind of quest for authenticity that paid little heed to the truth – portraying his islanders as engaged in a constant battle for brute survival, even when not taking to the open sea for their allegedly traditional shark hunts. By contrast, McDonagh makes no claim to even the loosest kind of realism. His Inisherin is less a functioning community than an unlikely haven for slow-witted, middle-aged celibates dedicated to taking it easy. This viewer never quite managed to fathom how the gormless Padraic (Colin Farrell), a nominal cattle farmer sharing a two-room cottage with his sensible sister (Kerry Condon), manages to afford his nightly pints of Guinness and his pricey-looking knitwear. Whatever his duties entail, he has all the time in the world for what he calls “normal chats” with his best friend Colm (Brendan Gleeson) – until Colm, who wants more time for playing the fiddle, loses patience with his mate’s ramblings and warns Padraic never to speak to him again. “What are you, 12?” a neighbour says incredulously. That, if anything, is over-generous; as so often with McDonagh, the characters are basically overgrown pre-schoolers, whose impulsive choices have all too permanent consequences. A similar childish quality is evident in McDonagh’s own undimmed zest for cheap shock effects: anyone familiar with his past work will not be surprised to hear that the action turns increasingly gruesome, nor that there’s a subplot involving sexual abuse. No less standardised are the musical repetitions of the dialogue, which relies heavily on having the characters say “feck” whenever the pace starts to lag. In all these respects McDonagh isn’t too far from his American counterparts such as Quentin Tarantino or the Coen brothers – trafficking, as they do, in a menacing absurdism that can be traced back to the plays of Harold Pinter. But as an entertainer he doesn’t quite have the agility of his transatlantic cousins. The fanciful material of Banshees calls for a more visually stylised approach than anything he can muster. Without that, it’s hard to swallow the plot contrivances and tonal shifts of the film’s third act, let alone the vague hints of an allegory for the Irish Civil War. Still, the core subject here – the pain of rejection – is so close to universal that few viewers will fail to respond. Farrell’s pleading, puppyish features seem made to convey every shade of hurt and bafflement, and McDonagh puts them to work in close-up, as Padraic moves through the stages of grief in a manner both funny and heartbreaking. Is truth really the daughter of time? Josephine Tey’s celebrated 1951 novel based on that proverb has a Scotland Yard inspector, in hospital with a broken leg, trying to resolve the question of Richard III. I read The Daughter of Time in high school in an earlier century. I dimly remember its conclusions: that the popular vision of Richard as a hunchback who murdered the princes in the Tower was a lie planted by the Tudors and promoted by their pet playwright. Richard was nothing like the horseless psycho in Shakespeare’s play. Philippa Langley was one of these so-called Ricardians. When we meet her character in Stephen Frears’ patchy and polemical film, she is a tiny, sickly Edinburgh woman with two boys and an ex-husband, played by Steve Coogan. Coogan also co-wrote the script with Jeff Pope, reuniting the team that made Philomena. Sally Hawkins, an elfin treasure of the British screen, has never given a bad performance. Nor is this one, but she is ill-served by the team. In effect, the movie manipulates Langley’s story for its own ends, while accusing others of doing the same thing to Richard. The real Langley is a screenwriter, who began investigating Richard for a film project. No mention of that here. She was one of the initiators of The Richard Project, not a sole eccentric voice. She did wander into a council car park in Leicester and come over all funny when she saw the letter R on the asphalt. She has said repeatedly that she “felt” Richard was there, buried below. The movie ignores the fact that a historian suggested in 1975 that he was there. The church in which he was buried in 1485 had been demolished centuries earlier. Langley was pivotal in getting the agreement to dig. The Richard Project raised the money to pay an archaeological company, based at Leicester University, who thought the project would fail. When they did find Richard, the university bigwigs claimed the credit, shuffling Langley and the Ricardians aside. That part at least appears to have some truth. Frears and Coogan were outraged by this, so they construct a film about a battler winning against all odds. Langley has chronic fatigue syndrome. She identifies with the way Richard has been demonised for his condition – an easy metaphor. Hawkins quivers with indignation throughout, reaching a point where I thought she might break. Her performance does not lack commitment, just someone to guide it. How much human degradation and depravity is too much? Like the waiter in the Monty Python sketch about the overweight man in a restaurant, Swedish iconoclast Ruben Ostlund keeps offering us “just a wafer-thin slice” to take us over the edge, where discomfort becomes the point. He wants to make a movie that is worth leaving the house for. It’s basically a (longish) vomit-comet of cinematic bile and guile. For Ostlund, subtlety is overrated. Triangle of Sadness shows us why he has a point. It’s a spectacular demolition of modern life, a disruptor movie full of ideas and nuance, as violent in its way as a Pieter Bruegel painting. Ostlund grew up on a Swedish island, and his mother was a teacher and a communist. He has no difficulty in identifying the enemy. The surprise is how sympathetic he is once he has them up against the wall, squirming like an insect on a pin. A brief introduction throws us into the gorgeous lives of two models. Yaya (South African actress Charlbi Dean Kriek) earns four times as much as Carl (Harris Dickinson), but still expects him to pay for dinner. After a spectacular argument brings them closer, they board a super yacht as invited guests. Yaya is an influencer, accustomed to her beauty opening all doors. It’s her currency. The location is unclear, but it feels like the Mediterranean, somewhere near Greece. Ostlund assembles a basket of deplorables, most of whom are only there because they’re rich. An impeccably mannered English duo, cutely named Winston and Clementine (Oliver Ford Davies and Amanda Walker), enjoy a family fortune built on land mines and hand grenades. Fat Russian billionaire Dimitry (Zlatko Buric) declares proudly that “I sell shit”. His wife Vera (Sunnyi Melles), pickled in champagne, gives outlandish orders to the exquisitely polite crew: money buys obeisance. In his cabin, the alcoholic Marxist captain (Woody Harrelson) refuses to come out. When a storm hits the ship, the Marxist and the Russian capitalist get so trolleyed they take turns reading the Communist Manifesto over the PA. Meanwhile, most of the passengers are hurling the contents of the seven-course captain’s dinner. Then the sewage tanks overflow. Ostlund does not hold back: this is one of the most revolting (and hilarious) sequences in the history of movies, a brilliantly satirical square-up as nature overturns privilege. The survivors wash up on a deserted island. Neither beauty nor money means anything now. Abigail (Dolly De Leon), a Filipina who cleaned toilets on the ship, finds a new role. She knows how to fish. It’s like Gilligan’s Island meets The Hunger Games. Ostlund made some waves with Force Majeure and The Square. Triangle of Sadness bolts onto those as the grand finale of a trilogy about masculinity in trouble in a world without pity or moral compass. Force Majeure was about a family falling apart. Ostlund indicted the art world and its patrons in The Square. He dissects multiple forms of privilege here, from beauty to heredity to sheer dumb luck, but he does it with compassion. He loves the characters he tortures. There’s an emotionally powerful shot here, with one character crying over the body of another. Until this, both had seemed like empty shells, the victims of their own misbegotten fortune. Death and grief make them human again. What more is there to say about Whitney Houston, whose brilliant career, drug-taking and premature death has been hashed over exhaustively on screen and in the tabloids? I Wanna Dance with Somebody tackles that question by taking her story back to the music. It’s written by New Zealander Anthony McCarten, whose screenplay for Bohemian Rhapsody didn’t dilute the tragedies in Freddie Mercury’s short life while still managing to evoke the exhilaration to be had from Queen’s greatest concerts. It took a delicate touch and other rock stars haven’t been as fortunate. While Rocketman was just as exuberant in doing justice to Elton John as a performer, the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect (2021) became more depressing as it went on. The United States vs. Billie Holiday, also released last year, was the same. It was powerful but it was no celebration. Then there was Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis, which was more glitz than heart, clouded by the decision to tell the tale from the venal viewpoint of Presley’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker. Members of Houston’s family were interviewed at length for a documentary four years ago. But for this film, also produced with the family’s co-operation, director Kasi Lemmons made extensive use of the singer’s original recordings, including those laid down en route to the final versions. It allowed star Naomi Ackie to take Houston’s false starts, double takes and spontaneous comments as prompts in shaping her performance. Although she was filmed singing, her voice was replaced by Houston’s. She does well, catching the contradictions in Houston’s character – the naivete, the fear of failure, the rebellious streak and its effect on her religious convictions. But physically, Ackie bears only a superficial resemblance to the singer. With Houston’s image still so fresh in the memory, this is a distraction. The script is impressionistic in style, covering a lot of ground by being selective and using Houston’s songs to drive the narrative. Much is made of her relationship with the record company chief Clive Davis (one of the film’s producers), who discovered Houston and helped her choose songs for her albums. He’s played by a wryly urbane Stanley Tucci, giving us a character whose iron fist is well covered in velvet. Appalled when Houston takes up smoking, he looks sadly at her as she lights up, remarking that it’s like watching a Stradivarius being left out in the rain. The film falls a little short of its claim to be warts-and-all, condensing the low points in Houston’s turbulent marriage to Bobby Brown (Ashton Sanders), but it doesn’t hold back in dealing with her father’s financial mismanagement. Nor does it underplay the importance of her enduring friendship with her former lover, Robyn Crawford – played with a lot of verve by Nafessa Williams. Roald Dahl was not the first storyteller to acknowledge many children’s taste for the macabre – the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen got there before him. But nobody has ever extracted as much fun from this discovery as Dahl has. Matilda Wormwood (Alisha Weir) is one of Dahl’s most popular creations – a small girl forced to survive as best she can in a world governed by some of the most malevolent grown-ups in children’s literature. Her parents (Andrea Riseborough and Stephen Graham) are bad enough – crass, venal and spiteful, with voices piercing enough to shatter glass – but Miss Trunchbull, headmistress of Crunchem Hall, the gothic house of horrors that is Matilda’s school, is worse. She’s a monster. Trunchbull was played by a man when Matilda: The Musical began its triumphal march across the world’s stages. When the screen adaptation was announced, it seemed the role would go to Ralph Fiennes. Instead, Trunchbull is brought hideously to life by an unrecognisable Emma Thompson. Her face looks as if it has been moulded out of concrete, while she stamps around her domain in a get-up with an unsettling resemblance to a stormtrooper uniform. Thompson abandoned her vanity long ago, but this creation goes quite a few grotesque steps further than her Nanny McPhee of the single bucktooth and hairy mole. Matilda is sent to Crunchem Hall because her parents don’t like having her around. She does her best to keep out of their way, having adopted the local mobile library as her second home. Librarian Mrs Phelps (Sindhu Vee) has become a substitute mother, as well as being a receptive audience for the stories spun by Matilda’s fertile imagination. The film is directed by Matthew Warchus, who is the artistic director of the Old Vic in London and worked on the original stage production. He has done a wonderful job transferring the musical’s energy to the screen. Two hundred children were recruited to portray Matilda’s schoolmates – or Crunchem’s “maggots”, as their headmistress refers to them – and their chorus work brings great vitality to Tim Minchin’s music and lyrics, which are crucial in advancing the plot and crystallising the mood of the film. They’re also gifted comedians adept at the slapstick that gives the choreography such charge. Eventually, the “maggots” all learn how to stand up to the execrable Trunchbull, as does her sweet-natured underling Miss Honey (Lashana Lynch). Despite his love of the sardonic, Dahl did believe in happy endings and Dennis Kelly’s script keeps the story’s dark and light sides in perfect balance. Twelve-year-old Weir does the same. It’s a performance in which innocence and intelligence are bound up with bravery and righteous anger. You cheer her all the way as she takes on the seemingly impossible. Apparently a classic in the US, the children’s book Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile wasn’t part of my childhood. But Will Speck and Josh Gordon’s new adaptation, a hybrid of live action and animation, felt almost familiar – starting out as a homage to the great Warner Brothers cartoon One Froggy Evening, then morphing into a bid to recreate the success of the genuinely charming Paddington films. Canadian singer Shawn Mendes supplies the voice of Lyle, a shy but musically gifted young crocodile who is discovered hiding out in the attic of a New York brownstone by the family that has just moved in. This is supposed to be an “elevated” children’s film, meaning we get Javier Bardem as a flamboyant magician, a suite of unmemorable songs from the team who worked on The Greatest Showman, and Adult Swim comic Brett Gelman playing a nosy neighbour named Mr Grumps with hipster irony. Less ironised is the core message, which appears to be the same one sometime Pixar songwriter Randy Newman satirised long ago in his novelty hit Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear: even rank outsiders can be accepted anywhere, provided they know how to sing and dance. Joel Crawford’s fully animated Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has a few more things going for it, at least for viewers like me who are easily won over by the notion of an intrepid marmalade cat who’s voiced by Antonio Banderas and can buckle a swash with the best of them. True, I can’t say I yearned to see this feline Zorro undergo a midlife crisis and face his own mortality. But given the character made his debut in Shrek 2 in 2004, it’s understandable that weariness would start to set in. Having used up all but one of his nine lives, Puss in Boots can only regain his mojo by embarking on a shamanistic spiritual quest through a psychedelic landscape where his fears manifest in physical form (the painterly style, influenced by anime, makes a change from the usual “photorealistic” approach). Hot on his tail is a parade of villains, including the menacing Jack Horner (John Mulaney) and a Cockney version of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) who has turned the three bears into her criminal sidekicks but still yearns for the day when everything will be “just right”. There are a fair number of amusing moments along the way, but also a few scenes that may alarm younger viewers. (One of these, involving carnivorous flowers, I found pretty creepy myself.)"
