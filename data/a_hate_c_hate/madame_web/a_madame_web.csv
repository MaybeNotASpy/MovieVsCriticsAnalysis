Apr 13 2024,negative,i dont usually leave reviews but i have just watched madame webb and it was one of the most awful movies i have ever seen i would leave 0 stars if i could the script is rubbish and dacota johnsons acting is so terrible that it is painfully to watch do not watch this movie if you value your time and money
Apr 13 2024,negative,absolutely a waste the whole storyline was all over the place they are trying too hard to make you hope it might be a good marvel movie but failed dismally to create one  the acting was terrible i dont thing dakota was the right actress for this roll she is better off being spanked in 50 shades  i felt my brain melting with the boring story line
Apr 13 2024,negative,i felt that the casting in this movie was questionable with the exception of sweeney and adam scott  this movie hits some very perfect notes of universe references right to ben parker being at his unborn nephews mothers baby shower    adam scott delivers nearly flawless execution of every scene and has a pervect level of relatability to a common man with influence of a super hero in the future       johnson has the acting range of liv tyler but that may be the limitation of the directors focus and capabilities   the story is disjointed and confusing    another strog point was the sheer terror that the dark spider presents when attacking and gives insight as to how an evil spiderman would be  the voice dubbbing was an insult to the actor and signs of the traditional sony comittee inteference    i feel that the spiderverse flicks were near perfection becasue these committees and executives viewed animation as unimportant and disposable    sony has a problem in that sony causes the problem and on a corporate level suffers the dunningkreuger effect and lacks the intelligence to see the lack of intelligence they have    its worth seeing but not at cinema prices
Apr 13 2024,negative,this movie wery bad madam web actors role cast its horrible
Apr 12 2024,negative,theres no connection to whatsoever events happening fast lack of sense gave one star because if dakota tl
Apr 12 2024,positive,it was a good storyline and it was action packed movie hope there will be more series to it
Apr 12 2024,positive,i dont understand why the rotten tomatoes rating was so low i think maybe whoever was responsible for that rating just didnt pay attention to the movie or didnt understand the medical things it did jump around some with the flashes of the future but it wasnt too hard to follow
Apr 11 2024,negative,this movie was so bad i genuinely would turn this on if i had plans to torture someone but even then i dont think anyone deserves that much pain
Apr 11 2024,negative,not even with the studios paid bots they could get a decent rating
Apr 11 2024,negative,just such a waste for marvel i struggled even getting through most of it couldnt finish the rest
Apr 10 2024,negative,worst superhero movie youll ever see ridiculously awful  dont waste your time 
Apr 9 2024,negative,this movie didnt make sense at all i didnt even finish it but i couldnt bare watching another second of this horrible movie i saw the other reviews going into the movie thinking that a lot of people were over exaggerating but no this movie is one of the worst movies ive ever seen i could only write bad notes about this movie          first like i get the fact that his movie is scientificfiction but this just crossed the line a spider that can paralyze you and kill you then why wasnt the baby at least a little bit disabled oh thats right instead of her being disabled she gets super powers and holds a bunch of teens hostage so she doesnt go to jail which makes no sense at all because if you hold teens hostage then you will have a grater chance of going to jail speaking of the topic there is one scene where she is being handcuffed and then when the guy comes which well talk about later when they run the handcuffs just disappear the guy is just a bad reboot of spiderman   the story telling sucks and lastly all the blood is just a bit of food coloring        do not watch
Apr 8 2024,negative,boring film without meaning or morals  sony wants to destroy the spiderman universe and it is succeeding  i think that without a doubt this is the worst superhero film in recent years and i think its impossible for anyone to take that title away from this film    horrorous
Apr 8 2024,negative,nothing special or exciting about this movie it was plane and dual all the best parts where what you saw in the trailers of this movie please dont make a sequel
Apr 8 2024,positive,i enjoyed every minute a perfect origin story
Apr 8 2024,negative,i have never hated a movie more i want my money back
Apr 8 2024,neutral,madame web    madame web emerges as the origin tale of cassie webb her quest leads her to rescue three girls from the clutches of ezekiel sims a ruthless figure intent on their demise to evade his own fate at their hands in the future    films in sonys spiderman universe have received criticism and madame web isnt exempt from that however contrary to many reviews madame web is a straightforward and enjoyable superhero film it doesnt aim for grandeur which aligns well with its storyline despite uninspiring dialogue hinted at in trailers the actual movie doesnt suffer from this though not particularly imaginative the dialogue effectively propels the story forward    the film effectively captures the nostalgia of its 2003 setting the soundtrack plays a significant role in this and the homage to beyonc√©s dangerously in love was a delightful touch    madame web does indeed encounter several challenges the unfolding of subplots relies too heavily on convenient occurrences which can be frustrating for viewers while the exploration of the titular characters powers is intriguing it diminishes the suspense that should accompany this genre of film as obstacles arise the predictability of their resolution removes any sense of genuine tension or dread    for a superhero movie where the principal characters are battling a villain palpably stronger and possessing no impressive powers of their own the action scenes manage to be more effective than one would expect    the performances in this film may not be stellar but they are wellsuited to their roles dakota johnson portrays just the right balance of detachment and confusion required for her character her reluctance to embrace heroism is palpable and serves as a driving force throughout the movie the rest of the cast also meet the expectations for their respective roles    numerous aspects of madame web require refinement and clarification but its notable that the runtime isnt adversely affected surprisingly the twohour duration passes smoothly without feeling prolonged or dragged out    madame web would benefit from better writing but overall its a simple and decent movie that knows what it is and doesnt try to go beyond that    5510
Apr 7 2024,negative,i was eager to watch madame web but i was disappointed by the poor writing the movie lacked depth the dialogue especially for the antagonist was particularly bad
Apr 7 2024,negative,terrible waste of time would rate it 0 stars if it were an option
Apr 7 2024,negative,so bad that no one even jokingly praises it
Apr 7 2024,negative,i dont know where to start i thought it was a parody film at least ill be ok with that but apparently this film is a million dollar production the acting is very bad the transitions make no sense and are sometimes awkward the characters seem to have their dialogues in front of their eyes the main character is supposed to be a paramedic but i dont think anyone would trust her with their life given the trolllike scenes lets not even talk about the visions she doesnt understand what theyre trying to tell us after 1 hour in the film the whole film seemed to be a perfect parody but that didnt seem to be the point save your time and money and get out
Apr 7 2024,negative,i couldnt finish it the acting was horrendous and i cant tell if the main villain had his lines dubbed over but whenever he would talk it never matched his lips
Apr 7 2024,negative,the only reason i watched this is because of the connection of it to the spider versethis movie is disappointingi want my money back
Apr 7 2024,positive,i wanted the movie to be more about her and less about three annoying teenagers they take up a lot of time and overall dont do much for the story
Apr 7 2024,negative,story was mediocre saw it in theaters i felt like there was so much money put into this but it ended up being a disappointment it was funny at some moments other jokes didnt land well if you dont want spoilers skip to the next review but why and how does the antagonist not die to the miniature bombs know as fireworks survive gunshots grenades fire but die to a falling sign it feels like the budget was running low so they had to end the movie early wouldnt say it was horrible but definitely not marvel quality
Apr 7 2024,positive,great movie we will need an additional madame web
Apr 6 2024,negative,absolutely rubbish the most ridiculous unbelievable made modern film ive ever seenthe story the acting the actual whole context of the film plotline if you could call it that is just a complete farce  how did someone not notice this during the production of this rubbish  dakota johnson must seriously have been hard up for cash to agree and then continue to do this thrash there is no other explanation because it has single handedly destroyed whatever reputation she might have had in the acting world  i usually am more forgiving when i see bad reviews of films i always feel that the reviewer didnt understand the point of the film whether it be just a no brainer action film or a serious proper epic but in this case i am the one who is 100 standing tall in saying that madame web is probably the worst modern film ive ever seenend of
Apr 6 2024,negative,worst heromovie with worst actresses
Apr 6 2024,negative,verily let me regale thee with a lamentation of cinematic proportions for madame web doth stand as a testament to the egregious misadventures of modern filmmaking with an air of anticipation akin to the unveiling of a grand tapestry i embarked upon this odyssey of moving pictures only to find myself ensnared within a maelstrom of mediocrity verily the plot unfurls like a tangled skein weaving a narrative so convoluted that even the most astute of scholars would find themselves lost amidst its labyrinthine machinations    in truth madame web doth serve as a veritable magnum opus of disappointment a cacophony of cinematic sins that assail the senses with all the subtlety of a rampaging herd of swine from its lackluster performances to its insipid dialogue every facet of this cinematic endeavor doth conspire to transform what could have been a masterpiece into naught but a hot pile of dog dudu alas if thou art tempted to partake in this illfated venture i implore thee to spare thyself the torment and seek solace in more worthy pursuits
Apr 6 2024,negative,this movie couldve been great the cannon had a great story but it was pathetically executed here another sony ruined spiderman story
Apr 6 2024,negative,madame web movie is so bad i aint like so far why didnt have spiderman on it
Apr 4 2024,negative,weak marvel comic book character who has never been popular enough to score her own comic book inexplicably is the leading character in this new superhero epic  which explains why this is the years biggest bomb you know the superhero genre is getting played out when they make a movie about a character who is simply a lady psychicnot exactly a stunning new concept brimming with exciting story ideasi mean we can just watch miss cleo for this kind of stuff or thats so raven  theyre actually much more exciting than this drivel    overall not recommended 
Apr 4 2024,neutral,its not that bad its just another meh origin story film it has some cool special effects the beautiful face of dakota and kind of a backstory for uncle ben so yeah dont take it too serious maybe some day we will have all these characters in a movie or not who cares
Apr 3 2024,negative,i went to see this movie earlier today i had hopes for this movie even after seeing the bad reviews however the acting was terrible the plot was weird and just overall a bore this movie is 100 a flop i would not recommend watching unless you like these kinds of movies the trailer was also terrible basically being a summary more than a trailer i should have listened to other reviews that told me it was bad before i watched it im not usually skeptical of movies and can sit through most movies that flopped but this movie was the last straw for me
Apr 3 2024,neutral,haha i did kind of like this movie but also yet this movie is amazingly horrible and at first when i first saw the trailer its kind of like final destination my favorite movie franchise this was kind of like that instead it was marvel made by sony the ones that also made morbius overall the concept of this is cool and its like the marvel comics but it just wasnt good and sydney sweeney is just to good of an actor to be in this like it literally got a 12 percent and is rotten like have you seen sydney on euphoria
Apr 3 2024,positive,i didnt expect this movie to be so good the story line is awesome had me in tears some parts had me excited some sorts had me routing for them as well im the beginning of the movie i was all for him defending himself against the girls but then when it started getting more into the video and i seen he was evil i wanted the girls to win i loved the movie a lot even my guy friend thinks it was a 10
Apr 3 2024,negative,i think this is the worst cinecomic in history during the duration of the entire film nothing happens with scenes where the camera moves randomly making you feel bad all the characters are flat without indepth analysis the film does not give explanations of any kind about what is happening in addition the film has a very badly done cgi i think its even worse than the morbius movie which at least in that movie had scenes that made you laugh and that became memes
Apr 3 2024,positive,loved this as someone unfamiliar with the comic i found the movie very entertaining would love to see what happens after this
Apr 3 2024,positive,82 didnt hate it i heard the worse things but for me yes some parts of the cgi was ok but i liked the lead in the movie i wish there were spiderman easter eggs its very frustrating that there isnt and the villain is stupid he gets hit by everything which has me laughing my asf in the theater i just wish sony cared about the source material bc ik they could be better and the movie should of put her in her suit definitely a complaint i had the whole movie i enjoyed the lead and the future past thing they did
Apr 2 2024,positive,when it comes to madame web ive noticed theres been a bit of a stir but honestly im a bit puzzled by all the fuss it seems like some folks went in expecting the usual marvel roller coaster but heres the thingim all for mixing it up why settle for the same old plots when we can explore something new right    personally i found madame web to be a breath of fresh air sure it had a few moments where things felt a bit offbeat but doesnt every movie these little quirks didnt spoil my fun if anything they added a unique flavor to the whole experience    the movie really shines by stepping off the beaten path and giving us something different from the marvel universe and lets be real in a world teeming with superhero tales bringing something new to the table isnt just niceits necessary    all in all madame web was a pretty enjoyable ride for me its a reminder that theres room in the superhero genre for all kinds of stories and im here for it the movie might not hit the mark for everyone but its definitely a bold step in a refreshing direction
Apr 2 2024,negative,awful just awful  terrible directing even worse writing and mediocre acting and visual effects make this film one of the worst ive ever seen
Apr 2 2024,negative,no hate towards any of the actors btw   between the dry plot  the nonsensical scenes and yall to drag my girl sydney sweeney into this after she just got a good rep from anyone but you  its giving wattpad vibes the director definitely played the game life is strange ifykyk
Apr 2 2024,negative,absolutely awful movie again making another female flop of a super hero movie marvel is going down the drain
Apr 2 2024,negative,everything about this movie seemed so lazy and low budget it made me want to shove scissors in my eyes hot garbage
Apr 1 2024,positive,since i went in without knowing anything about madame web the movie was ok however there were a lot of motions within the movie that had no depth like the teen girls in the movie felt like npcs nonplayable characters that have 23 lines that fit their age group no depths in their characters at all we had moments of their lives within the movie but they were the meat of the plot i wish they gave us more made us feel for why they had to run more desperate death in this movie had been taken lightly because i thought cassie could reverse it however thats not how her powers work and it confirms that shes not omnipotent
Apr 1 2024,positive,literally dont understand the bad reviews for this online reviews are becoming ridiculous its a good movie enjoyable
Apr 1 2024,negative,dont waste youre money
Apr 1 2024,positive,i watched this with my girls and they loved it   cant wait for the 2nd if there is one 
Apr 1 2024,positive,1010 i made an account just to counter the bad reviews because i actually enjoyed it for some off reason i related to the main character  it was tripping my whole family out lol
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie was an ok movie if you like the movie next starring nicolas cage that came out in 2007 youd like this movie her powers work the same as his just filmed better they using shoving in are face that this was a prequel to by making everybody say ben alot and at the end madame web basically confirmed the baby was peter i get it thats ben lets move on
Apr 1 2024,negative,absolutely cringe   the acting the storyline all of it  complete garbage the last two minutes of the film show the future in that this movie is really just a stepping stone for the next movie which features three spidergirls and seems just as cringe  if you want to put this movie on for background noise go for it but if you actually want to spend your time watching a good movie then hard pass
Apr 1 2024,negative,havent watched the movie and never intend to but i had to comment on the reviews  you can absolutely tell that sony has been salting the reviews with 5 star reviews  short sentences followed by i dont understand why it was rated so low   you see this comment again and again and again gee maybe read the reviews and youll realize why sony
Apr 1 2024,negative,cant describe how shitty it was every mili second of this movie was a waste the only thing i was hyped with is the peter birth at the end in post credits also turned out to be built up from nothing and was just made to give a reason to watch the movie sucks i would watch 10hs of pure cringe rather then ever seeing that movie again
Mar 31 2024,negative,meant for ladies that are afraid of pop culture
Mar 31 2024,negative,this movie should be culled it was designed for people with 7 braincells i have never seen such a waste of money in my life if they took the money they used to make this movie had gone to an open area put it all in a big pile and set it on fire we would have gotten more joy and comfort from the heat it produced than we had from watching this pile of rubbish
Mar 31 2024,positive,i really liked the movie and would love another one
Mar 31 2024,negative,brother ughh whats that
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is the greatest movie ever and dropped one of the hardest oneliners the girls were never your future i was girl power
Mar 30 2024,positive,i honestly loved this movie hidden references to other movies the actresses have been in i love superhero movies and to have one with female leads is honestly so refreshing hope they do a sequel
Mar 30 2024,positive,its not the best movie about superheroes but its not as bad as everyone claims it was fun to watch and thats the most important thing the actors extracted as much as they could from the script i personally dont read comics so i cant comment on how much the movie respects or doesnt respect that world but definitely neither the movie nor the actors deserve so much hate
Mar 30 2024,negative,i dont know why sony makes their own movies they are usually terrible and this one is no exception the leading female character was made to look so stupid she just couldnt figure anything out im done watching sony movies
Mar 30 2024,negative,the actors are not bad but directing and editing is
Mar 30 2024,negative,this type of movie is not well suited for dakota johnson as well not even good chemistry for the circle of this girlhood which was obviously ridiculous all i see is a timid superhero and a bunch of diabolical trio teens in a disturbing dream which doesnt make sense at all
Mar 30 2024,neutral,i felt like this movie couldve done better if maybe something actually happened
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was a different and refreshing story and it had a thrillinghorror vibe to it not perfect but entertaining and could def use this story line in the future
Mar 29 2024,negative,worst film ive seen in a while this movie is a huge insult to the marvel films and fans dont go waisting your time on this failure of a film the acting in this movie is horrific and nothing even happens the medical actions are horrific and painfully inacurate if you want to cringe out of your own body feel free to watch this monstrosity
Mar 29 2024,negative,this movie was so bad i really regretted watching it the story is so bad and illogical villain and the heroines are so cheesy and the acting is so bad i cannot believe that they spend so much money on this movie the whole movie is just horrible
Mar 29 2024,negative,i hated the film but the acting was what made me lividmaybe im just too used to watching good actors like morgan freeman or leonardo dicaprio but throughout the film she was so unserious oh she almost drowned no emotion the annoying idgaf attitude didnt really help either along with the forced raspy voice maybe thats just me hating
Mar 29 2024,negative,another bomb by marvel why are they putting people in charge of writing or directing a comic book movie  that have never read a comic book oh yeah wait dei nonsense is why very uneventful superhero movie great job marvel keep trashing the brand
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  hoping the negative reviews dont kill any sequels
Mar 29 2024,positive,its good more than okay less action but it as pleasant to watch
Mar 29 2024,negative,the last time i felt this amount of fascination and disgust was watching and smelling an art exhibit of a robot taking a human sht    a truly monumental car crash of hilariously bad dialogue delivered by the most low effort performances headache inducing camera work and a villain whos accent and acting was so bad they couldnt have a single scene of him talking into the camera    no amount of pepsi money could have saved this aweinducing shtfest
Mar 29 2024,negative,i watched 1 quarter of the movie and it sucked huge waste of my time already and i already knew what would happen at the end so predictable
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you dont like it its understandable but it has good lighting compared to other movies they have to improve their stories
Mar 29 2024,positive,i love marvel movies and this movie was great the plot was great it could have used more action giving the girls their powers in the movie would have been a good way to do that but all in all a good plot and movie
Mar 29 2024,negative,what kind of writing is this
Mar 29 2024,positive,maybe its a fun film for those who enjoy premonition the film definitely doesnt appear to be a superhero film and i like that
Mar 28 2024,positive,i didnt mind it is it the greatest no could theyre of been actual spidy type action yes     however it was easy to watch and follow little nods to the comics where needed worth a watch just enjoy it for what it is a filler film
Mar 28 2024,negative,personally i think the movie is cringe and only maybe worth watching if you have literally nothing else to watch but want to pass some time
Mar 28 2024,negative,ok so the movie starts okayish few interesting things knew the mother would die though ok we meet the mc she is coolish bit awkward and stuff but as the movie goes on it looses all the magic very fast with very generic lines and uninteresting dialog or just weird scenes that are not funny if it should have been the mc and the main villain start to seem very flat and the part where the girls just randomly dance on a table for the guys like i understand they are all abandoned and have issues but nerd girl played 2 different roles it did not seem like a girl having fun it felt like 2 different people playing 2 different roles most of the special effect are decent atleast some arent some scenes really dont add up like the police hunting the girls and stuff and why cant anyone else see the spider villain i might just have missed that part also how did the mc make the truck fly the maybe uncle ben reference was cool tho overall this couldve had allll the potential in the world but they missed the mark by a mile with wrong casting lacking better special effects directing choices and the script
Mar 28 2024,negative,backgroundstoryissobad very bad movie i didnt get it at all
Mar 28 2024,negative,it is just so hard to believe this is a marvel movie it seems like it is some attempt to make a movie but in the end nothing makes sense and everything is wrong the acting the storyline the dialogs the action i can imagine if i would try and attempt to make a superhero movie this is what it would look like and maybe i would do it better waste of time and you end up with a really bad taste in your mouth mind and heart no
Mar 28 2024,negative,bland corporatebaseline snoozefest lackluster dialog and a choppy plot make this film hard to enjoy
Mar 28 2024,positive,the movie has a very good story line the acting is solid not award winning that brings tears to the eyes would i be disappointed if i went to watch it on the big screen not at all would i watch a part two absolutely    great watch and would watch it again
Mar 27 2024,neutral,it has some fun fight scenes and the cinematography was nice but this potentially good film is really held back by a bland script with choppy dialogue and tons of plot holes
Mar 27 2024,negative,3 rules     1 we dont talk about fight club  2 we dont talk about bruno  3 we dont talk about this movie
Mar 27 2024,positive,this film feels like a lukewarm embrace between sony and marvel lacking the passion and depth one would hope for while some dialogues fall flat and certain acting moments could use improvement the overall visual presentation is adequate with decent visual effects the setting provides a gritty backdrop for the cast which adds a layer of authenticity to the narrative however there are unnecessary scenes that disrupt the pacing and cohesion of the story despite its shortcomings i dont outright dislike the film but it fails to evoke any strong emotions or leave a lasting impression yes the dragons may come for me but honesty in critique is paramount    guillermo alvarado  multimedia journalist  creativestudiogroupcom
Mar 27 2024,negative,absolutely garbage horrible acting and a horrible story madame web shouldve never got a stand alone movie she shouldve had an end credit scene at the end of a spiderman movie or a small part in a spiderman movie but never her own movie sony definitely screwed up on this one they should just give the rights back to marvel cause they dont know what theyre doing
Mar 27 2024,positive,i love it and want to see the future of these spider girls too long life to madame web
Mar 27 2024,negative,worst marvel installment since the 70s
Mar 27 2024,positive,really good i liked the movie
Mar 26 2024,negative,a great film to fall asleep to   did we need the table dance scene
Mar 26 2024,positive,the everything that happened in the movie was happened in 2003 from bush spying on americans to dancing on top of the table
Mar 26 2024,negative,save your money this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  watch paint dry and you will feel that your time was better spent
Mar 26 2024,positive,this movie has a lot of mixed reviews but i actually really liked it i tend to like movies alot of people dont like but this was interesting and dakota was really good in my opinion
Mar 26 2024,neutral,i was expecting awful but i didnt mind it   but i am truly not a superhero film fan so take that as you will
Mar 25 2024,negative,this movie is like an early 2000s cw movie so basic and plain im shocked that marvel helped make this they really out here giving movies to shitty characters
Mar 25 2024,negative,these femaleforward marvel movies are garbage this and the marvels are just as horrible as catwoman
Mar 25 2024,positive,had some great scenes decent story overall its a cute movie
Mar 25 2024,positive,i think it was a good movie and makes sense its nice to see their life before its all superhero stuff
Mar 25 2024,positive,im gonna go off and be in the minority here and im not afraid to admit it i had a blast with madameweb    is it perfect no its not but i truly enjoyed myself throughout the whole thing there are a few spiderman references scattered throughout and i thought they were cool sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor on screen together worked dakota johnson is likable adam scott was awesome as uncle ben and the villain wasnt great but he was okay     now i can definitely understand especially if youre a huge marvel fan like me if you didnt like it like i said its not perfect but i had fun with it personally    45
Mar 25 2024,negative,you know your movie is bad when velocipastor scores better rating on just about every review site
Mar 25 2024,negative,incredible my madame has been webbed
Mar 24 2024,negative,it felt like a teenager wrote a script turned in the first draft to sony and they let another teenager make it into a movie madame web is a film so bad im baffled it saw the light of day
Mar 24 2024,negative,i really didnt want this to be bad  but its worse than bad
Mar 24 2024,negative,maybe the madame was the web we made along the way cus i wanna flipping kill me
Mar 24 2024,negative,just stop with these girl boss movies already
Mar 24 2024,positive,had very low expectations because of the bad reviews but in the end it was entertaining enough to get an average score
Mar 24 2024,positive,typical and repetitive idea but still a fun movie for light viewing and entertainment
Mar 24 2024,positive,not a bad watch this movie has so much potential which wasnt fully tapped into
Mar 24 2024,negative,i liked the movie with its handful of timetravelish plot twists but the ending line about the future sth like you know the best thing about the future it hasnt happened yet seemed just so unnatural and forced to knock a few stars off if the whole movie was a spoof maybe it would fit in there maybe i missed the whole movie actually being a spoof idk solid 4 instead of 6
Mar 24 2024,positive,starts decent but weak storytelling and end with bollywood style logics hows can firewalls speared through a concrete wall
Mar 24 2024,negative,disjoined who were the side characters no development dialogue was lacking totally a waste of studio money
Mar 24 2024,positive,the movie is highly entertaining with a completely different spin and origin story from the original classic marvel character i didnt read any of the critics reviews and i just watched the film as is which kept me engaged from start to finish it has a lot of potential and i will definitely want to see a sequel
Mar 24 2024,neutral,this movie was just a bad superhero movie is it fun to watch sure am i going to watch it the second it hits a streaming platform no shot its rushed theres serious jump cuts that sort of dont make sense and the acting is not the best ive said it once and ill say it again its a good family date night at the movies movie but really nothing more than that itll get lost in the mix of superhero movies like the incredible hulk did 
Mar 24 2024,negative,are you kidding me with anything positive about this movie  i think about how many people are starving or going without just so some rich turds need to launder money and make it seem like they tried to do the right things with it seriously if you can make it through the first 5 minutes of this movie and not be able to tell me what you see stopping with it your either blind or your being paid by the ones who made ita 5 year old with a phone can make a better movie with a better story line playing with moms k    itchen utensils stop making movies just because you need too pay off your parents debts
Mar 24 2024,positive,it could have been better  its a good story but its missing a touch
Mar 24 2024,negative,movie was brutal lackluster acting and plot made this the worst movie of the year for me
Mar 23 2024,neutral,i personally didnt think this movie was bad but i think it could have been better there are other marvel movies id rather watch than this
Mar 23 2024,negative,considering who directed and wrote the screenpla maybe the movie is not so naive and stupid and if intend it to be only for teenage girls was the intention just to target a female audience with a female director with female leads  during that time teenage boys will be watching power rengers
Mar 23 2024,negative,this movie was absolutely horrible in most every way do not waste your time
Mar 23 2024,positive,im perplexed by the backlash towards this film in my opinion madame web is a commendable movie that deserves recognition from start to finish it keeps you engaged and entertained
Mar 23 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie honestly i think people who didnt have unrealistic expectations of superhero movies especially an origin story superhero movie it was entertaining the characters were enjoyable i overall really liked this movie and im definitely hoping for a sequel
Mar 23 2024,positive,fans of the spiderman universe might be surprised by the lack of direct connection to established characters but the film does offer subtle nods to the webslinging hero if youre looking for a superhero movie with a unique protagonist and a focus on building a new world madame web might be worth checking out however keep in mind that the film has slow pacing and lack of action
Mar 23 2024,positive,i know we all know the story but visuals nd telling r awesome a simple story makes my day a superb i want the team back in another chapter in future absolutely  great love it a
Mar 23 2024,negative,madame web did not pull a successful attempt on making this a solid film for the positives the main lead casts did a good enough job on playing the characters however the characters werent very likeable and its also because of the poor unsatisfying dialogue that they received makes the film feel very weak this was in some ways entertaining but stale
Mar 23 2024,negative,madame web attempts to blend supernatural elements with a thriller narrative but falls short on multiple fronts while the soundtrack featuring 90s music is a standout positive the film struggles with a lackluster story that feels uninspired and disjointed dakota johnsons performance doesnt manage to elevate the film leaving viewers questioning her role in the overall narrative flaws despite a runtime of less than two hours the pacing drags making the experience feel much longer adam scotts performance stands out as one of the few redeeming qualities but overall madame web fails to deliver a compelling or engaging cinematic experience
Mar 23 2024,negative,audiences at the movie theatres should be compensated well for this work of garbage the storylines make absolutely no sense whatsoever worse yet the whole dejavu thing is hilarious they dont even connect madam web visions oh wait now she travels back yeah even kids would want to be bribed to watch this pathetic production
Mar 23 2024,negative,this was so bad i kept notes throughout to make sure i didnt forget the numerous cringe worthy parts
Mar 22 2024,negative,another film in sonys hit and miss scu this is one of the bigger misses    thats not a knock on some of the cast sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor do well what what theyre given but that honestly isnt a lot it definitely felt like they wanted this to kick off a franchise of its own but thats never going to happen so its wasted some potential there    the story is just poor the villains motives are stupid the final act is decent but its a slog to get there i wouldnt recommend it unless youre either a completionist when it comes to comic book movies or you just enjoy bad films
Mar 22 2024,negative,an insult to the spiderverse how anyone involved in the making of this disaster thought it would be ok to release it to the world is beyond me
Mar 22 2024,positive,as an action fantasy it was still watchable  we didnt expect much from ms johnson and that helped  the major negatives were the three young girls two of which were pretty insufferable  could do worse
Mar 22 2024,negative,if i could give it zero stars i would
Mar 22 2024,positive,its a nice movie why such low rating dont trust rt
Mar 22 2024,positive,firstly dakota fanning was a poor choice for the main role she didnt seem to have any empathy with the role she played and just otherwise seemed to be there to collect a paycheck she doesnt seem to know anything about marvel based on an interview i saw and could really have cared less also dont be deceived there are no madame web comics she is just a character that has appeared in a few issues of the spiderman comics they never really established the hero characters of the three young girls and it was super silly to include ben parker spidermans uncle and surrogate father as well as the whole birth of peter parker its just another superhero movie that draws on way to much of the spiderman universe lore to make it anything truly tangible and worthwhile
Mar 22 2024,negative,madame web is a comic book film that has a convoluted story with little to no stakes its final act is lackluster and borderline confusing
Mar 22 2024,negative,i was scare to go watch the movie ive seen all the critics and i was like  alright lets see if its true or not  and unfortunately it is the trailer for this movie doesnt really showcase what the movie is suppose to be about it was tolerable at the beggining but i was cringing a lot the moment mme web goes to peru is when the movie became horrible and laughable nothing makes sense at all theres details missing that make it seems like its all a joke the ending needed to be longer and more explained
Mar 22 2024,negative,madame web is an extremely stupid and mediocre film if it hadnt been there nothing would have changed no expansion of the sony universe everything in the first trailer looked like an interesting and dark superhero movie with realities although we got clowning
Mar 22 2024,negative,saw my first bad movie of 2024 the dialogue was awful the villain was a bad cw side villain why was he wearing a spiderman suit dakota johnson and sydney sweeney cant act but wow sydney sweeney was hot af i fear for kraven and venom 3 now this makes the fans even hate marvel more  how did we not get a tobey maguire 4 or a andrew garfield spiderman 3 but we got this pos  310 only reason i give it a 3 is i like mike epps and adam scott
Mar 22 2024,negative,it was underwhelming and that is saying a lot coming from me the cast was good but the story was all over the place
Mar 22 2024,negative,terrible absolutely terrible
Mar 22 2024,positive,very entertaining and i loved all the characters i hope they make a sequel or spinoffs
Mar 22 2024,positive,love it i really enjoyed it cant understand why it was a horrible movie because it didnt feel horrible to me
Mar 21 2024,positive,my pikachu our trainer and her boyfriend watched and we all loved it and we see how this movie is obviously connected to the spider man homecoming franchise  is actually one the biggest surprises by far and our favorite marvel flim of this year at that   my rioul  taichi  so if your a fan of spider man andor marvel in general its worth watching once to actually see its inner beauty andor to actually have your opinion on it but it will still be a fantastic roller coaster ride of flim and with that we give this one the animat seal of approval for his sake as well not for ezeekle though to animat along with cassy and her family which will show more depth of whats yet to come in the spider man cinematic universe when knowing first what really happened during that they were peter parker became the hero spiderman  not ezeekle sims obviously  that we all grown to love our entire lives in marvel   story 8510  visuals 1010  characters 910  overall 9510
Mar 21 2024,negative,holistically rough at no point did i feel intrigued or invested in the story the plot the characters development of the characters was haphazard and sloppy if you consider it existing at all
Mar 21 2024,negative,lawd wth is this nonsense   someone said dakota johnsons performance was like watching a plank board trying to emote i almost died laughing because literally  that   who cast her in this role   the whole movie played in the background while i did everything but watch it sooooo boring and disjointed and boring
Mar 21 2024,negative,the script was terrible it was cringy to watch the villain was mediocre and scenes were followed terribly i feel bad for whoever put money on this movie
Mar 21 2024,negative,this movie is simply trash
Mar 21 2024,neutral,not a bad film i did appreciated marvels bad films because i like watching bad marvel films because to me theyre better than highlygrossed films madame web could use extra homework assignments dakota johnson  sidney sweeney are both horrible actors choice and characters developments dialogue and adr was putting ice on a frier machine at a fast food restaurant the villian wasnt so bad could use some work with his homework assignments overall experience was decent not the best but hey at least marvel tries is best with cg which they did i found that fascinating
Mar 21 2024,positive,i think the movie was good i dont understand the hate towards it
Mar 21 2024,negative,very weird idk so confusing   sometimes it was so bad i just had to skip forward  i didnt even understand the whole plot of the movie nothing really made sense very weird dialogue and bad cgi  but low key entertaining in a funny bad way though
Mar 21 2024,negative,horrible writing and except for madame web the other never get powers so they just run away the whole movie
Mar 21 2024,negative,an hour has passed through the movie the question i ask myself is why do i care about what happens to any of the characters i finished the movie theres no redeeming qualities to the movie i have no one to root for the characters are unlikeable whats the purpose of this movie its not a drama its not a super hero movie picking out a character from the spiderman franchise and adding cheap thrills and boring action sequences does not make a good movie  story 15  purpose of the movie 15
Mar 21 2024,negative,theres better entertainment in learning about actual spiders than watching this movie  a mangled mess of terrible one liners subpar dialogue and a terribly mundane storyline come together to give this one of the worst ratings ive ever given a piece of content    as a movie not worth streaming nor piracy nor the cinema  just about unworthy of anything but oblivion
Mar 21 2024,negative,really bad movie the acting the story its so basic and simple there is nothing impressive in the movie the dialog is repetitive wouldnt recommend it
Mar 20 2024,negative,an absolute car crash of a movie  dialog is not on really badly written but badly delivered by all parties  the bad guy looks like the majority of his lines were dubbed  dakota is just in phone it in mode
Mar 20 2024,negative,this would give b movies a bad name  pretty sure a bunch of 12 year olds could write a better script and produce direct  act it better as well
Mar 20 2024,negative,this movie is so bad in its entirety i was laughing at many of the scenes what a joke
Mar 20 2024,negative,in the final fifteen minutes of the film there is a battle scene that is a little bit lacklustre honestly its a terrible film i am going to save you time her mother was slain by spider powers and she meets three girls who dont show any powers at all during the film in order to avoid dying himself the man who killed her mother returns to kill them then as he sees in his vision he passes away following an hour of disengaged cat and mouse the conclusion  16 individuals
Mar 20 2024,positive,very good movie with amazing characters i dont understand why it was rated so low
Mar 20 2024,negative,utter trash the effects are shabby there is no 2003 emersion the villain only walks menacingly and has auto tune in his voice for 90 of the dialogue and the lead actresss dont fair much better none of them can act the story is held together by chewing gum and chicken wire its awful dont watch it
Mar 20 2024,negative,oh what a tangled web we weave
Mar 20 2024,positive,i think its a great movie 
Mar 20 2024,negative,another day another bad movie the ritm is wrong the character is running in a very static way emergencies are very emotionaly controlled waste of time
Mar 20 2024,positive,not sure what sony was thinking in the terms of creating this movie it had so much potential to kick off a reboot of spider man films all the right actors in such wrong taste the amount of money it probably cost to get every actor to sign on is probably what they should have spent on scene writing and visual effects plot was all over the place if they try to continue any of these stories good luck i would leave this off of dakota johnsons and sydney sweenys imdb page
Mar 20 2024,negative,horrendous flow is off things dont make sense acting is two dimensional and its just dull the director failed epically 
Mar 20 2024,positive,awesome cant wait for part 2
Mar 20 2024,negative,very bad    poorly acted    not funny didnt laugh
Mar 19 2024,negative,hands down one of the worst movies ive ever seen im not even sure why disney even thought it was necessary for this to be made the terrible script poor casting and unenthusiastic acting really sealed the fate of this film the only reason i watched it was hearing that it was so bad that it was almost worth watching it wasnt the fact it was far worse than mobious was almost an achievement in itself
Mar 19 2024,negative,everything about this movie was terrible
Mar 19 2024,negative,dull under acting like everyone was half asleep
Mar 19 2024,negative,too far from being a great comic book movietoo close to be one the worstif not the worstsurely not the monstrosity i was hearing from many reviewers but with many many flawsespecially on the script sidemy godgive me strenght
Mar 19 2024,negative,awful and terrible another random movie made by a character from the spidermans universe sony give up the marvels copyrights and give it back to marvel studios you dont know what you are doing at the beginning the movie is terrible and boring and the rest of the movie is the same as the beginning
Mar 19 2024,negative,despite one of the actresses fuming about people not embracing female led movies as the reason madame web bombed at the box office its much simpler than that  madame web is easily one of the worst superhero genre films ever made    i dont know what sony was thinking in making this horrid movie based on characters no one is really interested in   if youre going to make a movie about irrelevant comic book heroines at least make it different or interesting   look at what james gunn did with the hbo series peacemaker or guardians movies with unknown and irrelevant comic book characters   madame web offered nothing to justify its creation  easily one of the worst movies ive seen in awhile
Mar 19 2024,neutral,madame web isnt as bad as people are making it out to be  at least in terms of the story  to its credit it actually does a really good job of setting up what is conceptually a pretty underwhelming super power  unfortunately its an origin story that teases a bigger story that would have been far better choice  one that we will most likely never see  that closing scene that was the movie that should have been made  that said dakota johnson is lifeless and doesnt seem like she wants anything to do with the proceedings  either that or shes just a terrible actress  my biggest issue with the movie is how stilted everything is  its almost like a foreign film with the way stuff translates on the screen  it didnt help that the villains audio felt out of sync for most of the film  it seemed like an overdub  in the end the generally decent direction fell victim to absolutely horrendous editing
Mar 19 2024,negative,amazing film of the year watch it as soon as you can you wont be disappointed life changing all actors at their peak thought provoking storyline nuff said
Mar 19 2024,negative,first half is a ok movie second half is just terrible bad directing and bad story
Mar 19 2024,negative,if i could give this 05 i would terrible script terrible acting and terrible editing  not one character thats likeable no chemistry between any characters what an insult to a paying audience
Mar 19 2024,negative,im looking forward to watching this movie and when i finally did its boring that i didnt even finished it i love the cast but the story is i cant discribe how poor this is and i dont feel like finishing the movie
Mar 19 2024,negative,madame web is a catastrophic attempt at bringing a beloved marvel character to life on the big screen dakota johnsons portrayal of cassandra webb is like watching a plank of wood attempt to emote not only is she miscast but the lack of emotion and depth is staggering the film completely disregards comic accuracy opting instead for a haphazardly rewritten backstory that leaves fans scratching their heads in disbelief adam scotts performance as ben parker is a lone bright spot in this otherwise dismal production but even his talents cant salvage the sinking ship    the cgi is laughably bad and the decision to dub over almost every line of the villain is painfully obvious ezekiel sims as the antagonist could have been menacing if portrayed by an older actor but the casting choice falls flat the supporting characters are grating the writing is abysmal and the editing is choppy at best the humor falls flat the plot is thinner than tissue paper and the lack of superhero costumes is downright insulting madame web feels like a fanmade film gone horribly wrong and its a wonder how it ever got greenlit by sony and marvel save yourself the agony and skip this disaster of a movie
Mar 19 2024,negative,possibly the worst dialog ever written for any movie in the history of  movies on par with the worst acting in the history of any acting ever acted overall if i could give this movie negative stars i would mornius was better and morbius was hot garbage
Mar 19 2024,negative,at least the movie has the decency to be awful from the very start so you know what youre in for when i say the very start i mean the very first line of dialogue    the writing the acting the camera work the effects its all immediately noticeably bad im suspicious that the positive reviews on this movie are paid for no one could possibly watch this and think it was legitimately good
Mar 19 2024,positive,this truly is an affront to god
Mar 19 2024,positive,good art direction  interesting story  but the bad guy dont afraid some scenes are mediums   another actress could been better 
Mar 19 2024,negative,such a garbage movie
Mar 19 2024,positive,not sure why this has so many bad reviews im not a fan of super hero movies that are all action no storythis was good story with action that wasnt drawn out forever and boring to watch love dakotah johnson as always and everyone else was also great in this movie good story line and yay girl power if youre looking for long fights and car chases maybe this isnt for you
Mar 19 2024,positive,it was good not sure why everyone has such negative reviews sydney sweeney is hot
Mar 19 2024,negative,this was so ridiculously bad 1 born in the amazon with the help of magical spider people 2 runs over evil spider man with a car  twice 3 bad guys lips dont even match his dialogue 4 steals a taxi cab and literally just keeps it nothing else happens its just her taxi now 5 wanted by the police for kidnapping but somehow casually gets on a flight to peru in back 6 awkward baby shower wtf did i watch i loved it 
Mar 19 2024,positive,i feel like the movie was amazing is telling the store of how madame web becomes her i find it intriguing and interesting at the same time  would love to see a sequel to see how the girls develop their powers under madame webs guidance all my friends think it was a great movie is not your typical marvel movie but it was really good i feel like they didnt market the movie right and it was also released around valentines day which can mess with the box office numbers i absolutely recommend this movie
Mar 18 2024,negative,went to friends house and they put it on i managed to sit through it until the end it was the one of the biggest pile of rubbish i have ever seen but i managed to get to the end at which point i felt like i had been violated please dont let anyone make any more movies like this
Mar 18 2024,positive,best movie i have ever watched i love it i want to see its sequel of course im fully satisfied 
Mar 18 2024,positive,absolutely loved it great superhero origin story great story line great acting just absolutely loved this movie
Mar 18 2024,positive,i was a huge fan of this character when i was a little girl and i was fanning so hard in the theater this movie is spot on and really made me super happy i really hope there will be a second one because getting to see them live action really healed my inner child usually when you are a huge fan of something it gets ruined when recreated but not in this movies case i absolutely loved it
Mar 18 2024,negative,madame web was one of the most rushed and badly written movies i have watched the cinematography lighting and music was excellent and thats amongst the only good things in this movie i cant believe some of my favourite actors were convinced to play in this movie the script was terrible and all the emotional moments were just blurted out with barely any emotion we couldnt see any connections forming between madame webb and the three girls the first part of the movie was so rushed it made me physically cringe i am massively disappointed in sj clarkson the director who has directed many great shows but somehow fumbled this one so bad that i consider this a horror movie to all movie fans tahar rahim who played the main antagonist in the movie performed rather horribly for some reason he could not show any emotion during his monologues and every time he appeared on screen i wanted to turn the movie off i didnt have high hopes for this film but i was still disappointed yuck
Mar 18 2024,positive,i love the movie i enjoy it i hope they make another part to madame web best movie ever
Mar 18 2024,negative,the story line is just bad
Mar 18 2024,negative,poor plot bleak characters did not enjoy  all predictable and watch most on fast forward  story line came from a kindergarten brainstorming session    seen all this before too many times  please give us something new
Mar 18 2024,negative,half a star this is a negative 100 stars movie they should refund everyone who watches this god awful film  dull story poor performances cringe dialogs  you can tell this movie was filmed heavily on a green screen and was built in an editing room several times when the director saw this i am sure he died a bit inside please be better
Mar 18 2024,negative,ive seen one full movie bad times at the el royale and 18 minutes of another movie the high note where the cast included dakota johnson in major roles  her performance in  el royale was so bad that the only reason i stuck with the movie was the rest of the cast ending with me enjoying the movie overall  the high note was advertised as a movie about ross character which it was not as johnson was the lead  18 minutes was all i could stand to watch  due to johnsons past performances i did not have high hopes that madame webb would be any good and it wasnt  having a parent as a somewhat successful actor doesnt mean it will translate to the child of said parent being any good at acting
Mar 18 2024,positive,not so rotten as everyone says seen much worse movies than this
Mar 18 2024,negative,i dont know what i just saw
Mar 18 2024,negative,this is like a tv production as worse as captain marvel 2
Mar 18 2024,negative,there are bad movies there are atrocious movies and then theres madame web if theres ever been a cinematic disaster that could make even the hardiest viewer question the existence of good taste this would be it  from the opening scene to the end  this film is a masterclass in how not to make a moviethe plot if one could call it that is a nonsensical mishmash of clich√©s and absurdities characters make decisions so mindbogglingly stupid that youll find yourself screaming at the screen in disbelief the dialogue is riddled with cringeinducing oneliners and attempts at humor that fall flatter than a pancake    even the most dedicated fans of bmovies will struggle to find anything redeeming about this train wreck of a film its not so bad its good its just plain bad save yourself the agony and steer clear of madame web unless you have a masochistic desire to subject yourself to the worst that cinema has to offer
Mar 18 2024,negative,is it possible to give negative stars  anyone saying anything positive about this movie is a liar its trash from start to finish in every possible way  you know i am right stop lying
Mar 18 2024,positive,a little slow at first but did get up to speed
Mar 18 2024,negative,waste of time watching this movie i dont know why it was made
Mar 18 2024,positive,for meit was a bit entertaining a good way  to tell a prequel story and the very origins of one of our favs i ean a spidermans pregnant mom a young uncle ben i liked that maybe it would be better focusing on protect future baby spiderman instead those unknown girls but still quite good
Mar 18 2024,positive,i did like it but more as a funny movie
Mar 18 2024,negative,damn at least with morbius you have matt smiths performance this just has nothing when you take on great responsibility great power will come sounded so bad that it felt like a piece of my love for spiderman died
Mar 18 2024,negative,i had a whole breakdown of this movie in my headbut its just nonsense
Mar 18 2024,negative,i began watching this film with low expectations my expectations were realized this movie is an absolute dud it might destroy the careers of those associated with it
Mar 18 2024,negative,you see the girls being superheroes for ten thats right ten seconds  half a star and thats being generous  discount miguels voice is dubbed and sounds ai generated the lines were cringy the acting was cringy i dont know who thought this was acceptable to put out there but they need to be fired
Mar 18 2024,positive,worth the watch much better than what the critics rated it
Mar 18 2024,negative,stupid movie  everything in this movie doesnt made sense so unrealistic and too many plot holes  like it was made for 8 year olds
Mar 18 2024,negative,forgettable villain and plot action sequences were boring it was fun getting to see a young ben parker and the premonition sequences were a little interesting as well dakota johnson and the 3 other leads try their best with a weak story this movie definitely falls flat and is easily the worst movie out of sonys spidermanless universe
Mar 18 2024,positive,not as bad as people are saying
Mar 18 2024,negative,sony tried to get a group of well known female actresses and thought they could carry this poorly written script think final destination on a low budget
Mar 18 2024,positive,you have the power to watch a movie based on your own decisions  ignore the haters   i enjoyed the movie both my kids enjoyed the movie   we are our own individuals watch a movie if you want to dont let all the needless haters limit your consumption of beautiful art
Mar 17 2024,neutral,let me try to defend  the big problem of the film is the empty script and undeveloped characters and weak dramaturgy  but i think the actors are very good and the idea is not bad if you choose the right audience teens and young adults i think it could work dakota is beautiful
Mar 17 2024,positive,i went in with low expectations having seen the hate for madame web over the past few weeks i liked the film fun story and really likeable characters too reminded me a lot of the feel to the sam raimi spider man films and whilst its not a groundbreaking film it is however a very entertaining couple of hours worth of popcorn fun
Mar 17 2024,negative,this movie stinks
Mar 17 2024,negative,i did not enjoy this
Mar 17 2024,negative,there might be a fun oddly interesting so bad that its good movie with madame web but its marred by so many technical errors and misfires that it makes the film hard to take seriously on any level dakota johnson and sydney sweeney are a strange pairing for a superhero movie setting up further adventures down the line    
Mar 17 2024,positive,the critics are wrong this movie is good
Mar 17 2024,positive,move over morbius its madame webbin time  this absolute cinematic masterpiece showcases the most articulate villain ever to hit the big screen pitched against madame web a super hero who weilds the indomitable power of pepsi i cant wait to see this  expanded into a cinematic universe with jamie dornan returning as main antagonist
Mar 17 2024,positive,its another way to try to tell a spiderman story without spiderman it has some good moments on the movie but mostly not that all i like the conexi√≥n about madame web visions but not the conexi√≥n about the story and characters
Mar 17 2024,positive,it was kinda slow but it made it exciting to see what the future holds for the three younger girls i hope that marvel will try this story again as i think with great writers it could be a hit
Mar 17 2024,positive,i thought madame web really was appositely incredible story of the three young teenage girls finding out of their true selfies as marvels in the hole movie
Mar 17 2024,positive,i liked this movie and thought dakota did good in her part it was a little slow in the very beginning but it was good
Mar 17 2024,positive,i feel like this movie was genuinely good and a very fresh spiderman movie while i will admit this movie has a slow start and a weird pacingtone overall it was a very sweet and enjoyable movie that could have many cameos through the spiderverse in short very nice movie with bad reviews
Mar 17 2024,negative,this movie is terrible very poor quality and very poorly written throw out the person who hired the people who made morbius because they made it even worse the protagonist did not do well he recommends his movie and then says he didnt see it lousy visual effects it seems like its a movie if it ends the villain seems to have had his dialogue superimposed there is no chemistry between the actresses the villain is defeated by a pepsi cola letter a mediocre movie
Mar 17 2024,positive,i went in with low expectations having seen the hate for madame web over the past few weeks i really liked the film fun story well acted and really likeable characters too  reminded me a lot of the feel to the sam raimi spider man films and whilst its not a groundbreaking film it is however a very entertaining couple of hours worth of popcorn fun
Mar 17 2024,positive,i read the reviews and thought id give this a watch to see just how bad it is truth is it isnt there are a lot better superhero movies out there but there a lot worse the marvels and antman and the wasp quantumania being two of them
Mar 17 2024,negative,errrr this film has to be the worse thing ive ever seen
Mar 17 2024,positive,i thought the movie was really gooda very good intro movie for new characters
Mar 17 2024,negative,kind of waste of time if you have nothing better to watch and want to kill some time this is the movie the fight scenes were embarrassing and the final fighting scene was so disappointing acting was below average editing was terrible
Mar 17 2024,negative,that was painful to watch from the opening scene at the ambulance dakota showed absolutely zero emotion in acting well the rest of the cast was also the same the story is somewhere between bad and vary bad the last battle of the movie does not even try to keep you engaged  i watched the movie in hopes that people were overreacting  but nope it is as bad as people say it is
Mar 17 2024,positive,its not as horrible as everyone on the internet says it is the plot was good it wasnt horrible it had good themes it wasnt forced girl power unless you are actually looking for that then yes you can find it but its not as prominent as you would think the actors were good the dialogue wasnt horrible i dont think a sequel should be in discussion though
Mar 17 2024,negative,movie is bad in every way imaginable i was barely able to watch it
Mar 17 2024,negative,uh its not boring i guess    normally i would try to come up with a review or at least share my thoughts but im at a genuine loss for words what the heck sony
Mar 17 2024,positive,the movie kept getting better and better i was so hooked and then in the last 20 minutes it fell off a cliff into cringe abyss the potential was there i mean i cried several times leading up to the cringey finale like i wouldve watched a series of many episodes of how it was building the last scene was horrific writing that didnt make sense
Mar 17 2024,positive,there was a reason this movie was 13 buthear me out yall  let me put something down and if yall can pick it upthis moviecouldlegit get a 47  idk why people arent acting like there isnt structure and a plot the editing and possible every other aspect of this movie was equivalent to a toilet after taco bellbut nonetheless it wasnt a bunch of scenes mashed together  it was a bunch of scenes mashed together with structure   f u dakota johnson sydney sweeney was good but we all know ur not young enough to keep playing teenagers  ur pushing 30 bbg
Mar 17 2024,positive,great movie good character development and storyline definitely a fan i hate they didnt do so well in theaters as i fear they may not make a madame web 2
Mar 17 2024,negative,i normally am pretty forgiving of super hero movies but this ones story line was dysfunctional the way the three girls were portrayed was irritating and disingenious of how girls that age really behave ie it was contrived dakotas parts were good when she was not with the girls and her back story was well done too but her trip to peru was so quick as to have almost no need in the story line yes she learned stuff but there was no coming to grips with her abilities as in how to use them finally the last ten minutes so much happened as to make the movie seem squeezed i cant say much more about it without spoiling it     perhaps if the movie had a longer running time they could have developed peru the girls and fleshed out the ending better
Mar 17 2024,negative,worst movie i have seen in a while really hope they dont make another one i cant believe this made it to theaters it just goes to show you that it is ultimately the wealthiest studios control what we see in theaters i
Mar 17 2024,negative,i was expecting more acting was mediocre at best
Mar 17 2024,positive,i loved the movie it was fast paced it has action suspense and kept me on the edge of my seat i never thought dakota johnson could pull off a movie like this one but she was fantastic she was believable and likeable the movie has been panned by critics and audiences alike and i just dont understand why its really a shame that the movie didnt fare better at the box office i want to see the rest of the story and because of the financials there probably wont be a sequel do yourself a favor ignore the critics and watch it for yourself i bet youll enjoy it too
Mar 17 2024,positive,its really not that bad  i think script and the way they wrote some characters make is corny but i would watch again
Mar 17 2024,positive,this was not the movie the trailer sent to the audience to sell tickets for if they would have hid the spidergirl characters from the trailer i firmly believe that there would have been a noway home kind of vibe and would have had more of a chance to almost guarantee a sequel madame web is an origin story and i think the folks that hated it were misled by the trailer it was a good origin story that could have had some legs if it wasnt ravaged by bad reviews i personally liked it as well as my son its worth the time to watch it and come up with your own review never trust any reviews until you have seen the movie yourself i think this one was an underrated underdog movie and deserves an honest review hopefully my review gives that type of credit i personally hope that there is a bigger story to the madame web franchise or integrated into sony future marvel character movies because the madam web story has more to offer 
Mar 17 2024,positive,madame web offers an original take on superhero movies that strays from the same tired recipe weve all seen a million times shoot punch joke and punch some more the female protagonists make you like them and care and the origin story and superhero ability of cassie is refreshingly different with endless possibilities for the future it seems that critics and audience alike are unable to see beyond their preconditioned prejudices of what a good superhero movie should be and said prejudice limits their mental capacity and artistic imagination to perceive the power of the minds potential over stupids jetlagged physicality this is ironically the actual point of the plot and the downfall of the villain whom reviewers so adamantly criticize as bland not realizing they are one in the same open your mind see the web and if you cant see it think more deeply before speaking or at least ask somebody who hasnt been plucked from the masses
Mar 17 2024,negative,was this a b movie or a c movie oof this was trash skip skip
Mar 17 2024,positive,just eh i believe this movie was ruined on the editing floor
Mar 17 2024,negative,ooof plot holes bad acting and terrible screenplay  that no amount of web could save dont waste your time
Mar 17 2024,negative,the movie is trippy its lame its not the worst movie ever or marvel movie but we all saw it coming from miles away that it would flop but it had a good cast and it was ok
Mar 17 2024,negative,madame web was meh this is way worst then i thought this is the worst thing that sony pictures has ever done to the spiderman lore i really like dakota johnson however all those other actresses deserve better then this i enjoyed both venom movies then those pieces of  the script the dialogue music score etc everything about this movie is awful and boring its unwatchable nothing exciting or thrilling about it sony should cancel making spinoffs if theres no spiderman appearing anywhere whats the point of it  sony should  this is a biggest mistake theyve ever done   makeraimispiderman4  maketasm3
Mar 17 2024,negative,embarrasingly stupid
Mar 17 2024,negative,please dont waste your time on this one i tend to ignore the haters but this time theyre on the money the dialog absolutely horrible the portrayal of the villain was simply awkward the story is confusing too much explication of the wrong things the origin story is shown twice and yet theres no clues for how the girls get their powers in the future shown in redundant clips i will say that the main actors dakota johnson and the three girls did an amazing job with what they had to work with zero
Mar 17 2024,negative,i thought spiderman far from home was the weakest of them all but oh how i was wrong this is the worst spiderman movie ive ever seen in my entire life the characters were just cringe the story was so unpredictable and its just so slow paste i will never watch this movie ever again
Mar 17 2024,positive,this is the greatest web genre of movie i have ever seen i especially enjoyed when she announced she was madame web and webbed all over everyone my personal favourite actor in the film was john cena his webbed based performance was unparalleled i have watched this film 642 times already this week its amazing
Mar 17 2024,negative,the main characters acting was forgettable and the scenes and cgi seemed rushed and not well thought out
Mar 17 2024,negative,just stop with marvel movies they are just awful now especially the converse
Mar 17 2024,negative,the reason for a 2 star review is that the story was very confusing and badly written the main character cassie had the first 41 minutes of back story ezekiel 5 minutes beginning of movie 3 girls we dont know much about yet they are supporting actresses the way the movie ends leaves many questions without answers to me this full movie is just a back story so there can be a sequel also it would of been better for it to be a tv show introducing characters and then a movie
Mar 16 2024,positive,i was very spectacle about this movie considering the previews spiderrelated movies were pretty bad venom venom 2 no way home across the spiderverse but i was surprisingly fun and entertaining definitely their best installment in spiderrelated media
Mar 16 2024,negative,this movie is so bad that i created a rotten tomato account to tell you about it   superhero movies can defy logic  but throwing basic story telling and common sense or the window can ruin them and madame web or whatever screwed the pooch on all fronts  15 min a dump truck slams into an ambulance at 60mph or so  seconds later an arial shot shows that it was about 20ft away from driving into a river  later  the garbage main character has a vision of walking to a diner beating the villan by a good minute  she snaps out of it and drives her car at 60ish making it there after he arrives by the way  all this time  3 girls are dancing on a table at said diner and no employee screams at them to get the eff down  madame web also never gets pulled over  driving said car around nyc for a day with no plates because she pried them off with a crow bar which is totally something you can do     outside of all that  the dialog is flat and bad  the acting is dry and boring  the character devdevelopment is nonexistent and calling the plot empty would be generous
Mar 16 2024,negative,i have no idea how someone actually thought this was material worthy of making people spend their money and time to watch it it is a strong contender to worst superhero movie ever
Mar 16 2024,negative,sometimes a movie is so badly reviewed you can come into with low expectations and get some enjoyment out of itthis is not one of those movies  wow  script writer director producer casting agentshould never be allowed on another movie set again  i could not make it thru this movie  lead actress was horribly miscast for this role  this movie was so bad does not matter who the lead actress as  i hope dakota johnson fired everyone that did not stop her from doing this movie   if the razzies have a hall of fame everyone involved with this movie should be inducted
Mar 16 2024,positive,i think part 2 is required because i really want to know the stolen spiders and the girls future but it was the best
Mar 16 2024,positive,im looking forward to future movies maybe one where they meet peter parker or venom
Mar 16 2024,negative,the movie idea and story is not bad  but the weakness in acting and directing mmmm sorry to see the most experienced actor adam scott do not play a main character while the others are acting like school theater  not worth it to go for cinema for it  it should be tv movie not big screen
Mar 16 2024,negative,how can you make such a bad movie with so much ressources
Mar 16 2024,negative,they shouldnt show that movie it was efen disturbing cant imagine trauma people who took their kids to watch it in the cinemas if it even airs in cinemas that i doubt
Mar 16 2024,positive,i loved this movie  i dont get all of the negative press  it was a good move well cast and well acted  the storyline was good and well written  good to see strong female characters for a change i streamed it but would have gladly paid the movie rate had i known it would be so good
Mar 16 2024,negative,boring plot only wanted to see 3 spiderwoman and it gave me cliffhanger
Mar 16 2024,negative,complete rubbish utterly garbage a waste of time
Mar 16 2024,positive,the film isnt the worst thing in the world on the contrary if you watch it without being based on the comics its a super cool film
Mar 16 2024,negative,this is by far one of the worst movies ever made please watch it cause it is such a beautiful train wreck with every scene being horrible every single person involved with this movie gave the absolute worst they could possible give to a project
Mar 16 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie the cast is great especially dakota johnson i think people go into movies with this preconceived notion a movie has to be or go a certain way its a story for a reason i think if you go into it thinking wow this is a story that someone created to be its own ideas from comics yes but doesnt have to be exactly the same dakota said the original script is what made her sign on but things change and i dont think it is a bad horrible movie i think critics made everyone else hate it and put it in their heads before they went into it
Mar 16 2024,negative,the negative reviews for madame web are completely justified there simply isnt any redeeming qualities here the film drowns in generic plotlines and fails to capture the intrigue of its source material the clunky dialogue with an overreliance on exposition dumps feels so dumbed down yet nonsensical its a tangled mess that swings and misses on every level
Mar 16 2024,negative,this is one of the worst films i have ever seen terrible casting writing acting directing and cgi everything about this film should not have been done
Mar 16 2024,positive,i sat bored for most of the start it would ramp up then flatten out however there was a twist in the movie i never saw until i read the credits and saw the last name for ben it was more enjoyable than most people say but not by much
Mar 16 2024,negative,40 minutes in and main character has done nothing and just believes shes crazy with the slowest reaction  thank god im streaming it not even sure i want to finish
Mar 16 2024,positive,entertaining i liked the progression of the relationships between the characters sad that people didnt like it i would like to see the marvel universe expand in this direction
Mar 16 2024,negative,a feverish nightmare where just when you think youre about to wake up madame web drags you back into her lair of poor filmmaking lazy writing and questionable acting
Mar 16 2024,positive,i like it its not a marvel super production but it still a good movie
Mar 16 2024,positive,i dont understand the mainstream intense dislike of this movie i think its a very good setup for things to come spoiler alert incoming since i believe most have seen this movie by now i suppose a lot of folks may have felt tricked by the trailer because it seems like a superhero movie but the superhero element is grounded a little too grounded the action is there but you think youre going to see 3 kickbutt spidergirls and youre really not the entire movie is spent on cassies fleshing out her powers and saving 3 girls from almost certain death at the hands of a villain intent on preventing his own death at their hands all this analysis of how predictable it is well yeah most superhero movies are there are a few lines i think the movie could have gone without but it is what it is i hope that the bad reception doesnt stop what could or can be great sequels or movies with these characters in them later on
Mar 16 2024,positive,ok just saw this in my own personal opinion while this may not be a groundbreaking marvel production it certainly isnt as bad as most critics made it out to be i personally think this is even slightly better than morbius perhaps i didnt have any expectations about the movie before going in and just let it entertain me which it did
Mar 16 2024,negative,i never thought writing and a script could be this bad from madame web dropping into pero where she magically came up on the same exact spot where mom died but when you see a a 2000 skyrocket blow a giant hole in brick wall to make their escape is beyond bad its movie trash i feel bad sony went this low and actually let this not escape the trash can a horrible water of money and digital storage they had to do the bless you at the end just for bad measure of course lets not let pass the underwater skyrockets too the fire is so pretty under water moving so fast funny i never saw skyrockets get oxygen underwater to keep flying like torpedoes the absolute worst
Mar 16 2024,negative,once in a generation of spiders a movie will come along that is somehow better than morbius this is not that movie this movie is so great that it is not made for you  who ever you are and what ever you like  it will subvert your expectations and leave your feeling alone and confused     ps can someone please explain thy the sweeney girl is promoted as hot
Mar 16 2024,positive,id love to go into detail about the movie but i cant get over how good of a role sydney sweeney played if only she was the only character this movie might have been better  nevertheless watching sydney sweeney take down villains in her fresh superhero suit was amazing will 100 be watching the second one
Mar 16 2024,positive,wow sydney sweeney was so attractive cant wait to see the second movie clean up aisle my brain it feels violently thrashed and pissed on would be better if it followed a well written plot or had better script writing or if sony when making it put and comprehensive amount of brain power into it felt like a weird acid trip 1010 make the next budget doubled
Mar 16 2024,positive,its honestly good expected alot worse tbh
Mar 16 2024,positive,i dont understand all the awful reviews for this movie  when this movie came out on ppv i did not think twice about buying the movie and i am glad i did  madame web surpassed all my expectations   it is one of those rare superhero movie where it is not plagued with ridiculous jokes in the contrary its a serious superhero movie
Mar 16 2024,negative,the acting was wooden which is usually a sign of bad direction  the story also meandered  ive seen plenty of bad super hero movies but this one commits the cardinal sin of being boring as well
Mar 16 2024,positive,it was more enjoyable than the critics say but go into it with low expectations
Mar 16 2024,positive,it wasnt a bad movie but it wasnt a good movie either i think they could have made the story a little bettter but i actually enjoyed it i wasnt bored i just think some plot holes could have been fixed and would love to have seen more action
Mar 16 2024,negative,another epic failure from disney the scrip was terrible the direction was worst and the writting sooooo corny and predictable the actreses were mediocre to say the least i dont care about any of them it takes almost 80 of the movie before anything of consequence or interesting happens and the bad guy what a horrible actor how is it that the villan can jump down 20 stories and land on his feet and at the end he is defeated by falling from a 2 story building tand the factory is shooting firworks that can destroy wall and concrete floors but its supposed to be an explosives factory that shoots rockets like flares leave it to disney to destroy a franchise
Mar 16 2024,positive,madame web is a decent watch it has some entertaining moments and a few good performances but overall it falls a bit flat the plot feels predictable and the pacing could have been tighter however if youre looking for a casual movie night option it might suffice
Mar 16 2024,negative,i wish i could vote minus 9 9 so bad that movie is  for a moment i would like to see the bad guy killing the 3 girls soon so the movie would end thank god i didnt went the theater to watch this would a be wast of my money
Mar 16 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie dakota was lack luster but the supporting cast really brought it a little all over the place but the music was fire lol i think if we removed madam web from the follow up movie the girls will carry this saga
Mar 16 2024,negative,awful movie dont waste your time
Mar 16 2024,positive,hope there is a sequel
Mar 15 2024,positive,its a decent superhero action movie really dont deserve the hate
Mar 15 2024,positive,this movie was definitely not the best ive seen not even in my top 20 but i dont understand why its getting so much hate     firstly sure its writing isnt the best but it is entertaining and kept me watching despite not being your typical superhero movie    secondly the movie was heartwarming i liked it quite a lot the relationship between cassie and the girls made me happy as none of the girls really had a mother figure
Mar 15 2024,negative,they misunderstood their source material sony should sell their rights of spiderman before they distort any more stories from the spiderverse
Mar 15 2024,neutral,decent performances great visuals predictable storyline almost entertaining
Mar 15 2024,negative,waste of money what is going on with all this movies that are rotten
Mar 15 2024,negative,the actresses really tried but everything was really bad this was worse then morbius  i would be happy to rewatch morbius 5 times instead watching a minute of madam web
Mar 15 2024,negative,madam web is a film that falls short of expectations delivering a lackluster and sleepinducing experience with a poorly executed storyline it fails to captivate audiences from start to finish    the screenplay feels hastily put together lacking depth and coherence character development is virtually nonexistent leaving viewers disconnected from the protagonists struggles and motivations as a result its challenging to invest emotionally in the narrative leading to a disengaged viewing experience    one of the major drawbacks of madam web is its pacing the film moves at a sluggish pace with scenes dragging on without purpose or intrigue this sluggishness contributes to the overall sense of boredom and apathy that permeates the viewing experience    despite attempts to inject excitement with action sequences they feel forced and formulaic failing to provide any genuine thrills or suspense even the most visually stunning moments are unable to compensate for the lack of substance in the storytelling    in addition to its narrative shortcomings madam web suffers from uninspired direction and lackluster performances the cast struggles to breathe life into their characters delivering wooden and unconvincing portrayals that further detract from the films appeal    overall madam web is a forgettable cinematic endeavor that fails to leave a lasting impression with its lack of originality poor execution and tedious pacing its a film best avoided by discerning viewers seeking a compelling and engaging cinematic experience
Mar 15 2024,positive,it is good for a family movie but definitely not a marvel hardcore fans fantasy i had so many expectations and it didnt even meet halfwaynot a single scene that got me excited literally a movie for children who are 14 if your an adult and you enjoyed this movie i pray for your change of taste  not to mention the absence of post credit preview
Mar 15 2024,negative,possibly the worst marvel movie so far didnt really get the message from the movie  dakota johnson did a great job but thats it
Mar 15 2024,negative,horrible wht is wrong with u who made this horrible disgusting movie
Mar 15 2024,positive,this movie was incredible me and my cousin absolutely loved watching this so fun 
Mar 15 2024,positive,here is my own opinion if you have other opinions i respect it this movie was actually good there was a lot of positive themes like teamwork but also in the beginning there was like an equalizer kind of for people who didnt like it i still respect the opinion but this movie was good
Mar 14 2024,negative,it was definitely a waste of my hard earn money and time sony needs to stop creating films without spiderman in it
Mar 14 2024,positive,this was an entertaining movie it seemed like a live action comic book story some dialogue was a little hokey but so are comic books 
Mar 14 2024,negative,sony sony and more sony please stop of make a spiderman universe without spiderman you ruined my life sony no sony
Mar 14 2024,positive,easily the worst movie i have ever seen my bf took me for a first date would have walked out after the first 10 minutes if it werent for him we couldnt think of a worse movie
Mar 14 2024,negative,the special effects were good but the acting was bad for me i couldnt see their adrenaline for people who are supposed to fight or in do or die situations the acting was not at all believable it was so relaxed the plot could have been done so much better but instead it was rushed and the way the scenes were weaved was like cutandpaste no smooth transitions to be honest i fell asleep for a few minutes at a time
Mar 14 2024,positive,i was hesitant about seeing this movie after reading the critics but i like to see most of the marvel movies  i thought it was great entertaining and i liked that it had a plot i could follow along on for a change  i through dakota has gotten a bad rap  her acting was very good playing just a normal person who discovers she has powers  it was a learning curve that was fun to watch with the effects  many of the effects were different in this movie probably that is why everyone is criticizing the movie but who wants to watch the same marvel movie every time  and i enjoyed that the character was like a mother protector for the three girls  go see it and keep an open mind  it was good
Mar 14 2024,negative,unfortunately this was a major disappointment ugh where to begin so much was just awful the casting the characters were flat the plot was meh the tropes were so overdone very overt product placement cheesy cringe nothing was enjoyable at all total waste of my money
Mar 14 2024,negative,waste of time dont watch this movie
Mar 14 2024,positive,amazing movie im a long time spiderman fan and i remember her character from the comics and cartoon they did a really good job showing her origin story and dakota johnson performed amazingly     i hope they continue her story showing her guiding tom hollands toby maguires and andrew garfields spiderman set after their last movies since as we know she can travel timelines and the multiverse it would be cool to see her correct the timelines to keep them as they should be so the world remains safe as she knows everything that has is and will happen
Mar 13 2024,negative,madame web is an utterly unnecessary superhero film based on a farly obscure character in the spiderman universe    it joins the growing niche of spiderman movies without spiderman produced by columbia pictures which includes 2018s venom 2023s morbius and the asyet unreleased kraven    madame web is a watchable bad movie dakota johnson plays cassie webb an nyc paramedic who is ambivalent and coldly detached from her profession of saving lives she hasnt yet learned that with great power comes great responsibility    an accident knocks her into the east river which somehow triggers a penchant for  clairvoyance clearly this isnt the best origin story in the annals of marvel comics or movies    the story picks up with cassie on a commuter train and envisioning an assassin killing 3 young ladies and right on cue there are the 3 girls and the baddie is in the next train car ruhroh    much of the film is cassie playing mother hen to the trio played by sidney sweeney isabel merced and celeste oconnor we glean that the 3 are prospective heroes in waiting if this franchise can get off the ground    the film never takes off and were left wondering who thought it was a good idea to attempt a standalone film with madame web    i did appreciate some onlocation scenes shot  in new york city including some face time for my favorite hoods in queens astoria and long island city    during the promotional tour for madame web dakota johnson freely admitted that she hasnt watched the film and has no plans to so even madame web isnt a fan of madame web dont bank on a sequel
Mar 13 2024,positive,great story with a new take on the spiderverse
Mar 13 2024,positive,i would recommend it i was surprised that there was no post credit scene
Mar 13 2024,positive,this was peak cinema i loved the ending     my favorite part is when it ended
Mar 13 2024,negative,very silly and rubbish storyline very bad script and very bad acting  15 is still too high absolutely awful   
Mar 13 2024,positive,god this movie sucks
Mar 13 2024,negative,the worst ssu movie is not worth the money for the movie
Mar 12 2024,negative,this really shows on how sony just rushes their movies why cant they just leave their creatives alone and let them do their thing so they can create a masterpiece like spider verse
Mar 12 2024,negative,bad movie yeah i watched penguinz0s review so i pretty much got the whole movie in under 16 minutes
Mar 12 2024,positive,madam web is  amazing marvel movie it was very entertaining
Mar 12 2024,negative,worst movie ever    editing was terrible story is irrelevant and they keep trying to use spiderman references to grab the audiences attention but are made more to feel as a joke
Mar 12 2024,neutral,wellthe movie doesnt sit well with me the audio that doesnt match the lips or the fact how they force the accident to make madame web blind the movie feels dragging
Mar 12 2024,positive,the suspense was there throughout the movie    the acting was believable  the cgi was tremendous
Mar 12 2024,negative,that wasa trip not a good one at all if you know the meme of the fake cat sitting on a block with its hands out like its trying to say what the hell that was me during the entire movie everything sort of just came out of nowhere despite being given context it jumped from vision back to reality so much that it was horrendously confusing the ending was awful and i think thats the only way i can describe it
Mar 11 2024,negative,i believe this movie is a great candidate for future midnight showings in the vein of the room bad script wooden acting and awful plot mechanics all make for a possible cult classic its amazing that this got greenlite spoiler alert they had a newspaper show a frontpage story only 3 hours later after the incident happen midday  a character traveled out the country as a wanted person post 911 ridiculous a bright spot is dakota johnson being a good sport in the media definitely  watch on streaming if you like bad fun movies
Mar 11 2024,positive,the pacing was slow  plodding nothing to get excited about  no thrills
Mar 11 2024,negative,horrible superhero movie
Mar 11 2024,negative,its been a really long time since ive seen something so so soooo stupid my god kill me now
Mar 11 2024,negative,this film is an example of just because you have an idea doesnt mean it will work the characters are irrelevant nothing about the setting or editing makes sense the cast is wasted on every level or completely out of their element simply put nothing about this movie works as it should
Mar 11 2024,positive,i dont understand why this movie got so much hate it is just as good as any other superhero movie i mean yeah its not as epic as seeing every marvel superhero band together to defeat thanos but it tells a decent story with decent acting i was never bored and thought the mainly female cast worked well together i would watch it again and would even watch a sequel
Mar 11 2024,negative,morbius writers strike again
Mar 10 2024,negative,this was awful but almost to the point it was entertaining i have no idea why dakota johnson gets these roles she is absolutely terrible in everything shes ever been in
Mar 10 2024,negative,pe      totaly lost of my time wish i havent seen it
Mar 10 2024,positive,loved ready for the series
Mar 10 2024,positive,oh yes the dark knight really do be goodest film especially harrison fords gripping performance as shaquille oteal        
Mar 10 2024,positive,the biggest reason i loved it was because whenever she would see into the future thats exactly how i felt when i took acid like i would see into tha future exactly how tha movie presents it masterpiece 
Mar 9 2024,negative,great actors best 30 bucks i spent
Mar 9 2024,positive,3155 the two best things going for the film is that it delves into ones personal journey more and is defined by sincerity  also its better than people say  the final two scenes could have been stronger however
Mar 9 2024,negative,it was horrible i didnt really enjoy it people were right about how this movie sucks not a lot of action except the three girls running away from the villain when the the movie was over a lot of people were booing and threw stuff at the screen
Mar 9 2024,neutral,if it wasnt for the 4dx seats id have been fast asleep  the type of superhero movie they used to make in the 80s and 90s and that isnt a compliment
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was awesome and a definite must see
Mar 9 2024,positive,honestly a fantastic spideruniverse movie  possibly my favorite liveaction one since the tobey maguire trilogy back in the 00s i know its doing badly at the box office but i think this may be a case of a hidden gem that gets fondly remembered later the vibe reminded of terminator 2 and was more of a deadly chase movie than a standard superhero film its also a movie that will have much more to offer to hardcore than casual spidey fans theres so many allusions to cool stuff in the comic lore here that arent necessary to understand the movie but make it so much better if you do    dont believe the lousy ticket receipts  this one is worth your time and was extremely fun
Mar 9 2024,positive,not as action packed as most marvel based movies but still entertaining there were definitely some plot holes and an uninspiring villain but at least it was more original than some recent offerings as a standalone movie with no knowledge of the character portrayed in comics it stands up ok on its own as a decent but not great movie
Mar 8 2024,positive,high energy with lots of suspense the movie includes warm and fluffy moments
Mar 8 2024,negative,michael over here who rated this trash movie 5 stars obviously needs to get his head fixed
Mar 8 2024,positive,idk what yall talkn bout  my fam  i liked it
Mar 8 2024,positive,it was a great movie of female heroins in  this origin story the villain didnt scare me or bring anything to the storyline to make me believe he was who he was couldve replaced him the girls were awesome and it was a family friendly movie too
Mar 8 2024,positive,ive never watched a better film the action is so good
Mar 8 2024,positive,expansion in the marvel universe
Mar 8 2024,positive,the villain could of been better and i wish the girls would have got their powers in the movie but overall not terrible
Mar 8 2024,negative,this movie sucked so much it hurt my tum tum
Mar 8 2024,negative,there are elements of a good film here but theyre watered down by poor performances terrible writing and a runtime that only seems to grow longer as more time passes at most its amusingly awful
Mar 8 2024,positive,the movie was entertaining somewhat
Mar 7 2024,negative,oof this stinker was more rotten than usual
Mar 7 2024,negative,incoming hordes of reviews of people saying it was fun
Mar 7 2024,positive,pepsi sign and fireworks
Mar 7 2024,positive,its like a parody of spiderman its not bad for pasting time but not suggest to watch if youre a person which likes new themes
Mar 7 2024,negative,if there was ever a movie that defined so bad its good this would be it
Mar 7 2024,positive,it had great cgi great art great actors great background great starting but poor narration
Mar 7 2024,positive,its really not as bad as the reviews are saying the villain is completely 2d but otherwise its a solid origin and a little different its smaller than most super hero movies and didnt feature a finale fight in the sky which i was so grateful for   i wondered why emma roberts was in this in such a seemingly giveaway role and then it all fit together in the end     i dont think itll happen but this one did all the heavier backstory origin stuff im super curious for what the next one would be
Mar 7 2024,positive,despite the poor reviews was pleasantly surprised gripping and well made movie with some fan favourite actors definitely worth giving it a shot
Mar 7 2024,negative,the film was just awful the plot has more holes then swiss cheese     if you have a medical background dont watch this the inaccuracies of the paramedics during the scenes will make your blood boil for example doing cpr on someone with no aed attached without exposing their chest and then being called by their supervisor to leave the person and help them with something else which is miraculously the time the supposed dead person starts breathing and trying to sit up in fact cpr was done on so many people in the film without the correct equipment or techniques being followed     the characters dont seem to be gelled and appear believable the lines wooden the jokes or presumed to be stale     even the cinematic experience what marvel are known for is missing it doesnt have the flair and skill of other universe films
Mar 7 2024,positive,so so is more or less good story but id bad set it and the wrong statement about the responsibility and power put it down the script
Mar 7 2024,negative,absolutely garbage the dialogue is pathetic the attempts at acting are as lame stilted and boring as a high school film production where nobody in it actually cares to try to act if you watch this train wreck and think it was acceptable then you must be an ignorant child
Mar 7 2024,positive,my bsf and i watched this movie the other day and i dont understand the hate we loved it right away this was such a fun chick flick i know its not marketed as one but come on everything about this screams camp obviously you would hate it if youre expecting a blockbuster marvelsony universe movie which spoiler alert it isnt  you have to go in with the right mindset   i can see myself unironically rewatching it from time to time as a feelgood kinda movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,way better than i expected the cast have great screen presence and i didnt think many of the negative aspects detracted too much from what made the movie interesting  loved a lot of the first responder humor    go learn and practice cpr it could save the life of someone you love
Mar 7 2024,negative,ever wonder how to make a film worse than morbius this is how
Mar 7 2024,positive,610 61100  first half is definitely better than the last half it just falls short as if the writers quit and ai took over they sped up too quick too especially during the 3rd act
Mar 7 2024,positive,i dont understand the hate this movie is receiving i thought it was very good and entertaining good acting and never once did i look at my phone to check the time to see when it would be over was it a huge blockbuster no but i personally dont think any marvel ones are entertaining and worth a watch in my opinion
Mar 6 2024,positive,way better than critics said
Mar 6 2024,negative,i want my money back that was just terrible i cant believe they messed up something which could have been great
Mar 6 2024,negative,complete garbage shame on you marvel
Mar 6 2024,positive,i was told there were a lot of negative reviews for this film so i went in with low expectations i was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it was thoughtfully made plot good characters played by talented actors well timed comical quips touching scenes as a marvel fan i thought it was refreshing to take a step out of the crazy multiverse drama to have a for now standalone movie with new characters i do hope they make a second one and i hope the story and characters get better from here
Mar 6 2024,positive,it was ok  i wouldnt recommend it but at least it had a plot to it
Mar 6 2024,positive,definitely not a 1 star
Mar 6 2024,negative,it was terrible and boring
Mar 6 2024,positive,madame webb is a film which enthrals you from minute one to the last with its captivating script and storyline the scenes were picturesque and captured with pure quality and i think all of the actors predominately dakota johnson aced her role of playing cassandra webb showing that she belongs in the marvel universe the actors all gel nicely together which makes the film free flowing and easy to get gripped by it the way they implemented  flashbacks also to give us an insight on ezekiel and cassandras moms past and what occurred helped me obtain a deeper understanding on why things were occurring in the movie and it illuminated the storyline more overall madame webb achieves high praise myself and i would definitely recommend
Mar 6 2024,negative,nah thats my take half a star for attempting an origin story thats heavily needed for the spiderverse half a star for someone involving mike epps in a superhero movie idk how they gave the biggest name in the movie the smallest role and half a star for luring me in to watching this and wasting 116 minutes of my life bravo from becoming to finish i tried to get into it i really did i honestly think this is the worst marvel movie of all time even worse than the first hulk movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,madame web offers a captivating cinematic experience anchored by dakota johnsons remarkable portrayal of the titular character johnsons performance shines throughout the film showcasing her depth and range as an actress while the story may feel somewhat weak at times requiring a bit more mental stretching from the audience it nevertheless succeeds in captivating and engaging viewers the side actors complement johnsons performance with their own strong portrayals adding depth and richness to the narrative despite its shortcomings madame web ultimately delivers an entertaining and memorable moviegoing experience
Mar 6 2024,positive,i watched it in cinema and loved it i get its not everyones cup of tea but for me a female protagonist spider man movie was awesome  dakota played her part very well and held my adhd attention throughout the entire movie  i think there is potential for a sequel would love to see what the girls get up to as adults
Mar 6 2024,negative,i would rate this a 0 but thats impossible so i give you a one
Mar 6 2024,negative,this movie was so bad it was painful to watch i actually feel bad for the actress in this movie because i do not know if they will ever get work after this movie
Mar 6 2024,negative,i would rather watch a 2 hour pepsi commercialchris sturniolo would love this movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie feels like a prank someone played on dakota johnson 1010 no notes
Mar 6 2024,positive,not bad at all  based on what i heard i thought it was going to be horrible and it wasnt  its worth watching in theaters
Mar 6 2024,positive,dakota johnson was perfect as madame web
Mar 6 2024,positive,loved it  just what i needed a fun movie with a twist
Mar 6 2024,positive,i gave this 5 star because i think it was a good movie i enjoyed it people kept going on about this movie being a spiderverse without spider man well people spiderman was just being born at the very end of this movie hes still an infant he cant be spiderman yet this movie is just the begging to where well see spiderman through madame web which will be on the next seque
Mar 5 2024,negative,sony why you make a spiderman universe without spiderman this movie is trash like morbius and i dont got hope in the next movies of this universe conclusion trash
Mar 5 2024,positive,if youre expecting a fullon marvel action movie you may be disappointed however great story well done and very enjoyable
Mar 5 2024,positive,im actually surprised at the low critics rating of this film because i was pretty entertained sure there were some eyerolls at the heavyhandedness with which the 3 girls were portrayed and much of the story was predictable but at the end of the day its a superhero movie its not shakespeare nor does it pretend to be but it was entertaining and cinematically gorgeous id see it again
Mar 5 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie setting up for future story lines
Mar 5 2024,negative,if you are into cringe girl boss types of film this is for you
Mar 5 2024,positive,this is a great family movie for families with preteens and older it has action and a great plot made a great date night movie
Mar 5 2024,negative,madame web brings a strong cast that work with a little as they focus more on the cinematography as its beautiful dont get me wrong but it focuses too much of being a spiderman than a madame web film and you dont see much of the power abilities which was very frustrating and also same with the superhero costumes as it was less than 5 minutes
Mar 5 2024,positive,i dont understand fans hatred towards female led films was there some plot holes yes but i found the film enjoyable to watch its not the best superhero film but it doesnt deserve the hate
Mar 5 2024,negative,this movie was so awful that i legitimately considered walking out of the theater alas i stuck it out and the movie played out exactly as expected acting was terrible almost no action scenes and very confusing plot and progression hilariously bad voiceovers i thought my ears were playing tricks on me because i thought that there was no way a big time movie studio would just let their product reach theaters in that condition the writers clearly intended this movie for 2yearolds considering how much they spoon feed you everything this makes morbius look like a mustsee
Mar 5 2024,negative,what a piece of garbage the end
Mar 5 2024,negative,i dont even want to give it half star
Mar 5 2024,negative,at this point sony should give up the spiderman rights after venom 3
Mar 5 2024,negative,0 star option should specifically made for this movie
Mar 5 2024,neutral,the movie was entertaining however some scenes were not realistic like stealing the ambulance and no police pursuing leaving the girls in the woods and thinking they would be there when night falls
Mar 4 2024,negative,didnt see it but its worse than morbius
Mar 4 2024,neutral,i did not have high hopes and somehow it still disappointed me
Mar 4 2024,negative,the villain sounds like somebody who is from the 18th century
Mar 4 2024,negative,it wasnt written well and the acting did not feel natural
Mar 4 2024,positive,dakota johnson can do no wrong to me
Mar 4 2024,neutral,the truth is that the movie was quite good i can understand why people criticized it harshly because while you are watching it what happens with its dejavu scenes and so on makes the movie very confusing and half angry with what is happening because imagine being are you the one who tries to capture the dejavu effect for an audience and doesnt know how to do it i suppose this was the premise for making the movie and its great appeal these things are not new in other marvel movies you can see these effects of how do we show this to the viewer and boom they make a great movie for you however i think that for the brain in general it was not very nice since it made us feel like fools when watching it for not understanding what is happening and when repeating scenes it became so repetitive and monotonous that i did not like it in general thats why the bad reviews but after finishing watching the movie if you start to reflect on everything you saw you understand that everything made a lot of sense the truth is that it was not an ultra movie like all the other marvel movies  but it worked out it worked out quite well for what it was it wont be one of the best but its easily close to a 710 to watch it once with popcorn and leave it there as a source film i hope they use the characters again in the future 
Mar 4 2024,negative,i have never seen a worse movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,a great show i enjoyed it more than expected a new twist on the usual spider man movies
Mar 4 2024,negative,madame web is a wasted potential with horrible acting dialogue editing cinematography and set up it fails to bring a great spiderman spin off movie that this makes morbius a masterpiece
Mar 4 2024,positive,i love it people just hate this movie  maybe because of the villain and some graphics
Mar 4 2024,positive,madame web is one of the best moviesive seen in 2024 the trailer surely doesnt do the movie justice as it is a bit confusing but the movies introduction explains everything the trailer for the movie doesntwho the spiderman like person is what is his motives who are the girls etc i feel like at some points in the movie it is hard to follow along with what cassandras visions are depicting it is not a big enough issue for the movie to avoid 5 stars for any marvel lover who loves the action and thrill of the most recent sonys spiderman trilogy you are going to love madame web
Mar 4 2024,negative,this movie is what being lobotomised must feel like
Mar 4 2024,negative,it was cringe it didnt even have a great plot line
Mar 4 2024,positive,a true delight car theft mind projection not knowing how to talk to children ben from parks and rec still being named ben herehonestly what more can you want
Mar 4 2024,positive,great story and nice action hope there will be a sequel
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was able to introduce madame web as a stand alone movie as well as connecting her to the spider man multi verse
Mar 4 2024,negative,the plot line was cool the acting and writing were awful the jokes were so forced i think it was my least favorite marvel movie to date
Mar 4 2024,positive,dont listen to the critics    warning minor spoilers ahead    madame web is a very well thought out movie and pays attention to all the small details the way its able to play tricks on the mind with its complex story telling and how it creates tension and panic with the sounds heard throughout are amazing and what this movie is best at also speaking of sounds this movie has some of the best sound design of the decade it can create so much emotion and perfectly add on to a scene also i love how this movie is able to create intense emotion confusion and wonder in the minds of its audience in a very well executed manner most of the visuals are also quite stunning its clear that there was a lot of thought put into them im also hyped for the sequels this movie set up at the end and i hope theyre just as good as the first    this movie is not without its flaws though for example at the start of the movie ezekiel sims shoots down the mother of madame web because she found a spider she himself and other researchers were looking for while madame webs mother wanted to use it for good and to save her unborn daughter from a disease ezekiel wanted it for himself while the type of spider they found did grant powers thats spiders in the marvel universe 101 the motives felt somewhat vague while he did say something about his parents not being listen to when they were starving at least thats what i remember i was a bit tuned out at that time it still feels like they could have elaborated a bit more in the rest of the movie also one set in one scene of the movie the scene where madame web found out her mother was good just looks fake kind of like something i would see on some ride at disney that was based of a cartoon     other than that this movie is outstanding and i would definitely watch it again honestly i think the only reason critics hate this movie is because it didnt feel very marvlelike but for me someone who likes to go into things with a clear mind and not to many expectations this wasnt a problem madame web is an amazing movie and you should 100 go watch it if you havent
Mar 4 2024,negative,the worst marvel movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,we enjoyed this but the audio voice overs were pretty bad at times the acting wasnt so great on the part of the main character and villain but everyone else did great
Mar 3 2024,positive,awesome all female cast
Mar 3 2024,neutral,see for yourself 
Mar 3 2024,positive,a solid movie that introduces the main cast the villian was very iffy but the girls did their jobs nice to see an origin story were they dont actually get their suits yet only reason i think its getting killed in ratingbis the whole all girl crew and some people dont like that
Mar 3 2024,negative,i think they were confused that this is not 50 leftovers if it werent for the fact that dakota johnson has dad and mom working there she wouldnt get a job the movie is horrible time has no logic its an involuntary comedy with recycled scenes and a villain without dignity
Mar 3 2024,positive,well i like the story from the beginning but it was turn down sour in the middle and not enough action the four of the spiderman girls character could have put on costume instead of oh yeah im not gonna put a costume during the fight scene
Mar 3 2024,positive,liked it  not what i thought
Mar 3 2024,negative,the villains casting was terrible his voice didnt set right with me
Mar 3 2024,negative,the villain is defeated by literal product placement
Mar 3 2024,negative,the plot was awfully constructed made no sense and there was less action than a soap commercial it was rushed sloppily constructed and the character could do whatever they wanted the villain only used their assets when it helps the plot and even then this film is so boring you dont care about the characters and you dont care about the plot   sony you need to stop hiring terrible writers and making terrible films
Mar 3 2024,positive,fascinating dakota beauty and the beauty
Mar 3 2024,negative,i have never witnessed multiple groups of people leave a movie well before it was over my group laughed all the way through still madame web may be the worst movie ive even seen in theatre
Mar 3 2024,positive,i personally injoyed this movie its look so much better in person then in youtube shorts it tik tok
Mar 3 2024,negative,2 hours of my life gone
Mar 3 2024,negative,worst movie i ever watched
Mar 3 2024,neutral,it was ok id recommend watching it on streaming services than in a theater
Mar 3 2024,positive,was interesting cant wait for part 2
Mar 3 2024,positive,went to see this because seeing for dune was packed this wasnt too bad its not a movie i would watch a second time
Mar 2 2024,positive,i loved the movie gave it 4 stars cause i wanted more action but great into story for the 3 young lady characters 
Mar 2 2024,positive,really enjoyed it love an origin movie and fun being set in the early 00s with the music and fashion pre social media i think it set up the characters pretty well and i like that they kept the dakota johnson awkwardness but with know it all attitude and had some good funny parts cant be marvel now without that marvel humour
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie has gotten a bad rap  it was entertaining and kept your interest to see how it ends  isnt that what movies are supposed to do  you didnt have to see all the marvel movies before it to understand parts of the movie  it could stand alone by itself  could have done without all the horror movie previews shown before it
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was alright  ive seen it and thats enough
Mar 2 2024,negative,had good potential but was uneven and confusing  for example it kept showing the 3 teens as superheroes with spiderlike powers in flashforward scenes but at not time does it even attempt to explain where they would get the powers  and the ending where cassandra falls into the river and nearly drowns does not explain why she lost her eyesight or ended up in a wheelchair  other things that bothered me included the 3 teens in the woods with a campfire that they just abandoned without extinguishing to go to the diner smokey would be sad  then theres the dancing on the table at the dinerwould doubt that would be allowed by the staff   the scene at the fireworks warehouse at the start was ludicrousthey would not allow anyone to be that close to it   and the scenes where they return to the diner all there is to keep people out after its destroyed is a piece of yellow tape   same goes for when they return to the warehouse  no guard anyone can just walk in and mess with all the explosives and just tossing flares into boxes of fireworks omgso ridiculous  that entire place would have exploded like a small nuke  the other major thing that ruins it is that cassandra is wanted by the cops for attempted kidnapping and attacking cops yet can drive around nyc in a stolen cab with no plates  and then can hop on a plane fly to south america and find the same spot where her mother died  how did she get a passport how did she get past tsa and on a plane if wanted by the cops  the movie was so full of things like this that it made it almost unwatchable
Mar 2 2024,negative,it is obvious that dj made no effort to show any love for this movie or character her promo interviews were terrible she put as much effort in the character nor did the writers editors or anyone this movie is not even worthy of its so bad its good status honestly movie execs are just wanting to piss off fans and give them anything and everything but source material content as now i am done with comic book movies other than deadpool 3 hopefully its loaded w source material and fan justice that these idiots in the biz will wake the f up and give us a good comic book movie done right utter trash the 2 minutes of action was in the preview and it was not even real the razzies are going to have a field day 
Mar 2 2024,negative,its just a pepsi ad no fun in this
Mar 2 2024,negative,madame web entangled in a mess  this movie had me more tangled up in confusion than a spider web in a hurricane the story was all over the place the characters felt flat and the dialogue was about as smooth as sandpaper even though the visuals were kinda cool at times it wasnt enough to save the movie from feeling like a big ol letdown skip this one and stick to reruns of your favorite spiderman flick instead
Mar 2 2024,neutral,i cant say its a failure but its not the level of marvel
Mar 2 2024,negative,dialogue is horrible but this movie had so much potential no clue how it was written and edited so poorly what a shame
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was so enjoyable and rich and fun the performances were spoton for this pretty original brand of superhero movie where the real power came from intelligence strategy and learning calm amid chaos i hope the totally undue and in my strong estimation misogynist shade people have been throwing this movie gets ignored and that we get a sequel i want the next chapter i want to know how the tale of the three girls unfolds i want more of cassies journey to discover more of the strength and courage her mother left to her that shes only just begun to learn dumb people love a bandwagon dont be one of those idiots piling on this movie is honestly head and shoulders above any of the marvel movies in recent memory and definitely a great time at the theater
Mar 2 2024,negative,my favorite part is how ezekiel says a whole sentence and his lips dont move at all this wasnt even so bad its good it was so bad i want my money back how did they make this move so horrendous the dialogue is horrible cassandra is wanted by the nypd for kidnapping the whole movie and yet still drives the taxi she stole and crashed and decides to steal an ambulance too ezekiel was absolutely horrible the dubbed audio over him never matched up the entire movie and it was so horrble my favorite best worst quote my spiderthey took my spider
Mar 2 2024,negative,the chaotic film rhythm and predictable plot make it difficult to become a good movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,it is a very interesting movie dont go in thinking it is going to be like spiderman and if you do that you should enjoy it dakota johnson is good at acting but some parts were off good movie though
Mar 2 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie a lot and loved the concept the only issues i have with the movie is that it felt like it didnt have a proper conclusion i also wanted to see the girls actually use their powers although it makes me hope for a part 2 this movie really loves crashing through buildings with a car
Mar 2 2024,positive,very good action movie
Mar 2 2024,negative,had a lot of great ideas but the writing and acting was cringe the entire movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was an origin movie  that exploded the mythology of madam webb  it was great
Mar 2 2024,positive,while there were a couple of unnecessary scenes for the origin story and a couple of plot holes paramedics not delivering a baby overall a good movie
Mar 2 2024,negative,legitimately the worst movie ive ever seen i went in thinking it would be bad but funny but it was just so so bad i love watching bad movies but couldnt stand this one every single character was excruciating to watch the end was especially bad comparisons to the room are completely accurate
Mar 2 2024,negative,i have not even seen this movie but you could already tell from the first trailer it was the worst superhero movie ever 
Mar 2 2024,negative,i took a chance thinking it couldnt be as bad as the reviews it was horrible acting and a snoozefest  i gave it a half star for the little twist at the end
Mar 2 2024,negative,the movie is a piece of shi  finenever mind
Mar 2 2024,positive,starts off slow but movie picks up there are parts that are far fetched but its a marvels movie not sure they shouldve cast dakota super hero i did not quite believe it shes so dainty then really no powers to take on a powerful spider yet dainty dakota does however it does set up for a nice sequel at the end when it is explained glad i stayed through it
Mar 2 2024,positive,i liked it im a mom though so some of the lines from dakota in the beginning i find myself saying daily kind of had some final destination vibes
Mar 2 2024,negative,if i could do no stars i would
Mar 2 2024,positive,dont listen to the negative reviews go see this movie your going to be confused at first at whats going on it gets explained shortly in the film after the train scene the rest of the movie picks up and filled with action and a decent story line is this movie a big budget draw dropping marvel action film no but i can see the potential  i respect the originality in this script and the teen girls in the movie werent trying to do the most and it was refreshing to see mike epps he wasnt forced to be a comedian and make corny jokes overall this movie is solid enough to watch and recommend
Mar 2 2024,negative,a spidermanless spiderman film green lit by misguided sony executives as part of a weird disjointed spiderman cinematic universe with a lack of spiderman with the quality of a disney channel superhero original
Mar 1 2024,positive,mw was a good movie it was 4 of 5 film entertaining enough excitement and some superhero  magic  much better than the movie critics ratings its not going to win an oscar but  worth seeing
Mar 1 2024,negative,fell asleep during it 
Mar 1 2024,negative,a film that sets a new low for superhero movies and even movies in general honestly there is no entertainment value here just awful humour terrible characters just bad everything
Mar 1 2024,negative,the timeline was all off zeke wasnt portrayed anything like how he is in the comics the man who climbed the ceilings come on now hes stronger than spiderman and sacrificed himself not cool at all madame web was not 80 and had absolutely no emotion literally a bunch of teenagers getting into trouble because they dont listen and a few psychic moments the chinese though doh do not bother why these stand alones keep happening is beyond me write it into the actual spiderman films and it may make sense dakota johnson is not superhero material absolutely pants watching a pepsi sign cause so much trouble for 15 minutes was not how i thought i would be spending my night im still trying to work the whole thing out now 3 days later its a no from me
Mar 1 2024,negative,marvel and disney has lost there way the plot was dull and boring is ezekiel having a dream about his death and going after the girls the best they can come up with did they even do any screens for this movie  wait for disney and play it in the background while you are cleaning
Mar 1 2024,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie  it kept my interest the entire time  i cant  wait for the sequel  i felt like the cast did an amazing job i love dakota johnson and i watch all of her movies
Mar 1 2024,negative,much like madam web i foresaw this movies future when sony announced it luckily the poor screenwriting and subpar special effects wont distract you from dakota johnsons obvious disapproval of starring in this failed franchise attempt
Mar 1 2024,negative,in my opinion the cinematography of the film was appalling the film was boring and the villain was weak he could have won a thousand times and failed for a bad conclusion
Mar 1 2024,positive,it was a good movie a movie not connected to the same universe as spiderman nor venom or morbius nor kraven
Mar 1 2024,negative,madame webb initial reaction      score 40     1 this film is hilarously terrible    2 sydney sweeney could not save it     3 its a shame this had to exist    full review 
Mar 1 2024,positive,great great great movie i want another one stop listening to these judgy people that dont ever like anything good
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing movie yall need to stop hating every time a movie that involves females with powers or as a super hero yall give it low rating stop hating and appreciate a movie like what harm is it doing to you yall aint the ones paying to make the movie and for the first movie it was actually really good good action good graphics even marvel themselves have made some very bad movies i give this movie 5 stars being honest
Mar 1 2024,positive,movie was freaking amazing idky people are being haters giving it low ratings my family and i loved it
Mar 1 2024,negative,its time to stop disney its time to stop
Mar 1 2024,negative,this was a bad movie  i cannot decide which was worse this or morbius  ultimately i blame the writers and director for this throw away superhero movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie is absolutely epic i hope they make a second one my friend and i are seeing it again tomorrow excellent job
Feb 29 2024,negative,i wasnt a fan of this movie terrible awful movie
Feb 29 2024,negative,so bad its good but even that becomes strenuous the lack of effort put into the filmmaking is unbelievable to say the acting is phonedin is generous no one involved with any aspect of this disaster seemed to remotely care
Feb 29 2024,positive,610 so bad its fun
Feb 29 2024,negative,should have showed the action first instead of the origin that would ruined the movie
Feb 29 2024,neutral,the meh it passed the time prompt from rotten tomatoes is pretty accurate in this case i actually found myself enjoying the movie outside of the awful ezekiel sims adr debacle yes it is not great and there were some questionable choices made like why dakota johnson and why so much choke slamming amongst other things but i do not think its too far off movies like the flash shazam 2 or quantumania to name some contemporaries that have been notably bad i am not sure why sony keeps putting all this money and effort into trying to create a spiderman universe without putting some brains behind it too   there is a lot wrong with this movie but i did find it mildly entertaining so that must count for something
Feb 29 2024,positive,it was not that bad
Feb 29 2024,positive,despite the hate from everyone i think this movie is ok for me decent script
Feb 29 2024,negative,madame web is awful laughable and tiresome i think its the worst comic book movie ive seen this year
Feb 29 2024,negative,the movie didnt make any sense and it a waste of time
Feb 29 2024,negative,no stars would be a great option   just like getting your money back after a terrible movie would be great  or realizing that someone wrote a terrible script and maybe you should read it before greenlighting something just for the sake of making a movie with popular actors   the only saving grace is they never said spidermans name  the universe doesnt feel quite so tainted
Feb 29 2024,neutral,ham its good for time pass
Feb 29 2024,positive,although it ends more with a thud than a bang i enjoyed the movies novel departure from typical supercharactermarvel flicks dakotas laidback style is perfect she did not call it in and the rest of the cast did fine the story line was interesting and easy to follow and moves spiritedly along far better than the average critics rating suggests
Feb 29 2024,positive,after hearing not so good things i didnt know what to expect honestly i loved it i think if you payed attention the whole movie you got the whole story the person i went to see it with didnt understand the story i felt like it was described perfectly and i am excited to watch it again
Feb 29 2024,positive,dont believe the bad reviews  this movie has a great storyline
Feb 29 2024,positive,this movie is definitely watchable it is not as bad as the critics make it out to be just as good as godzilla minus one  imho
Feb 29 2024,negative,it was pretty bad and not very well made
Feb 29 2024,negative,i really wanted to like it but the dialogue was absolutely terrible i liked the story and i think if they tried they couldve made a very cool movie
Feb 29 2024,negative,this was extremely disappointing for many reasons especially the fact that we havent had a spiderman based movie in so long and we got a not even halfbaked film with annoying characters and a plot thats falling apart throughout the movie
Feb 28 2024,negative,i only wish i could have those 2 hours of my life back
Feb 28 2024,negative,26    i agree    yeah its bad like really bad im not even sure what to call it a fanmade movie  a bad idea poorly executed im not even sure if i can call it a train wreck because a train wreck at least has something that draws people to it this has nothing its disastrous execution with a terrible script and bad dialogue the performances arent all that great but the villain stands out as 1 one of the worst villain performances in the past few years and 2 one of the worst villains in comic book movie history chukwuji iwuji eats this guy alive dakota johnson is fine and my guy adam scott is always fun    this film doesnt seem like it exists i dont know how to explain it seems like a frankenstein experiment from the 2000s that was put in a drawer went rotten and has now been revealed to the world there are some plot points that eat 1520 minutes of the film that serve no actual purpose and finally the visual choices here are baffling the costumes are laughable the cgi is not good and the editing what was that the cuts weird and unnecessary camera turns everything was wrong the last 10 minutes are special just special    great way to start the year    long live madam mommy    its worst that morbius
Feb 28 2024,negative,possibly one of the worst films ive ever seen dakota was the only good part about the movie but it did her a disservice i dont think ive ever rated a movie as low as this normally i like to spend some time talking about the movie this one its just not worth it
Feb 28 2024,negative,nothing ne  boooooring
Feb 28 2024,negative,contains spoilers im actually not sure where to start the trailers built up some actionpacked fiasco that i didnt get to see in the theater the plot had a tendency to go painfully slow then there would be several fast developments then it went back to being painfully slow if youre going to see sydney sweeny as a superhero the reason i went because it was so heavily advertised dont the young girls dont actually become their superhero personas at all in the entire film there is one scene we get to see them in action but it is a flashforward to a time that apparently exists after the credits roll aside from the terrible plot the aspect that threw me off the most was the dialogue sloppy dubbing for no apparent reason combined with poor phrasing choices annoying cliches and just flat out bad grammar made any character a pain to listen to dakota johnson even hinted in a few interviews that this isnt the best film shes participated in however she seems to have done the best with what she was given here are a few rants i have about the film     in the opening scene when we are introduced to cassies mother and the main villain the plot isnt just predictable and cliche its just flat out ridiculous firstly the actions of the main villain ezekiel just seem so dramatic to me like mrdering a pregnant woman for a spider he could have easily taken out of her hand to later be driven mad with a want to kll literal kids because of a nightmare he had maybe im being overly cynical but that was bizarre also the entrance and the entire presence of the unexplained native tribe that supposedly runs the island spiders or something in this scene was just too random for me we hardly got any context there at all     in the scene with the fire where one of cassies coworkers des in an accident involving an ambulance i almost started laughing because it was such a slow dramatic scene where i think we were meant to feel sad for the death of a random character we didnt even know i believe the idea was not to feel sad for the character himself rather the situation and that cassie could have prevented his death however it was executed so badly i fear it didnt achieve that point      there is a way for a director to show an audience that the main character doesnt know whats going on however clarkson apparently felt the need to show us over and over and over again that cassie didnt understand the timejumps she was experiencing it got so monotonous and repetitive i feel it took up way too much time in the film and i got physically agitated     did anyone else think that the villain was a little outrageous we never saw his transformation there was no explanation of his endgame or his goals only that he really didnt wanna die and wanted to have cool powers i guess in the start of the film he seemed to be a researcher driven to madness by some intense want to attain the soughtafter spider for its abilities years later he just sort of reappeared as a billionaire with a cool spidersuit spiderman like abilities technology decades ahead of its time and an mission to kll three children who may or may not cause him some trouble ten years in the future i just felt his entire character was so odd for lack of a better word also back on the whole dialogue thing what was up with the way he spoke all of his lines sounded aigenerated and badly badly dubbed      the cheap knockoff of with great power comes great responsibility had me writhing in my seat like what was that just so cringe     in conclusion part of me is upset i spent money and time to give this a shot another part of me is glad i did so i can join the large online community of madame webb haters
Feb 28 2024,negative,without the banter between dakota johnson sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor this movie is not watchable the ladies provide comedy heart and and feel good moments but other than that the movie gives nothing  the villain is as one dimensional as they come horrible dialogue and delivery of it  the suit designs were nice however all you saw in the trailer is basically all you get in the film   unpopular opinion but i would love to see the ladies in a sequel because now that they have been established it could promise more of the good aspect of this film
Feb 28 2024,positive,people on the internet love hating on things this movie is a perfect example for that  if i hadnt known about the hate this movie got i would have completely enjoyed this movie which had a lot of spiderman 1 vibes but even with that knowledge this movie was entertaining and made me wanna watch more     dear internet please take a deep breath
Feb 28 2024,negative,why  why  why  why  why
Feb 28 2024,negative,concept  brilliant execution  awful  i had high hopes for a dakota johnson led superheroish movie i think the editing of this movie is awful had the director spliced together the scenes differently a totally different movie could have come out of this a good one half the scenes just arent necessary there are a few brilliant scenes the subway the diner im not sure why this movie is set in 2003 other then to have toxic playing on the radio conveniently if thats the reason ill accept it because when toxic came on it really elevated that entire scene  the prologue for this movie could have just been skippedand should have been dakota johnson falling into the river the prologue is lightly replayed later in the movie and could have just been heavily featured at this point elevating the mid movie scenes far better   ultimately the payload for the entire concept is burnt up early on in the movie unfortunately this movie is subject to dumbing down so lazy viewers can follow it without question rather then watching along with intrigue  i will say this for iti hate prequelsso if this can act as the prequel to a much larger overall story then im in for more
Feb 28 2024,negative,madame web the latest addition to the superhero genre falls short of spinning a captivating tale that resonates with audiences despite its potential for exploring intriguing themes and introducing a lesserknown character from the marvel universe the film struggles to weave a compelling narrative and engage viewers on a deeper level
Feb 28 2024,positive,1010  must see for marvel fans  my favorite of the marvel series  strong female leads  very positive message and theme on the importance of love and being family to one another whether biological or not  this is a fantastic movie for the whole family the plot was complicated and engaging the whole time the actors were fantastic to make such an engaging movie with almost all new unknown actors is a difficult task  all of the actors do a fantastic job and the acting of the roles is convincing     the settings were beautiful and the motives and plot believable as far as movies go    my children range between 12 and 20 years old and are big marvel fans therefore i see a lot of marvel movies this is in my top three marble favorites along with iron man and captain america    this movie has my mind spinning and wondering how it connects to the multiverse and if theres any connection to spiderman  the main characters real life work partner is named ben parker could there be any relation to other parkers we dont learn any other names in the movie so why is this name mentioned a few times    weakness for me one movie weakness is the cinematography on the driving an action scenes or when there is a premonition the video movement and angles didnt make sense it kept spinning us in circles with blurry images those parts were done terrible  i want to see great scenes during action that are clear and that physiologically makes sense i want to move with the vehicle and not feel like the cameras hanging from a rope spinning in a circle    pro one of the best marvel movies  beautiful major theme of family and creating family  no language or romantic scenes    great for whole family  ended the show wanting more and looking forward to a sequel    cons action scenes were filmed in a blurry circular motion how does driving a car down in new york st get filmed with a camera spinning in circles      why so many blurry images of action scenes  in this day and age action scenes should be crystal clear    1010 overall
Feb 28 2024,positive,wow one of the best superhero movies ive ever seen  madam web starts with an amazing story of a heavily pregnant mother searching in the amazon for a cure for her unborn daughter a cure that needs venom from a very rare spider  due to her being critically injured she dies but her daughter survives to become a paramedic living in new york who loves her job but is bitter about being an orphan and doesnt want a husband or children  but thanks to sharing a connection with spiderfolk she discovers 3 teenage girls in danger of being murdered by the same man who killed her mother  using her newly developed power to see the near future she embarks on a cat and mouse battle to protect the girls whilst trying to find out why shes so connected to them  some of the best scenes are her trying to deal with 3 typically unrully teens the movie is a lot of fun and makes the most of its best ideas strong recommended
Feb 28 2024,positive,holy moly this might be one of the greatest films i have ever seen i literally morbed in the theater dont be surprised when madame web wins every oscar this year it is exciting and adventurous the main character of madame web is so good and the villain ezekiel sims is more impressive and wellacted than heath ledgers joker from the dark knight it even beats out some of the greatest movies of all time like the godfather or justice league 2017 even though not quite as good as the masterpiece that is morbius sony you better make a crossover happen 55 mustwatch for the best movie of the century
Feb 28 2024,negative,train wreck of a movie so bad its almost comical
Feb 28 2024,positive,i know everyone is hating on this my son included but i dont care  i liked it anyway ive been wanting a lowstakes superhero movie and this gave it to me i thought the girls were fun as was cassies irritation with them i liked how cassie figures out how to deal with and use her newfound abilities
Feb 28 2024,negative,sonyfor the love of god stop making these movies and sell the spidey rights to disney
Feb 28 2024,positive,this movie has a very cheesy early 2000s marvel movie vibe its a stylistic choice while some dialogue is a bit clunky the movie is never really boring a lot of creative decisions were made and they landed pretty well coming into this movie with an open mind is the best way to view it its a good time and definitely worth a couple rewatches
Feb 28 2024,negative,my brother fell asleep he said he took a 6 dollar nap and the best part about the movie was the slurpee that movie was so bad it hurt my heart
Feb 28 2024,positive,it was a very entertaining movie just dont mind the loopholes in editing its not as bad as some people think
Feb 28 2024,negative,sony really doesnt know how to manage the marvel ip really poor movie
Feb 28 2024,positive,this was an awesome movie good cast good story and it went along with the comic book i definitely would see it again
Feb 28 2024,positive,it was really good i expected to not like it because that seemed to be the trend but it was actually good it mainly focused on introducing madame web and how she came to be might not be your movie if you have a short attention span
Feb 28 2024,positive,i liked the story line the tie in with spiderman most of the acting was good mostly exciting only a little predictable great ending
Feb 28 2024,negative,possibly the worst movie of all time feel bad for the three spiderwoman that didnt even get to be spiderwoman i believe the writers for this movie were high off tranquilizers when they wrote it
Feb 28 2024,positive,go into this movie open minded
Feb 28 2024,negative,there are very few moments where it is watchable 
Feb 28 2024,positive,dont understand all the hate tbh it wasnt anything mindblowing but theres been worse superhero movies
Feb 28 2024,positive,this movie was actually very good the bad reviews really dont make sense id suggest seeing it for yourself to decide and try not to fall into anything you might have seen online of course all superhero movies can be a bit silly at times but this was well written has a good story line and was fun maybe some people just dont enjoy an all female led cast or forgot that this is in the same universe as magic spiders that bite people and give them powers this movie is entertaining plain and simple just go into it with no expectations good or bad and try to take it for what it is a superhero movie
Feb 27 2024,positive,took awhile to find out her powers and still kind of left of left that question  open need a sequel to pull it all it together and put madame x on the map as well as the other three
Feb 27 2024,positive,wonderful film best possible story and ending with promising very good sequel
Feb 27 2024,positive,madame web i had low low expectations but i gotta give it an 8 out of 10 for someone with epilepsy and experiences d√©j√† vu right before having a seizure it was cool to see that incorporated as a super power lmao  it had a decent story line and a lot of easter eggs that i noticed from the spiderman cartoon that we grew up with like her friend ben uncle his house in the movie resembled aunt mays house in the cartoon and a few other ones 
Feb 27 2024,negative,waste of time worst super hero movie ever
Feb 27 2024,negative,youll be bored for the first 30 minutes but then youll laugh out loud at how badly the script is written
Feb 27 2024,negative,absolutely terrible movie
Feb 27 2024,negative,its a movie with an interesting concept executed in the worst ways possible decent action and a solid main character cant save a formulaic script terrible dialogue and ridiculous character decisions
Feb 27 2024,negative,to be frank this movie was very bad the filming style gave twilight vibes the lines timing was horrible there was no actual backstory and or one that made sense this movie shouldve never hit the big screen not only did casting mix and mash bad actresses trendy actresses with low caliber skills regarding acting the budget mustve went to the beyonce mural pepsi and mountain dew advertisements within the movie
Feb 27 2024,positive,i liked it sure it needed a bit more  like how the 3 get   there powers and which peter parker it is  other then that my friend and i saw it and we agreed it was good but needed more
Feb 27 2024,positive,i thought it was a solid movie  not great but very good i would absolutely watch it again
Feb 27 2024,negative,really bad movie madam web is dumb
Feb 27 2024,positive,great movie loved it
Feb 27 2024,negative,worst marvel ever dc getting a good laugh here it seemed like dakota johnson didnt even want to be in the movie  there was no emotion whatsoever no excitement no suspense nothing the best part for me was realizing that the baby was peter parker
Feb 27 2024,positive,was interesting to watch but didnt like ending of movie
Feb 27 2024,negative,it held my attention but that may have been because of the really bad adb dubbing of the villans lines or the fact that dakota johnson cannot show any other emotion except sarcasm and that is even stretching it our 3 teenagers could have been a good segway into the spiderverse but unfortunately this movie was so bad i dont think it will make it to any screenwriters desk its a tossup on if this or morbius was worse i vote this had more action but morbius had better actors
Feb 27 2024,negative,not a good movie  wasted my time and money  disappointed
Feb 27 2024,negative,horrendous movie i thought i was watching a lifetime channel movie
Feb 27 2024,negative,rubbish from start to end
Feb 27 2024,positive,great movie especially if you got little ladies in your life
Feb 27 2024,negative,what is most apparent when watching this movie is nobody involved wanted to make it or cared about the final product
Feb 27 2024,negative,while madame web is a much weaker superhero movie than morbius i was honestly expecting something much more remarkably awful if anything its just really boring without some of morbiuss redeeming qualities such as some decent ideas that couldve been more thoughtprovoking in a better film and a villain whose actor seemed to be having a blast playing him i suppose madame web has some slightly good points dakota johnsons performance was betterthanexpected given her comments about acting against blue screen and reacting to thin air and therere some good stunts from evil spiderman but on the whole i still remained baffled why sony is insisting on not just making this universe dedicated to spiderman characters without spiderman a thing but trying to exploit the multiverses current mainstream popularity to actively trick people into thinking these are mcu films and you know theyve dropped the ball hard when conspiracy theories are being tossed around about how the actors are being manipulated into thinking theyre going to join the avengers only for it to not be the case the film has a very outdated feel even without the period piece trappings coming off as a glorified fan film the poorlydubbed villain is given no personality and his entire motivation can be boiled down to he had a bad dream the visual effects have a very we have doctor strange at home feel to them the way the titular characters powers work isnt explored adequately and feels more like a glorified easy way out and i guess i should discuss the big thing the product placement given all the pepsi memes surrounding this film i was expecting the film to stop dead in its tracks to extol the virtues of this soft drink and talk about how only nonchads drink cocacola when all it amounted to was an unintentional example of rule of three i suppose its glaring in the climaxs location but i think product placement in a sony film has pretty much peaked with the emoji movie okay mountain dew is owned by the same company but not everybody knows that youd think theyd at least use the opportunity to promote pepsi classic or something however since pepsis in this film are manufactured and distributed by timetravelers apparently due to the pepsis being from 2023 rather than how they looked in 2003 btw i dont think the early 2000s settings added anything of note and couldve been set in the 2020s without any meaningful changes oh wait it turns out there is a reason why its set in 2003 and its for sony to shamelessly gaslight people who dont do their research into thinking this is an mcu film youll know it when you see iteven though once you do the math you realise the scene in question shouldve been set earlier yep madame web is really bad  and lies to you  and i can see why some higherup at sony had little faith in the project as evidenced by the spoileriffic trailer  though the superhero genres struggles over the past two years certainly havent helped  and it forces me to declare one thing help us deadpool  wolverine youre our only hope
Feb 27 2024,positive,i think it was really good i would love to see another installment
Feb 27 2024,positive,the movie was great if you are prepared to see something slow paced once you get past that its a great movie to enjoy
Feb 27 2024,positive,i heard so many bad reviews about it i decided to see it for myself i loved it
Feb 27 2024,positive,everything was good i get it
Feb 27 2024,negative,the worst movies are always the ones with promise that end up a jumbled disaster point the finger where you like  audience expectations casting writing directors vision editing  whatever you can blame you should because it was all wrong dakota johnson was a one level performer showing little to no depth or complexity jumping disconnectedly from boring and bland to world wise saviour the girls were better in a they did the best they could with what they had way the technical aspects were messy and middle school caliber the story line dragged and then wrapped up weirdly quickly   should have been handed over to marvelthey should be ashamed to even be associated with this and made into a streaming series
Feb 27 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie and dakota johnson acting was amazing hope theres a second movie 
Feb 27 2024,positive,it started slow after all characters were established the movie was very enjoyable all the characters except the villains were perfect not sure why this movie is getting bad reviews  is it end game no  but it was better than average
Feb 27 2024,positive,there were some good parts but the ending got really cheesy and it isnt something id watch again
Feb 27 2024,positive,it was better than i expected granted that i went to see the movie with very low expectations
Feb 27 2024,negative,this is a scam a spiderverse mivie withour spiderman a superhero movie without superheroes anothe failure sad
Feb 27 2024,positive,a decent popcorn flick with some moments of genuine hilarity   listen we arent looking for the second coming of cinema we know what these movies are gonna do   this was entertaining brought together some charming young actors and provided an interesting back story for a character that doesnt get much love
Feb 27 2024,positive,a real movie lover not another side of anything else this movie is ok   yes a lot to like and dislike yes a lot of other whatever mess hollywood is going thru  but movie story telling wise yes they are learning and understandingeven tho acting of young actress in a few scenes were cringe worthy other then yes plot holes and blah blah blah who cares cause story wise  its like blue beetle worthy of a movie  and further movies as long as hollywood stops throwing in all the other dumb nonsense like super powers for everyone without actual realistic bs story line   like grandma flies a space ship in blue beetle etc sorry about two blue beetle mentions but these movies are hurt cause of other things then actual movie stuff  they ok not like vlack addameternals and etc    u real supposedly critics just follow the crowed to anyone who likes super hero movies this is one
Feb 26 2024,positive,loved it dont understand all the hate
Feb 26 2024,positive,done right it had so much potential its pretty blatant that they were hoping this would be a multi film endeavour so thought theyd keep something back for more films unfortunately this film needed the fan service the trailer promised the actors didnt have much chemistry and while dakota johnson did her best theres only so much you can do with what she was given its a shame because madame web is an awesome character and if spiderverse has shown us anything its that people love these universes and theres so many stories and characters to work with more enjoyable than morbius less so than venom
Feb 26 2024,positive,i enjoyed the storyline and loved dakota johnson as madame webb i liked that she uses her mind not brawn to get the job done i would have liked the movie to have been longer hopefully there will be a sequel how do the girls get their powers i and my wife both really enjoyed it
Feb 26 2024,positive,a good movie but very predictable  definitely not the terrible movie many are saying it is  go have a good time with this one
Feb 26 2024,positive,not the best marvel mcu movie but it is nice to watch as a solo movie wich not all mcu movies are
Feb 26 2024,negative,it was honestly boring and uneventful the acting was terrible
Feb 26 2024,negative,jo and i went to see this movie last friday 23 after reading the large number of dreadful reviews neither of us are fans of these super hero movies that seem to be what the majority of cinema goers like most there are plenty of them being shown and made and we both find them hard to understand however they past the time and we both enjoy hearing the audience scream and clap and all seem to thoroughly enjoy them  they do we both admit pass a couple of hours plus away    i like to read the reviews of all movies we see before we actually watch them at our local cinema  therefore we went with very low expectations    however neither of us thought it was as bad as the feared although if i was a super hero fan i would have given it a one star there was very little super hero action even the final battle at the end was almost a yawn     the plot was the best past but was not written or acted well  the villain was just not villainous enough and how many times can you feel horrified and frightened at a man crawling upside down on a ceiling    the heroine wasnt a super hero yet and certainly didnt act as one  she appeared more a s a mother figure protecting three very silly and whining teenagers who were apparently in the future going to become spiderwomen why they were picked was not explained if it was it passed us by    we are being kind i suppose in giving it 212 starts out of five because the story was so dreadful it could and should have been a lot better and the acting looked as if they couldnt believe what they were actually saying  however that is no excuse i well remember one of the great actors of my time point to hammer king christopher lee  he made even the worst dialogue in the world sound like shakespeare     our new aspiring actors should take note    go with an open mind to see madame web the first half an hour of the movie is the best     oh one last thing  the awful villain his acting he certainly wasnt frightening had to have had his voice overdubbed most times it didnt match his lips that was very annoying but then so was the dialogue he had to voice
Feb 26 2024,neutral,if you take it at face value it was a good movie however the commercials lead you to believe it was more of a superhero movie and it wasnt that fell short   entire movie could have been reduced down into a few sentences liked the cast though
Feb 26 2024,negative,not as bad as critics are saying but not good other villain was extremely weak and underdeveloped
Feb 26 2024,positive,while not a great film i liked it better than most reviews would suggest it had a good story a good popcorn movie acting was okay considering the dialog was not especially well written
Feb 26 2024,positive,i genuinely had a good time watching madam web with my son its not a ground breaking top 10 superhero movie of all time but i dont think thats a bad thing theres less cringe than i expected and better acting than i expected its a fun origin style comic book movie
Feb 26 2024,positive,entertaining movie typical superhero movie
Feb 26 2024,positive,loved the movie i am hoping there is a second one  
Feb 26 2024,positive,i loved the movie amazing acting and overall an exciting film would pay thousands of dollars just to see it for the first time again
Feb 26 2024,negative,this was absolutely horrible disaster
Feb 26 2024,positive,i thought the movie was quite good and the roles were played well i do believe the lack of ratings is due to the dislike of this being a female dominance film a recommended watch from me
Feb 26 2024,negative,the boring the bad  and the bate and switch id rather watch encino man on repeat id rather watch grass grow in the desert or stare at the sun
Feb 26 2024,positive,love it   i cant wait to see the next one 
Feb 26 2024,positive,me and my brother loved it i understand that some people arent going to like some bad dialogue and some bad voiceover work for the main villain other than that we really loved this movie especially if you grew up watching early 2000s comic book adaptations catwoman daredevil and the first two fantastic four movies i think you will really enjoy it
Feb 26 2024,positive,mid but better than morbius looking forward to part ii
Feb 26 2024,positive,im pretty lenient when it comes to movies   as long as i had a good time and enjoyed myself i approve of the movie  and i enjoyed this movie  it wasnt ground breaking but for me it was a good movie about the origin story of madame web  and im looking forward to a progression of this story
Feb 26 2024,positive,i think people forgot what the average sony quality is i just watched the movie and figured out that when it just released everyone was capping letting a bunch of bottom feeders talk about how terrible this movie was for a sony movie its average not even the worse movie ever made i thought the same when i watched morbius how everyone was capping about how that was the worst movie ever made i have seen movies worst than these movies i have seen superhero  hero movies worse than these 2 movies the fact that other people think madame web  morbius are the worse superhero or hero movies proved that the average person is not into movies they dont like trying new movies cause they never seen an actual horrible superhero or hero movie if they think that both morbius  madame web are the worse movies ever i recommend watching both when youre bored
Feb 26 2024,negative,i walked in with hope that this was a good movie i was wrong
Feb 26 2024,negative,disney is killing marvel
Feb 26 2024,negative,it was buns bad rescue and cpr bad writing and bad actors  l
Feb 26 2024,neutral,not what you expected the trailer is very deceiving the movie is underwhelming and doesnt have really any actionfighting that you would expect it to no costumes besides antagonist and doesnt really feel like a superhero movie
Feb 26 2024,negative,feels like this should be on the cw network
Feb 26 2024,positive,the movie was pretty enjoyable i liked the mysterysuspense direction instead of the standard super hero format it was better than a lot of them stuff marvels been putting out lately
Feb 26 2024,positive,not as bad as everyone made it seem to be not the best but entertaining nonetheless
Feb 26 2024,negative,that movie was the worst movie ive ever watched everything was bad the dialogue was terrible acting was trash the characters were either unlikeable or one dementional horrible pacing worst ending of a marvel movie it was absolute brainrot it was all prologue and so little climax  editing was horrible i felt like i was tweaking in the cinema the reason why i gave it a half star was because the people laughing in the background were like a laughtrack which was funnier than the actual movie longest two hours of my life marvel should have saved the 100 million dollars and never made this garbage
Feb 26 2024,positive,the movie was actually pretty good i understand why other people would think its bad but in reality its not that bad dont let other reviews persuade you its just from their experience 
Feb 26 2024,positive,it was okay some parts the video just moved too fast  the storyline was predictable but enjoyable
Feb 26 2024,positive,nicely webbed story
Feb 26 2024,negative,omg why was this film made
Feb 25 2024,negative,did not meet or even come close to expectations left within 1st hour
Feb 25 2024,negative,this movie was horribly written and the acting seemed as if they all just got out of acting class thumbs down waste of money
Feb 25 2024,positive,this was a great movie despite the low budget
Feb 25 2024,negative,very confusing plot with no direction to lead into future movies
Feb 25 2024,negative,yes  this movie is dumb and cheesy  but  lets be real here so is every other marvel movie  i walked out of this movie with the same impression i walked out of every other marvel movie with  well that was dumb but still somewhat enjoyable  and i dont care what anyone says this movie is not as bad as morbius    with all that being said there isnt actually that much to like about this movie  the characters are annoying it often feels like a cutrate hospital drama show tahar rahim gave an absolutely terrible performance and the same thing just kind of happens again over and over again in this film     this isnt a good movie  but its not one of the worst movies of all time  its just a movie about a ctier superhero from a movie studio trying to milk its franchise rights absolutely bone dry  i will surely put it on in the background while i stare at my phone and occasionally glance up and have a vague sense of enjoyment from the experience
Feb 25 2024,positive,i went in expecting it to be poor so i kept noticing throughout the film how much i was enjoying it there was a point near the end where it took a turn for the worse  not bad enough to spoil the film but might leave people with a lasting negative impression
Feb 25 2024,positive,b movie actually corny at times hey marvel even the best of them are allowed a lemon now and then
Feb 25 2024,positive,i actually love marvels madame web movie  i was thoroughly invested from start to finish and liked the story love her superpowers which are basically her gifted mind and intellect instead of the usual brute force what a breath of fresh air the movie is thrilling and thriller has always been my favourite genre loved it 
Feb 25 2024,positive,its not spiderman so dont think it is and youll enjoy it
Feb 25 2024,positive,i think it was amazing yea movie was kinda confusing or people  may not like it and they didnt get their powers yet but man just wait for madame web 2 they will get their powers and we will have more than just a story going on this movie to me was good very good i love marvel and sony films but people need to have respect that they dont have to make anything to earn money or make them watch the marvel films i didnt even have to make spider man tom hollands spider man have the og spidermans in them like just be glad that they are trying their best to make the movie the way they want them
Feb 25 2024,positive,i genuinely liked this movie i thought it was insanely cool and epic dont understand the hate
Feb 25 2024,neutral,it felt rushed and there wasnt enough real action
Feb 25 2024,positive,fairly good movie doesnt follow the comic but havent read that so no worries not a film to watch if you want your thoughts and feelings challenged but a solid piece of escapism with a possible sequel critics really overthink these things
Feb 25 2024,positive,i genuinely liked the film im sad that there are so many bad reviews but personally i thought it was good
Feb 25 2024,positive,pretty cool action female spider man movie the nitpick i have with it id the main girl being an ahole to the girls but i understand shes trying to protect them other then that the movie was actually pretty good although i was not expecting people to be harsh on it
Feb 25 2024,positive,nowhere near as bad as ive been hearing went in with low expectations so that may have helped it  but i got into it and thought the premonition scenes were well executed  i think a lot of the bad press comes from people that may have a problem with female superheroes  obviously not a great movie but one im glad i went to see  my 2 marvel obsessed daughters were keen before release but were put off by the bad press it received i think they would enjoy it
Feb 25 2024,negative,another poorlywritten dei masterpiece from hollywood
Feb 25 2024,positive,good movie  dont understand the bads reviews 
Feb 25 2024,positive,i genuinely enjoyed this movie although there were some parts that annoyed me the voiceover for the main villan ezikiel was very annoying the voice for him genuinely upset me and kinda threw off the whole movie the cgi was relatively good during this movie i cringed at this movie a few times but other than that i genuinely cried and laughed at this movie it had a good plot and decent acting the way the actors portrayed their characters was very well thought out another thing that upset me was the ending although it was good ezikiel at the end against cassie didnt put up much of a fight i believe if they wouldve continued the fight a little bit more and gave ezikiel a proper outing then it wouldve been so much better at the end cassie becomes blind and has adopted the three girls we get a look in to the future and see how they really are and i enjoyed that little peak of them although cassie being blind near the end kinda made no sense keep in mind i havent read the comics if there is one her being blind and still being able to fight upset me only because it wouldve been so much better if the mentor of the three girls could fight alongside them instead of a hologram or a fake cassie alongside them her being able to tell the future is definitely strong but being blind and still being able to tell it is kinda of weird to me    overall this movie was definitely great with some cons but all movies have cons i would definitely recommend it to people who havent seen much spider superhero movies and would i watch it again
Feb 25 2024,positive,it was good i do wish they made the ending better seemed like they ran out of time and just wanted to fill what was left of the movie with a pretty basic ending also she has superpowers from healing spiders so how is she blind and paralyzed at the end definitely a mistake on the directors part
Feb 25 2024,negative,this movie is so trash the story is very bad and sometimes it doesnt even make sense even the voice lines were sometimes confusing like reallly confusing it looks the scriptwriters didnt know what is mcu or what is marvel it so empty in the story i dont recommend watching it
Feb 25 2024,negative,really disappointed hoped it would somehow tie into the larger mcu but it was in a universe of its own the story wasnt bad but the choice of villain was
Feb 25 2024,positive,i loved this movie i dont know what everyone is talking abt it was so camp so fun and features ko and bey and britney are you kidding me a holy trifecta watch it have fun
Feb 25 2024,positive,i like the movie but the film just sets up too much and shows little    you can see how bad the movie but just be aware they changed the script alot during production so its mostly all over the place    overall cool movie cool characters and its cool but could be better
Feb 25 2024,positive,definitely a descent movie
Feb 25 2024,positive,lots of people said not to watch it cuz it wasnt good  my daughters and i honestly thought it was good and enjoyed it the storyline was good and interesting and i didnt fall asleep considering it was late movie lol
Feb 25 2024,negative,i understand now why this marvel movie was released in february the story is bad and probably killed any chance for a continuation of the character dakota does her best but her character is so poorly written that she couldnt do much with it other characters are shown as superheroes in visions of the future she has they never develop those characters and you dont see them in their spider costumes except in her visions  i think its well overdue for columbiasony to give control  over their marvel characters back to marvel tahar rahim is awful as the villain ezekiel i saw a question in an online forum whether his voice was dubbed because it sounds so bad unfortunately for him it wasnt and he speaks very good english in other roles ive seen him in so what exactly was he attempting to do with his voice and why didnt the director fix this it was obvious it sounded horrible that played a key part in me disliking this film
Feb 25 2024,positive,the movie was better than the reviews i had seen i thought the major weakness of the movie was either the script was weak in areas or the acting by the main address was forced at times my grandson was also disappointed that the three young girls didnt really get to show there new powers in this movie and will have to wait for a sequel  also dont wait for the end of the credits there is no credits clip like all other marvel movies marvel associated
Feb 25 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in my life
Feb 25 2024,negative,yet another spiderman film suffering from its lack of continuity with the mcu it misuses a mentor character in the comics and turns it into a villain the use of the other female spider characters feels wasted and comes out as a sloppy mush  some of the camera work is a bit crazy id love to get my money back with interest
Feb 25 2024,negative,bad story bad acting horrible ending it looks like a movie made in 2003
Feb 25 2024,positive,a good movie it really feels like something from the 2000s when the adaptations were simpler but still fun better than 80 of the movies and tv shows the mcu has released in recent years but the experts arent ready to admit that
Feb 25 2024,negative,if i could give no stars i would this was a terrible movie and its so bad its funny but the most laughable part is how the female stars think their characters can take on the spiderman this movie shouldnt have been made if it couldnt be made correctly
Feb 25 2024,positive,of course is not the best movie all times but its decent its a good movie it has some things that are not very logical but in general the movie is entertaining dont believe what some critics say because must of them just want more fanfiction
Feb 25 2024,positive,this is really a pretty decent b movie if you approach it as an independent b movie with some commendable if predictable themes like the love of a mother the biggest problem with the movie its a marvel spiderverse movie it had high expectations to meet from the start  it was never going to be able to meet them because of how high those expectations were from marvelspiderverse fans furthermore it did its best in action sequences with only an invisible superpower of being able to see the future    critics are humans too they are also susceptible to biases id take their views with a large pinch of salt
Feb 25 2024,negative,i went to see this movie specifically to witness its memeinthemaking unintentional hilarity and on that front i was not disappointed writing that ranged from lazy to ludicrous and overthetop production choices kept my theater audience howling with laughter ironically this made it one of my favorite movie experiences of 2024 thus farso i guess ill add a halfstar for that the effects and fight choreography were exciting too which counts for something in a superhero film in more capable filmmaking hands the four female leads all solid actors could have made for a compelling onscreen team which is a real bummer
Feb 25 2024,positive,i cant recommend a movie more this may have or may have not changed my life for the better   i laughed i cried i madame webbed
Feb 25 2024,positive,i loved the way the movie went  to explain the characters  no little easter eggs afterwardsi would like them to continue these characters
Feb 25 2024,positive,great movie  start of a new exciting franchise 
Feb 25 2024,positive,it was a very inspiring movie the ending shouldve explained a little more on how the girls will be the next future of marvel characters the beginning was a little confusing with the people that were dressed in red on who they were and shouldve explained the background of what they possess
Feb 25 2024,positive,great movie wouldnt mind watching it again keeps you in edge
Feb 25 2024,negative,the audio sync was absolutely terrible there is not a single piece of dialogue that sounds like it comes out of an actors mouth the cuts in the film are wild and seemingly random im not sure how such a massive flop passed all the checkpoints unless there are no checkpoints
Feb 25 2024,positive,this movie is an origin story and it was definitely a good movie not the best movie ever but i would not say it was bad
Feb 25 2024,negative,i mean i definitely do not think its the worst superhero movie but it was just a headscratcher the antagonist was severely underwhelming the plot felt really predictable the writing felt lazy and there were a few parts that i didnt understand although i am a little curious where this story goes following the film
Feb 25 2024,positive,we enjoyed the movie the way her visions were filmed were better than most movies have portrayed visions of the future d johnson was excellent
Feb 25 2024,positive,it was actually pretty good its the beginning of everything else for people who dont know is madame web like marvel the first movie dont let the other comments fool you
Feb 25 2024,positive,it was good really good  story cast  all of it was enjoyable and i wasnt looking at the to see when it was going to end  glad i ignored all the negative reviews
Feb 25 2024,positive,i expected much more but had a decent time watching
Feb 25 2024,positive,took my 14yearold daughter and we loved it very well done and good storyline
Feb 25 2024,negative,here is the proof ive been looking for   marvel needs to stop making superhero movies  13 on rotten tomatoes is 14 points higher then id rate this piece of marvel trash
Feb 25 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie and i thought all the actresses did very well ive seen it twice now and it unfolds like fanfiction i would really like to see a sequel that ties this movie to the venomverse
Feb 25 2024,positive,the movie was great great back story it shows a different side of the spider verse the movie shows her origin story why she was able to see the future of things to come loved the little hints about ben having to be responsible for peter parker movie was awesome dont know why its getting such bad reviews i believe people should just watch and enjoy instead of nitpicking
Feb 25 2024,positive,madame web isnt bad but its not good either very generic and forgettable i think superhero films in general have run their course
Feb 25 2024,negative,i honestly dont understand how producersstudio execs saw this and said yup thats the one release it in theaters
Feb 25 2024,positive,it may have made for a great tv series the film has momentum a few scenes where the three teen characters were out of character but it all came to great story telling
Feb 25 2024,positive,very good very good story
Feb 25 2024,positive,i do not care how cheesy it was sure the villain and the end scene sucked but it was extremely entertaining never the less the script could definitely have been written better and i wish they had a completely different casting for the villain
Feb 25 2024,negative,what the f did i just watch im so confusedi wasted 14843 seconds for this i watched the whole thing and it made me more confused than to actually understand her so called story we dont talk abt the bqd cgi
Feb 25 2024,positive,movie was an entertaining origin story that isnt as bad as everyone is making out to be
Feb 24 2024,positive,i liked the action and the plot
Feb 24 2024,negative,horrible what happened to marvel what a decadence 
Feb 24 2024,positive,lots of action liked story as well
Feb 24 2024,positive,i go to the movies to be entertained and i personally enjoyed the movie the critics dont know what they are talking about i hope they make another one
Feb 24 2024,negative,ngl i went in knowing it was going to be bad but i didnt think it would be this bad the movie is filled with plot holes and confusing scenes in addition to poorly written characters i had a hard time cheering on any of the characters because they were all pretty awful in their own right probably best to skip this one
Feb 24 2024,negative,written by illiterate children
Feb 24 2024,positive,the movie was good it was interesting and the action was great the cast was brilliant its worth seeing 
Feb 24 2024,positive,it was a nice kid friendly movie  refreshing to not have sex scenes and profanity that young people will be seeing
Feb 24 2024,negative,the script for this movie is really bad its filled with plot holes and cringey moments that do nothing for the story ive seen better fan made youtube movies than this trash 
Feb 24 2024,negative,yet another marvel fail at this point they just need to give up    the ship has sailed what made the marvel movies fun and exciting is completely gone
Feb 24 2024,positive,really enjoyed the film the story line was gripping straight from the start really well made and all questions were answered  fingers crossed there is a sequel
Feb 24 2024,neutral,i think a lot of the reputation and reviews were quite harsh for this movie i thought it was an okay movie overall there were a good many parts i enjoyed and thought was well done in the movie most of this was regarding the first 23s of trying to come to terms with the powers the train confusion was done well for example as it showed the state of disorientation the main character was in with the audience just as disoriented   the lack of the villain characterisation and motivation made the movie weaker the end also felt a bit rushed   overall the mystery and understanding of the powers kept me pretty engaged for most of the movie with the end needing to be fleshed out   overall i would give it 510 was decent enough for 1 watch
Feb 24 2024,negative,marvel needs to take spiderman rights back from sony these spiderman related films by sony not marvel are horrible they cannot make a film without marvel guiding them it keeps getting proven dont waste your time on this movie was a total dissappintment
Feb 24 2024,neutral,not the worst recent marvel movie you can only hope that they shot some of the sequel at the same time doesnt look like sony is willing to spend more money on this
Feb 24 2024,positive,it was a good origin story
Feb 24 2024,positive,i thought the film was pretty good madame web dont really have a origin story and sony made it ppl say spider bite original not what i saw her mother was bitten by spider she was born after and illness is mentioned maybe this creeps up on her even tho in this states mother trying to save her daughter and she does go blind towards end think the villain needed work as didnt really follow the spiderman knock off suit was but cleashay  other than thought was entertaining and the link to parkers that not many i guess caught was pretty cleaver tbh
Feb 24 2024,positive,a light hero romp through dc tv style storytelling storytelling or character interaction being a kind of focus instead of action
Feb 24 2024,neutral,when i saw the trailer and read about the stellar cast for madame web i was incredibly excited but after watching the movie im unsure how to feel on one hand the story lacked depth or complexity and there were not as many action sequences as i had hoped the movie failed to deliver much excitement and was occasionally dull however on the flip side i loved the themes of motherhood love and growth throughout and the cast was amazing i didnt hate or love the movie it kind of just falls in the middle it was sweet and a bit boring  it didnt feel like this movie was a waste of time and it was better than some of marvels recent works its not anything close to iron man or any of the movies leading up to no way home but it beats the eternals and the marvels
Feb 24 2024,positive,fun movie really good
Feb 24 2024,positive,i dont think it was completely bad  some of the actresses where not great at acting  and the writing was not amazing but can honestly say its not the worst movie i have watched in the past year or two
Feb 24 2024,negative,madame web disappoints on multiple fronts stumbling through a convoluted plot that struggles to find its narrative footing the characters lack depth leaving audiences disconnected and indifferent to their fates the cinematography feels uninspired with scenes lacking the visual flair that could have elevated the movie its a missed opportunity for a compelling exploration of the madame web character as the film falls flat in delivering a captivating and engaging experience
Feb 24 2024,negative,sony please give the rights to spiderman to the mcu not that the mcu is really doing great at the moment but even secret invasion wasnt this bad clearly sony is completely incompetent and destroying a beloved franchise    booooo   literally throws rotten tomatoes at sony executives
Feb 24 2024,positive,stupendous   i loved it  the best movie of   this year  i will watch it again  fantastic  emotional   i love the characters   i will give it 100 score on rotten tomatoes   
Feb 24 2024,positive,good movie but no easter eggs at the end
Feb 24 2024,positive,loved this movie very action packed
Feb 24 2024,positive,great but could be better
Feb 24 2024,positive,it was a great movie and the cast was great but it was a very heavy movie and it felt like a movie without a budget it didnt have the action of a marvel movie and it was also a bit confusing at times
Feb 24 2024,positive,i went with my son expecting not to enjoy this one as much as other marvel moviesbut i was wrong it turned out to be a very interesting movie with good characters that keep you at times on the edge of your seat i recommend this one to all ages
Feb 24 2024,negative,i wanted to see if this movie is as bad as they say wow wow its so bad even morbius looks in comparison like the movie generic boring bad story plotholes cringy acting trash dialogs and no positives last act is almost parody aggressive product placement streaming quality but only when you drunk enough stay away this is very very very bad film everyone associated with the production of this crp writers director editors sound team cgi crew even most actors should be banned from working in their professions we have the worst movie of 2024 and nothing will change that again and no  its no so bad its good type
Feb 24 2024,positive,i was expecting much worse based on the reviews i have to admit i was mildly entertained
Feb 24 2024,positive,super entertaining and seriously underrated
Feb 24 2024,positive,madame web delivers a captivating cinematic experience with stellar performances that elevate the storyline the casts great acting prowess brings depth to the characters and the wellcrafted storyline keeps you hooked surprisingly amidst the suspense the movie sprinkles moments of comedy that provide a refreshing balance making madame web an entertaining and engaging watch a mustsee for those who appreciate a blend of great acting a compelling storyline and unexpected comedic gems
Feb 24 2024,neutral,well it was definitely bad but i still had fun
Feb 24 2024,negative,this movie could been better
Feb 24 2024,negative,they had some decent scenes but overall the movie was just so bad and the dialogue did not match up with what they were mouthing half the time
Feb 24 2024,negative,i am completely blown away this was even allowed to see the light of day acting sucked  characters as whole sucked dialogue was so damn wonky its sad for a big budget film to come off as if they didnt have a care in the world on how this movie does godbless all those who worked on it but my god this is not good and never will be sony needs to take this out back and put it down
Feb 24 2024,positive,the movie was pretty nice went in with low expectation but it was better than expected to be honest better than a lot of mcu action filled and cgi movies
Feb 24 2024,negative,honestly dont waste your time they poorly edited it the majority of the time and there is more plot holes then an entire years worth of swiss cheese theres a insanely obvious last minute cut in the first five minutes of the movie one minute the moms talking next minute shes in pain mid word voice acting is beyond poor the acting in general was poor so many things happened in the story that just made absolutely no sense missing parts of the story so the big emotional scenes are more funny then genuinely sad at one point the main character just leaves her coworker with three teenagers casually and goes to the amazon forest up on a whim and nobody batted an eye you only get two scenes where you see the characters with powers and in costume besides the main character having her all seeing future ability you just get glimpses and you hope the story gets there and it never does they give you the tiniest snippet at the end and that was it they give you hopes your gonna see some cool action and you never do another point the only way the main character did any damage was by driving into people the main character hit the bad dude a good 3 times with a vehicle and the bad guy just casually gets up the enemy somehow withstood a point blank blow from an explosion and got up the story had easily guessable plot points oh no danger i can see whats going to happen i must save them easily was 70 of the movie im pretty sure at one point a cat walked through a closed window when filming if the audio isnt moviequality they will rerecord the lines in the studio and edit them into the video so its less filming and you can very easily tell they did it in this movie there were some points where the lip syncing was not matching the audio i was hearing i may have hearing problems but it was so bad there were some points where you can tell they just copy  paste the audio onto the video file and put lipstick on a pig  its just a bad movie in general and not the fun bad where you get a laugh its just bad
Feb 24 2024,negative,this movie made me wanted to not live 
Feb 24 2024,positive,i dont know why the people hate the movie for me it was amazing i think what not many understood about the movie is that it is not the typical action plot of just fighting and winning it is surviving the villain by not having experience therefore it turns it into a suspense thriller and even a mystery that leaves you biting your nails so yes dont expect to see consecutive fights and multiple blows because remember that it is an origin movie well everyone will have a different opinion of the movie but give it a chance you wont be disappointed
Feb 24 2024,negative,i walked out first 10 min glad it was a free ticket
Feb 24 2024,positive,the build up was a little long
Feb 24 2024,positive,great movie quite entertaining and refreshing plot hope to see more of this universe
Feb 24 2024,positive,peak film watched it 3000 times absolutely loved it first movie to sell one trillion tickets
Feb 24 2024,negative,trailer over sold what the movie actual was
Feb 24 2024,positive,the movie is entertaining your typical superhero movie not sure why all the hate
Feb 24 2024,positive,i think people were expecting to see more action and for her to be using her powers to me this movie was more like her background and how she came to be personally i enjoyed it
Feb 24 2024,negative,horrible worst superhero movie in years
Feb 24 2024,negative,this film is a bullshit
Feb 24 2024,positive,my 6yr daughter and i loved it perfect movie for mother and daughter night
Feb 24 2024,positive,wasnt incredible but wasnt any where near what rt rated it excited for the second movie out of 10 id give it a 5 an average movie
Feb 24 2024,negative,how you make a superhero movie w no superheroes
Feb 24 2024,negative,it just wasnt great acting seemed bad very predictable and corny if there was a bad decision to be made by the characters they made it i was annoyed most of the film theres obviously going to be more films with this story line i am not even remotely interested i have no issue with female led movies but this seemed like that was the only reason for the film dear marvel this was terrible
Feb 24 2024,negative,i saw the movie in a dolby cinema screening and i was very disappointed i entered the cinema with excitements because i thought it was connected with spiderman and i liked the trailer a lot a lot of people hated it the open scene was already bad the camera movement made me dizzy and the way they were zooming on the faces was terrible after that i saw that the movie played in the year 2003 and i knew at that moment that this was not going to be like a spiderman movie the villain was terrible he wanted to kill three girls and that was his whole plan what if he did would the movie end also dakota johnson had no chemistry at all with the other girls the movie had no plot twist that was feeling like one the ending was horrible because they didnt actually show the three girls as heroes if you still plan to watch it dont spend extra money on any premium format for example imax dolby cinema 4dx or screen x
Feb 24 2024,negative,madame webb unfortunately falls short of expectations delivering a lackluster experience that may be considered the weakest entry in sonys marvel lineup the films plot is uninspired and fails to captivate lacking the depth and intrigue that are characteristic of successful superhero movies the narrative meanders without a clear direction making it difficult for viewers to remain engaged overall madame webb is a disappointing addition to the marvel universe failing to deliver the excitement and entertainment that fans have come to expect
Feb 24 2024,negative,madame web falls disappointingly short of the mark in a genre thats become synonymous with spectacle and depth this latest addition to the superhero cinematic universe feels both undercooked and overstuffed failing to weave the compelling narrative its namesake suggests despite a promising premise that hints at the exploration of the mystic and the multiverse the film meanders through a convoluted plot that struggles to find its footing     the screenplay is a patchwork of missed opportunities with dialogues that often border on the banal robbing the characters of the depth and complexity they deserve the protagonist meant to be a beacon of power and mystery is rendered with a surprising lack of charisma and gravitas leaving much to be desired in a performance that fails to captivate     visually the movie attempts to dazzle but instead delivers a series of cgiladen sequences that feel more like a retread of betterexecuted spectacles in its genre the action scenes which should have been the films saving grace are instead predictable and lack the inventiveness or thrill that fans have come to expect     the direction is equally lackluster with a pacing that oscillates between rushed and dragging never quite finding the right rhythm to engage the audience fully this uneven tempo combined with a storyline rife with plot holes and unearned twists makes for a viewing experience that is both confusing and unsatisfying    in its ambition to expand the universe and delve into lesserknown characters madame web ultimately spreads itself too thin lacking the focus and narrative drive to make a lasting impact what could have been a bold exploration of destiny and the web of fate feels instead like a missed connection leaving fans longing for the depth and dynamism that this character truly deserves in the end madame web is a forgettable detour in an otherwise rich and vibrant landscape a stark reminder that not all that glitters in the superhero genre is gold
Feb 24 2024,positive,honestly really enjoyed it an easier movie to keep up than other marvel films not sure why its so negatively reviewed but i would 100 recommend it
Feb 24 2024,negative,it was incredibly cringy
Feb 23 2024,positive,its good it wasnt marvel level good but thats because its not disney marvel its sony it was entertaining and had funny moments its worth seeing

Feb 23 2024,negative,insanely dated and awful vfxediting but if youre going to watch a really dumb movie and have a fun time it gets the job done
Feb 23 2024,positive,theme   overall  idea was good  you cant tell it was a low budget film    not worth full price  good family movie

Feb 23 2024,negative,i wish i had the power of premonition so that i could saved my time from watching this
Feb 23 2024,positive,i definitely think this movie is being over hatted yes there are some scenes that are predictable and the beginning is bad nonetheless the movie can ne enjoyable for some
Feb 23 2024,negative,another boss chick showing how its done
Feb 23 2024,positive,i honestly cant understand much hate about this movie its truth there are a lot of thing that could have done better some ideas where not really appropriate for the spiderverse but its a origin movie of a character who doesnt have a great story development in comics    the movie is far away to be the most fantastic ever there are connections that could have been developed but it tells a nice story with a great acting of dakota johnson
Feb 23 2024,negative,worse than a waste of time poor editing poor writing  just poor
Feb 23 2024,positive,dakota johnson carried this movie its not a bad movie buts not great either did not care for the bad guys performance it was like he was just reading the lines no reacting involved
Feb 23 2024,negative,this movie had no reason to exist at least some people got paid to feed their families
Feb 23 2024,positive,i thought this film was really good and i dont understand the hate its getting i thought they did see into the future mechanic really well
Feb 23 2024,negative,i actually left the film to go let a staff member know the audio was out of sync with the video only to be told that was the quality of the film and was due to adr they did for the villian of the film i had to look it up adr is automated dialogue replacement it felt like this film was written by ai as well as having audio replaced by it because it was a lifeless corpse of a movie with zero intrigue i couldnt tell you any characters name except cassie web and the other main character pepsicola
Feb 23 2024,positive,corny and predictable needed a better ending and timeline
Feb 23 2024,positive,simply an amazing movie best superhero film since end game and no way home i was glued to the screen all the way through thinking wow this looks awesome and why has every said its rubbish i dont know i thoroughly loved it and will never listen to anyone ever again you know when you are blind to the petty stuff people get hung up on it turns out its just a really good movie
Feb 23 2024,positive,liked the action  hated the fact that the main characters were in their costumes so little of the time when the pics on the  web were the same amount as in the film was just too few
Feb 23 2024,negative,that was wasnt good the dialoguethe plot the whole thing a train wreck 
Feb 23 2024,negative,i couldnt watch it in the theaters  scary demon audience and dakota johnson makes absolutely no sense as cassandra webb other than a seriously sick terror film  i couldnt stand any of the babypregnancy scenes  found the first 15 minutes i watched appalling  the car crashing into the water and near death experience that unlocked her so called abilities is a completely out of line sequence in my book
Feb 23 2024,positive,lazy writing unfortunately but entertaining for young audiences how did she become professor x
Feb 23 2024,positive,good movie was good not that bad i love dakota johnson she good actress the action was great in it 
Feb 23 2024,positive,it was a great movie better then expected

Feb 23 2024,negative,zero stars was not an option
Feb 23 2024,positive,madam web was a great movie  i could relate a lot because i survived foster care  i also enjoyed watching the powerpuffgirls  90s spidermancartoons  honestly it reminded me of marwilliamson if she was in the finaldestinationmovies  watching madam web last tuesday night at highland square w my current favorite ex polyamorous sisterwife  this married couple i met at the bar recently was a fun experience my ex sisterwife  i were laughing crying experiencing the roller coaster  thrills of the movie  the married couple not so much
Feb 23 2024,positive,dont believe the bad reviews  this was a great movie its up there with the rest of the marvel movies   dont pass up on it you will not be disappointed  my daughter and i almost didnt go because we had read the bad reviews too  we are fans of dakota and decided to go regardless and glad we did we would of missed out   not in one moment did i feel like i needed to get up and leave  not sure why this movie is not getting the support it deserves
Feb 23 2024,negative,two wordssydney sweeney
Feb 23 2024,positive,well it wasnt perfect i enjoyed the action the story and suspense
Feb 23 2024,negative,absolutely death sentence for the film industry   i cant believe people have wasted money on something like this 
Feb 23 2024,positive,i believe the movie was really good and i dont get what the fuss is about yes its not an adaptation or retelling of a comic book but the story is very good and overall enjoyable a bit cheesy a times and our only complaint being the rushed amazon sections as well as the kids powers but aside from that 55
Feb 23 2024,negative,i went in hoping it wasnt as bad as everyone was sayingand everyone was right the script felt like it was written by a middle schooler and the acting was just cringe
Feb 23 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie and i hope to see more of the characters in the future marvel movies
Feb 23 2024,positive,for the most part the main villain was rather forgettable and unassuming certain points felt rushed along and the dialogue seemed abnormally simple and repetitive
Feb 23 2024,negative,sony im sorry for what i said about morbius
Feb 23 2024,positive,i love everything about this movie it was completely and 100 amazing and the cast is amazing as well i cant wait to buy it 
Feb 23 2024,positive,im not a comic book reader but know they changed madame web    the film isnt dreadful nor stunning i liked parts of it but just as many parts were cheesy and cringe worthy    i like dakota tho
Feb 23 2024,negative,it was not great didnt love it at all much
Feb 23 2024,negative,this is the first review i have written to come on and tell you all it was bad the end was very cheesy the lips didnt seem to line up with the sound sometimes like they rerecorded it some plot point seemed very rushed also felt like the villain didnt really have any depth it was great concept that just seemed to not be done right still better than human centipede
Feb 23 2024,positive,i enjoyed it tbh plenty of flaws like i think they tried to make the end too typically action and it failed but on the whole it was a refreshing approach to the superhero genre the trip to peru would have made more sense as a vision but its just a few plot problems they all have them just enjoy the good stuff there was plenty
Feb 23 2024,negative,sickingly bad story
Feb 22 2024,positive,surprisingly good got emotionally involved and liked the ensemble
Feb 22 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i went in blind i had not seen trailers or anything beforehand i enjoyed the story line as well and it was a very action packed movie     my only criticism is that it is somewhat forgettable towards the ending    also i can understand how if someone was expecting a marvel type spiderman movie they would be disappointed i was happy it wasnt that
Feb 22 2024,positive,pretty good movie would have liked more action but other than that its pretty good
Feb 22 2024,positive,it was better than expected based on all the poor reviews its not stellar not making any top ten lists for anyones favorite movies not the old marvel quality but better than a lot of the dc movies its sony  yes the plot is rushed in parts of course there will be plot holes but it was entertaining  for the most part definitely one you can wait to stream
Feb 22 2024,negative,oh my oh mydear oh deari lasted only 45 minutes of this sheer torturesimply awful awful awfuldear sony please stop nowover and out
Feb 22 2024,negative,zero stars isnt an option
Feb 22 2024,negative,not the worst movie ever made but that doesnt make it great either meh
Feb 22 2024,negative,wasted potential sad
Feb 22 2024,positive,overall really liked it  the how do you know you can climb a wall unless you try scene had me in absolute stitches    is it cheesy yes but thats also kind of great sometimes     i loved how they visualized the future telling  and tying it into the web of destiny    only a few misses for me   should have made the last scene the post credit scene    what were those glasses at the end
Feb 22 2024,positive,i thought this was flawed but way better than reviews say   the first 40 min were great  it just started to fall apart after mw returns to the jungle   and yes the villain sucked and the teenage girls were totally underutilized but dakotas banter was fun ive seen much worse
Feb 22 2024,negative,one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life so far words cannot even describe how torturous it was for me to have to sit through this in the movie theatre i may have to sign up for trauma based therapy to cope
Feb 22 2024,negative,does not deserve to be called film
Feb 22 2024,negative,unfortunately one only finds out very close to the end that this is nothing but a prequel to another movie with more girlie marvel heroines this said this movie here doesnt say much on its own the fact that the extra dollars for the dbox seat movements i had spent being a complete waste of money pretty much shows that there is way too much teen girlie talk and too little action the movie isnt really bad but it is surely nothing worth to waste your time for to watch it in a cinema unless you are a girl of 14 years of age 310 points ps except for the villain the acting of everybody else among this cast was pretty lousy i feel that marvel has reached the end of the rope
Feb 22 2024,negative,just trash a waste of money and time a joke
Feb 22 2024,neutral,i wouldnt say it was worse than any of the other sony marvel films but not better either i liked the premise but didnt think they explored it too well with none of the heroes having any offensive powers or fighting skills a lot of the confrontation was just running and crashing cars i enjoyed the glimpses of the girls costumes we saw very comic accurate there wasnt any explanation as to what the web actually was or how cassies powers work not even a single reference to her as madame web i liked the found family concept between cassie and the girls but felt there wasnt enough time exploring it also too many teasers about the fact that ben is ben parker and his nephew peter being born without anybody actually saying last name or the babys name when you make it that obvious its just annoying when you cant just say it out loud 
Feb 22 2024,negative,worst of the worse do not watch waste of money and time
Feb 22 2024,positive,seems like the so called critics have become bored as they continue to berate comic book movies these movies are not meant for them this movie is a good movie as it sets up the story it is not bad as the critics say it is they seem to lean toward r rated movies and most people just wait to stream because its in their budget
Feb 22 2024,negative,worst hero movie of all time
Feb 22 2024,negative,without question this is the worst superhero of 2024
Feb 22 2024,negative,i am not going to waste my time on this garbage
Feb 22 2024,negative,not great but better than expected 
Feb 22 2024,positive,dont compare to other marvel movies  as it is a great stand alone movie with a lot of suspense and keeps your interest
Feb 22 2024,negative,had to walk out and could not finish watching
Feb 22 2024,positive,loved dont let the opinion of chronically online brain rots tell you this movie is bad it amazing and i will be seeing it again
Feb 22 2024,negative,it really is absolutely god awful its shite
Feb 22 2024,positive,this film was not as bad as people are saying i liked it there were hot girls and they did their thing haters gonna hate i got your back dakota
Feb 22 2024,negative,i mean i dont even have the words to describe how absolutely terrible of a superhero movie this was
Feb 22 2024,positive,this origin story was expertly executed even someone with no previous knowledge of this character will be captivated the story line moves at a perfect pace and the actors did an excellent job personifying their characters this is one of the first marvel movies in a long time that left me excited to see what comes next i was only surprised at how few people where actually at the theater the critics reviews definitely did not match up with what i experienced and im glad i went to see it anyway because me and the other 7 people that went with me to the theater all left wondering how this movie can be that good and not be getting more attention  hollywood the critics are unfairly killing your industry its time for a change and this movie is a perfect example of that heres to hoping we get some sequals to this awesome movie
Feb 22 2024,positive,it wasnt terrible it did have some pacing issues i dont have an issue with female leads which i think a lot of the bad reviewers have
Feb 22 2024,positive,i know it could of been way better but i liked it the ending could of had a little more the cgi on the spider was on point
Feb 22 2024,negative,i thought the villains voice was dubbed it sounded so bad  wow i like most movies but this was unwatchable  love adam scott in everything and just saw dakota on snl which was great but what possessed them after reading this script to do this movie ugh
Feb 22 2024,negative,this movie makes kraven the hunter feel like good will hunting compared to this where was morbius
Feb 22 2024,negative,its a shame not a movie
Feb 22 2024,negative,listen my precious little ravioli this film couldnt have been worse i know damn well there wasnt no damn script they put them girls into costumes and said just go with it say whatever you want awful horrible ehstupah the very opposite of iconic this movie is like the potato salad at the cookout aint nobody want that bland sht this movie actually stressed me out so now i gotta go take a nice hot bubba bash ugh god love ya  seriously dont watch it this movie was a joke 
Feb 22 2024,negative,marvel isnt even trying anymore they just put out anything to stay relevant but by doing that no one wants to watch their movies anymore it used to be so much fun to go see the new marvel movies in theaters and now its just a disappointment with ai dialogue
Feb 22 2024,negative,this movie gets half a star for having sydney sweeney it fails in every other category including utilizing her 
Feb 22 2024,negative,sony hits a new low with madame web which is truly one of the worst comic book movies of recent memory this movie has terrible dialogue acting and story and not much redeemable about it i do feel like it is often unintentionally funny and i had some fun because of how awful it was so maybe it could work for a bad movie night i know many were super hard on morbius but this movie makes that movie look a lot better because if you think it couldnt get worse it absolutely could aside from all of this the movie is just boring the action scenes are minimal and the story just didnt grab me with its characters or plot intrigue overall it is a movie that is so bad that it actually may even be worth seeing but a definite reminder that comic movies need an extended break
Feb 22 2024,negative,trashed movie like marvel  came out    last year
Feb 22 2024,negative,i firmly believe it had potential but took a pitiful turn the cast is good but the script lacks the soul of superhero movies it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth and i think it aspired to more than it could deliver it took hasty steps with the intention of establishing a new streak of hero movies and that almost seems like a project of film students who have not even started the career the script is bad and has many gaps there was a base idea that could have been very good but took the wrong path the special effects are weak and low budget the villain is stupid and seems like a bad joke the main characters feel empty and plastic i feel sorry for it because i had faith in the superhero genre and thought it could bring something fresh to the spiderman universe but it didnt and its very sad because it has good actors and could have been a fresh movie and while not groundbreaking it could have been more than it is
Feb 22 2024,positive,i liked madame web  it was fun to watch and it actually had some nice themes  ignore the critics and view this movie with an open mind
Feb 22 2024,positive,my family and i thoroughly enjoyed the movie i went in with zero expectations and was pleasantly surprised other than a few mismatched diaglouge scenes with the villain i thought the storyline was good and i liked the characters
Feb 22 2024,positive,wasnt nearly as bad as the critics and fanboys are making it sound it was a bit slow with minimal fighting and an abundance of dialogue the acting wasnt terrible but i also wouldnt tout it as anything great i think its worth a free viewing once it hits tv
Feb 22 2024,positive,i didnt think it was that bad i liked it and had fun it was sort of similar to venom in that no one can mention spiderman but it is clearly related great cast and fun action just dont take yourself or the movie too seriously p
Feb 22 2024,positive,it was better than morbius lol
Feb 22 2024,positive,the movie is solid  no overplayed campiness or humor  web character develops nicely in layers  no drawn out sequences  it is an origin story that gives you the purpose of the main character  it isnt an over the top hero movie with huge action scenes  well done
Feb 22 2024,positive,i thought it was well done went with an openminded attitude and was surprised it was fun and entertaining
Feb 22 2024,negative,15 not the worst movie ive ever seen or the most boring either it only kept my attention for the first and only viewing due to how jarring some of it is yet that doesnt make it a good movie or some style id like to see i watch most films only once so i wouldnt watch this again or some other films however i find this film as watchable as the marvels but thats a low low bar
Feb 22 2024,positive,i thought it was great it had a lots of action and a really complex plot its everything id want to see in a movie it was very complex with lots of mind twists i liked it because it was something new with a totally new idea and spin on the spiderverse plots i love the other spider verse movies but this definitely has a fresh perspective i though was very refreshing it absolutely does not deserve the hate the acting was good and i was on the edge of my seat the whole time i hope more people go to see it and they can make up their own minds on the movie great story great  plot great acting i hope more people give it a watch
Feb 22 2024,positive,i dont know how much i was laughing with the film vs laughing at the film but all i know is i had a great time on the surface this film is a trainwreck filled with silly special effects cringeinducing dialogue poorly developed characters who make inane decisions and one character whose lines are so badly dubbed over it will distract you from the first scene but when you look closer it seems very likely that at least some of the people involved were trying to make this film as a comedy leaning into the absurdity of the story and the dumb plot dakota johnson seems to be going for intentional laughs not only in scenes where her character is cracking jokes but also in ones where she has onesided conversations with a bird or a cat awkwardly advancing the plot in laughable fashion yes this movie is very dumb in so many ways but it seems like at least johnson and director sj clarkson who has directed some of the best tv of the last 20 years including season 4 of dexter and season 1 of succession know how dumb the film is and really lean into it to provide an uproariously fun time its no mistake that cassandra tells her three wards dont do dumb things before leaving them alone in the woods for three hours knowing full well these teens are bound to do something absolutely idiotic nor is it an accident that the product placement is woven so prominently into the fabric of the story that it almost serves as a deus ex machina the studio clearly wasnt in on the joke or they wouldnt have excised the films most notorious trailer line from the final film  you know the one about ezekiel sims having been with her mother in the amazon where she was studying spiders right before she died but try as they might the innate camp of the film shines through making this an instant cult classic in the vein of howard the duck and steel before it if youre into that sort of thing head to the theater with a likeminded group of friends and youll have a blast 5 freaking stars
Feb 22 2024,negative,this movie makes me believe in magic magic is the only thing would allow dakota johnson and sydney sweeney to be alisters in movies sorry for the hate im sure they are lovely people but they are awful to watch just like this movie hey ive got a great idea lets light a firework factory on fire and then climb up to the roof whats the worst thing that could happen oh yeah and the fireworks are as powerful as missiles and can blow up a helicopter and another thing this brilliant idea ends up killing the helicopter pilot who we called in to save us but whatever     i never really use the term complete garbage but this is where the shoe fits
Feb 22 2024,neutral,the dialogue was unrealistic the supercool suit designs were probably on screen for one minute the villain is not complex and even so his whole motive is a cliche with no actual movie like substance and the climatic ending wasnt that enjoyable overall its just entertaining enough to get a group through two hours of watching characters that are hard to connect to if you make jokes every 15 minutes with your party
Feb 22 2024,positive,could have come to part where they learned and used powers earlier
Feb 22 2024,negative,all i have to say is yikes  were they even trying  the lack of effort put into this movie was apparent throughout the entire movie
Feb 22 2024,positive,it is so good the first act is a bit fast but the movie is so good the only bad thing are visions vfx they are a bit bad but not much 4 stars
Feb 22 2024,negative,ughhhhhhhhhhhh    ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh    who let this movie get released    saying that the cast was phoning it in is an insult to phones everyone in this film clearly did not want to be there in the slightest though dakota johnson is getting rightfully called out for it there is a glimmer of personality in the few scenes where they lean into the dry humor the worst offender is tahar rahim who plays the villain ezekiel sims aka evil spiderman for some reason half of the time it sounds like he recorded his lines in a vocal booth and they were dubbed over the performance later the dialogue doesnt line up with his mouth and it all feels incredibly forced and awkward    the plot of the movie doesnt even really make sense and the way the story is told makes even less sense whats the point of the flashback at the beginning of the film if were gonna have to watch the main character painstakingly learn everything that we the audience already know and why make so many spiderman references without it even going anywhere its just a reminder that there are three franchises worth of better movies we could be watching    okay a few rapidfire complaints the teenage girls are very obviously twentysomethings acting like awkward idiots the whole time it was stupid as fuck to cast adam scott who is known for playing ben wyatt on parks and rec as another character named fucking ben why the fuck do the jungle spider people speak english    unless you really want to laugh at an absolutely terrible film do not see this movie
Feb 22 2024,positive,its fine people relax lol
Feb 21 2024,negative,this movie makes the human centipede look like a masterpiece i truly cannot believe sony could mess up a spider man related movie this bad but i guess i was wrong
Feb 21 2024,positive,first off not sure why so much hate for this movie considering the recent marvel flops this one stood its ground thats not to say there werent issues because there were several that stuck out to me 1 not sure what rolepurpose the 3 young girls played it was pretty much just filler to me 2 not sure why emma roberts was even in this movie maybe  im missing a marvel clue 3 why did dakota johnson appear to be smiling at the most inappropriate times throughout the film 4 considering dakotas character personality at the beginning of the movie the ending just did not vibe with that  other than those questions i had afterwards it was an entertaining film and glad i saw it in the theater
Feb 21 2024,positive,im all for girl power in action movies i thought it was well done i never read the comic so i didnt have anything to compare it to im not sure why its getting harsh critiques i thought it was well done and id watch the sequel if there is one
Feb 21 2024,positive,this movie was so good and had a spectacular storyline not only that this film have the best fitting cast ever emma roberts dakota johnson i wont understand the hate for this movie or tolerate it if youre scared to watch it because of the reviews and you dont want to waste your money like i worried i promise you if you walk in with a good mindset and ignore what the critics say you will love this movie as much as the rest of us it was perfectly lengthed suspenseful and had great writing not every movie has to be endgame level or nwh or any pivotal movie because thats what make them special but this movie was the perfect combination of not undermining endgame and enough to love just the same 100 recommended
Feb 21 2024,positive,to be honest it isnt as bad as most people thought to be and im one of those people that are easygoing when rating movies ive seen far worse corny superhero action movies and madame web is not one of them in my opinion i find the story to be straight forward mostly except at certain times character chemistry can need some more work at least the movie got the job done though in a kind of underwhelming way overall 710 not bad but couldve been way better in execution
Feb 21 2024,positive,i just watched this and all i can figure is that the critics are just looking for ways to bash marvel this movie was good was it guardians of the galaxy no but it was as good as any spawn movie so far it is worth the price of admission i think people are bashing on it cuz its female led im a 52 year old dude and it was a good time out for me
Feb 21 2024,positive,very enjoyable good telling of the origin story good villain good action tight script with no superfluous silliness and no over the top insanity as marvel films have suffered from lately heck yes to female leads and superheroes and to the critics i say its a comic book not shakespeare my wife and i came to the movie with no knowledge of the story or expectations and thought it was terrific from start to finish if you like marvel or superhero movies i think youll enjoy this
Feb 21 2024,positive,nice setup movie into future events it left the door wide open
Feb 21 2024,positive,i thought this movie was fairly decent 6510 though it feels a shame the 3 girls didnt get much screen time as their super hero counter parts it definitely set up a future movie and showed that there doesnt always need to be a strong hero to overcome threat and defeat a villain there was also some fairly creative parts to this movie were the 3 girls used a life and death lesson from a paramedic point of view lastly i would like to comment on how good the villain suit looked and his movement i thought was also brilliant in certain parts of the movie without spoiling it 
Feb 21 2024,positive,the movie was great 10010 i can say this movie was better than the avengers infinity war
Feb 21 2024,negative,nothing is good in this movie
Feb 21 2024,negative,i mean this was legitimately one of the worst big budget releases ever made    any critic that gave this anything above a 310 should be fired for either incompetence or for being paid off the people who gave it a positive review would be better off lobotomized
Feb 21 2024,positive,i wasnt expecting it to be this good i wouldnt trust other reviews saying its bad see the movie for yourself
Feb 21 2024,negative,ended up leaving the movie early hard to watch poor acting bad story transitions too much to put very disappointing
Feb 21 2024,negative,madame web  38  a cinematic experience that left me questioning marvels stamp of approval sonys was the lead in production and they didnt fare much better as it suffered from an unfortunate casting choice with sydney sweeney known for her bombshell image attempting to portray a sweet innocent teenager the result a film that struggled to be taken seriously evoking unintentional laughter from the audience during crucial scenes dakota johnsons attempt at dry sarcastic humor earned some points but when it came to emotional depth the laughter continued the lead villains peruvian accent added an unfortunate layer sounding more awkward than menacing the plot unfortunately didnt offer much excitement and felt overly simplistic as the story unfolded the theater was met with a corny ending that had the entire audience cracking up  not the reaction one hopes for in a marvelassociated film despite the inclination to give it the benefit of the doubt the 13 percent rating i had seen elsewhere seemed more reflective of the reality in the end madame web was a cinematic disappointment and one i regret giving a chance official sundaynightstreaming rating of 38
Feb 21 2024,positive,i really liked this movie and found it refreshing that it was not totally marvelesque although i do love a good marvel movie while a few of the lines early in the movie felt a bit forced i thought all of the actresses and actors did a nice job and i enjoyed it thoroughly
Feb 21 2024,negative,so stupid its like a 6th grader wrote the script i love marvel movies but this movie had a dumb plot it was very shallow there wasnt a lot of depth to the characters so awful they need to remove the movie and start with a new writer and a more experienced director   so bummed that this wasnt  even an okay movie
Feb 21 2024,negative,small spoiler    good concept bad execution acting was less than standard sitcom dialogue was worse and people were announcing inner thoughts if it was an attempt at a quip please look up good examples or dont use ai to generate these lines it feels like nobody did a proofread or even looked at the takes bad guy tried to put on a bad guy voice theres other ways to seem like a killer if spiderman was around during this time why not make a reference saying i thought spiderman was a good guy why did go psycho could have been a trademark issue still mentioning pop culture or any material isnt a crime     im going to reiterate that you dont need to announce a thought or idea the character is having if youre going to show behavior implying this its useless and makes the characters seem dumber than they actually are    scenes that could be better intro into amazon whole thing any suitcase scene she doesnt need to say anything just bring in the notes closer if youre trying to make an uncle ben moment maybe there should have been more focus on that character rather than a three line conversation and a background shot    you know what go watch a pixar film nobody should give the time of day on this if the director wasnt going to
Feb 21 2024,negative,what was that yikes
Feb 21 2024,positive,the storyline leads with a cliffhanger but was well made and i enjoyed the action and cinematography
Feb 21 2024,negative,its should be a crime to watch this film nothing more nothing less
Feb 21 2024,positive,signed up to rotten tomatoes just so i could rate this movie i think its getting a bad rap there were elements of the acting that werent great the dubbing was poorly executed and i think some scenes were poorly directed however i really liked the overall story line and the suspenseful nature of the story kept me interested through the whole movie i wouldnt mind another movie with these characters perhaps with a bit better dialogue
Feb 21 2024,positive,it was a very good movie im happy i went and seen it money well spent
Feb 21 2024,negative,a couple of the dumbest scenes and most unrealistic scenes i have ever seen yes even for a comic book movie
Feb 21 2024,positive,a lot of hate about the movie and not only but i say its pretty ok it has potential dakota johnson has potential and her character could be better highlighted if a good script was thought and not written on the kneesi say go to the cinema to see it
Feb 21 2024,negative,another terrible marvel movie with bad cgi lazy writing and bland characters when will they understand that we are tired of this garbage there is an oversaturation of superhero movies we want normal movies
Feb 21 2024,negative,id give this film zero stars if i could it was an absolute train wreck god awful acting and the script was absolute garbage dakota johnson cant act period
Feb 21 2024,positive,much better than i expected as it was quite interesting and somewhat suspenseful    glad i saw it as was thinking of skipping it due to some poor reviews
Feb 21 2024,positive,the villains motivations are a little forced but overall an enjoyable film not the worst of sonys offerings
Feb 21 2024,negative,painful to watch aggressively stupid and unbelievably nonsensical movie which is highly offensive to intelligent audiences  this movie would have worked better as a weird parody of superhero movies  believe me its  a cross between glenn or glenda and catwoman  but without the so bad its good charm an ed woods movie with a big budget written while he was at his deathbed
Feb 21 2024,positive,i did enjoy this film with great actors and actresses but its one of those films that not a lot of people would love and also wouldnt be in a rush to watch it again sydney sweeney was a standout for me
Feb 21 2024,negative,this movie was boring and could not hold the attention of a rock  the only interesting and thats going out on a limb was the very end where the three girls got their mojo  i hope they make a movie  with the three girls and let madame web remain in her web and not come out again
Feb 21 2024,positive,while this movie wasnt great i thought it passed the time alright maybe my expectations were a lot lower than other folks who went to see it it was a bit slow in parts and the acting and visual effects could have used a bit of polishing again while not the best movie it was far from the worst ive seen in the last year or two
Feb 21 2024,positive,i give the movie a c compared to the great marvel movies this is one of the few that was at the bottom of the list i  mean the best thing they could do is make a sequel to this particular one to get it right maybe this particular script was done the way it was on purpose for a better box office leap on the next one hmm well at least i  hope idk but i could have waited for that to stream on disney
Feb 21 2024,negative,several of my fav actresses are in movie but sadly it just did not work baffled how the movie was even launched at theaters still love dakota will give you a pass
Feb 21 2024,negative,no logicstory it had noting to watch
Feb 21 2024,negative,one of the most underwhelming superhero movie ive ever seen i went to see it with an open mind but it was boring and the worst superhero origin story you can imagine even the action scenes were bad a true disaster i dont understand how can a studio can release that
Feb 21 2024,negative,it made me laugh not gonna lieif you go and watch the movie ironically i think youll have a good time
Feb 21 2024,negative,save your money  the plot was paper thin the writing was bad  the acting was terrible  the cgi was not great either  everything depicted about the paramedic profession was more laughable  unrealistic than normal  the only positive is that maybe the audience has been educated in how to give chest compressions
Feb 21 2024,negative,sooo bad everything about this movie was bad bad actors bad storyline beyond disappointed
Feb 21 2024,positive,i actually enjoyed this more than the marvels the story to me was intriguing throwing in a ben parker storyline was cute particularly since we got to see the birth of peter parker overall it started off a bit weak but once cassies visions start they draw you in because you want to knowfigure out how they work the cgi and action scenes couldve been better either they seemed slow motion or the actors were afraid to do the stunts the same scene where las aranas crawled down the tree was shown more than once they couldve done that differently for their second on screen appearance
Feb 21 2024,positive,i went into this not really knowing what to expect spider man has been my favorite character since childhood so i pretty much know all of the players in the universe if youre looking for a superhero smash and fight movie this isnt it its more character driven with very little in the way of costumes does that make it bad like many of the reviews claim no just different to me its a bit refreshing to get something that tells a story without the action usually associated with superhero movies
Feb 21 2024,positive,amazing movie dont worry about plot or pacing or dialogue 
Feb 21 2024,negative,lazy script shallow characters too much convenience terrible direction complete disconnect from madame webs story
Feb 21 2024,negative,absolutely terrible
Feb 21 2024,negative,the film was boring and soulless it was a drag
Feb 21 2024,positive,absolutely loved the movie wish there was a sequel in the making
Feb 21 2024,negative,the script certainly needed tightening to inject some pace in an otherwise meandering movie which lacks humour and suspense or any engaging characters not an awful movie but not one to waste the price of a ticket on so better to wait for it to appear on a streaming platform
Feb 21 2024,negative,total mess from beginning to end
Feb 21 2024,positive,being a person who grew up a full on comic book lover of course i took my 15 yr old daughter to see it we loved it its a great origin story and i love the new take on how she became madam web dakota johnson is amazing as usual and spoiler alert i love the little how ins about peter parker and uncle ben i hope well see a second one in the not so distant future
Feb 21 2024,positive,just good its honestly better than what i was expecting for a b characters origin story the story didnt really try anything ground breaking but i thought the visuals were good also dialogue felt a little jumpy like reading an actual comic book if that was the intent then good on the writers 610
Feb 21 2024,positive,it was actually a decent movie i felt a little mislead by trailers because i was expecting something different from what it turned out to be but the end result was still alright
Feb 21 2024,negative,i didnt even watch it im js a hater
Feb 21 2024,negative,you could tell the writing was lacking and the story was in need of fine tuning while im sure some of the actors were just working with what they were given others you could tell werent really feeling it you can find some appeal if you can connect with the main characters and overlook the cringy moments special effects were decent enough the concept couldve been the making of a new franchise but ultimately i feel with this delivery this isnt going anywhere anytime soon
Feb 21 2024,negative,the movie dragged  wasnt excited about the movie
Feb 21 2024,positive,not bad her powers are not the typical flyingpunchingleaping great physical strength or moving at the speed of light it will be interesting to see where they go with the characters that were introduced if they do another movie on this i would see it hoping more will be revealed on how madames power will be fully expressed as well as the other three characters will she travel back to peru to gain more understanding to the layers of her gifts
Feb 21 2024,negative,worst movie i have ever seen choppy with painful dialog save your money the reviews are correct
Feb 21 2024,positive,so good i want to watch more
Feb 21 2024,positive,really enjoyed this the ending was a little weak but i had a genuinely good time
Feb 21 2024,positive,great movie definitely would watch it again
Feb 21 2024,positive,i thought there would be more webey stuff but otherwise i really enjoyed the plot
Feb 21 2024,negative,unbelievably bad a waste of time and money for all involved a career crusher a spiderman superhero movie made by people who dont watch superhero movies or read comic books dull borrows footage from spiderman 2 morbious made us groan threwout and somehow this is worse fifty shades of boogergreen bad fx bad dialogue bad pacing bad directing unmemorable characters sony should stop trying
Feb 21 2024,negative,the cgi was bad and the dialogue was terrible the ending was not real at all
Feb 21 2024,negative,lame no other word seems marvel is trying hard to turn into dc comics
Feb 21 2024,positive,good plot and action  terrible acting and dialog
Feb 21 2024,positive,definitely not as terrible as i was led to believe it would be but certainly not a strong film not much character development for many characters but an interesting premise with some good action and oneliners
Feb 21 2024,positive,i liked the basic premise behind the movie and found it to be kind of cerebral but there needed to be more about what she did in peru that enabled her to be able to control more when she got back encountering her mom and the reasoning behind her being in the peruvian jungle when she was so pregnant provided a needed piece of the story but did not explain her being able to control her mind powers any better the relationship between her and the girls was also kind of up in the air it was good but it left me wanting more backstory
Feb 21 2024,positive,i was not expecting it to be as good due to bad reviews so my expectations were low but great surprise it was good i would have liked more action but it told a story i recommend it was definitely 100 times better than the other super hero marvels movie
Feb 21 2024,negative,just an other bad movie
Feb 21 2024,positive,great for a sony movie i had low expectations and it exceeded them the worst part was the villain the guys acting was horrid i believe this is an instance in where the sequel could be better due to such a complicated setuporigin story
Feb 21 2024,positive,great to get a backstory for madame webb look forward to seeing the storyline develop
Feb 21 2024,positive,i liked the movie it wasnt marvels best movie by far but i liked better than the movie critics did it pretty much kept my attention for the 2 hours i hope it does get a sequel because it definitely sets one up
Feb 21 2024,positive,great movie  loved the storyline
Feb 21 2024,positive,great storytelling and a very engaging plot throughout this being a marvel movie seemed a bit out of place but maybe a second one will happen created plenty of hate for the main villain but the star dakota johnson was amazing in her role the ending for me just didnt feel great but another movie or some way to tie together more would make it better
Feb 21 2024,positive,it wasnt amazing but sets up something going forward
Feb 21 2024,positive,dont judge a movie off the reviews surprisingly was a very good movie loved dakota johnson in this movie storyline was pretty good graphics in some parts could have been better but the predictive skills of madam webb really made this movie interesting to watch
Feb 21 2024,negative,buddy lost to product placement thats tough
Feb 21 2024,neutral,the movie was ok but i recommend watching it during a matinee or waiting for vod or streaming
Feb 21 2024,negative,one of the absolute worst superhero films ive ever seen a pure embarrassment
Feb 21 2024,negative,story telling is dead this movie couldve been good but the acting the story character development was so poor had a hard time continuing to watch it would not recommend
Feb 21 2024,positive,i like the movie i think the end could be more realistic looked like it is taken from x man
Feb 21 2024,positive,i think the movie itself is good and has a potential the issue is that dakota johnson isnt a good actress as well as ezekiel actor many times an average movie can be elevated by excellent acting sidney sweeney who is a very skilled actor was holding back i think to be on par with leads not to outshine them i did like the movie and the plot just wish it had a better more skilled and talented leads sorry dakota
Feb 21 2024,negative,i cant believe this was allowed this to be published this is the room level bad
Feb 21 2024,negative,only thing good about this movie is the ladies were pretty story was eeh acting was blah and it just didnt make much sense really didnt think they could make a worse superhero movie than morpheus but they really said hold my beer 
Feb 21 2024,positive,nice movie really liked it 
Feb 21 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie
Feb 21 2024,positive,fantastic action packed movie
Feb 21 2024,negative,good idea bad script poorly directed
Feb 21 2024,negative,that movie is terrible
Feb 21 2024,negative,it felt like lazy writing i thought some of the action scenes were cringe i still somewhat enjoyed it and id say its worth a watch
Feb 21 2024,positive,the movie was fun and the 4 actresses complimented each other  it was a plus to the marvel brand stan lee would have enjoyed it
Feb 21 2024,neutral,seeing as birds of prey and the marvels had a good story and showed off the heroines that were in the movie madame web falls short of that there is clearly a story but with the choppy editing its hard to tell what story the movie wanted to tell with such a great cast its sad to see sony just throwing out yet another spiderman related film with no trajectory of where it may go there is a lot of fixing this universe needs but the question remains is it too late or can sony course correct
Feb 21 2024,negative,more the theater than the movie from the showtime there were 15 minutes of ads and then 20 minutes of previews i dont mind ads before the showtime but didnt expect to wait 35m for the show to start
Feb 21 2024,positive,internet hyperbole did not get to me and i had fun with this movie definitely felt more of a complete movie than morbius
Feb 20 2024,negative,the movie was slow and many scenes were not needed  the storyline seems to bounce around and the weird dynamic between her and the girls was awkward at best  it seemed to be nothing more than a time killer 
Feb 20 2024,positive,so fist off im tires of all the negative flack that sony and their movies have been getting  you cant base every movie off of the original spiderman andor infinity war  they are all different movies with different stories to tell  the cast in this movie is great together all except for the main villain they got his looks down but the acting could be a little better just really really stiff and sometimes a little awkward  i think the entire conflict of the movie is a little forced meaning the whole premise probably could have been figured out if they all met for tea lol  but pace is okay sometimes a little fast but for the most part easy to keep up with and not too crazy  im tired of going into super hero movies and it being so much going on i start getting a headache  this movie does not do that  only time this occurs is during the final action scene and the sloppiness shows  but overall very fun movie  i saw it amc lazer which sounds and looks amazing and my wife and i were just about the only ones in the theater so it was nice no screaming kids or teenagers rather  i recommend this movie for people wanting a nice pace different from the norm super hero movie just dont go in with any expectations and sit back and enjoy the show  dont nit pick and you will enjoy just fine
Feb 20 2024,negative,in this film the actress who plays this film looks very good but in terms of production story  script this is really very bad  confusing in terms of story the editing also seems sloppy which if you pay attention there are some parts that look strange this is even worse from morbius
Feb 20 2024,negative,this is worse than morbius how
Feb 20 2024,positive,for the over saturated super hero movie world we find ourselves in this was a refreshing take on madame web dakota johnson was witty funny and compelling to watch if your burnt out on corny super hero movies give this one a try funny and worth an afternoon at the movies
Feb 20 2024,negative,the plot was so predictable and weak that it was the most comedic aspect of the movie
Feb 20 2024,negative,this is a formulamade movie nothing else stands out
Feb 20 2024,negative,it wasnt as bad as i expected saying that it is not good dakota johnson in the lead has to put in one of the worst acting performances i have ever seen and the rest of the cast are not much better there are massive bits of the plot that make no sense what so ever i would say dont over think the movie and the glaring bits that are plain crazy and you might get a small bit of enjoyment out of it
Feb 20 2024,negative,unknown caracter bad history
Feb 20 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie actually
Feb 20 2024,positive,people have been wayyyy too harsh on this movie it was actually quite entertaining yes there were some plot issues as do most super hero movies yes the cgi wasnt 100 at some points the villains voice and dubbing was a bit off and sure they could have done a better job at tying the movie into the rest of the mcu  but the movie itself was still enjoyable i never had the urge to look at my watch to see what time it was and the cast actually did a great job
Feb 20 2024,positive,it had plenty of action but with her seeing into the future could be quite confusing
Feb 20 2024,negative,this movies plot is like a knock knock joke but the only part of the joke you are told is the part when they say knock knock then they start laughing     the moive the whole way through felt like it only had one this to build to and that was how the cast become heroes but we learn almost nothing about the powers the characters the spider people tribe or the villan there is action but thats it the movie ends without so much as a hint to how the cast get their powers and just ends showing them in the future with powers and outfits no explanation     what was there wasnt too bad but there just wasnt much there
Feb 20 2024,negative,i absolutely adore matt sazama and burk sharpless true to name these guys are legends honestly single handedly bringing down sonys stand alone universe heroes they may be forgotten but i will remember theyre sacrifice one day a plaque will be put up in theyre honor at the sonymarvel mega museum once they merge in 20 years
Feb 20 2024,negative,i have signed up this to review this movie  i saw this film in 4dx and even that did not make this film enjoyable they have basically ripped off spiderman but made it 100x time worse in the process i left the cinema feeling more depressed than when i arrived which i did not think was possible i will have to book an extra session with my shrink
Feb 20 2024,positive,some questionable writing and corny flash forward scenes overall though i still liked it
Feb 20 2024,positive,i was not perfect but great cast and great acting better than all of the last movies from marvel
Feb 20 2024,positive,watched it in imax i enjoyed the film and characters glad i took the opportunity to watch it at the cinema
Feb 20 2024,positive,not as bad as people are saying more a  boring movie then a bad one
Feb 20 2024,negative,not as bad as expected but still not great
Feb 20 2024,negative,so i finally got around to watching madame web in 4dx nonetheless and yikes its like they were aiming for the stars but ended up somewhere in the stratosphere lets dive into the nittygritty    first up the cgi remember how epic the visuals were in movies like into the spiderverse yeah keep those memories close because madame web wont be joining that hall of fame the effects felt outdated like something out of an early 2000s superhero flick its kind of a bummer because you go in expecting to be wowed but end up thinking about the good ol days of cgi    the adr automated dialogue replacement was another headscratcher its like watching a badly dubbed foreign movie where the lips and the words are in their own little worlds it pulls you right out of the scene especially during the moments that are supposed to hit hard honestly its pretty jarring    and then theres the script oh boy it felt like someone let an ai loose told it to watch a bunch of superhero movies and then write one the result a mashup of clich√©s and awkward lines that had me cringing more than cheering the characters deserve so much better    one small silver lining madame web isnt part of the mcu canon which is kind of a relief its a sony project that plays in the marvel sandbox without affecting the bigger picture so at least theres no worry about it messing with your favorite mcu storylines    all in all madame web was a bit of a letdown with the talent involved i was hoping for a lot more the cgi adr and script issues were just too glaring to ignore its a shame because the concept had so much potential but hey not every swing is going to be a home run right    in any case its one of those movies you might watch just to say you did or maybe to appreciate the effort just keep your expectations in check
Feb 20 2024,positive,was fantastic loved the special effects very awesome and exciting hope they make another movie
Feb 20 2024,neutral,the movie was action filled which i liked  but was a little farfetched
Feb 20 2024,negative,the plot was alright the special effects were lacking but thats pretty typical with movies nowadays the acting and dialog were absolutely repulsive to the point that anything that was almost good didnt even matter it wad almost the first movie ive ever walked out of did nod off a couple of times
Feb 20 2024,negative,the amount of laugh out loud moments in the last third despite being joke free add an extra half star but this one lives up to the rep of being one of the worst movies ever made
Feb 20 2024,negative,lost 2 hours of my life i wont get back
Feb 20 2024,negative,can we give 0 stars
Feb 20 2024,negative,when she said its morbin time i gasped i thought it wasnt possible to have such a creative line be expressed directly to the camera in a way where the audience felt something the ones of people in the audience got out of their chairs and started hitting the griddy all over the theater so much so that the disco lights turned on and we all started to conga out of the theater towards the nearest exit so we didnt have to watch the movie anymore 000000000110
Feb 20 2024,positive,its not too bad but its not fantastic ether like its just fine its pretty solid i would say its the best sony spiderman unverse movie but thats not saying much overall i would give it a 710
Feb 20 2024,negative,madame web was not what i was hoping for this was not a good marvel or spider man movie
Feb 20 2024,positive,i feel bad that this movies is receiving really bad reviews  it was entertaining and dakota was quite funny in an unintentional manner though i did fell that the villains dialogue was not the best  his actions sequences was cool and creepy  give this movie an honest chance and check it out  the family and i enjoyed it would like a sequel to follow up
Feb 20 2024,negative,i went in with low expectations and this is the first time i feel like i deserved a refund for my ticket since ive seen the movie i have seen promos where they literally just say hey come see these beautiful girls on the big screen and its very creepy how theyre doing all this
Feb 20 2024,positive,this movie was 1010 it changed my life forever best comic book movie since ryan reynolds green lantern movie i cant fathom the awesomeness that this movie has you need to watch it right now this is cinema also the movie sucked big gurthy veiny dick
Feb 20 2024,negative,madame web is so bad where does one begin first and foremost dakota johnson is just not a good actress lets get real shes gotten to where she is because of her nepo baby status the success of those dreadful fifty shades of grey films had very little to do with with johnson or her acting it was because the books were fan favorites the last film was the lowest grossing in the trilogy also whoever wrote the script for madame web should never write another script again the dialogue was trite the storyline was boring and it was directed and shot like it was amateur hour on an abandoned studio backlot overall madame web felt superlow budget ive seen student films that were way better than this nonsense i dont always agree with critics but on this disaster of a film they are spoton madame web has no redeeming qualities at all if your curiosity gets the better of you just wait until its on a streamer but by no means spend your hardearned money on it technically madame web is part of the larger spiderman cinematic multiverse so how on earth did they get this film so wrong with an 80 million budget
Feb 20 2024,negative,a mediocre movie not good but not really bad the dialog is atrocious at times and something was seriously wrong with the audio of ezekiel sims sounds like the original audio was dubbed over badly     but still a movie that is entertaining enough
Feb 20 2024,negative,horrible horrible acting i understand it was an intro but what an horrible marvel movie i should watched the bob marleyone love it was so cheesy every actor horrible
Feb 20 2024,negative,i would give this a negative rating if i could  i am not one to walk out of movies but it seriously crossed my mind several times  the constant flashforwards if you want to call them that were confusing and made it hard to follow  dakota johnsons acting was atrocious at best  she duped sony on this one  who at sony watched this and said yeah this is great release it  that indeed proved to be a lie  it was not great and should have never left the studio maybe it needed to be on the studio floor
Feb 20 2024,negative,everything would be better if spiderman participated in these movies
Feb 20 2024,positive,very slow dakota did a good job and is a great actress  however the story was just blah and even more blah  i was really disappointed there wasnt any kind of preview like marvel usually does at the end of the move but i really understand why since the movie passed the time
Feb 20 2024,negative,an utterly unnecessary entry in the superhero genre based loosely on a rather obscure marvel character  if you bring very low expectations the movie is watchable add a star if youre a fan of dakota johnson or sidney sweeney note there are no bonus scenes in the end credits
Feb 20 2024,negative,im genuinely shocked that people are shocked mad and baffled that this movie is genuinely this bad    my full video review can be found here youtubeq9opcwzvbjasiuwbgphpeefncdnzr    however i will say the one trailer they put out a couple of months ago is the best version of this movie you will find plus you wont have to endure 2 hours just to get to the worst crime of all madame webs suit those glasses gives me nightmares be glad none of the marketing has shown you her godform because i truly think my amygdala is forever broken    thank you sony thank you    oh by the way dont take your date to thisokay imma go eat berry colossal crunch in bed  watch the incredibles now
Feb 20 2024,neutral,plot line jumped and meandered  would have made a better tv show than a movie
Feb 20 2024,positive,it was not horrible i expected a flop but was pleasantly surprised
Feb 20 2024,positive,story was intruiging with the exception of a few very unbeleivable situations like driving a stolen damaged cab with no license plates in ny city for days  without being pulled over but then the whole   movie is about a suspension of reality and should be enjoyed for the creativity of the story
Feb 20 2024,negative,ouch what a waste of money  when one of the only positive thing to say about your movie is that toxic from britney spears played for like 5 minutes its really rough 
Feb 20 2024,negative,actually the cast was ok but the story was so drag and no reason just to make a spidy movie and make it  y dont they polish the next spiderman and add these cast inside
Feb 20 2024,negative,this was a few million more dollars stuffed into a cw tv episode at best     if it werent for movies like oppenheimer  this movie is the movie i would choose as the poster film for everything wrong with modern cinema   i cant fathom how after over a hundred years of movie making they still pump out low grade  lazy lack of love directing like this   the dialog is robotic and uncomfortably predictable    i can actually go on and on but im choosing to not give this horrible film another ounce of my energy
Feb 20 2024,positive,its a good superhero movie it focuses on the beginning its a good superhero movie it focuses on the origin of the main characterof the main character
Feb 20 2024,positive,this is a movie that has been unfairly criticized seemingly because sony didnt invest enough in pr resulting in an undeservedly negative reception personally i genuinely enjoyed the film for its heartfelt storytelling of the protagonist which is a touching and relatable tale of an ordinary civilian heroine told from a female perspective evoking both empathy and tears the performances of the three young actresses were commendable and i eagerly anticipate the chance to see their characters return in future installments a rare and valuable femaleled film  dont miss it
Feb 20 2024,negative,im not sure who at sony thinks these are good ideas  as soon as i saw dakota johnson i was disinterested  she cant act her way out of a paper bag  to put her at the forefront of a spiderman related series  what were you thinking sony  tired of these run of the mill comic movies  even the actual marvel studios is failing miserably right now  you need a long story arc  no one cares about origin stories anymore  if you want to introduce new characters do it in a longer arc  the whole comic book superhero movie world right now is a mess with no real direction  the luster is gone  be creative or just dont make the movie  this one is not worth the investment
Feb 20 2024,negative,the dialogue in this movie was so poor i had to laugh out loud that was how bad this movie was it had some interesting ideas thats why i gave it 1 star
Feb 20 2024,positive,loved it i always enjoy my childhood comic books come to life story and characters and everything was excellent
Feb 20 2024,positive,great movie awesome graphics
Feb 20 2024,positive,i think it is not as bad as others commented  personally madame web is better than the marvels and eternals    thank you
Feb 20 2024,negative,ridiculous costumes stupid dialogues terrible acting hollywood is dead
Feb 20 2024,negative,i didnt have rottem tomato account but i created one just to post this comment i needed to tell everyone to avoid this film because it wasted my valuable 2 hours and money on imax this film didnt deserve to be on imax it was a total waste of my time and money i want a refund it would have been a teeny little better if dakota johnson had shown some skin but no it felt like i was taken through a twohour long teaser i am freakin mad
Feb 20 2024,negative,worst marvel film ever its simply just a bad movie
Feb 20 2024,negative,is madame web a good movie no
Feb 20 2024,negative,i mean they dont even try anymore just sad
Feb 20 2024,positive,it was phenomenal and its kind of upsetting to see this kind of hate on the movie i question whether or not anyone who is tearing it down actually watched the movie
Feb 20 2024,negative,it was boring and honestly didnt make much sense
Feb 20 2024,positive,its really not bad
Feb 20 2024,negative,not good at all there was no way to like this
Feb 20 2024,positive,i saw it before reading the critics reviews and thought it was a fun superheroesque movie the last 10 minutes did seem a bit janky but the cast were great throughout and i definitely dont begrudge having paid to see it in the cinema    having now read the reviews im confused where all the hate has come from its not that bad
Feb 20 2024,negative,what the hell was i even doing in this theater after 30 mins i was getting the marvels vibe but only creepy crawly vibes this wasnt bad it was horrific to where i actually almost asked for my money back i never write reviews and and can be well imagine my lackluster writing skills terrible
Feb 20 2024,neutral,i think that if sony wants their spiderverse movies to succeed they need to reread the disney playbook venom is single handedly holding the ssu up
Feb 20 2024,negative,damn that was bad dont watch it trust me dogshit
Feb 20 2024,negative,has no story and it is misleading in so many ways what a waste of time and money smh
Feb 20 2024,negative,this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life i will never get back the time or money that i spent on this disgusting and horrifying experience of what they call a movie i would rather eat feces than to ever see this movie ever again the actors should be ashamed for the disgrace that this movie is dont watch it this is ass
Feb 20 2024,negative,horrible script no chemistry between the actors 
Feb 20 2024,positive,i liked madame web it is a good movie with a storyline that does its job to introduce her and the other ladies the authenticity of the 2003 era was fun to see and dakota johnsons performance shine and enjoyed seeing her on the screen     i loved the birth of peter parker and seeing a young uncle ben i know there is a lot of reviews out there but i am a fan of origin stories and i love and have an appreciation for a movie that allows me to connect the dots     i cant wait to see more from this talented cast and crew i hope they continue it  give it a chance
Feb 20 2024,negative,it was so bad everything cast acting direction script awful
Feb 20 2024,negative,one of the worst movie of super hero genre
Feb 20 2024,negative,i liked the cast tbh i have no idea where to start first the audio issues were very distracting from an already mediocre film this took the film from mediocre to down right garbage the main villains lines did not match up with the words coming out of his mouth for a company this big that should not be happening also in certain areas of this film you could tell it was voiced over due to the lack of atmosphere idk the technical stuff in the sound for example there was a bit of an echo when they were in the cab i believe moving on the three spider girls did not have complex personalities very much what you see is what you get it felt way too power rangery interestingly convenient how all of them have no parentsnot a trope im fond of but it can slide moving on to the main actress dakota i found her acting very bland  she was funny during her dry humor scenes which i think she shines best at but for a superhero movie if we can even call it that she was not meant for this role my next major issue with this movie is the lack of  cool powers we get to see since most of the marketing aims at showing these girls in spider suits the pacing with this movie was also an issue i find that theres this quick switch between cassie not being able to control her powers to her in the span of one day being able to master her powers is pretty lazy usually theres some sort of training montage for stuff like that but i guess by the end of filming they already knew they put too much money into a big garbage can not to mention what happened to cassie being aired on the news for abducting these girls how on earth do they live with her and go to school im mortified at whats coming next from this sonyweird marvel deal
Feb 20 2024,negative,dakota johnson plays a very unlikeable character in this film and shes supposed to be the protagonist which makes no sense a tip for the director make the leading actoractress someone you want to root for not someone you want to root against the bad guy did a good job in his role as did the three teenage girls in their roles but the movie as a whole stunk thumbs down
Feb 20 2024,negative,regrettably this film consistently grapples to establish a coherent narrative with its origin story proving notably deficient it represents yet another unsuccessful endeavor by sonys executives to capitalize on the spiderman universe without adequately acknowledging its foundational elements
Feb 20 2024,positive,movie was great awesome just didnt like the ending other than that recommend it
Feb 20 2024,negative,one of the worst marvel movies i watched should of watch aqua man maybe parents with kids 9 and up would enjoy this movie 
Feb 20 2024,negative,terrible movie the story was mess and lacking
Feb 20 2024,negative,i see what the producerswriters were trying to do but the story line was too weak the writers threw believability out the window when these three teenagers just followed casey with very few questions and even the questions they asked were lame for casey to leave them in the woods by themselves for three hours was almost laughable and then when the momtobe had to go to the hospital the girls left a place where they had been safe for a week for no good reason the sequel if there is one will probably be pathetic rather it is or not i will not spend a dime to see it    the one good point is dakota is hot
Feb 20 2024,positive,great movie  i cant wait for the sequel
Feb 20 2024,positive,this movie was so amazing to me and i love their costumes especially madame webs love the red i was a little sad that she went flying but i think it really suits her and i still love her blind or not blind
Feb 20 2024,positive,first time giving my opinion about a movie or making a movie review and i give madameweb a 910 as it was an awesome origin story born in 1973 myself this movie i feel was very underrated and definitely a date type of movie     people forget to just enjoy a good movie dont overthink it just watch the  eat your  and realize dakotajohnson as cassieweb was a great acting choice     also the 3 actresses including isabellamerced  worked very hard to create a movie  and i recommend this movie not for what people are expecting to see but what it actually is an origin story for madame web great movie    the fighting sequences in the film is exactly what i wanted to see i wasnt expecting to see spiderman just how cassie became madame web how she guided the 3 heroines into their destiny way before spiderman was to become a ny comic book hero meets the big screen box office icon madameweb 
Feb 20 2024,positive,good movie great cast kid appropriate
Feb 20 2024,positive,not sure why it got a lot of hate has a great backstory to the origin of the character acting was great as expected from marvel related movies
Feb 20 2024,positive,best story i like this cool concept
Feb 20 2024,positive,just felt like they couldve change some things and add to it but overall 610
Feb 20 2024,positive,this is not youre tipical superheroe movie but instead the give a suspensesuperoheroe genre i enjoyed every plot twist
Feb 20 2024,positive,just to much unfair criticism good story flowed well acting was fine definitely entertaining
Feb 20 2024,positive,it was a good time  there was a bit left unexplained but since it felt  like the start of a bunch of them i expected some things to remain open for the future  overall i enjoyed the pacing and watching a super hero film where you didnt need to watch a million tv series to follow along
Feb 20 2024,neutral,just got out from the movie thought the camera work was made by a youtuber with a zoom lens and lines of dialogue could have been written better to be less corny in the end it wasnt a bad movenot saying it was a good movie if it wasnt a spiderman movie would have given it a better rating but since it is horrible spiderman movieit was somewhat bearable wouldnt watch again though its definitely a one time watch
Feb 20 2024,negative,sony should leave spider verse alone
Feb 20 2024,negative,i liked it when it ended and disliked it from the beginning made no sense
Feb 20 2024,positive,it was better than i anticipated i think the movie was way better than the marvels the movie suffered from a horrible trailer and some bad choices i think she deserved better than this and i fear these characters will never be revisited again
Feb 20 2024,positive,intriguing story good acting and good special effects reminded me of spiderman i wouldve liked to have seen an after credits trailer though
Feb 20 2024,positive,i thought it was great didnt have too much relation to the comics but still kept my attention
Feb 20 2024,negative,a movie that looked ok in the trailer but was so slow i fell asleep at times i blame this on the writers and directors the actors and actresses were decent considering the train wreck of a script they were dealing with i have no issues with them with the villan all we get out of the story is he has a vision of three teens that steal his spider or do harm to him but that is it it was a cat and mouse story the whole film something that should have been 40 minutes in the movie they extended to a 2hr train wreck of a movie none of the characters were really fleshed out we dont see madame web in costume or do anything really heroic till the end of the film when we see her in a wheel chair and is blind im more curious how the girls get there powers the big thing to is why wasnt it till the end of the film till we see them in costume its a marvel comics movie at some point we should have seen them in mid film using their powers and in costume not the las 5 min of it it makes me really worrie what theyre going to do wit kraven the hunter
Feb 20 2024,positive,i like this movie has a funny interaction with the tennager and theirs rebel heart it has some scenes of introspective and follow the damage make to her mom
Feb 20 2024,positive,not the greatest film of all time but i dont fine it bad sometimes the cgi looks weird and ceartain scenes are meh but for me is an enjoyable movie and not as bad
Feb 20 2024,positive,the movie was great some wired moments but the story was awesome like the setting
Feb 20 2024,positive,great movie kept my interest through the story line it was a great origin story loved the female cast dakota was fantastic
Feb 20 2024,positive,i disagree with the horrible reviews it  was nowhere near as bad as some reviews made it out to be sure there were some aspects that were patently ridiculous but hello dr strange 2 thor love and thunder ant man quantimania not meant to be over analyzed it was entertaining at least
Feb 20 2024,positive,it was a superhero movie it was fun good action good scenes i dont know why so much hate for this film
Feb 20 2024,positive,to be fair i never have tried to climb a wall
Feb 20 2024,negative,its not even fun bad 
Feb 20 2024,positive,entertaining and action packed when you least expected the ending was a little dull and main character should have had a better outcome still worth checking out
Feb 20 2024,negative,is there a way to put negative stars there needs be deleted out of my brain  very dumb movie all around terrible
Feb 20 2024,negative,i loved this movie in the same exact way i loved fast x its so unintentionally funny that im glad i saw it nothing in this movie makes sense so many things happen off screen the villain is just atrocious hes so bad that theres more than a handful of times when hes not even saying whatever he originally said dakota johnson is hollywood nepotism at its finest its almost impossible to believe that shes the lead actress in a movie and was probably paid at least a million dollars for this movie hollywood makes no sense its so goofy and stupid that its hilarious
Feb 20 2024,negative,nah man the films delivery is freaky stiff the story telling is bland the antagonists background isnt really explored even though the cast is already wow
Feb 20 2024,negative,this movie was plain awful  you sitting there waiting for them to get powers and fight back there was nothing the worst superhero movie ive ever seen i wouldnt recommend to watch it on streaming when it happens an absolute waste of my time  how can you love a superhero movie when there was no superhero duh
Feb 20 2024,negative,not a real movie going into it i did not know what the plot was and leaving i was even more confused the camera work is what i imagine madame webb sees when glimpsing the future the only glimmer of hope was when i thought i saw morbius in the background but alas ive was not there
Feb 20 2024,positive,if they still had double features  it would make a good b side i had a good time
Feb 20 2024,positive,it was a decent film not perfect but enjoyed by my daughters
Feb 20 2024,positive,absolute loved it worth seeing in theater
Feb 20 2024,positive,i honestly dont understand why so many critics are panning post avenger super hero movies marvel and dc and constantly compare them to avenger level hype news flash there were many movies prior to avengers to build up to the story we saw which was broken up into multiple movies itself     movies like this tge marvels etc are fun and full movies to enjoy that are super hero centric with fun cgi moments and character building theyve had great performances and are simply being gunned down by comparison to movies that took decades to build up to     i found all the leading ladies performances enjoyable the action scenes fun and the use of madame webs powers very interesting     i truly hope that theyre able to secure dakota for future projects perhaps movies that are part of the greater marvel universe which it seems people are more happy to give 100 ratings to  i really dont get the critic scores and i personally feel this movie among others shouldnt be sitting below 80     i hope in time more people see this movie even if it doesnt recoup costs for sony but perhaps gives the ability for the characters to live on in live action     worth a rentstream for sure if youre not sold still worth a fun matinee priced movie for sure
Feb 20 2024,negative,not only the worst spider verse movie but the worst movie ever if i could give it zero stars  i would
Feb 20 2024,negative,it was bad so very bad you thought morbius was bad this is even worse the writing was bad the adr additional dialogue recording was bad and didnt match the actors mouth movements it feels like the people who made this movie kind of wanted it to be a horror movie but didnt really commit to it it also felt like sony just dont care about these characters all theyre doing is sticking to a contractual agreement that says they have to release a spiderman  spiderman character movie every 5 years and 9 months otherwise the rights go back to then marvel entertainment which is know marvel studios sony please stop
Feb 20 2024,negative,even if i dont particularly like a movie i generally can get some enjoyment out of seeing it a the movies not so much this time
Feb 20 2024,positive,i like it had action comedy and talks about spider man without talking about it i thought it awesome so did my friend i will watch it again
Feb 20 2024,positive,great origin story i actually enjoyed the storyline chemistry and acting was great overall a fun movie worth a second watch i hope the powers that be ignore the hateful comments and continue to build from this movie because im very much looking forward to their evolution as superheroes
Feb 20 2024,positive,i love it its funny witty  wellwritten and also some emotional scenes are good its not your regular marvel movie if youre expecting some epic battle its not that but its still a good movie to watch i hope theyll make a part 2
Feb 19 2024,positive,to be honest this movie was actually very good if you liked the sam raimi spiderman movies you will definitely like this i did very much so the problem is that the mainstream critics are nowadays usually off about lots of things and if youre movie doesnt have explicit content they will not give you a good review further many of the user critics are part of the tik tok generation and have no patience for anything these days if you grew up in the 90s you will definitely like this movie
Feb 19 2024,positive,it was great love it wasnt bad as people say i was so intrigued with the clairvoyance she experienced and the the girls were great when they were together a great movie
Feb 19 2024,positive,loved the suspense and the action  great actress
Feb 19 2024,negative,its definitely one of the worse superhero films characters arent well known or interesting plot isnt well done major fail for sony and their spiderman films when the market has been saturated with superhero films you have to bring something special this definitely is it
Feb 19 2024,negative,the acting was good the girls were highly lovable  but the writers wrote there hero and villian to both have highly questionable behaviors and motivations there was too many plot wholes and fuzzy logic to fully enjoy this super hero movie with the least super heroing
Feb 19 2024,positive,classic marvel not bad at all recommend for teens and kids
Feb 19 2024,negative,terrible movie boring shallow plot subpar acting cheesy lines no character development and the characters themselves are poorly written and acted oof that was rotten
Feb 19 2024,negative,im sorry  i dont want so say its bad what i will say is i was extremely disappointed and thats hard for me cause i was really looking forward to this after discharging from the hospital the story just feels forced and you can tell the actors knew their lies were just lines please go see somthing else and wait for this when its streamable youll feel more fulfilled watching literally anything else in theaters sorry to anyone feeling let down by reading this just being honest 
Feb 19 2024,negative,what a waste of time the characters dont grow at all as a person its horrible how they make the protagonists complain all the time the villain is very stupid in scene 3 where he comes out and repeats i have to kill them as if he hadnt done it many times before the cgi is terrible
Feb 19 2024,positive,this is a solid entry into the sony marvel universe  as origin stories go this is a great stand alone movie that sets up some great characters and also ties into spiderman
Feb 19 2024,positive,i would like to see more good understandable story line i did not see the comic book
Feb 19 2024,negative,i gave the movie a chance because wasnt disney  another all females cast nothing wrong with it hollywood need to understand if are going to keep doing this kind of movies need to be ready for more flops really the movie is a mess mention what part and you can agree is bad scripot action and fx all are awful
Feb 19 2024,negative,i dont mean to be rude but this movie is a total waste of time and money  it is worst marvel movie ever being produce
Feb 19 2024,positive,there is a new gold standard in filmmaking and it is madame web  the makers of madame web put on an absolute clinic with the creation of this masterpiece that the likes of tarantino scorsese spielberg and wiseau and breen should study and attempt to emulate  usc film school should have an entire class  nay semester dedicated to the study and analysis of this next evolutionary step in the art of filmmaking  if kubrick and hitchcock were alive they would weep at their wasted years and failures upon viewing this masterclass and peak of cinematic culture      as a viewer madame web was not a movie but an experience  just watching this grand treasure on the silver screen was the closest that most of us will ever be to being in the presence of true greatness and genius  madame web should be shown in the louvre at all times  temples should be erected where those of us so touched so moved by this experience can go to pay our respects or perhaps dedicate our lives to a humble existence of servitude and deep reflection on the message lessons and teachings shared by director sj clarkson in this new form of enlightenment    i am weeping at the beauty of what sony pictures has created and shared with all of us wealthy and poor young and old alike my life will never be the same  we are not worthy
Feb 19 2024,positive,good plot parts felt drawn out and some parts felt rushed but overall a really good story
Feb 19 2024,positive,im usually not a fan of marvel superhero movies but i kind of enjoyed this there is no real depth to any of the characters but thats par for the course with comic book movies at times i enjoyed the tension build in act two but found it hard not to ignore that there were no reproductions from stealing a cab and driving around without plates or how the time line jumps by weeks in the blink of an eye enjoyably passed the time on a rainy afternoon and made me laugh in the right moments
Feb 19 2024,positive,i dont know why this movie has such a low rating me and my family loved it it was funny adventurous action packed and heart warming we absolutely loved it and even saw it twice acting is great and the story line kept us hooked definitely a must see 
Feb 19 2024,negative,sony does love money dont they there are fewer companies that i believe more shamelessly vie for the cash they believe is burning a hole in the pockets of superhero fans than the reluctant marriage of marvel studios and sony pictures quality and care are often sacrificed in favor of creating the next comic book movie blockbuster    as a longtime spiderman fan its almost painful to say that watching madame web was a slog the existence of madame webs powers are almost completely absent with little more to show for it than action sequences that stop and start at a whiplashinducing pace punctuated by editing that is nauseating as it is annoying this pace is done no favors by the nonrhythmic and soulless plot with its mere reason for being seems to be to serve as a precursor to another hopefully better movie i was hoping this movies saving grace would be its cast which was a naive assumption almost all of the performances were awkward flaccid and cringe with its cast desperately trying to find the pulse of this cadaver    i will say that adam scotts performance as ben parker stood out to me ive always admired scotts loveable dork persona which he embodies in many of his roles and i found myself drawn to this kind funny and younger version of ben he summoned a good couple of laughs from me which offered more for the movie than any of its other weird illtimed quips    i want to say im disappointed but im not this kind of glib storytelling is now par for the course for the superhero genre whether or not madame web was trying to stand out or settle for a cashin is unclear maybe in 10 years this will become a cult classic among spidey fans but for now its a forgettable spiritless embarrassment
Feb 19 2024,positive,it wasnt spider man but it wasnt the green lantern either it was ight  kinda cool fight scenes but i honestly couldnt help but laugh at some points of the plot it was so ehh not that substantial but johnson have it her all and she did a great job and shes very pretty
Feb 19 2024,negative,i really wanted this to be good i like dakota johnson and thought she might bring an interesting angle to a new character thing is the plot is incoherent  i was completely lost as to what was going on  i think the editing is to blame as characters jumped around a scene without continuity such a shame
Feb 19 2024,negative,russ review  madame web bad script right from the start lots of telling and not showing the way that dakota johnsons dialog is written and acted seems like this was her characters cassie first day as a human at the beginning of the film adam scott portrays the only believable character his ability to make that possible with bad dialog reminds me of harrison ford in the original star wars supposedly cassie is a paramedic with the fire department ive been a firefighter and a medical first responder she seems like she has no clue how to do her job the situations that happen with the bad guy to make us realize he is the bad guy are nonsensical and contrived also the bad guy sounds like all his dialog is rerecorded during post production his lips are hardly ever visible and when they are they barely move its really weird in fact there are a lot of characters speaking with their back toward the camera where you can tell it wasnt spoken on the day frenetic blurry quick cuts to portray action in scenes that dont make sense to be shot that way i can appreciate the intended story but its put together poorly it saddens me because i was really hoping this would be good we dont get to actually have any sympathy or empathy for characters everything is explained about the characters like they read the description off the call sheet and instead of using it as motivation for how to portray their characters hey simply said it out loud the movie prominently displays mountain dew and pepsi so thats cool i guess 
Feb 19 2024,negative,the film is a mess the characters especially the three girls are so annoying and they are future superheroes one says i dont need anyone taking care of me well you kinda do idiot the villain has tried to kill you twice who ever wrote this mess needs to apologize and try harder i was cheering on the villain in this film and in terms of acting adam scott is the only one putting in any effort he deserves better
Feb 19 2024,positive,all in all i thought it was an enjoyable film was it perfect no but what movie is if im going to see a superhero movie i tend to suspend reality while watching i go to enjoy myself and not look for every plot hole just go watch the movie grab some popcorn and relax dont look for something to complain about its not going to win any major awards but rarely do superhero movies ever do
Feb 19 2024,positive,great movie my daughter and i loved it ignore the critics and enjoy it unless you normally agree with them  i  find them to be mostly wrong go with the 55 who liked it
Feb 19 2024,positive,great new marvel hero plenty of action
Feb 19 2024,negative,why did sony pick her  she is a really really opscre marvel hero mostly because most people who watch movies dont read comics
Feb 19 2024,positive,excellent story and acting glad i saw this superhero movie which had very minimal cgi for once dakota johnson had a great performance aling with the rest of the cast cannot wait to see the sequel
Feb 19 2024,positive,i especially liked the lead character  there was plenty of action in the movie but it seemed like it used spiderman to try a different play on spiders seemed obvious that the girls will be returning as superheros in the future
Feb 19 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie the action was great and i loved the back story that was given
Feb 19 2024,positive,i thought it was a great entertaining movie all the way around people tend to forget that even though a movie could be tied to a book or comic book it doesnt necessarily mean it has to follow it in purity there are plenty of people that just want to see a movie and be entertained not disseminate it like the thirtysomething year old critics we see here who feel their childhood dreams have been brutally smashed because it is not replicating the greatest of detail those weekly allowance money comic books they poured over while sipping their capri suns and feeding their tamagotchi happily surrounded by their participation trophies they are probably still fondly holding on to their 24kgoldplatedmewtwoburgerkingkidsmealpok√©mon card and sweetly whispering someday little buddy youll be worth something its ok kids mom still loves you and youre the greatest
Feb 19 2024,negative,the first movie i walked out on in years absolute trash
Feb 19 2024,negative,not very interesting
Feb 19 2024,positive,finally a decent introduction of a new character i would like to see a more invested johnson in expressing cassies feelings and i hope in the future itll better a little disappointed for the absence of postmovie and postcredit scenes but thats ok
Feb 19 2024,positive,this is a great film  i have no idea why the critics have scored it so low  i really enjoyed it
Feb 19 2024,positive,i went and watched this with my kids ranging in age from 917 all of us thought this was a really good movie i dont see where some of the criticism on confusing plot or lack of action is coming from the characters all have good story arcs the bad guy does a reasonable good job being a bad guy especially when seen through the glimpses that madame web gets i think dakota johnson does a good job with the role and gives a good performance as the lead character i think they did rush past some of the better easter eggs in the movie which would have been great if they expanded on those a little more the only thing i wasnt real clear on was her state at the end of the film which i wont ruin here all in all if you really like marvel movies or at least sony spiderman flicks then i think this is a really good movie
Feb 19 2024,positive,fantastic film i was glued to my seat the whole time
Feb 19 2024,positive,pretty solid film required a bit of extreme suspension of disbelief at points not superhero stuff where youd expect it but things like a flickering neon sign completely broken off its power supply    i felt the story was a little off the beaten path from other superhero films and it added some welcome originality    dakota johnson did a great job in the lead role playing the kind of discombobulated discoverer of her powers and becoming more and more competent over time the three girls were written a bit twodimensional but played really well by their actors     overall id recommend the film just think of it as a fun ride and dont be overly analytical or critical
Feb 19 2024,negative,hey sony im gonna pitch a concept that you might pay a couple of million for seeing as how you havent been able to come up with it yourselves    make a good movie  thats it  even great is shooting a little high at this point  your getting so that what ever marvel character your involved with isnt going to bring in any money at all if your names attached to it with such poor story telling and weak writers attached    the screen writers and producers need another job other than this this was horrible  the idea is good and thats about it on this one  the movie makes no since and is very boring and underwhelming the script is horrible writers move the story for goodness sakes its stagnant  and more importantly end up somewhere  all the blame is on the higher ups on this one you can tell by all that was allowed to be released
Feb 19 2024,negative,what was that for what wretched idea
Feb 19 2024,positive,the internet can be lame it becomes the cool thing to attack sony spiderman spin off movies so people jump on the band wagon movie is nowhere near atrocious its a fine fun movie
Feb 19 2024,negative,this is just too bad to put into words arguably worse than the 2015 fan4stic
Feb 19 2024,positive,2000s comic book movie no its not the mcu no its not the worst comic book movie yet very convinced people are jumping on this because its popular to hate sonys superhero movies it was fun it reminded me of when superhero movies were fun and simple it was enjoyablefor the most part    there was some very awful dialogue and some even worst acting specifically from the villain what was that did they dub the whole thing it was actually unbearable to watch that guy i cant praise it for that the movie overall isnt great but its not as bad as people are saying either just maybe sony should watch the movie before they release it next time
Feb 19 2024,positive,it feels like on purpose they want this movie to bomb at the box office like an evil plan or something but for me and my family it was an absolute must see such an amazing acting from dakota very good cgis not like some recent much bigger budget movies and a good story line     dont listen to people and news around the world this movie is good entertainment highly recommended
Feb 19 2024,neutral,cgi is the worst ive seen in the last few years the best part of the movie is dakota johnson and her acting i understand that ezekiel comes from a poor family but thats not enough reason to be a bad person
Feb 19 2024,positive,too many plot holes misleading advertising trailer is there going to be a directors cut to fill them i hope so the special effects were decent thanks movie gods but as mediocre as it was i preferred this to the latest aquaman where i actually left the theater
Feb 19 2024,positive,not as terrible as critics say it is a little slow at some points but it was an overall enjoyable movie
Feb 19 2024,negative,i went in thinking it would be a fun bad movie but it was funny how bad it was
Feb 19 2024,positive,this movie is decent idk why people are giving these reviews its a super hero movie not the green mile or good will hunting go watch it for yourself
Feb 19 2024,positive,dont get me wrong this movie is horrible the writing is terrible the directing is choppy and dakota johnson is completely incapable of displaying any sort of passion ironic isnt it but its the sort of movie thats extremely fun to make fun of with your friends id wait for it to be on streaming but its still worth checking out
Feb 19 2024,positive,it wasnt great but what can be expected from a lesser known superhero origin story it did what it had to do and introduced madam web to the audience she can definitely play a supporting role for spiderman films but shouldnt have a sequel not that it would   the film itself reminded me of a made for tv movie with 90s vibes still worth a watch but dont go out of your way for it
Feb 19 2024,positive,this movie isnt as bad as the critics say yes there are plot holes yes there is bad dialogue but not all comic book movies are going to reach the high bar set by the og mcu i walked out of it having enjoyed myself and talking with my family about the spiderverse easter eggs in the film it was fun the acting outside of the main villain was good and id see it again
Feb 19 2024,positive,it has its faults but its still a fun ride
Feb 19 2024,negative,i usually cant watch movies because the plots stress me out but i got through this no problem there were like 50 plotlines and 0 made sense there was almost no character development and a lot of pepsi product placement the production is giving twilight in a bad way im giving it 2 stars because it fits into the category its so bad its good please go watch this film its a hoot and a half
Feb 19 2024,negative,half a star in generous
Feb 19 2024,negative,the actresses play their roles so bad couldnt believe my eyes in the cinema
Feb 19 2024,negative,i wouldnt even give it half a star  horrible writinghorrible scriptthe execution of the movie just alll of it was bad just bad
Feb 19 2024,positive,a fun cute movie but they showed the main character giving a cat milk but cats are actually lactose intolerant
Feb 19 2024,positive,loved this marvel movie my whole family went and we all thoroughly enjoyed it great story line  loved dakota johnson in this role if you enjoy marvel movies its a must see
Feb 19 2024,negative,the first half was so painful that for the first time in my life i wanted to get out and leave especially after the villain is revealed the overall dialogue is the worst and most basic the villain just repeats himself the whole time dakota is adorable but even she looks like she cant believe how bad the script is
Feb 19 2024,positive,loved the movie the only problem i have is how they got there powers i hope that in some miracle this movie gets a sequel wish the villain was more menacing and wished the ending was different too so far its a good movie and would consider watching it
Feb 19 2024,positive,i honestly dont get the hate on this movie it was a perfect execution of narrating the beginning of their story i believe both the characters and the plot will get more interesting as the movie continues if you want to talk about trash movies sonic 1 would be the right discourse
Feb 19 2024,positive,its bland at times but has enough going for it to make it a bit different and quite enjoyable its far from amazing but its not bad either
Feb 19 2024,negative,the movie is not a sheet but is a sheet
Feb 19 2024,negative,it was bad how can a movie be this bad everything was fuped felt like some newbie made this movie to fillup their portfolio
Feb 19 2024,positive,it seems as though too many people are attacking this movieand i do not know why honestly when i go to a superhero movie i am not looking for a masterpiecei am looking to be entertained this is movie is exactly that it is entertaining i thought it was enjoyable to watch its simplicity was a pleasure and i though the actors did a fine job i would enjoy a 2nd one
Feb 19 2024,positive,its a good movieand i dont mind go watch it again
Feb 19 2024,positive,its worth watching without being influenced by the criticism the film is entertaining
Feb 19 2024,positive,the movie is good the dinamic of her powers is not something we see everyday the protagonist is not useless or overpowered she drives the plot forward which is something rare these days    my only complaints would be the little girls personality
Feb 19 2024,positive,not that bad but not good either a lukewarm addition to the spiderman mythology dakota has a certain charm that unfortunately fails to lift up a film with a bad script and a boring villain
Feb 19 2024,positive,is it a perfect movie no but its still fun and has a dynamite cast captivating story and unexpected twists no more convoluted than poor things which was a masterpiece because i see these films with my resident marvel encyclopedia i know its a relatively canon tale hints at bigger things for the future and is an alternate timeline in terms of aunts and uncles good and bad guys etc but overall a strong entry with potential for people looking for a more feminine spidyverse
Feb 19 2024,positive,it didnt seem bad to me if its about entertainment its a bearable movie the low budget must be taken into account
Feb 19 2024,positive,my wife and i went to see madame web in spite of the brutal reviews and we both really enjoyed it was never boring nor slow in a bad way compelling story that was at times emotional lead character was very likable  she had a sweet disposition though initially she was shown to be somewhat jaded and detached supporting characters were interesting villain was gross as a villain should be when it was over and we left the theater i had a good feeling inside id seen something good something worthwhile
Feb 19 2024,negative,idk how to say this nicely but i want my time and money back just saw this right before watching the bob marley bio pic and i regret watching this movie
Feb 19 2024,negative,i think the story has many problems and holes too much driving around lack of interesting characters or villain everything seems artificial and not very deep
Feb 19 2024,negative,worst acting ive ever seen sloppy script and sloppy cgi
Feb 19 2024,positive,not sure why this movie is rated so low its not the best marvel movie but its overall pretty good my whole family recently watched the marvels and agree that madame web is hands down better its engaging the entire time and dakota johnson did great the last few minutes could have been done a lot better but it doesnt discredit the rest of the movie i was hesitant to see this because of the reviews im glad i did anyway
Feb 19 2024,negative,puzzling and displeasing visuals a clich√© script that borders on cringe at times and a disappointing climax sink a potentially compelling characters origin story while its not quite as terrible as people make it out to be this was definitely a poor effort from sony
Feb 19 2024,positive,we found this movie to be very entertaining although it doesnt have the special effects of previous spidey movies the plot is interesting the pace is excellent and the acting is solid if we had fallen asleep during the movie then the critics would have been right in their terrible reviewssorry we enjoyed it
Feb 19 2024,negative,i cant work out whats going on with sony  morbius was rubbish and the same script writers plus corporate interference produced a dog of a film that was lampooned to death  this is worse and begs the questions  is sony just trying to keep their hold of the ip of  spiderman alive by the obligatory release of films in the same universe  if yes why dont they make an effort  are the executives so incompetent that they are unaware of what entertainment is  are they convinced that only fanboys will go to these film so that the script has the depth of a comic book  are they ignorant of the fact that the avengers etc made so much money because people who had never read the comics and knew nothing about them went to see those films  do sony execs come from another planet
Feb 19 2024,neutral,well it felt like a long movie and then again it didnt the story was a little flat and didnt go anywhere the ending didnt explain how the three girls got their powers ok madame web is sorry thats a spoiler the implication of our future sorry thats another spoiler no after credit scene to worry about get up and get out the best part was watching the movie with my son then getting some lunch after the movie
Feb 19 2024,positive,it was sad about her mother but more inspirational afterwards when she found out she had a powerful ability and she helped those three sad teenage girls
Feb 19 2024,negative,this is a movie in which nothing happens our heros only heroic ability appears to be running over people with a car and ends with one of the least satisfying ho hum endings in comic book movie history the acting is awful likely due to the cast being embarrassed of the script the action non existent and a plot that has nothing driving it forward embarrassing sony needs to stop trying to beat this dead horse  marvel hasnt been doing much better as of late but they at least have some gas left in the tank
Feb 19 2024,negative,i wish there was a rating below half a star
Feb 19 2024,negative,the cast and acting is terrible might not be appropriate for many 7 year olds there were alot of jumpy scenes  which i liked but may not be good for the faint heart reminds me a little of final destination movies im surprised this is a marvel movie
Feb 19 2024,positive,fun film critics as usual get it wrong
Feb 19 2024,neutral,story deff felt a bit rushed throwing all these characters together all at once was extremely hard to navigate it picks up nicely in the second act and by the third i was not only invested but interested in what could come of this hope to see more
Feb 19 2024,negative,at this point you just wonder if sony will ever get to grips with what it is doing with marvel from bad dialogue to flying ambulances this is definitely not marvellous
Feb 19 2024,negative,i really didnt expect anything from this movie and it manages to give me what i expected even less but at this point more than just wishing the film bad im just wondering how sony gave the green light to a project like this i am convinced that everyone involved is aware of the quality that the film has and it seems very strange to me how this universe continues to exist it has already demonstrated since it began that there is no substance these films do not even generate economic profit except for the two venom movies i think it is important to rethink what this universe of films wants to be and where it wants to go because the only thing that madame web does achieve is generate unanimous apathy towards a very uncertain future the movie isnt even one of those that are so bad that theyre good or funny this one is so bad because its so boring and unsubstantial it has been a long time since a film generated a case study as dense as madame web
Feb 19 2024,negative,i watched it 37 times in one day  one of the spiderman movies of all time
Feb 19 2024,positive,so good cant wait to see what they do with this
Feb 19 2024,negative,sooo boring i didnt feel any action or adrenalin i laughed only after the movie about the movie
Feb 19 2024,negative,slow plot boring merely a movie to introduce lame marvel characters
Feb 19 2024,positive,horrible story lots of holes in the plots ai generated dialogue some cool scenes but would wait till after the movie is out of the theaters
Feb 19 2024,positive,the movie offers an interesting perspective as it is set in 2003 the cast is one of a kind and it is always nice to see new stories from the spiderverse the movie isnt horrible it just misses a couple of things we have gotten used to worth watching in my opinion
Feb 19 2024,positive,ve a verla mientras escuchas algo de bad bunny extasis puro
Feb 19 2024,positive,fantastic movie definitely a must see i hope they make sequels
Feb 19 2024,positive,this is the lowest ive ever reviewed a movie on here the girls were good ben was a great they had an opportunity to tell a good origin story and add some action  too much unnecessary origin story with no real payoff or closure    and stop making spiderman movies without spiderman what are they thinking about  venom 1 is the only one that should have been stand alone if sony is going to act like spiderman is not one of the top 3 most popular superheroes ever created then sell him back to marvel studios for live action    at least they knew to put him in miles morales movie
Feb 19 2024,negative,this was a terrible film horrible writing and horrible acting
Feb 19 2024,positive,the theater seats didnt work they just told us to move the whole point of oaying higher prices for the mx4d theater is that the seats are supposed to do things along with the movie theater should have blocked these seats from purchase until they get them fixed
Feb 19 2024,negative,worst superhero film in current cinema history
Feb 19 2024,negative,boring shallow nothing interesting there another morbius kinda movie
Feb 19 2024,positive,as a comic and movie fan i know that you cannot translate them one for one so when going to watch a movie i do not compare and contrast them  for me its them both existing separately that is important      most reviews could not do this and missed that this movie was not a comic  the story was not bad there was a lot of action but not the normal we have seen in action or super hero movies of late  that is okay    if you take this on its own it was enjoyable  my family who are not big comic fans all loved it  so my 3 star was moved up to account for that
Feb 19 2024,negative,another terrible marvel movie its unwatchable
Feb 19 2024,positive,its an okay movie people are exaggerating on performances or special effects everything is passable and it is a standard saturday afternoon movie critics giving it 13 is absurd given even the marvels got 62 and madam web is way more engaging than that
Feb 19 2024,positive,the movie was definitely underrated after seeing low audience scores i almost decided not to watch it but finally followed my instincts and what a pleasant surprise it was fun the plot was balanced not excessively full of fights and action sequences that are usually forced to justify the genre the chemistry between dakota and sydney sweeney isabela merced  celeste oconnor was nice and refreshing as it didnt follow the cliche of a romantic interest for the main character the story was good too conveying positive messages and portraying an unconventional hero whose main powers were more complex and untraditional dont try to compare this movie with others just enjoy it appreciating its merits standalone without thinking about genre fatigue and other nonsense coming from the mainstream i fully recommend watching it
Feb 19 2024,positive,fun movie dakota johnson was excellent
Feb 19 2024,negative,oh my goodness this has got to be the biggest train wreck of a plot to ever see the light of day
Feb 19 2024,positive,it was just a good movie i love everything about marvel and the spider verse
Feb 19 2024,positive,this is a perfect final destination meets marvel movie if you go in expecting female spiderman then you are expecting a movie that was never promised super fun movie better then some of the phase 4 marvel movies
Feb 19 2024,negative,the sound of chalk screeching is like a chill moment compared to watching that thing
Feb 19 2024,negative,great cast with horrible scripts no action scenespoor cgi i dont know how this is supposed to be superhero movie 
Feb 19 2024,positive,i can understand why a lot of people didnt like the film its different from a typical marvel film or superhero film that come out in the last years but i personally enjoyed the slow burn that come with a comings to be a superhero something that i think was lost in the marvel genera i liked the female cast and dakota interpretation of madame web is stunning what i dont understand is the prejudices about the film that its around the web even before people seen it
Feb 19 2024,positive,hi i went yesterday with my nephew 62 and 14 and we really quite enjoyed it the miserable critics seem to have overlook a few subtle features of madam web one it is presented as a very traditional comic book story and i could envisage old school peter parker and his angst in every scene even the villains work at a comic book level with a narrative style that is certainly two dimensional because that how they were written think of syndrome from the incredibles plus the young heros are completely scooby doo which only adds to retrostyling but in a very clever way i saw all of this and appreciated it greatly where as my nephew just thought it was a great movie my feeling is too many critics are too invested in the superglossy over designed marvel universe and all its associated baggage and need to take a broader filmatic view
Feb 19 2024,negative,acting was bland storyline was boring and the worst villain ever in a superhero film the editing was horrible with odd zoom ins and terrible cgi watch this movie if youre in for a good laugh at how bad it is
Feb 19 2024,negative,this is a bad movie no way around it almost unbelievable but with hollywood nowadays im not surprised
Feb 19 2024,negative,absolut horrible every 5 star review seems to be a bot
Feb 19 2024,negative,i have no accurate words to describe this train wreck in a way that truly convey how bad it is
Feb 19 2024,positive,maybe it was because i had low expectations but i thought this film was fine  yeah there were a few clunky lines and weirdly contrived plot points and the antagonists dialogue seemed amateurish but it was still enjoyable to watch and the main leads were captivating enough
Feb 19 2024,positive,i loved the movie its refreshing to have a new origins story not sure why the critics are hellbent on destroying the movie my only criticism is that they could have shown off her powers a bit more but i belive they are gearing up for a sequel
Feb 19 2024,positive,i dont understand why so many people hate on this movie me and my mom loved it
Feb 19 2024,negative,really bad and really really slow very disappointing
Feb 19 2024,negative,what did i just watch
Feb 19 2024,negative,im sorry but can we just stop making superhero movies for a while the entire genre is stale and stretched beyond breaking point there is a reason why these movies continue to fail enough
Feb 19 2024,negative,an experience youd wish youve never seen in your entire life its a horrible excuse of a superhero movie the plot is a mess the writing is terrible the editing looks like its not budgeted enough the fight scenes are horrendous it was overall terrible
Feb 19 2024,negative,a lot of people got hyped about this movie and honestly worst spiderman related movie ever looked more like a cw series and a lot of the lines from the antagonist are dubbed over making super weird most of the movie antagonist choking everyone and madam webb ran over everything with a vehicle
Feb 19 2024,negative,really bad audio work for ezikiel and was a was terrible villain bad script and directing
Feb 19 2024,positive,it was a good portrayal of the madame wed origin story
Feb 19 2024,negative,absolutely terrible such a waste of potential  dont waste your time
Feb 19 2024,negative,absolutely atrocious
Feb 19 2024,positive,be honest this movie is out of the box more epic then all mcu movies even doctor strange combanine balancing between physical and nonphysical world rationally
Feb 19 2024,negative,plot was bad dialogue terrible no spider man in it
Feb 19 2024,positive,slow burn at the start but if you like spider man the ending is really good definately worth a watch
Feb 19 2024,positive,movie was great but not the way i really expected i understand why was so emptyzzz
Feb 19 2024,negative,fuck you sony just fuck you this movie is like drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth this is the worst comic book film if you could call it a comic book film i have ever seen and i watched morbious 2 times you have the license to one of the greatest super heros and their villains and you make movies about villains actually being the good guys or in this case a character no one gives a rats ass about you have fumbled not 1 not 2 not 3 but 4 films it blows my mind how a company can be this idiotic i a 15 year old high schooler could write a better film in a week with a stick up my ass in all i cant wait for kraven the hunter im sure it will meet my none existing expectations
Feb 19 2024,positive,i loved the movie i enjoy watching a female cast kick butt being an origin story the nuances brought depth to the movie in the end the good guys won which left us ready for the next chapter
Feb 19 2024,negative,no comment no action same plays over and over again no good story refund please
Feb 19 2024,positive,the story was very captivating but id like more actions from all girls including madame web
Feb 19 2024,negative,definitely didnt meet our expectations for a marvel associated movie
Feb 19 2024,positive,this movie was pretty good confusing at times by it was fun to see references and cool weird spectaclesjust because its weird doesnt make it not fun
Feb 19 2024,neutral,acting was meh storyline was not compelling along with the marvels i see a pattern of an attempt at inclusiveness but clearly the writers were on strike for these if hollywood wants to be more inclusive try taking pointers from the mcus black widow
Feb 19 2024,positive,thought it was great
Feb 19 2024,positive,its not as awful as people make it out to be its suspenseful and gets you on the edge of your seat     is it someone thing out of this world amazing no but it was good it showed a unique aspect of the spider verse powers of telling the future and it gave you a hint of suspense     i enjoyed it 710
Feb 19 2024,negative,pretty lame fell asleep for a bit it felt like they tried to be different by having 3 future super heroes that didnt have their  powers yet tried to be unique  while setting up future movies  formula didnt work what a yawner
Feb 19 2024,negative,went in with low expectations even then they were subverted
Feb 19 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie was so fun and i love dakota such a beautiful and great actress
Feb 19 2024,negative,quite disappointing script and acting would have loved to see more developed characters i feel this film was a teaser to future ones to come they missed the mark on making this a series watchable in the future
Feb 19 2024,positive,warning spoilers ahead    my main reason for giving it the 4 instead of 4 is the action i was on the edge of my seat the entire time and in a good way i was constantly stuck between did it happen or is this the future and the sound effects were quite intense but in a good way when judging action scenes i recall the theater collectively going ooohh as we all kind of flinched thinking what the pain would feel like based on the sounds especially during the diner scene i thought the actual fighting sequences were pretty good too considering the powerforce differences between the characters it was more like wit vs brute force which seemed appropriate considering cassies adjustment to her powers vs the much stronger villain i tend to judge fightaction scenes based on whether the portrayal of strengths is reasonable or not     getting into some of the less positive aspects  other comments    some of the lines were a bit cheesy  random  rushed  couldve been stronger   it wouldve been nice to see more of the girls bonding and becoming their projected future selves   villain origin story was missing what was his motivationend goal with having the spider he just seemed like a weakly written character  maybe this is just me but i expected the villains it support girl to somehow intervene and help the girls outwhen she realized their ages it just seemed like she would play a larger role in the plot  didnt know emma roberts was in this just seemed kind of random lol   why didnt ben want to reveal who his love interest was i thought there was going to be something with him  cassie based on the silence  i am not familiar with the comics so i was surprised to see cassie in her condition at the end of the film didnt realize the full extent of that one explosion in the water    overall it was pretty entertaining and the plot of a not trying to catch feelings socially awkward paramedic becoming a caring mother figure to 3 teen girls was pretty sweet i wouldnt let any negative reviews keep you from watching it there are some pretty cool parts to it you might like it
Feb 19 2024,positive,not nearly as bad as people are saying it was very enjoyable with fun characters there was good action with a decent villain just go watch it and form your own opinion
Feb 19 2024,positive,this movie was waaay better than the reviews said it was the cast was good and i didnt notice anything that deserved the hate this movie is getting not the best marvel entry but it was a good pastime and worth seeing pretty cool story and great messages of found  family
Feb 19 2024,positive,the movie is actually really good once you make all the connections
Feb 19 2024,positive,i thought the movie was enjoyable
Feb 19 2024,positive,if its not a marvel movie but a stand alone title it might be better they give too much important to marvels easter egg stuff instead of character development and plot
Feb 19 2024,positive,from an intriguing first scene to a satisfying finale this is a fun ride     dakota johnson is humorously sarcastic in the title role with the rest of the cast fulfilling the job of giving audiences a good time    the dialogue is fun and to the point the fact that the movie doesnt entertain in the same manner that other marvel flicks do is a good thing this has its own personality and is a bit more cerebral rather than just one battle after another    a scene in a diner is played humorously yet tense and reminds one of the goofy entertaining movies from the 80s    this is a good fun quickly paced flick  id like to see more of madame web
Feb 19 2024,positive,surprised with all the negative reviews i thought it was pretty entertaining and better than the marvels which i recently watched on disney plus
Feb 19 2024,positive,this movie has everything spiders car crash hassan piker if youre looking to crawl into a fantasy world this might be the film for you and your loving wife consider watching this if you think you might like it 5 stars
Feb 19 2024,positive,we liked  not loved  this movie  8 out of 10  i dont understand all the bad reviews  i kept wondering when the movie was going to get bad  an enjoyable movie  i think it will be very successful on dvd and streaming
Feb 19 2024,positive,its a good movie i dont understand why experts rated so bad
Feb 19 2024,negative,this movie was not it i was excited but ended up being disappointed marvel needs to step  up their game  do better wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone save your money
Feb 19 2024,negative,theres more suits and action in the trailer than in the hole movie my sister and i agree is the worst movie of marvel was just happy with the ending song dreams by the cranberries
Feb 19 2024,positive,its an entertaining film there isnt much new to see here and there are some wasted opportunities to tie to mark and ben parker    its a wortwhile film and not the hot garbage some thinkbut its definitely not a pinacle piece like tom holland led spiderman films or most of the mcu at large
Feb 19 2024,negative,awful writing awful cinematography awful performances extremely awful adr this movie is truly bad
Feb 19 2024,positive,i would say as a non fan of marvel movies but a fan of geeky things in general this might have been the most entertaining movie be prepared to make fun of it as you go and dont take it too seriously
Feb 19 2024,positive,enjoyed the movie some parts couldve been better but didnt think it was as bad as people thought give it a 375 wish it did better because i feel the second movie wouldve been a lot better
Feb 19 2024,negative,in the beginning the camera moves so much you almost get whiplash there is no hero training scene which is important for any hero character coming into their powers
Feb 19 2024,positive,was a great movie cant wait for the second movie
Feb 19 2024,negative,terrible marvel should be embarrassed awful plot with worse script writing 
Feb 19 2024,positive,review 
Feb 19 2024,positive,was wary of the movie going in as the all the reviews online were super negative but i was was very pleasantly surprised with it the begging of the movie establishes the characters just enough to the point where we care for them and it doesnt use up too much of the run time the special effects cinematography and acting by dakota johnson perfectly exemplify the suspense of the movie and the magic behind it super fun watch definitely recommend
Feb 19 2024,positive,fun and thrilling i love girl power movies and that was a cool uplifting and unique movie madame web has awesome superpowers
Feb 19 2024,positive,we really enjoyed this movie this is a great addition to the marvel franchise we are hoping to see more of this story line in the future   we found it to have a spiritual content good acting and special effects   it was a high 5 star performance
Feb 19 2024,positive,very much exceeded expectations the story was engaging and coherent the acting was serviceable was refreshing that some of the action was not cgi if you are marvel fan you will not be disappointed 
Feb 19 2024,positive,dont know what people all talking about movie is amazinghow it got bad reviews cant understand hopefully theyll make another one
Feb 19 2024,positive,contrary to stupid credits  this is actually a good movie made good use of the time and plot was explained fluidly and precisely  acting was good and no over the top acting like other spiderman movies  wife and i both liked it    the end fight could improve with more what if scenarios but its not bad at all
Feb 19 2024,negative,this might be the worse movie ive ever watched in my lifetime how can one have an amazing cast like that  create such a travesty  i walked in with no expectations but the girls were looking like halloween city when i saw them suited up twice for a second so poorly written
Feb 19 2024,positive,this movie is definitely up there for me in terms of  marvel films because i genuinely liked the story and the characters i feel like the directors tried to do more with the time they were given and they should have just focused more on cassandras mother and her relation to ezekiel as opposed to cassandra protecting the three girls from ezekiel and trying to squeeze extra tidbits in if youre going to begin telling the story of a character it should just be about that character i do like the three girls characters but i think the directors could have set this up much better for a sequel if the girls were more of a side thing than the whole movie i really liked it though the action shots were insanely cool and got my heart racing
Feb 19 2024,neutral,lazy writing i feel that there is potential with a better director but the story and acting was just lazy  great idea bad execution
Feb 19 2024,positive,i mean is not the best movie of the decade but is not as bad as everybody say is an origins movie you wont see a lot of powers display but it does the job i enjoyed i was hesitant to pay for it but it was a good one that doesnt mean that they used false advertisement but well survive 
Feb 19 2024,positive,ummm good movie the ending what was that trash is what it was it wasnt even that bad in beginning the cgi yeah umm the middle was good but that ending was straight garbage its literally like they just gave up gave her sunglasses and sat that heifer in a wheelchair and called it an ending i love dakota but she shouldve stuck to romance or whatever else shes in cuz she just looked awkward while trying to be a superhero there was a point where she was standing there and she just looked goofy shes so good tho i love her but yeah it was just the ending that made me want to die
Feb 19 2024,positive,not as awesome as many other marvel movies would have preferred to have watched it for free on disney
Feb 19 2024,positive,what can i say it was alright i was going to give it a 75 till the last three minutes  it was soooo cringey i guess part of the problem was not getting the full action they promised but it was just an introduction also you really need to be into dakota johnsons type of awkwardness
Feb 19 2024,negative,i think giving this movie one star is being generous between the plot that made no sense the dialogue that sounds like a child wrote it the lines that rahim said that sounded dubbed over and the zooming in and out randomly at times made it feel like it was shot with a camcorder this is by far the worst movie ive ever seen in the theatre dont waste your money or time on this stinker
Feb 19 2024,positive,very good fun movie enjoyed it very much obviously its not godfather 2 or gone with the wind but for what it is i liked it and my kids did too
Feb 19 2024,positive,its the origin story of madame web its different from most superhero movies but its still good
Feb 19 2024,positive,was impressed with the movie and the plot im not sure why reviews are so poor good cast and storyline
Feb 19 2024,negative, i think this is the worst movie i ever saw 
Feb 19 2024,positive,ive heard all the negativity ive seen movies that were a lot worse  this wasnt terrible  i actually enjoyed it
Feb 19 2024,positive,entertaining definitely not a bad movie  the story line wasnt as bad as people say maybe the whole amazon trip was a little too much but other than that solid
Feb 19 2024,positive,honestly ignore the low ratings and go see for yourself i think people are caring the prejudice over the past few mcu movies who have been a bit of the same formula and also sequels there is always some loss with a sequel we all know that but this is an origin movie and it was actually pretty good i would say a 7510 freon a different metric i didnt know now much about madame web so im only talking from the mcu perspective and i was missing a movie like that i really hope the low ratings doesnt mean the end for madame web i like where it seems to be heading for those comparing with morbius it is nothing like that i promise
Feb 19 2024,positive,i was expecting much worse  however  this is a step up from morbius despite the horrible miscasting of dakota johnson in the lead role  she elicits very little interest in her character  the story  although convoluted  is somewhat fun   however  i found my thoughts crossing universes between marvel and dc  not being familiar with the comic this is based on didnt help it struck me as the basis for the birds of prey television show
Feb 19 2024,negative,complete garbage  im so embarrassed for the mcu
Feb 19 2024,positive,i enjoyed myself sony has a lot of room to grow in expanding their universe superhero film
Feb 19 2024,positive,definitely not as bad as others are saying much better than most recent marvel movies it has more of a slowburn thriller vibe which my family enjoyed for the first time in a while i actually cared about the heroes and wanted the villian to get his my family enjoyed it but if you want to see a bunch of ripped dudes blow stuff up this isnt your thing
Feb 19 2024,negative,wokness is killing everything
Feb 19 2024,positive,this was really good wellplotted good acting nice action  effects plus a ton of easter eggs cant wait to see it again
Feb 19 2024,neutral,i do like marvel universe movies but this one is probably the worst one ive seen 
Feb 19 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie very much super fun not an intellectually challenging story line but worth your time 
Feb 19 2024,positive,great pace great character development and great dialog minus a few moments the characters werent all powerful immediately like they tend to be in other marvel movies with female protagonists making it easier to root for the characters as you see them struggle before winning in the end
Feb 19 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie my teenage girls i took with me loved it so much and were practically bouncing when we left bc of the baby and next movie set up i dont understand all the hate there have been so many marvel movies that were way worse and dont even get me started on dc this is the first originprequel comic book movie ive thought was entertaining looking at you logan movie critics are way too jaded these days this movie was fun and interesting stop being grumpy
Feb 19 2024,negative,unfortunately the new marvel madame web movie fell short of expectations despite its potential for an enthralling story and captivating characters the film struggled to engage viewers and lacked the compelling narrative that fans have come to expect from marvel the pacing felt uneven and the plot failed to deliver the depth and excitement often associated with superhero movies while the visual effects were impressive they were not enough to salvage a lackluster storyline overall the movie failed to leave a lasting impression and may disappoint diehard marvel enthusiasts
Feb 19 2024,negative,dakota johnsons performance will be studied for years to come
Feb 19 2024,positive,i do not get the hatethere was some clunky dialogue at the start but after that it settled into a nice little origin story  it was set in the early noughts but almost felt like a 90s superhero film in all the good ways  dakota johnson goes through the whole heros journey while looking after some teens with attitude told you it felt 90s d and i hope we see more of our spider heroines sometime in the future
Feb 19 2024,positive,dont listen to the haters the movie is amazing  would recommend watching will definitely be re watching this movie
Feb 19 2024,positive,great movie that takes the time to build the story looks like ma4vel is getting back to its roots introduce the character and do a great job with their origin story my teen girls loved it and we cant wait for the next one
Feb 19 2024,positive,time skips was bad in the movie   introduction  of the movie was good
Feb 19 2024,negative,unfortunately sonys madam web is set to be considered one of the weakest superhero films ever made a bold statement but one that reflects its reality despite boasting a talented cast their potential is undercut by a combination of lackluster editing and either poorly portrayed characters or performances that seem disengaged as if the cast was aware from the start that the project was doomed to fail the core issue lies in its uninteresting story which fails to captivate or engage making madam web a disappointing addition to the superhero genre
Feb 19 2024,positive,its nice good to see the girls but some feeling was missing
Feb 19 2024,positive,not perfect but aside from a few odd details like the yellow taxi a good movie  i cant see how it was much worse than no way home which was a bit silly in spite of some great moments madame web has an odd ending not great but i get it as a set up for the new characters  who are very interesting so i might compare it to soso origin films for wolverine  were they as good as x1 or x2 no but i would say only two marvel movies were as good as x1 and x2  so anyway madame web is great maybe for its target audience like my daughter she gave it 4 stars or 45 because it was too kidshowy at the end she is 12 so if more critics or kids were writing reviews the score might go up it was a lot like a cheesy comic book and so people just dont get it sony did a good job all things considered with their odd contract
Feb 19 2024,positive,its not that bad i dont understand all the extremely bad reviews
Feb 19 2024,negative,i couldnt even make it to the end of the movie before deciding my half star rating poor writing poor characters poor execution morbius level bad a waste of a starstudded cast
Feb 19 2024,negative,dear god i had hope but that was ruined in the first ten minutes
Feb 19 2024,negative,i dont understand why they would make a superhero movie with no superhero costumes for 95 of the movie and the spiderman connection was extremely weak like we all knew that the babys name was going to be peter eyeroll
Feb 19 2024,positive,i enjoyed it dakota is fun and witty the villain is creepy four lead females awesome the origin is interesting the plot isnt overshadowed by the origin story the sfx are solid and there are a couple overt connections to the mcu spider verse     all in all this flick is getting a lot more hate than i expected and as i read the review a lot of them are coming from folks who dont plan to see the movie so they dont really get an opinion yeah
Feb 19 2024,negative,lack of story and a total treason to spiderman without anything new
Feb 19 2024,negative,the movie was slow and boring  nothing made since  played off spiderman and to top it off she could just see the future  long and drawn out  i had to get a refill of popcorn because i was so bored  save your money it will be free on a streaming service soon
Feb 19 2024,negative,terrible movie with no pretense
Feb 19 2024,positive,entertaining popcorn movie  overly roasted by critics
Feb 19 2024,negative,everything from the action storyline the characters build up the explanations to whats going on as far as the powers or abilities was not there and underwhelming the attitudes logic and seriousness of their situation was not even taken seriously which makes it even less captivating the teenagers in my opinion looked older which didnt fit the roles theres more but i wasnt a big fan of the film
Feb 19 2024,positive,this is truly one of the movies ever made i was sobbing when madame web said its webbing time and webbed all over the place i have heard that this film reemployed the writers from the cult classic morbius this was an excellent decision as the writing is extremely written this film changed my life and if i dare to say it may in fact be even greater than morbius
Feb 19 2024,neutral,its not as bad as people are making it out to be went in with low expectations and that might have helped
Feb 19 2024,positive,genuinely loved this movie the plot and story were super interesting and shows the clairvoyance power in such an exciting interesting way instead of playing scenes redundantly the cast was great with dakota and sydney
Feb 18 2024,positive,a nice take  on spider wimen saga possibllity of sidestories are endless with multiple characters good movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,action packed kept us on the edge of our seats
Feb 18 2024,negative,this was more of a close to two hour pepsi commercial than anything there must have been someone on staff to make sure every pepsi can faced the camera not sure i would count their speaking as dialog neither seemed to be no compatibility with any of the actors poorly put together
Feb 18 2024,neutral,not as bad an everyone says if you know what youre getting into youll have a fun time i recommend you rent it or wait for streaming
Feb 18 2024,negative,another sony marvel movie where they use a spiderman side character in a solo movie no one asked for of course when they almost made an aunt may movie       its like sony only made the movie because tom holland wanted madame web in a spiderman movie      which definitely would have been better especially if she showed up in the no way home end credits scene where he felt the most alone        madame web did keep my attention but mostly felt like a superhero version of final destination
Feb 18 2024,positive,i loved this movie so much fun go see it
Feb 18 2024,negative,my favorite part was leaving the theatre and pranced to my car
Feb 18 2024,negative,this film in useless first of all the plot is confusing because the entire story turn around the villain that must kill three girls but in this film that has a link with comics and superpowers there arent superpowers is a thriller movie that has not a structure is all superficial sony must stop to make movies that are not linked with spiderman i am without any words the best aspect of this film is the chemistry between the 4 main characters stop this is the only aspect that i save about this film i would talk about the other good characteristics of this film but unfortunately there arent sorry
Feb 18 2024,positive,not as bad as the critics said it was way better than the marvels for sure  i just dont understand why they even made this movie from what i read they were never going to make a sequel or follow up with anyone offs etc disney and marvel really needs to step it up
Feb 18 2024,positive,we really enjoyed the movie in spite of what naysayers said
Feb 18 2024,positive,not great but a good time
Feb 18 2024,negative,if i was to rate this movie between a 1 and 10 id give it a negative 2  it lacked so much action and just came off as the kind of movie to make you fall asleep in the middle of it this movie definitely would never live up to the other marvel films that have came out just my personal opinion
Feb 18 2024,negative,terrible movieterrible actingterrible writerssmh
Feb 18 2024,negative,when you take on the responsibility great power will come     all 15 of us in the theater applauded as this movie came to its conclusion it was a great responsibility now we have great power
Feb 18 2024,negative,poor acting by the leads esp dakota not a spec of emotion on their faces is that how you run for life 30mins on and i just lose my mind im burning my bridges with dakota its over gurl
Feb 18 2024,positive,someone said that the mcu shouldve called 911 sure but i hope dakota changes time the movie is quite fun but what happened at the end hah and the actresses are hot
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was ridiculous at times but i was entertained the whole time and i love dakota johnson
Feb 18 2024,positive,is it deadpool is it guardians is it avengers is it any of the tom holland spiderman films nope not even close but in a world where we have been spoiled by some spectacular blockbusters this film is an entertaining way to spend two hours and get lost in a movie world at a time when everything else is caught up in overly complicated multiverse plots madame webb actually stays contained within its own story and keeps the thread moving throughout there are some plot gaps and unexplained moments that leave you scratch your head my biggest regret  wishing that adam scott had more screen time in the best played role of the film
Feb 18 2024,positive,i thought this was a great movie  i dont know why the professional critics panned this one  it had a message  it was interesting with a powerful villain  even the womens lib if that will stop you was nowhere near as strong as in movies from a couple of years ago
Feb 18 2024,positive,would highly suggest watching this movie fresh characters who messed together well and felt authentic forbidding villain that while generic felt well connected definitely worth a trip to the movies
Feb 18 2024,positive,i would say even though the ssu sonys spider man universe had negative reviews this movie was better than morbius and venom two i never seen a movie with dakota johnson but this is the first movie that she did a good job in good luck sony for any of your future films and to sidney sweeney
Feb 18 2024,positive,quiet a nice watch considering all the negative reviews
Feb 18 2024,positive,great movie much fun to watch
Feb 18 2024,neutral,the film isnt as bad as some critics might say but it was definitely presented with issues regarding the script i think as some point they had a good script but everything was changed and it turned intothat way too many teases to mcu events or spiderman related things we dont need a film with so many teases to spiderman just make your own story
Feb 18 2024,negative,what a waste of time i so wanted this to be good but geez it was cringy to watch the action scenes were laughably bad
Feb 18 2024,negative,this is the worst hollywood film i have seen in the past 2 years  truly uninspired lacking chemistry amongst the actors confusing storytelling and bad cgiit is better left to be seen while you are doing house chores that may help you keep awake
Feb 18 2024,positive,great movie very entertaining it tied in well with the marvel movies nice having leading characters as females 
Feb 18 2024,negative,worst superhero movie of all time not a single fight scene and cringe dialogesbad acting
Feb 18 2024,negative,twas the shittiest of shitstorms i have ever paid 26 to see do not see this at your own risk
Feb 18 2024,negative,how is this what marvel has become one of the worst things ive ever watched it was rushed unsure of what it was trying to be and just so boring no even adam scott could save thus disaster dont waste your time
Feb 18 2024,positive,i was entertained by the ensemble of actresses and their unique superhero story
Feb 18 2024,negative,4 superheroes and the villain dies with a p
Feb 18 2024,positive,im so glad this movie exist in a world where peter parker has been revamped  rebranded so many times i enjoyed the secrecy of everything but saying his name this film aims high  takes a chance madame web dares to dig into a story outside the spiderman world    the film dates back to 2003 new york city  maybe up until halfway through i realized that a phone wasnt even an option to handle a crisis im not sure if its this movie specifically but it gives the impression that 2003 isntwasnt that long ago or maybe im old ironically the villain shows us that we have come more dependent on technology usage for the character of spiderman    i do wish they fully committed to being practical instead of teasing some of the suit looks  powers thats a lil frustrating when you look at the cgi the actors are strong enough to carry the dialogue if you give them something worth while its not perfect but to me could easily be one of my favorite non peter parker spiderman movies the possibilities of a sequel im unsure but i could happily watch this as a prequel for the toby mcguire films despite no correlation    i dont think ill ever understand the hate on its initial release its a cool movie that doesnt try so hard to be anything but itself
Feb 18 2024,negative,the movie made no sense
Feb 18 2024,negative,i was not impressed with a movie that does not spider man in the movie and the story didnt convince me at all it is not a movie for me maybe for someone else
Feb 18 2024,positive,i try not to take the reviews of movies too seriously before i watched this i heard mixed reviews and some people saying this was going to be the lowest ranking marvel film those same people are the ones that said the flash movie was bad i enjoyed the flash movie this one wasnt bad either i personally liked it
Feb 18 2024,positive,the actor who plays the evil spiderman in the movie is the only downside its as if sony filmed the movie with a whole other actor and then dubbed in this new guy and his lips dont match the voice 
Feb 18 2024,positive,few cheesy moments and plot holes but overall enjoyable if you like the spiderman story   lots of good action
Feb 18 2024,negative,simply awful just awful
Feb 18 2024,positive,although theres a lot of problems but its a lot of fun
Feb 18 2024,positive,this movies was amazing i went with my friend and we both greatly enjoyed this movie no spoilers this movie was gripping and held my attention for the whole 2 hours i have a short attention span so for me this is pretty impressive there was a perfect storyline everything worked perfectly i would not recommend this movie for children under the age of 10 as it might scare them but otherwise i recommend this movie for everyone
Feb 18 2024,negative,this was really appalling the dialogue was incredibly bad ai would improve it
Feb 18 2024,positive,its not as bad as the reviewers and critics wants you to believeits not great but its entertaining it doesnt feel long its worth a watch
Feb 18 2024,positive,hey you left your mail down the stairs
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was okay  perhaps the next one will be better
Feb 18 2024,positive,i loved it and stayed hooked throughout the movie i dont know the source material so cant talk to how closely it matched the comics but for me it didnt matter it was a gripping story and i cant wait for any sequels they have planned
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie was one of the worst films ive ever seen the writing for this movie was awful the delivery of the lines was terrible as well i was excited to see this movie and was disappointed after watching it
Feb 18 2024,negative,super slow storyline and character development
Feb 18 2024,negative,do not watch this trash  its like a low budget tv show with bad acting  just watch the trailer and move on with your life
Feb 18 2024,positive,all the four sony spiderman spinoffs this was the best by far the four ladies carried the storyline i love how ben and mary parker are featured in the movie  i love the 2000s vibe  the main thing i didnt like about the movie is the villain i found ezekiel annoying af
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie was so bad that it wasnt even hilariously bad or campy bad it was not only distressingly stupid and poorly written it was also almost offensive in how its marketed the characters never actually become superheroes the whole premise is really that sony needs to make a throwaway movie every 5 years to keep the rights to spiderman however i dont think even they knew how much money theyd lose on this pile of garbage i wouldnt suggest anyone even watch it on tv
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie was so bad that i made a rotten tomatoes account just so i could give it this rating
Feb 18 2024,negative,ive never left a review for a movie in my 30 years here on earth if you value your time and sanity and everything you stand for as a normal person do not watch this movie my girlfriend drug me to see this today and this isnt your typical bad movie its a one of kind impressive i might add atrocity of a movie its worse than a movie its an eye sore and i physically cringed through most of the movie    the writing for the villain is incredibly dull and weak  the plot successfully accomplishes zero things the entire plot is a set up for a sequels that i doubt will ever come  the whole plot could be summarized in a 23 min flashback which would be far more entertaining than anything this movie could imagine    im begging you save your time and money i wish i could give less than half a star review but thatll have to do for now
Feb 18 2024,positive,it is a great origin story with cool tieins to the larger spiderman universe beyond that its a good movie delving into the dangers of obsession and of creating your own destruction
Feb 18 2024,positive,the idea of the story was interesting but the execution and direction was done poorly some action sequences were cool and some werent as much
Feb 18 2024,negative,madame web is the worst superhero movie ive ever watched in my life and look at the fantastic four the flash and thor love and thunder i hate it but this surpasses them all
Feb 18 2024,negative,yikes just so horrible half the dialog is from behind because they dubbed over half the movie the other half makes you feel like you are watching a foreign film dubbed over in english there was almost nothing good just so bad
Feb 18 2024,positive,movie was pretty good love the villian suit is the movie perfect no its not but its not garbage as they say go see it with an open mind 
Feb 18 2024,positive,depth  selfempowerment    if you are a wanderer of the rabbit holes of lifean explorer of the psyche  the language of the universe this is by far one of the best films out there     on tier with inception interstellar the matrix cloud atlas but in superhero format    i can see why this movie can be upsetting to some as it is very different from most marvel films and i think thats precisely what makes it incredible    an absolute thrill thought provoking mindbending powerful experience
Feb 18 2024,positive,great story and lots of action
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie has terrible writing and the antagonist is the driest with the worst motivation ever dakota johnson is the only reason to go see this movie everything else is trash
Feb 18 2024,positive,much better than how the critics described it
Feb 18 2024,positive,dakota is  a lot better than other marvel movies and it wasnt over the top fake
Feb 18 2024,positive,one of the funniest movies out laughed almost the entire time movie of the year pls
Feb 18 2024,positive,madam web was so good i for sure think a second one is going to come out by that ending bro cassie is such a badass and her story is so great action scenes are on pointi do wish there were more fighting scenes and more scenes of the girls in the suits
Feb 18 2024,negative,i think i need to apologise to morbius in all seriousness this film is total garbage with a weak script and underwhelming characters the villain shows no real menace to the plot and this proves as to why superhero flicks arent what they used to be even as recently as 2019  its also probably been done to set up spiderman 4 which even now im debating to go watch
Feb 18 2024,positive,while this may not be a fantastic movie i felt it was more enjoyable than the reviews give it just relax and dont think too hard about it i think this may become a cult film one day like empire records  lol
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was  really good movieintroducing new younger superwomen to marvel universe
Feb 18 2024,negative,complete shiet  unwatchable  more junk from studio hacks
Feb 18 2024,positive,this sony movie is not that bad as people are saying  they are just haters who think that each superhero movie need to be as good as avengers endgame    when i saw on the internet that this movie was even less good that morbius i was not expecting anything in fact i was suprised because ive prefered madame web than morbius even if some are saying the opposite    it is true that this is not the best superhero movies because you dont have the thrills and the excitement of movie like endgame or spiderman homecoming by example    i passed a good time and me and my friends even laugh hard at some acts the actresses were good in general and they have done their best    for me it was more a psycology thriller than a common superhero movie but it was not that bad the humor was more for young people than older but by sometimes it was funny    at the end i was down to see what comes next with those characters
Feb 18 2024,negative,madame web is if final destination was an outdated  poorly executed comic book movie filled with numerous plot conveniences dialogue so painful its noticeably dubbed over  action that is lazy its a shock this movie was given the okay to be made
Feb 18 2024,negative,lackluster characters with even worse pacing how do i get my money back
Feb 18 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie went in with no real expectations and i liked it i could see myself watching it more than a few times it did have a few bad cgi moments and one plot point i didnt get but i am here for the ride
Feb 18 2024,negative,another lackluster sonymarvel associated superhero film the film at it roots had an inspiring new story to tell but it fell far from that the cinematography at times became an eye sore and the cgi reminded me of a early 2000s film the storytelling and performances left a lot to be desired i can only hope that future superhero films steer clear of the blueprint this film followed
Feb 18 2024,positive,enjoyable  definitely not as bad as the people are saying in my opinion its just negative mob mentality
Feb 18 2024,positive,not as bad as people are making out its mediocre but not the worst and better than morbius in my opinion  love dakota johnson in this film she had such good comedic presence and feel she should be in more comedys
Feb 18 2024,negative,i fell asleep during the movie
Feb 18 2024,negative,i wasnt expecting much but it became worst than expected what a waste of time
Feb 18 2024,positive,madame web is certainly not the greatest movie ive seen but its not the worst either there are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future but needs a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment with a talented cast music and some fun writing can be the building blocks but they cant erase what felt like lots of production limitations rewrites and editing that greatly shows in the film a couple of boring battles annoying gimmicks and underdeveloped characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if it wants to continue in future installments
Feb 18 2024,negative,although i was really excited for this movie i was fairly dissatisfied with the lack of production i would give it three stars but the movie seemed rushed   a desperate attempt to make something good but backfired on them   i hope sonys spiderman universe can redeem themselves with kraven the hunter   but not getting my hopes up
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was enjoyable to watch if you are looking for something on the level of the avengers connected to tom holland or tom hardy then you will be disappointed  but if you are okay with a good story and a decent plot then you will find this entertaining  it was good for what it was 
Feb 18 2024,negative,utter garbage among the worst films ive ever seen in a cinema inept in every way from concept to finished product saying that i had an absolute ball watching this in the cinema and laughed the whole way through it but aye absolute trash
Feb 18 2024,negative,dakota johnson is an awful actress just cause your fam is talented doesnt mean one should get roles over other more deserving talents
Feb 18 2024,positive,kids love it is a good movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,the movie has some good action scenes however i felt the story line was at times confusing and left gaps with the characters along the way there were some scenes that made absolutely no sense and almost seemed as if the writer had hit a blank and just did a few fillers
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie makes morbius look like lord of the rings whose high school film project was this
Feb 18 2024,negative,to whoever established the thought of making this movieyou should honestly think about killing yourself
Feb 18 2024,positive,i saw this movie because of the bad reviews i wanted to see how bad it was for myself surprise i had a blast it was a fun movie by far not as bad as people are claiming ive seen much much worse superhero movies trust me this one like i said kept my attention and kept me entertained there were some weird plot holes and the villain was the weakest link but overall this was a fun movie ignore the haters go see it and judge for yourself you might enjoy it
Feb 18 2024,positive,this movie is hilarious love what they did with the adr 
Feb 18 2024,negative,the original darker and mature story for the movie should have been made johnsons character had to protect a pregnant mary parker from a villain that wanted to kill her to prevent peter parker spiderman from being born why it was changed to the utter nonsense we were given is not fair to stars like johnson and sweeney     bad writing bad direction and editing shame on everyone
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was a little cringe at the end but i think its getting a lot of hate because the trailer was misleading     i was hoping to see how they all get their powers
Feb 18 2024,positive,all these low scores are from hard core marvel fans the movie delivered and did great its not your typical super hero movie thats for sure but we needed a change from all those derivative disney marvel films
Feb 18 2024,positive,villain was bad but at least it was better than mobius and somewhat entertaining  you really need to suspend your logical thinking to be able to sit through certain parts of the movie but other than that the action was not bad and liked some of the spiderman references they made in a movie where they try really hard not to mention spiderman
Feb 18 2024,negative,madame web is a very strong contender for the worst superhero film ever produced by a major studio it almost feels like a parody of a superhero film both the main protagonist and the antagonist give some of the dullest performances i have seen much of the dialogue feels clunky and forced if not obviously dubbed over the action in this film is nonexistent as the sequences are pretty much just running away from the villain and avoiding being killed by him the characters are not likable or believable and the costumes and outfits for the heroes and villains all look like you would find them in a fan made trailer or student film the film had a couple of glimpses of something competent but ends up feeling completely disjointed the only time we ever even see the heroes fighting the villain are in these visiondream sequences where everything is hazy and the actors look silly in their costumes unfortunately we never arrive at this moment in the film and none of the characters who are teased to become these heroes develop powers nor is it even alluded to how they do i am not sure how or why sony continues to release these films when they are this terrible but they should discontinue their spiderman universe and start over or give the rights to someone else
Feb 18 2024,negative,i generously award this cinematic masterpiece a stellar twostar rating it brilliantly delivered on my expectations of a movie where good people effortlessly triumph without any surprising twists or rollercoaster excitement the bad guys motivation remained a mysterious enigma as he showcased superpowers with an unparalleled level of incompetence  a true beacon of weakness the girls apparently masters of subtlety skillfully attracted attention from unknown teens and gracefully danced on tables while trying to lay low is it a gripping reality or just a figment of madam webs imagination the movies ability to let my brain take a welldeserved nap at home truly makes it a popcornworthy gem for the ages
Feb 18 2024,positive,the movie was outstanding need to see more movies like this one  i give it a 5 star
Feb 18 2024,negative,really slow first half drawn out story line was boring and all set up for a sequel which i would rather have a double root canal then watch this again or any thing related
Feb 18 2024,positive,the strong female lead cast did not disappoint great writing some hilarious one liners throughout the film that will have you laughing out loud its a feel good movie with a perfect set up for a sequel which im hoping we get
Feb 18 2024,negative,ii dont have words to describe what i watched  first of all i had absolutely low expectations to start with after seeing the trailer but yet this movie still manages to disgust me no movie in the comic book adaptation or superhero genre as a whole i have seen is this bad   i agree sony already did messed up hiring morbius crew for this film but swooney and johnson are culprits too as during this movie i sometimes felt that they were unable to act example whenever there was a flashback or a vision to future dakota johnson couldnt keep up with whats happening  cinematography disappointed me because from the person that has worked on spiderman no way home i only expected that even if everything is bad in this movie cinematography will be better  probably the only thing making sense is sony trolling us  thanks sony for this absolute mastercrap of a movie truly a one that i will never forget and will haunt me in my sleep   perhaps morbius i was too harsh on you
Feb 18 2024,positive,i dont get why is there so much hate on this movie it is a very entertaining and very interesting movie
Feb 18 2024,negative,awful id like my money back 
Feb 18 2024,negative,from the beginning from the very first trailer i knew it was going to be nothing the movie was terrible sony dont ever make a mistake like this again please but now there were also good things it just hasnt been repaired
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie is an embarrassment to sony and to spiderman this is the worst movie ive seen in since fantastic 4 2015
Feb 18 2024,negative,so bad can i have my money and time back and if possible toi forget that i ever saw that horrible movie 
Feb 18 2024,positive,wasnt a perfect movie but a start of a good sequel is inevitable this movie only scratched the surface on whats to come  you have to have a beginning of a story before you get to the meat and potatoes of the full idea give it time
Feb 18 2024,negative,the story was bad the action was bad the adr was bad the dialogue was bad  the acting was passable but everything that was done in post ruined any hope that this movie could get 35 stars  i felt no connection to any of the characters and felt no desire to see the villain fail  it feels like this was a first draft written by chatgpt and edited by a high school video productions class
Feb 18 2024,negative,the young talent was the only redeemable thing about this movie has to be the worst marvel movie yet slow disjointed main villain is the worst  so many cliche lines it felt like a b movie the repeated flash forwardsvisions were overplayed i paid extra to see in imax a total waste of time and painful to watch
Feb 18 2024,negative,the film is practically an hour and fiftyfour minutes of pure nothingness the antithesis of a superhero film a real example of how not to make a comic book film i really want to understand what was going through s j clarksons screwedup head that all this nonsense was a good idea super hero movies mainly need two things people in costumes and great fight scenes this movie has none of that i wonder where they used this 80 million budget i really dont believe in horrendous cgi special effects and poorly made constant camera cuts and shots that look like they were taken during an earthquake the only thing it has in common with the comic is the name not to mention the coprotagonist actresses who remember absolutely nothing of their comic book counterparts if not one and for those few costume scenes not even those the villain is mediocre if not bordering on ridiculous they took a character from case of the comics originally good and they made him evil with a weak motivation morbius in comparison as much as i liked it although the latter is also full of problems placed next to madame web makes it of the caliber of cult films like citizen kane in conclusion this film is a bad fanfiction without rhyme or reason of a minor comic book character so much potential wasted shredded eaten spat out if not vomited and thrown into the incinerator
Feb 18 2024,negative,please just stop
Feb 18 2024,positive,watch it for the plotmsjohnson
Feb 18 2024,positive,the movie starts slow and has a few cheesy issues but overall this is a great movie  there is a lot of action  good story  typical marvel movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,madame web was bad but its not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be it wouldnt surprise me if half the people in the reviews havent actually watched it
Feb 18 2024,negative,if i could give it zero stars i would this movie had no redeeming qualities i didnt think dakota johnson could be any worse at acting and this movie proved me wrong the story made no sense  the villain made no sense awful awful awful sony needs to admit defeat and surrender all the rights it has to any part of marvel to the official mcu
Feb 18 2024,negative,i dont understand why sony cares so little but wants me to care about their bad movies this is a disaster and laughable at best
Feb 18 2024,positive,maybe not quite as much action as your regular marvel movie but my wife and i thought it was great
Feb 18 2024,negative,the film is set in 2003 and it is shot like it is a tv pilot from that time too everything in it is so halfbaked that it is really unbelievable that this is such a huge studio film at the same time for this exact reason and maybe because even bad superhero movies are still comfort films for me there was some charm to it the simplicity with which a lot of it is approached and the lack of real stakes really made this a very comfortable watch it is still a bad film but i really didnt think it was one of the worst superhero movies the last superhero movie i saw at the theater aquaman 2 was definitely worse than this in my opinion  and i think the casting was done a long time ago because watching syndey sweeny as a meekmannered teenager supporting character feels very weird when shes basically established as the new hot star in hollywood
Feb 18 2024,negative,one of the worst films ive seen in my life  misleading trailer making us think we would have heroines in the films and they only appear for 30 seconds  ridiculous villain a poorly made copy of spiderman just to say there is a spiderman  shame on others film
Feb 18 2024,neutral,a sporadic slow burn mess that has lots of empty moments and feels rushed
Feb 18 2024,negative,sony needs to stop  this movie was absolutely unbearable to watch
Feb 18 2024,positive,was it the worst sony marvel movie absolutley not was it the best absolutley not i went in with medium expectations with my 13yo daughter and her best friend it wasnt a bad time we had a few giggles and a few sad moments my daughter and her friend loved it they love these types of movie because it shows them girl power     the movie itself started off slow and i was quite confused at first but everything came together in time and it turned out to be a ghreat origin story if you are going in looking at the comics as your point of reference then you will be disappointed but if you go in with knowlege of the comics and then expecting a hollywoood twist the you should enjoy it     the charachter development was pretty good with one excfeption the villian he was underdeveloped and i feel like they never gave a him a real goal to what he was doing dakota was hot and is a great actress but i feel like they could have given her a bigger range of emoptions to her character syndey sweeny celeste o conner and isabela merced were good but underutilized     the story was good and the pace was ok but as i said earlier the movie started off slow and didnt keep my attention until the train scene but from there it was a good pace    bonus the soundtrack was an a
Feb 18 2024,negative,worse superhero movie of all time  i have nothing to add  just no
Feb 18 2024,negative,started with a decent premise but quickly fell apart the movie just seemed to drag on and on and on with nothing actually happening
Feb 18 2024,negative,lazy writing silly dialog unsatisfying ending just the worst
Feb 18 2024,negative,dies of cringe    sony what were you thinking shoving this nonsense madame web could be a 10 times better story than this money grab
Feb 18 2024,negative,this will be featured on redlettermedias best of the worst its so bad that its good dakota johnson is a prime example of why the word nepotism exists
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie was completely horrible and a total waste of time should have listened to the terrible reviews and the fact it is a box office bomb that no one went to see
Feb 18 2024,negative,genuinely one of the worst films ive seen
Feb 18 2024,negative,i wish they give option of 01 star rating cause this picture deserve this
Feb 18 2024,negative,there is no rating available for a movie like this i knew it was going to be bad i just never imagined how bad it was going to get marvel studios allowed this to happen and they keep wondering why the movies and shows keep failing one right after the other they are out of touch and completely lost what it meant to be a fan
Feb 18 2024,negative,morbius ironically is better than this movie this spiderman movies without spiderman are failing i hope kraven the hunter is sonys last spider villain movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,i think it was amazing i loved the characters and the story i really liked cassies powers this movie has gotten unnecessary hate it was really enjoyable and im hoping there will be a 2nd movie 
Feb 18 2024,negative,no sense boring bad performances
Feb 18 2024,negative,maybe the worst movie i have ever seen had i not been with my daughter who wanted to see the movie i would have walked out 10 minutes in  cliche premise bad acting especially the bad buy stupid plot line and poor cgi  what is laughable is the whole movie is a setup for sequels next time i will pay more attention to rotten eggs rating
Feb 18 2024,negative,waste of your time and money

Feb 18 2024,positive,enjoyed it very much fun comic book movie dont understand the hate for it brought the kids and they all loved it toowould give it 7 over 10
Feb 18 2024,positive,overall better than i expected  definitely some cringe worthy scenes  but has its moments of suspense and action  a lot of exposition to explain the origin story but good time twists to keep you guessing
Feb 18 2024,positive,its an ok movie not the greatest and could have been so much better however having said that the critics score is ludicrously low still worth a watch and many would actually enjoy
Feb 18 2024,negative,im not sure what sony was thinking when they made this movie this movie made me think that morbius wasnt so bad after all
Feb 18 2024,positive,enjoyable and fun not too serious the girls were great the villain not so much weird adr and editing loved dakota johnson great comedic timing and chemistry with the tree girls i recommend
Feb 18 2024,negative,one of the worst superhero movies ive seen and ive seen a lot of it plus the bar was extremely low

Feb 18 2024,positive,overall a good view if you love marvel more specifically the spiderman franchise a few questions were left unanswered like what happened w that missing persons report for the 3 girls since it doesnt show a resolution to thatonly they and the protagonist reconnecting bit excessive w the jumpscare noises during flashforward scenes one or two would have sufficed
Feb 18 2024,negative,its clear theyre setting up for a second part of the story but this was one of the worst endings ive ever seen and it hurts my heart cause i had such high hopes ill likely watch part 2the sequel just so i can finally see the trio of girls actually getuse their powers
Feb 18 2024,positive,its cheesy yes its predictable in places yes but its very watchable the graphics are great and the soundtrack is brilliant its set in 2003 when i was 17 so the music literally struck a chord with me the only major complaint i have is the dubbing of the baddies voice you could literally see his mouth moving at a different pace very annoying   i loved the cheese the storyline and the characters and would recommend my husband enjoyed it too
Feb 18 2024,negative,i cant understand how these people get a chance to make a movie
Feb 18 2024,negative,i think the budget went to marketing because this had the worst cgi ive ever seen in any movie oh and the spider people do not fight once villain straight out of spy kids the movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,typical story about individual with special abilities despite no having super strength speed she still able to defeat the nemesis just enough back story to tell her abilities overall good movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,is the dialogue sometimes stilted yes is the tahar rahims villainy absolutely laughable oh absolutely and is this the best liveaction superhero film ive seen in the past five years without a doubt     dont go in expecting a critical masterpiece but appreciate what you get humour wit tongueincheek references feelgood moments drama tension highoctane action sequences character development emotional depth the first marveladjacent property in living memory to not end in a huge cgi fight    its not perfect  at some points its painfully awkward  but its something that feels new its an origin story its about human beings as well as heroes and i left the theatre smiling went in expecting something so bad it was good ended up with something that was just good
Feb 18 2024,negative,the worst movie i have seen in a long time many parts of the movie make no sense loaded with predictable clichees and horrible written characters you disliked morbius it appears to be a master piece compared to this movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,i had read some bad reviews in regard to this movie so i was a bit nervous to go watch it but to be honest it wasnt bad i enjoyed watching it
Feb 18 2024,negative,please dont waste your money like i did   garbage 
Feb 18 2024,positive,i dont understand the hate for this movie it was good and entertaining it does not connect to the mcu but it hasnt seemed like any sonymarvel movie has 
Feb 18 2024,negative,if youre the type of person who doesnt care about good acting dialogue or cinematography you will enjoy this movie it is fun to watch i just dont understand why sony is trying so hard to kill the scu
Feb 18 2024,negative,it doesnt make sense its complete rubbish
Feb 18 2024,negative,oh my god im so glad i didnt have a spoon on me else id have melon balled my eyes out i had hopes for this movie but man it ended up being one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Feb 18 2024,negative,i had higher expectations but found it very corny at times
Feb 18 2024,neutral,not as bad as all the critics say     it does feel a bit like its just one long set up for another spiderverse movie but this time all the characters come from the same universe    it also has some unremarkable dialog choices not to mention that cassie webb appears to go through several personality changes throughout the whole film from sassy paramedic to reluctant mom to all seeing cosmic deity    i still enjoyed some bits from the film most notable how cassie reconnects and redefines her relationship with her mother i did not see that coming i enjoyed it even though it felt slightly out of place    i think this movie would have been better if it removed any references to peter parker and his family and replaced those scenes with much longer catmouse sequences between the viallian and webbs crew of future superheros    its not a good film but i just quite say its awful just kinda bad
Feb 18 2024,positive,great marvell movie for once the story makes sense and i never got lost  wife and kids loved it
Feb 18 2024,negative,terrible  bad acting terrible cast tons of plot holes but at least my kids enjoyed
Feb 18 2024,negative,my teenage kids and i all felt this movie was terrible the actors fell flat and werent engaging at all the oneliners felt cheesy i hope they wont waste money making a sequel out of this stinker
Feb 18 2024,negative,terrible film moronic boring bad acting horrific story finally horrendous directing
Feb 18 2024,neutral,the script has potential but the villain was horrible they never stated why hes evil other than making him that way honestly his acting ruined many major scenes because he sounds uninterested and almost dubbed
Feb 18 2024,positive,entirely entertaining action movie good subsidiary characters not too heavy on intrusive cgi well worth a couple of hours of big screen action no need to know the whole marvel canon to enjoy this oneoff standalone story go have some fun
Feb 18 2024,negative,this was the worst movie ive ever seen i cant believe this got made
Feb 18 2024,negative,absolutely terrible god awful sony continues to take good idea and concepts and just run them into the ground how hard is it to go off the comics its literally a step by step play on how to make a marvel movie good they inserted alot of womens empowerment all throughout the film that was unnecessary save your money and time and watch  a different movie
Feb 18 2024,negative,i dnt know how to give this 0 starsit was that badwhat a waste of money
Feb 18 2024,negative,i am genuinely concerned for those that said this is an amazing movie and the acting was good for those not being ironic or facetious  i sincerely recommend psychiatric medication please join the rest of us in reality by acknowledging the utter travesty that is this film
Feb 18 2024,positive,the movie was so much fun to watch dont let critic reviews keep you from watching it
Feb 18 2024,negative,thank you sony and the unknown director for ruining another great spiderman movie character when will you be smart enough to sell the rights to marveldisney because thats the only way your spiderman movies gonna billions with great reviews and audience scores
Feb 18 2024,positive,fun and warm hearted film editing was strange at times but it was entertaining and it was nice to see more spider people
Feb 18 2024,positive,movie was great loved the characters and acting
Feb 18 2024,negative,horrible slow bad dialog bad acting 
Feb 18 2024,positive,best movie ever the story line was amazing hoping for a sequel
Feb 18 2024,positive,this movie was much better then i expected i am happy i saw it in the theater and hope to see the characters in future films
Feb 18 2024,positive,loved it very enjoyable i dont know why people are hating on it i just wished there were more action
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie had the worst acting i have seen in years also this movie was just plain irritating from beginning to end i cant believe they okayed this movie for release
Feb 18 2024,negative,dakota johnson is attractive and well read as an actress but this is her worst work without sidney and isabela this would be zero stars
Feb 18 2024,neutral,i see a lot of people absolutely dunking on this movie but its not worse than morbius like ive heard people claim of course morbius sets the bar extremely low i found it to be just another generic superhero movie that hits all the same cliches but without any of the charm really     sony needs to figure out what theyre doing with this whole sonyverse theyve been haphazardly cobbling together its obvious they want the success of the mcu but this is our fourth outing into this sonyverse and we still have no idea who this earths spiderman is yknow the character all these side characters were made on the back of what wouldve easily made this a solid 45 stars for me would have been some kind of cameo or confirmation of an existing spiderman but were left with nothing as if sony is too afraid to embrace the most central character to the spiderman ip spiderman himself    with how mid this movie was ill likely not go see kraven the hunter and venom 3s trailers will seriously need to woo me to get me to see it in a theater
Feb 18 2024,positive,i loved this movie and i hope for a sequel
Feb 18 2024,positive,masterpiece is kinda over the top but its very enjoyable and you will be happy
Feb 18 2024,neutral,there were some parts i could see what they were aiming for but the dialogue tonal shifts exposition and direction was all over the place typical sony mess
Feb 18 2024,positive,my friends and i enjoyed it it was a little slow in the beginning but we liked the movie and it was different from other films it was cool there will definitely be a sequel so we cant wait for that
Feb 18 2024,positive,the story could be better the action was good 
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie was utterly disappointing and thats to say the least i understand making an origin story movie is hard but they seriously failed with this one at no point in the first hour and a half of the movie did anything happen there was only 510 minutes of action in the entire movie and thats being generous counting the future vision as action the trailers for this movie are highly deceiving making it look like its going to be a movie about her and the girls its almost two hours of straight talking and bad pepsi commercials we definitely wouldnt have spent 80 to come see it if we had known this is how bad it was going to be
Feb 18 2024,negative,a film that literally no marvel or spiderman fan asked for yet here it is and getting dumped on like everyone expected where in the multiverse do these characters emerge from because hopefully that multiverse never gets visited in the marvel timeline again
Feb 18 2024,positive,give this movie a break for what it is it is rather entertaining some over acting some underacting but enjoyable interesting spider lore of an alternate reality i have read and collected comic books for 50 years and know webbs story well we cannot expect these movies to be exact copies of the books wheres the fun in that get some popcorn check your expectations at the door and just enjoy the night out at the movies
Feb 18 2024,positive,dont know what everyones complaining or bad reviews are about its a good movie i would see the sequel all the stars acting movie plot and scenes were good
Feb 18 2024,negative,not enough chicks and not lame enough    this movie was rough boring uninspired not even dakota johnson could salvage this     brutal
Feb 18 2024,positive,just finished watching this movie in the theater i enjoyed it it is different from the comic book origin story but is still pretty good i hope that more movies with the characters are made in the future but considering how much this movie is getting torched by critics im not optimistic about that
Feb 18 2024,negative,if i could rate it 0 stars i would and id still think that was too many stars for this film
Feb 18 2024,positive,underrated doesnt deserve this much hate and quite enjoyable however vocal mixing is off
Feb 18 2024,positive,people are being haters and take themselves too seriously i personally had a good time and thought it was funny its supposed to be camp not a masterpiece i would recommend
Feb 18 2024,negative,the worst spiderman movie ever i liked venom and venom let there be carnage and morbid was just ok anyway yeah its garbage the writhing is terrible it goes in for way to goddam long and dont even get me started with that rip off spider man character
Feb 18 2024,positive,lots of amazing character development and im really really hoping they make another movie
Feb 18 2024,negative,the worst spiderman movie we have ever gotten how come last year we got the masterpiece called spiderman across the spider verse now we have a stupid cash grab that brings you all in with the spider man aspect and ruins it once i got out of that theater i said in my head  finally  because of how bad it was would not recommend 010 if i could give zero stars i would
Feb 18 2024,positive,loved it and cant wait to see more
Feb 18 2024,neutral,not as horrible as one might expect but thoroughly meh felt like a soupedup tv pilot uninspired acting and questionable plot points id watch it again before i would watch eternals again though
Feb 18 2024,positive,i have no idea why its getting trashed so badly yes the dubbing on ezekiels voice is terrible otherwise its a typical midtier superhero movie i dont get the seething hate
Feb 18 2024,positive,it felt like a superhero movie preiron man more like the early spiderman movies   not nearly as bad as what i expected based on reviews i have heard the bad guy dialogue was genericbut its a superhero movie honestly with the right director a sequel could be awesome
Feb 18 2024,positive,entertaining good movie i like the easter egg
Feb 18 2024,positive,great marvel movie action and a wonderful storyline
Feb 18 2024,positive,it wasnt as bad as everyone made it seem to be i went in with 0 expectations of it being a good movie it not the best but its not bad i wish though that the dialogue wasnt as long as it seemed to be as well as the unending plot holes that made the movie not make sense sometimes but it had some good scenes not a lot of fight scenes but what was shown was good especially during the end  finally it did make us kind of laugh in some scenes i wish the mcu actually did it thought might be a tiny bit better but it honestly isnt as bad as how the people made it seem
Feb 18 2024,negative,not really what i expected
Feb 18 2024,positive,contrary to the general belief i really really enjoyed this movie a great origin story that introduced multiple characters yet set them up perfectly     only thing about the movie that i wasnt convinced by was the acting of the villan but in reality he takes the back seat when it comes to the developing relationship and understanding between the protagonists so it didnt really affect my score for this movie i am also not against an all female superheroe movie but all of the ones i have seen before feel forced this movie did not feel forced at all and the characters really worked well with eachother     i have seen a lot of reviews saying that the lack of action and fights scenes is the reason the movie is boring i personally feel like the amount of action was perfect for the type of movie we were presented there is a lot more to a superhero movie than action scenes and explosions     i honestly dont understand all of the hatred towards the film apart from going off of what their favorite social media influencer has to say about the movie i would recommend to go out watch the movie and formulate your own opinion
Feb 18 2024,negative,it was a very boring movie unless your goal is to fall asleep the characters were bland and mundane story  i like dakota johnson in other movies but she is miscast as a leading marvel superhero she just did could not pull it off
Feb 18 2024,positive,i definitely would say it was better than i expected it did feel rushed and it wasnt a lot of action or big budget fights some how for me that wasnt that big of a deal for what it was trying to do it did ok it felt like they werent sure if they had the rights to name drop spiderman in any way which was weird its like the crew wasnt sure what they could and couldnt connect and that was felt every time they made a nudge towards spidermans future i would of loved diving into webbs powers more in the movie they do enough to be acceptable but i would loved to see her gain even more polish during the film i also would have loved if the three co stars had more actual time on screen doing more than being damsels in distress this is a good launcher movie for other movies to come and we will see these girls again which is cool but i need them to be established and fully fleshed out in the next entry i liked the movies use of camera angles and how they conveyed what she was seeing and confused she was telling the future in the beginning this movie felt rushed but it wasnt a disaster by no means and it wasnt horrible like the media made it out to be as far as sonys other titles it falls in line with venom amazing spiderman 12 and morbius
Feb 18 2024,positive,incredible cast phenomenal acting and female empowerment what a fantastic trifecta the story line is perfect and it makes an amazing connection to the marvel universe i cant wait to see more marvel movies with these characters marvel definitely needs more badass female representation like this highly recommend
Feb 18 2024,positive,an entertaining and enjoyable super hero origin movie  i cant lie it was nice to see a marvel movie sans most of the disney social messages  strong but believable characters teenagers acting like teenagers and female characters using their intelligence and bonding together
Feb 18 2024,positive,personally really enjoyed the movie all the way through
Feb 18 2024,negative,absolute and utter garbage just when you thought the movie couldnt suck any worse it somehow manages to sink even deeper
Feb 18 2024,positive,read reviews saying how bad this movie was however i found it to be pretty decent i brought my mom and tried theater ears app and that was a must so loved that i could watch it in english while my mom heard it in spanish
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was a really good movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,loved it writing could have been better but dakota johnson did great for what she was given to work with
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was good and entertaining its the first movie probably if they do a second one would be much better go see it 
Feb 18 2024,positive,the kids liked it but it wasnt that good to me
Feb 18 2024,negative,i have one word terrible
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was decent not the greatest but not as bad as social media making it out to be wish the girls were actually in their suits more maybe we will get a 2nd movie where they do
Feb 18 2024,positive,im gonna have to say that movie was phenomenal kinda and i loved the visuals and dakotas performance was one hundred percent awesome
Feb 18 2024,negative,this isnt even a superhuman movie why do they keep making these movies so bad
Feb 18 2024,positive,went in not really knowing what to expect from a sony verse marvel movie but can say i was pleasantly surprised by it definitely a must watch
Feb 18 2024,negative,i dont review many usually just the really good ones and the really bad ones this one was soooooo bad 
Feb 18 2024,positive,entertaining would have enjoyed more it more if they worked in more actions from the girls future selves but overall i found it to be a decent movie i think people find anything to nitpick when it comes to female led hero movies got my support tho
Feb 18 2024,positive,we liked it it starts a little slow but then shifts just before half way nice cinematics decent story kinda dark acting was good lots of big actresses and actors overall we give it a 4 out of 5 stars well done sonymarvel
Feb 18 2024,negative,very boring slow and tepid storyline no character context or build dialogue was bleak not even worth the money to nap in comfy chairs
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was enjoyable could be better i would like to know how sony will fix the script in spiderman in the spider verse they said that only one spider man can live in each universe bow we see 3 spiderwoman here obviously their own name in general i would love to see the result of  mixing all universes with madame webb
Feb 18 2024,negative,i wish i could give negative stars it was that bad
Feb 18 2024,negative,i was looking forward to this movie unfortunately i found it uninspiring uninteresting and underdeveloped the plot holes were numerous and easily avoidable which begs the question if anyone even read the script  quite disappointed
Feb 18 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i dont get why its getting so much hate id love to see more of this storyline in the future
Feb 18 2024,positive,loved the movie dakota johnson great as always
Feb 18 2024,negative,fifty shades of madam web was fifty shades of disaster  it feels like it was written and produced by an ai a pentium 2 ai
Feb 18 2024,positive,movie is much better than what i had been reading online it has a solid story funny in parts and the action is decent fanboys are upset because there arent 40 characters running around in tights
Feb 18 2024,positive,i have been hyped about this movie for  months and then i read such horrible reviews about it that i almost didnt want to see it let me tell you im so glad i did i loved this movie it kept me intrigued the comedybanter we expect with dakota was there and there were some nice connections to the spider verse it was the perfect saturday night movie
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie sucked thank god there was no postcredit scene
Feb 18 2024,negative,when the trailers posters or tv spots came out it looked promising good and entertaining    but getting to see it  you could be the worst disappointment of your life    bad editing bad script bad acting bad cgi horribly characterized costumes and the only thing that stands out is the cast    i would give this movie a 0 but since what rotten tomatoes allows is 05    unfortunately i will have to give it half a point or 05  unfortunate marvel and sony
Feb 18 2024,negative,horrible movie   sony just cant release anything good but animated spider verse movies which is sad movie not worth the time doesnt feel like a spider universe movie or even a super hero movie dont waste the money or time only people that are none marvel fans give this movie a good review as they are npc movie watchers everyone has an opinion but giving a good review on something that is terrible is just not right this movie is the type of movie you tell your kids to watch on a movie night and puts them to bed time
Feb 18 2024,positive,i really liked it felt it was messy in some parts but dont really get the hate dakota did a good job in the portrayal of madameweb adding to on of the best universes in marvel the spideyuniverse
Feb 18 2024,positive,she is a great actress
Feb 18 2024,positive,madame web is receiving a lot of hate from critics and audience members alike i dont quite understand why was it perfect absolutely not the script needed some clear revisions and overall the movie needed a bit of an edit however it is like people have forgotten that this was an origin story which typically have some performance issues i felt like the story in this was explained well the action was good and the story moved along well it seems like the super nerd critics tend to hate on all the female driven marvel films which is unfortunate  i personally am looking forward to the future of these characters now that they are fleshed out and i am looking forward to seeing this all come together with the mcu and other sony properties hoping sony does get it together though as it seems like they have made some poor choices recently  overall i give it a 35 just because i think the script could have improved but the overall plot was good it was still a fun and entertaining movie and i think it will inspire more young girls to get into comic book movies in the future
Feb 18 2024,positive,great female empiwerment  disliked all the pepsi and other commercial plugs  way too many
Feb 18 2024,negative,i saw this movie for free and i still feel ripped off 90 of the time the villains words didnt even match his mouth writing was abysmal dakota johnsons acting was so clearly phoned in it kept taking me out of the movie madame webs costume at the end was so horrible i promise with everything i love i couldve made a better one with even macaroni art i had more enjoyment playing with the dune worm bucket in the lobby than i did watching this movie  i have never reviewed a movie on here but after this i felt compelled to do so  half star do better sony
Feb 18 2024,positive,great movie and best theater in savannah ga
Feb 18 2024,positive,i thought was a great prequel to all the spider man movies and has great potential moving forward for sequels and the future of spiderman world i would definitely watch it multiple times
Feb 18 2024,negative,they could have set up sooo many movies with this one show introducing miles or peter as the end resultso disappointing
Feb 18 2024,positive,i enjoyed a look into how madame webs were weaved into her early days a must for any marvel fans out there
Feb 18 2024,positive,this was good   the critics are wrong
Feb 18 2024,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed madame web and i would even go as far as to say it is one of my favorite marvel movies it really does have everything action camp emotion i would absolutely watch this movie again and i will be heartbroken if there is not a sequel in summary i loved madame web
Feb 18 2024,negative,it was pretty bad i couldnt get over the bad dubbing for ceiling guy the insane im flying to peru last minute on the concorde apparently for how fast it was and on a paramedics salary no less and so much more im glad i didnt pay to see it do yourself a favor and wait until its free
Feb 18 2024,positive,they survived off pure luck and coincidence
Feb 18 2024,positive,watched madame web today and this movie was so much fun i enjoyed it
Feb 18 2024,positive,i never go by what the critics say about a movie i really enjoyed the movie i was thoroughly entertained i hope they continue on this was a good actionpacked movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie dakota has the best comedic timing i went in expecting to dislike the three teen characters and i ended up loving the whole cast as a unit  i know many are upset that the lore has been altered but honestly i felt like this fresh idea took me personally on a great journey and invigorated the story for me i hope dakota comes back for the sequels and doesnt get chased off by the community   i understand how important marvel lore is to everyone but they were clear this story happens before tobys spiderman  for a movie set in 2003 i really enjoyed the call backs to how technology was then seeing the blockbusters the lined phones and the paper billboards  i enjoyed the characters dynamics in the movie and how dakotas character made it clear she wasnt going to be the hero  she was just trying to do what she thought was the right thing  the growth cassie goes through and the healing she comes to terms with with her mother  i am so excited to see where they take this and i hope to see dakota again as madame web
Feb 18 2024,positive,this is another lead who has had a traumatic past and is withdrawn from humanity  i am tired of grumpy heroes  at first madam web is in trouble for kidnapping the girls  then nothing came of it one girl has wealthy absentee parents but her housekeeper never checks on her  however the biggest problem for me is that she kept driving back and forth in stolen vehicles which had also been involved in accidents but she was never stopped by the police
Feb 18 2024,positive,the movie was well made the story plot builds up to a sequel the special effects was good no boredom at all dont listen to the movie critics
Feb 18 2024,negative,was more origin story then a marvel movie wed all come to know and love there were many boring lines used that were to scripted and didnt feel natural in the context of the conversations  wait for it on disney  in a month rather than seeing it in the theater
Feb 18 2024,negative,a film with many flaws fast and confusing scenes that try to find meaning with the passage of time without being able to achieve it  with many flashforwads that do not support the plot and on the contrary show inconsistencies to the film
Feb 18 2024,positive,kept you going the whole movie you get the back story the beginning to the super hero as the story goes to get you geared up for more 
Feb 18 2024,neutral,dakota johnson didnt fit the part  hokey how she found the exact place her mom was in the amazon
Feb 18 2024,positive,overall decent the action scenes were fine for the most part and the concept of introducing madame webs character into the ssu will hopefully yield good results
Feb 18 2024,positive,the movie is a pretty decent film considering i was really expecting a flop comic fans may nitpick this movie to death comparing the ends in and outs about how the story or effect or powers should be different i do like comics but i will give a superhero movie a chance i read the stories for the comics i dont need to watch it too however for those of us who just go to the movies to enjoy them you may be pleasantly surprised though i will say the villain is notim not sure what to say about himhe is flat
Feb 18 2024,positive,it wasnt bad its not on par with disney quality mcu movies but if you go into it can be enjoyable
Feb 18 2024,negative,awkward from beginning to end
Feb 18 2024,positive,i think it suffered from the sagaftra strike and i assume in the following months and through 2024 well continue to feel the repercussions   but overall a good origin movie  as long as sony doesnt scrap it im excited to see what the sequels will do for the story of madame web
Feb 18 2024,positive,its not the best comic book movie but its enjoyable
Feb 18 2024,negative,film is hot garbage  marvelsony please stop take a break mothball all superhero movies for a few years  plan out another group of films hire some great writers and give them timeits getting worse and worse  you have great ips stop destroying them
Feb 18 2024,positive,really liked the storyline and female characters  villain needed more backstory  overall liked it
Feb 18 2024,negative,it was alright definitely not a super hero movie
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie was terrible and uneventful and the actors did a terrible job and the writing was dreadful marvel should be embarrassed now i think of marvel as a horrendous legacy another horrible thing about this movie was that the conversations were so bland and again the acting as which they were about to get murdered was not so real the story line was not soo bad but the acters camera angles and everything else about this movie was horrible i do demand a refund do not watch this movie i could have been spending time with my family instead i wasted 29 for this horrendous film this guy sitting next to me fell asleep in the first 5 minutes i had to wake him up when it was overdo not recommend
Feb 18 2024,negative,the movie had no correspondence  it was a mix of look at this and what is this for such good actresses they portrayed their parts with no passion for the role unfortunately i cannot recommend this movie
Feb 18 2024,negative,i hated this movie the acting was bad the editing was bad the characters were poorly written to annoying for my tastes if you were to ask me i would not recommend you watch this movie at all
Feb 18 2024,positive,it wasnt great but a nice enough movie  a lot of unanswered questions  didnt really like the ending and didnt fully explain either
Feb 18 2024,negative,i dont know what im doing i completely fell asleep while watching the movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,not nearly as bad as i was led to believe that being said there was some very clunky setup i suppose it could be because she foresaw the need and the villain was very poorly acted
Feb 18 2024,positive,going in after seeing the reviews i thought it would be awful to my surprise i found madame web to be an amazing movie the way it is directed is so beautiful and the plot really feels you in throughout the movie 1010
Feb 18 2024,negative,this is a 2hour teaser for a sequel that will never be made if they had completed the origin story and the girls had obtained their powers and saved the day by the end of the movie then this would have been an average superhero movie as is it drags out the story much too long and is marginally tolerable
Feb 18 2024,positive,i found this film to be pretty good very entertaining its flawed but definitely not fatally so id recommend it
Feb 18 2024,positive,it has a great story behind which has to be pushed beyond one movie it builds well the only thing which seemed uncompleted are special effects they seem very unnatural
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was a fun time the cinematography around old new york was fun and the costume designer did a great job with the the clothes setting up this trio feels like they have great chemistry i do however wish they handled the peruvian origin story a bit better but i feel fully optimistic a universe could do well around these 3
Feb 18 2024,positive,webtastic this film strings all the webs
Feb 18 2024,positive,amazing kept me on my feet dont listen to the reviews
Feb 18 2024,negative,absolutely abismal flop that makes a 2 hour runtime feel like 4 hours went to see it on valentines day hoping for something lighthearted but wasnt expecting anything great due to disneys current track record this movie was so bad it caused me and my girlfriend to have an argument 110 do not reccomend
Feb 18 2024,positive,great origin film   smart funny heartwarming  corny ass villain   bad voice effects sometimes   overall its needlessly hated on  people need to get a life and stop jumping on every hate train they see
Feb 18 2024,positive,great moviegreat origin story for madame web and gets the backstory of the other characters set up for any future movies that may come along
Feb 17 2024,positive,its ok not bad but still had some issue
Feb 17 2024,negative,today i owe morbius an apology a very lackluster and dull experience the trailer is very misleading buyer beware
Feb 17 2024,negative,it was a confusing and awkward mess from the start and it didnt get better the acting is tired at the best of times and the main villain feels so unenthusiastic about what hes doing and what hes doing makes no sense theres no attention to detail and seemingly no real consequences for the actions the dakotas character takes apparently you can just steal a cab in new york and keep it for weeks without anyone ever noticing its insulting how bad this was
Feb 17 2024,negative,worst marvel movie ever i have seen better film on teeth atrocious dialogue  the 4 main characters are potential heroes who run from every situation the script was probably generated by ai because the storyline is weak and the dialogue is weaker
Feb 17 2024,positive,not as bad as they say
Feb 17 2024,positive,its pretty good its entertaining its a movie doesnt deserve the harsh reviews people need to calm down and just enjoy 
Feb 17 2024,negative,put a chick in it make her lame check  black girl hispanic girl dei villain  check    good story good acting compelling characters  not needed    this is a remarkably bad movie i would have assumed that studios would learn but of course to learn one must have brain horrible movie do not waste your time or money
Feb 17 2024,negative,fraudulent movie trailer scenes not in the movie 
Feb 17 2024,negative,horrible  this movie proves sony doesnt care about the character and the fandom all they care about is being greedy to keep the  spiderman movie rights this movie is a scam
Feb 17 2024,positive,the amount of hate this film is receiving interested me so i had to watch it i know nothing of madame web and it was an origin story style film her powers are definitely different from other characters making flashy fight scenes non existent after watching many of these super hero films i understand others complaints people who want the grand scale high pace adrenaline enduced superhero experience wont be getting that with madame web you get an origin story where she barely knows how to use her powers i didnt think it was that bad middle of the road for me
Feb 17 2024,positive,not the greatest movie of all time by any stretch of the imagination but it was entertaining could have been some more action and sims character was nothing more than a brooding generic evil guy but passable for a lazy afternoon watch
Feb 17 2024,neutral,despite the onedimensional villain and underdeveloped supporting characters madame web is still a good average superhero film thats enjoyable thanks to dakota johnsons performance
Feb 17 2024,positive,in the minority but i enjoyed the movie it felt fresh from the more recent super hero movies a good origin story movie in my opinion
Feb 17 2024,positive,it was a nice movie i dont know why its getting so much hate but im not a movie critic you should go see it if you like marvel movies
Feb 17 2024,positive,it was good loved the theater
Feb 17 2024,positive,i was expecting much worse with the reviews i read it easily passed the time not a favorite  but not nearly as terrible as people are saying it held my interest
Feb 17 2024,negative,waste of money and time i really had high expectation smh
Feb 17 2024,positive,captivating movie that showcased female superheros finally without the clevage dakota johnson did an outstanding job and portrayed a character that was very relatable this movie was a fresh take with the superhero getting their powers later in like instead of as a teenager although an action movie the focus was on the mind instead of brute on brute fighting 5 stars
Feb 17 2024,positive,thought the movie was amazing the suits were as comic accurate as could be thought the plot was ok and at some points it was a little slow pace other than that amazing movie need a part 2 immediately
Feb 17 2024,positive,45 not a must see but awesome
Feb 17 2024,positive,finally a reason to go to the movies dakota was superb in the role and i cant wait to see the others in action with the sequel
Feb 17 2024,positive,was a pretty good movie dont let the low rating deter you full of action not superheroes thats why the fanboys are trying to kill it if it was a non spider world movie it would be getting much better reviews
Feb 17 2024,neutral,wasnt awful not enough character build up very little information about ezekiel  would go see a sequel
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie was good its not the worst movie as people have been saying it needed more action but overall it was a good movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,probably one of the worst marvel movies  ive ever seen dialogue and action were terrible
Feb 17 2024,neutral,they dont explain anything if you  dont read a lot of comics of spiderman you will be lost t
Feb 17 2024,positive,it wasnt a bad movie the plot was cool the foreshadowing of ben and peter parker was fun the dialog hit some weird points but from what in all honesty little that i know of madam web she doesnt act or talk normal which makes sense for someone that is watching the craziest case of deja vu ever on top of multiple universes all the time
Feb 17 2024,positive,we loved it and would see it again very entertaining hoping to see more about these characters happy we did not trust all the negative reviews from rotten tomatoes and imdb
Feb 17 2024,negative,the worst marvel movie ever
Feb 17 2024,positive,overall the movie was good but i was expecting a bit more action
Feb 17 2024,negative,i thought my mom never cared about me
Feb 17 2024,negative,i now have to rewatch catwoman in order to determine which hero movie is truly the worst  at least this elevates antman and the wasp quantumania   so glad that i didnt waste money taking my kids to see this   i think ill have to start listening to my 12 year old daughters impression of movie trailers as she definitely called this one
Feb 17 2024,positive,first off i liked it the color and the photography in general was sharp and natural each shot was well lit and the color pallet was full spectrum it took a bit to get used to the flash forward deviseand it worked really well the acting although criticized elsewhere in these reviews seemed really natural and uncontrivedall of the leads except the villain who was overthetop vicious all of the time the special effects were introspective type not big and flashy and the emotional development the the girls seemed genuine not overly violent for this type of film nor any fbombs news flash there is an uncle ben in this universe eventually and all the adults in the film are competent working and relatively smart so were the adolscent girls although it took them some time to drop the attitude and make that journey as mentioned above score fit the action not overly bombastic although fullyorchestrated nice credits theme song at the end i guess i must have taught junior high too long in my career but i enjoyed my time with these young ladies
Feb 17 2024,positive,was expecting more but was mildly entertained it was okay
Feb 17 2024,negative,poorly written cliched themes daddy issues subpar performances
Feb 17 2024,positive,it will keep you on your feet action movie  very captivating
Feb 17 2024,positive,please dont listen to all of these bad reviews this movie was not as bad as these critics say it is although not great it still was a overall not bad movie dakota is a little dry and reminds me of bella in twilight a little bit but it was not a bad movie overallid say go watch and judge for yourself
Feb 17 2024,positive,great movie my daughter and i loved it critics are idiots
Feb 17 2024,positive,i need a notification regarding the bluray release date
Feb 17 2024,positive,much better than the reviews made it out to be my wife and i both loved it and cant wait to see more from the girls
Feb 17 2024,positive,madame web is a large and convoluted character in the comics she has so much potential that it would be nearly impossible to make a perfect movie about her that said the big let down in this movie isnt the ladies its the guys zack scott and tahar rahim gave lukewarm performances at best celeste oconnor was a badass that i couldnt look away from enjoy the movie and the talented beauties that populate it
Feb 17 2024,positive,i dont know what everyone is talking about this movie was awesome not the best but it was great
Feb 17 2024,positive,much better than anticipated left me wanting more and cant wait for sequels
Feb 17 2024,negative,some people that worked on that film should never work again
Feb 17 2024,negative,hands down one of the worse movies that ive seen terrible dialogue the best part of the movie was when it was over it sucks that this is attached to mavel
Feb 17 2024,positive,its actually a pretty good introduction movie to some supporting roles for mcu if you compare it with mcu ofcourse its nothing but as stand alone maybe pretty convincing
Feb 17 2024,positive,i really enjoyed it love all the characters looking forward to seeing them again hopefully live action spiderverse just got enjoyably fleshed out a little more
Feb 17 2024,positive,wasnt sure what to expect but i definitely enjoyed it

Feb 17 2024,negative,i think i cringed at every single piece of dialogue from this movie worst acting ever ive ever seen
Feb 17 2024,positive,i loved it most of the bad reviews clearly were not paying attention
Feb 17 2024,negative,makes morbius look like a masterpiece at least morbius had memeable content
Feb 17 2024,negative,not any real redeeming qualities to this movie the only reason i dont give it a half star is that it was fun to laugh at how awful it was
Feb 17 2024,positive,i thought it was a fun time
Feb 17 2024,positive,i really likes this movie i have not spent a lot of time on the marvel movies but this being a female lead i thought i would try one i look forward to future madam web movies as well
Feb 17 2024,negative,decided to go in with the impression of the first trailer  five minutes into the film i thought the character was speaking to me when i heard  youre making the wrong decision
Feb 17 2024,negative,so this is what happens when you hire writers that have never read a comic and then let them have access to hard drugs bleedin awful and i have seen awful and this is it
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie had so much potential to be a good movie but i feel like it was executed so poorly nothing made sense the scenes that shouldve been exciting werent portrayed that way and the ending was such a let down again the idea behind could have been so good but the execution did not do it justice
Feb 17 2024,positive,it was a cheeky little side trip into rhe spider multiverse  honestly it was more enjoyable to watch than other recent super hero releasesthe latest marvel or further back the elementals  i would watch a sequel in this series
Feb 17 2024,negative,if you thought morbius you may think this movie is just ok as bad as morbius was this movie manages to be even worse and i did not think that was possible i am talking battlefield earth level bad
Feb 17 2024,negative,i have not left a movie review in a long time i typically avoid critics and any news or buzz i always watch cb movies i even liked a few that everyone hated soooooooo i decided to go last night and hit up the theater to this soooo do movie execs even do any research   do they even pick up a comic book do they watch any material where the characters were used i am the point where i am no longer watching a sony  marvel movie im done this movie is terrible poor dakato was she at gun point forced to make this movie or were all of them 
Feb 17 2024,negative,has to be in the top 5 worst movies ever made poor script poor acting terrible plot bas special effects dakota although a pretty face can not act
Feb 17 2024,positive,far from a perfect movie but also far from the dud that everyone says it isthe villain in this movie is poorly cast and his dialogue is weird bc you never see him talking but the overall movie and origin of a marvel character i know nothing about was interesting but the acting and directing felt lacking
Feb 17 2024,positive,everything i heard about this movie leading to its release led me to expect it was going to be terrible i just do not understand there has to be some kind of conspiracy to cover up the fact that this is actually a pretty great movie it was so much better than the last several moviesshows i have seen from the mcu it didnt have that same familiar boring feeling that all comic book movies seem to have these days if you are not already a spiderverse fan i figure maybe there is nothing here for you but if you like that kind of thing i think you are in for a treat
Feb 17 2024,negative,throw up emoji make movies great again please
Feb 17 2024,negative,man this movie sucked from the very beginning you just know its going to be bad bad cgi cringey acting stupid storyline characters feel and looked cheap sony needs to stop touching super hero movies or come up with their own
Feb 17 2024,negative,having heard how bad this was i was curious to see if that was truly the case unfortunately it is true it is so boring to have a super hero who occasionally sees into the future does not work cant imagine there will be a sequel but if there is then im out
Feb 17 2024,negative,not sure who wanted to be there less me as a watcher or the actors in the movie
Feb 17 2024,positive,i didnt understand anything but it was more or less interesting
Feb 17 2024,positive,its honestly not as bad as people are making it out to be
Feb 17 2024,negative,madam web has got to be one of the worst film of 2024 his my positive on the movie we get the story of how she got her powers by learning it and find out her powers work my negative about it it was has if they rushed the film story and we barley even got any suit from beginning till the end my negative about it we dont not get any spiderman reference and posted credit scene
Feb 17 2024,positive,this movie is good until spoiler alert i wont say but you will see
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie is so bad that sony would lose less money calling it tax writeoff boring story that makes little sense bad cgi wooden unconvincing acting etc etc  name anything you would see in a bad movie and this movie has it all and more   i am only glad that we watched this on a monthly movie pass along with 2 other people in my cinema  normally i would say wait to see it on streaming but in this case i think most people would find something more interesting and enjoyable to do in the same time such as watering your plants cutting your toenails or just watching the rain fall  it really is bad with a capital b
Feb 17 2024,positive,the best movie that i saw it showed how confident cassie was overall it is a pretty good spiderman movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,from the writers that brought you the last sonys spiderman universe ssu film comes an even worse ssu film    the plot barely made any sense the acting from half the cast members namely dakota johnson and tahar rahim were poor the characters werent memorable the cinematography was all over the place the special effects were very outdated and certain scenes dragged on in a very awkward way    i dont know what the long term goal is for sony when it comes to making all these spiderman spinoff films without spiderman or in conjunction with marvel studios but if madame web is any indication its definitely a step in the wrong direction  save your money    ps  no mid or post credit scenes
Feb 17 2024,negative,one of the leading candidates for the worst movie of the year
Feb 17 2024,negative,just cant believe this got green lit the villain and sydney sweeney were so bad
Feb 17 2024,negative,waste of time so many things in this movie make absolutely no sense feels like its just cobbled together by teenagers late for a team project
Feb 17 2024,positive,i read that a lot of people didnt like it i loved it i love anything marvel related
Feb 17 2024,negative,fifty shades of horribleness  cringeworthy action and dialogue throughout the movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie doesnt warrant a long review simply put absolutely worse movie weve seen in theaters not just for a superhero movie but movie in general god awful and misleading trailer with 90 of what was shown being a guys nightmare 20 minutes into the movie you never see the girls fight or in costume other than the nightmare scene the rest of the movie is them running and being told to stay in place so that the bad spider man doesnt get you first action scene was 140 minutes in and then the movie ended she tells the girls she can see the future and will protect them then credits roll
Feb 17 2024,negative,weak story full of spider man references but without spider man
Feb 17 2024,negative,im actually very impressed at how terrible this movie was it was like they were trying to f these actors careers up im actually astonished it got approved for world wide release multiple people need to be fired for letting this hit theaters sony you should be ashamed of yourselves 
Feb 17 2024,negative,terrible super hero movie had promise but it poorly directed very bad acting and terrible customs please sony sell spiderman property back to marvel
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie isnt worth the hype for me idk why the hell theyre making this movie 
Feb 17 2024,negative,so trash dont even bother to watch this i hope it will get deleted
Feb 17 2024,positive,worth the matinee ticket character development can be long but thats expected the villain could have been casted much better dakota played her role well some spiderman content was included i didnt expect that so it was nice aha moments ending could have been better but most of these bad reviews are closed minded go check it out for yourself
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie damaged my brain throughout this whole movie with all due respects with the casts in this movie the directing the writing and the pacing is very mediocre and slow which dragged this whole movie apart for me to be interested
Feb 17 2024,negative,worst movie ever biggest waste of money with serious buyers remorse in this day in age when ticket prices are expensive as heck only to end up with a bad taste right after    worse than morbius
Feb 17 2024,negative,the girls dont even get powers in this movie this movie is a scam dont waste your money on this hell dont buy the dvd either the villain was after those because the thought they would get powers an kill him but turns out madam web was the one to kill him the action is trash in this movie the trailer sold you a lie youll never see the girl with the powers or with spidey suits on      the trailer shows then righting but when you watch the movie those are just flashes of what could happen boo boo boo boo
Feb 17 2024,negative,an incoherent mess that feels like 20 different final destination scripts mashed together into something that can only be described as slop this isnt funny anymore
Feb 17 2024,positive,loved this movie and so did the person i went with   great actors and story  i dont get the critics response  now a days all the movies they give lower scores to are great and the high review ones almost always are unwatchable i recommend seeing this
Feb 17 2024,negative,plot must have written by a child weak acting at best i miss when hollywood used to be able to make good movies
Feb 17 2024,positive,this is such a good film due to there being nothing else on at the cinema we decided to think about going to see it but unfortunately the terrible ratings put us off despite this we still decided to go and we found out the reviews were really wrong in our opinions it was nice to watch a movie which wasnt just another film about spiderman for example this film is really interesting and tense and cool to find out about cassandra web but the goggles for the spiderpeople take away half a star 
Feb 17 2024,negative,theres absolutely no purpose for this movie the villain is completely stupid and doesnt make sense madame web powers are so stupid action scenes were stupid the acting was mediocre the fact this piece of crab got approved for release is beyond me what a joke
Feb 17 2024,negative,madam webb    complete garbage of a movie if you watched already see if you can do the same as i can attempt to get a refund and an apology from the movie production     you only get to see the spider girls in the bad dudes dream he has a vision in his dream that they kill him the rest of the movie is all 4 of them running away from him and a constant repeat of the sanrio that makes you feel like youre watching final destination movie at the end of the movie you get to see the girls in the custom one last time for a couple of seconds from madam webs future vision the only reference that they make about spiderman is peter being born at the hospital no after credits      i just saved you time and money dont watch this movie terrible acting plot and action
Feb 17 2024,positive,i think it was a really good story that focused on her  and how she became madame web and i do hope they make another one a real good chick flick i think and should be watched by others and not go on reviews 
Feb 17 2024,positive,i enjoyed this movie  not the best ive seen but not the worse either
Feb 17 2024,negative,its looks very very cheap dacota just cannot act sydney overacting there was absolutely no action its
Feb 17 2024,negative,dreadful honestly ive never been so bored  unentertained
Feb 17 2024,negative,what are they thinking  complete nonsense  what happened to the formula that gave us movies like captain marvel iron man and thor
Feb 17 2024,negative,even my dads death in a car accident it wasnt so terrible than this movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,truly awful  from the horrible edits style of framing shots writing to the nonsensical direction of the story this movie should have never been released to 4000 theaters and imax screens we need to renew faith in the fan stop releasing high cost films this film should have been 15m straight to streaming
Feb 17 2024,positive,i watched the movie knowing what the critics were saying but im not easy influenced and thank god cause it was so good had so much action and it was genuinely interesting dont be so judgemental about it your gonna love it
Feb 17 2024,negative,oh my god this thing was boring terrible and so unprofessional that it feels like spiderman lotus if a big studio made it
Feb 17 2024,negative,yikes guys a rough waste of time
Feb 17 2024,positive,i thought it was really good
Feb 17 2024,negative,i wouldnt even pay for this movie with the reviews ive seen surrounded by tik tok i agree and said what sony is doing with these movies or what they really want to expect from a concept that not even the protagonist herself knew what this was about its rubbish and she wont pay anything to see this horrendous movie so dont waste your time on this go out with friends or do something with your life
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie is terrible
Feb 17 2024,positive,not the best marvel film ever but certainly not as bad as reviews suggest  go and see your self youmay just like it
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie was a waste rather have watch a video on waste management i cant believe this has any association too spiderman
Feb 17 2024,negative,my favorite part was when madame web shot up a bank so she could fund her massive tranq habit then when the drgs gave her superpowers she flew through her neighbors roof and beat them to death while screaming its webbin time
Feb 17 2024,negative,another horrible miss
Feb 17 2024,positive,it was fine started a bit messy and ended a bit messy but i enjoyed the middle part of the movie i did connect with the 3 girls and wish we got to see more of them it wasnt an amazing movie but i think people should go form their own opinions rather than just hating it because some guy in youtube said it was bad
Feb 17 2024,negative,poorly written terribly edited the entire movie just didnt make any sense and at many times was unwatchable worst movie in a while 
Feb 17 2024,positive,i liked it its a good movie its interesting not much action but its there

Feb 17 2024,negative,was quite a terrible movie sorry but dakota johnsons acting in this movie was horrible this goes in my bottom 5 worst superhero movies my 5 worst list is 5 fantastic four with miles teller 4 madame web 3 morbius 2 elektra 1 catwoman with halle berry
Feb 17 2024,positive,i enjoyed madame web forget the critics ratings and go see this movie fast paced for an origin story great casting good soundtrack one critique the dialogue is so basic better dialogue would have elevated this movie enjoy the humor easter eggs and music
Feb 17 2024,positive,its great they prepared the plot from the start well  people who rated it bad only because they expected the superhero vibe more fighting with super power and else
Feb 17 2024,positive,it was very entertaining and exciting i loved how it was a superhero movie without necessarily having the suited super heros
Feb 17 2024,positive,could have been more action but dakota and the rest of the girls were great would love to see this world continued
Feb 17 2024,positive,people are being too hard on this movie it was a lot of fun and my family loved it it was not a 1 star movie it deserves a higher rating yes i understand what theyre saying about the ending being a little cheesy but the rest of the movie is still really good 
Feb 17 2024,positive,it was fun different and enjoyable people are so quick to trash thing these days  its not a blockbuster but there is depth to the story fun characters and great pacing  i enjoyed it
Feb 17 2024,positive,another great movie from the marvel universe
Feb 17 2024,negative,marvel has been on a downward trend since infinity war this continues that trend
Feb 17 2024,negative,its not a hero movie this may be the worst female superhero movie yet cringe dont waste your money
Feb 17 2024,negative,so many things wrong with this movie 80 million budget for what save some money and go watch something else
Feb 17 2024,negative,i have never walked out of a movie i usually grin and bear it if its bad i couldnt with this one i had to leave people need to stop killing story lines with their dumb ideas
Feb 17 2024,negative,i cant put in to words how bad the cast the direction the script or the overall movie was ive never had this hard of a time describing how bad a movie is ill just put it like this id rather watch concrete dry you get not even a minute of the cast in their respected costumes i can gratify myself quicker than these characters show up in their costumes what a waste time and money
Feb 17 2024,positive,more fresh than rotten its 5 stars compared with morbius
Feb 17 2024,negative,umm that was horrible barely interesting far from entertaining i would have left but i liked the popcorn
Feb 17 2024,negative,im speechless at the moment in regards to this movie it wasnt as promised as the trailers suggested the villain wasnt a menace at all it was a total failure two good things very creative visual effects and dakota johnson sydney sweeney and isabela merced were wonderful also celeste o conor was ok so and so definetly a character redemption needed for madame web and julia carpenter not cornwal as the dialogue suggested not reccomending to waste money on a movie that was dissapointing from my point of view
Feb 17 2024,negative,complete and utter rubberish
Feb 17 2024,negative,wtf was this horse dudu marvel
Feb 17 2024,negative,honestly aweful like right from the start the decision that the people making this film boggle the mind i would love to sit them down and ask them what they were thinking
Feb 17 2024,negative,who the heck was the clueless fool who penned this screenplay
Feb 17 2024,positive,truly one of the movies of this time period i loved the scene where madame web looked into the future and started webbing everyone up the story had writing thats for sure 1010 would watch again
Feb 17 2024,positive,its not bad  its not as good as it could have been some ideas were really clunky and didnt work well it also felt like it was building up to something that never had a payoff  i love the cast its a good popcorn flick to turn your brain off to at the beginning of a weekend  i much prefer the sony marvel properties to what weve been getting from marvel studios
Feb 17 2024,negative,not the worst out this week but certainly not far from it
Feb 17 2024,negative,the worstthis years disaster
Feb 17 2024,negative,watching a movie like this makes me scratch my head you hire  compelling actors b level production values horrible score and  non compelling  direction  proving actors are only a small part of overall production  but i guess it comes down to script or lack of a good one   i hope for the sake of the actors  they will  look back on this and think  how difficult it is to make any film that is entertaining and meaningful but i guess they gave it the old college try
Feb 17 2024,positive,actually is very good movie   all characters are good and beautiful  ben is a very responsible and the man can count on  all three girls are beautiful and nice
Feb 17 2024,positive,i actually loved this movie and was pleasantly surprised by it very excited about the set up for future movies in the spiderman universe the critics for this movie are being extremely overdramatic about how bad it is
Feb 17 2024,negative,bad writing lines that wouldnt happen in real life bad plot great premise which makes the film more disappointing bad cinematography
Feb 17 2024,negative,i need to apologize to the producers of the marvels that dogs breakfast looks like an oscar contender compared to madame web to say its just another on a long line of superhero movies in which the writers dont like the source material and didnt even bother to read it is an understatement which begs the questionwhy bother making a superhero movie when you hold the source material in contempt in fairness to the writers it looks like dakota johnson didnt seem to care about the source material or character either that probably explains why she was mailed in her performance seriously the movie felt like a 2 hour rehearsal you know a movies bad when the fake reviews written by people raving over a movie they never watched are more entertaining than the movie itself yikes
Feb 17 2024,negative,madame web is a film that has a lot of potential to build an alternate liveaction female spiderverse but the film itself is too long there are too many fractures within the story to make it make sense the character development is minimal at best and the films ending and fight scenes leave a lot to be desired its a shame because i thought the casting was great and there was some good chemistry between all four female leads however the cons outweigh the pros now do i want to see a sequel yes mainly because i want to see how these characters develop in a more grounded story with a more menacing villain and some better action sequences
Feb 17 2024,negative,disgustingly bad and horrible
Feb 17 2024,positive,sloppy but not a failure this is a survival story not a superhero story fun but not art many of the plot holes online were due to people not paying attention to the movie dialogue wasnt terrible but nothing quotable humor was good not great but not bad acting was a mixed bag the biggest fault is the rough cgi all the problems seem to stem from a lack of faith with the vision of the project the potential was there but it seems like people lost hope in the process could have easily been a 4 out of 5 if the vision was allowed to be finished most of the cringe things people talk about were clearly intentional not accidental
Feb 17 2024,positive,not your  typical marvel movie it lacked the edge of seat excitement
Feb 17 2024,negative,god what was sony thinking by releasing this movie so awful so boring so cliche  the action part is so little and so bad the story was meh  the acting is not good too they use their suit in just under 10 minutes  i dont expect this movie to be this bad but man way to go sony
Feb 17 2024,positive,the story is about cassandra web and the movie develops it quite well it has nothing to do with the other 3 spider girls or the antagonist i dont understand the hype for seeing other characters that are only the primary motivations of the main character and that serve as a possible introduction to the arachnid world    as for the costumes the madam web glasses at the end of the movie are i dont know as if my little nephew had designed and painted them the costumes of the spider girls and ezekiel were well done    the movie is generally very entertaining nothing to do with what the experts said by the way who are the experts
Feb 17 2024,negative,holy hell from the very beginning it felt like a very cliche super hero movie  like you exactly what was going to halen before it did  and who the villian was down to the shifty eyes  the paramedics didnt know how to paramedic  cassie pulls her injured coworker of of a damaged vehicle and doesnt check for vitals if hes breathing or head injuries  just pulls him out and starts cpr   later she teaches three teens to do the same thing no vitals no check for breathing doesnt show them where the chest sternem is to get compressions in the right area  just straight into compressions   i was done by the half way mark
Feb 17 2024,positive,dont let the negativity reviews turn you away it wasnt the best movie ever but it was still good i agree that some dialogue was unnecessary and the bad guy role was not played well but my whole family enjoyed going out to watch it
Feb 17 2024,positive,i have no idea what people are complaining about the story is absurd maybe no more than vast majority of superhero movies though   at least it is interesting which cannot be said about most of the recent disneymarvel blockbusters at least this movie doesnt throw at you ridiculously prolonged action sequences in slow motion to make them even longer   anyway dont believe reviews and give it a try it wont change your life but it may entertain you for a bit
Feb 17 2024,negative,had bright spots and has the potential to be a good story just poorly executed by the actresses director writers and everyone else involved the marvels was better
Feb 17 2024,negative,i just seen it today it was the worst movie i ever seen in my life the movie was was trash the character are boring the editing was garbage this story was trash i watched it all way through i lost brain cells while watching this movie and they change great power line for dumb reason im done with these sony spiderman movies this movie barely explains the spider tribe people or that one guy who was in the opening but he appears later and having age and its false advertisement the spidergirls dont get powers but they get powers in the future it was in a dream and at the end of the movie which in the future dont advertise your movie tell us there getting powers for the whole movie what a lie and of course with sony they killed off the villain just like with carnagemilo riot this movie is 00 bad movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,give me the he was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died cut
Feb 17 2024,negative,where to start this film never seems to have a soul character motivations are unmotivated or inspired lead actress dakota johnson fails to convince that she even wants to be in the film pacing makes what is a 2 hour film feel like 4 and when anything comic book film started to happen it was over     its quite rare that i see a film at the cinema that makes me want to leave but this film while not infuriating is just boring when films like minus one can be cinematic masterpieces for 15 mil i have to ask where did the 80mil for this go
Feb 17 2024,negative,this has to be the worst movie ive ever seen
Feb 17 2024,positive,it wasnt perfect my any means but i enjoyed it cassies character development was solid i will admit i am a little disappointed they made her both blind and disabled at the end of the first film  was kinda hoping theyd make a trilogy or something and movie 1 would be here discovering her powers movie 2 would have her lose her sight and movie 3 would have her become disabled    there were also some very cringable moments but what movie isnt these days over all though really solid movie i wouldve liked to know more about ezekiel and his motives like we get why hes after the girls but why did he do what he did at the start of the movie    the spiderman references were kinda cool too and very well hidden took me two viewing to get the references with ben parker mary parker and marys son that was born at the end of the film who will be named peter eventually    so yeah not perfect but a great movie and in the end very enjoyable
Feb 17 2024,positive,the villains voice sounded like evil batman but aside from that it was fun
Feb 17 2024,negative,ashamed to even call this a spider man movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,its extremely boring also an absolutely garbage installation the scenes jump from one to the other so nothing is clear watch this great movie only with a group of friends
Feb 17 2024,positive,i liked the storyline but would have liked to see more i think they are setting it up for maybe a disney series or another movie allinall i am glad i went to see it it was a pretty good movie
Feb 17 2024,positive,super fun movie if dont have too many expectations exited to see the characters again
Feb 17 2024,negative,i didnt think worse than the marvels or  morbius was possible but my god this is tubi bad
Feb 17 2024,negative,it wasnt as horrible as people are saying  they were smart to show the future scenes  it did seem more like a cw movie than a sony movie   the writing was like a 90s early 2000 comic book writing  you can enjoy it while reading it but then you realize how dumb the story really was   if they are smart theyll use this as their connection to the multiverse and to all the other sony movies  pull them all in thru the web
Feb 17 2024,negative,horrible boring disgusting no sense
Feb 17 2024,negative,sony should sell all the rights to disney they know what to do with this stuff
Feb 17 2024,negative,the bad guy appeared to have a bad voiceover the acting in general was cringeworthy it may be far and away the worst marvel movie ive ever seen yes im talking worse than both hulk movies yes even worse than the early 2000s version of fantastic 4 why did they do this im still confused
Feb 17 2024,positive,very good movie it tells the emergence of madame teia well of course we cant compare it to the comics but for a cinema adaptation the film is great
Feb 17 2024,positive,actually has a story and isnt just a cgi fest we enjoyed it
Feb 17 2024,negative,wow terrible story directing and cast  what were they thinking
Feb 17 2024,negative,worst character development worst action sceneslol its not even action scenes  waste of money sony  sony changed the whole story and here is the worst end product  i am so concerned about venom 3 and kraven
Feb 17 2024,negative,nothing ended up happening in the movie the whole movie was to setup the future of the sony universe but it all got cut from the movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,just junk  one of the worst cinematic wastes of  ever  garbage all around with terrible screenwriting
Feb 17 2024,positive,i actually thought the movie was quite good from the fun scenes with the girls being teenagers to when cassie madame web was getting her visions into the future but there was some downsides to the movie one being the ending was disappointing but i think they could redeem it in the sequal overall i thought this movie was fun thrilling and enjoyable
Feb 17 2024,positive,loved it i dont know what all the negative reviews are for
Feb 17 2024,negative,horrendous dialogue no connections between the characters and no action until 1h30 into the film and then still brief second day in theatres and only nine people at showing should of left before it started 2h ill never get back
Feb 17 2024,negative,train wreck meaningless shall not exist
Feb 17 2024,positive,surprisingly entertaining not like the other recent dc or marvel movies cast was great  hope they do a sequel
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie was nowhere near as bad as some reviews made it out to be i would say the ending was rushed and a better job couldve been done explaining the aftermath of the final fight sequence
Feb 17 2024,negative,too complicated and confusing and not a good way save your money
Feb 17 2024,positive,the film isnt as dark as people described it it certainly could have been better but i really thought this was a funny film with a really cool action scene and a feminine energy its a good film and i think its worth watching youll definitely have a good laugh with cassie she is really cute
Feb 17 2024,positive,a nice switch up from normal superhero films the last 2 mins of dialogue are a little cringey but overall an enjoyable film
Feb 17 2024,positive,okay i might be bias because its spiderman related but the movie literally wasnt that bad as people are saying i would say its still more enjoyable then morbius its definitely not anything great but it doesnt deserve the amount of hate its getting i see what they were trying to go for and yes it may not have worked well but the movie was still watchable and enjoyable i did notice some weird edits and bad voice lines but other then little tid bits its not a bad movie i will agree that they could have made it way better then what has released im going to give it an 610
Feb 17 2024,negative,a weak cast with weak acting a villain with no conviction and a voice that sounds to be dubbed over this spinoff should have never left the studio how this despicable and lazy story script ever met the minimum requirements to be green light is beyond me the costumes look absurd and the we are spider people yet we arent visuals is awful the list of disappointments goes on and on the ending being the most absurd and egregious this is not worth watching and is actually painful to finish
Feb 17 2024,neutral,weak in general wouldnt even be good for a 2005 film at all
Feb 17 2024,negative,it is insane to me that these shows and movies continue to be made these are the same writers that made morbious and guess what its even worse
Feb 17 2024,negative,absolutely abysmal its the worse marvel movie to date
Feb 17 2024,negative,marvel really disappointed their fans with this moviewell i dint expect much from the movie also i didnt expect i would be so disappointed as thisworst movie ever seen in 2024
Feb 17 2024,negative,i understand the intention behind the plan here it aimed to produce a trippy film that envisioned a robust future for the sony verse however the execution fell short the cinematography employed in this movie made it frustrating to follow with incessant quick closeup shots of the action the dialogue was subpar accompanied by excessive and blatant voiceovers during the villain scenes much of the movies duration felt squandered on dull scenes leading me to suspect that the screenwriters finished the script only to realise it fell short of the word count frankly the acting quality was lacking across the board particularly that of the villain who seemed miscast or hastily chosen as someone who enjoys guilty pleasures like watching bad movies this was a truly agonising experience i cannot recommend it
Feb 17 2024,negative,character development overall was a bit off it felt like a bad episode from a tv show action was ok this was a waste of my time marvel dropped the ballalso no post credits
Feb 17 2024,negative,honestly terrible lol stan lee would be pissed
Feb 17 2024,neutral,just poor in som emany ways
Feb 17 2024,positive,a decent movie to watch when theres nothing else not as bad as many fans of comic books are making it out to be its apart of a multiverse so the story isnt going to be exactly like the comic books
Feb 17 2024,negative,the villain who has all the powers that make him strong including the fact that he can poison a person just by his touch somehow gets defeated by a billboard falling on him just more lazy writing stay away from this flop
Feb 17 2024,neutral,the actors were basically reading off the script and the script was cheesy like a bad disney movie but i was definitely interested to see it since im a big spidey fan the suits were super cool tho dont regret watching it but wont watch it again
Feb 17 2024,positive,i love this movie it was full of adventure and surprises and the imagery was amazing
Feb 17 2024,positive,i went to see the movie without having any expectations and really enjoyed it its just the first in the series so you cant expect an epic finale like endgame and such but i enjoyed seing cassie discovering her powers and using her her brain and the elements to overcome a strong enemy
Feb 17 2024,negative,slow  sequences and very very disappointing performances   story line was supper dumb
Feb 17 2024,negative,i got up and left after 15 minutes what a boring snorefest
Feb 17 2024,neutral,good story bad everything else
Feb 17 2024,positive,movie is actually good dont believe in critics review they just want to let down the marvel movies    well defined story and good screenplay and setting a great plot for future movies of spiderman in the sony universe dont miss it by the wrong critics review
Feb 17 2024,neutral,bad animations bad cgi no posta cr√©ditos scene no connect with nothing bored
Feb 17 2024,positive,a lot of fun if your a spider fan  ignore the critics go see the movie
Feb 17 2024,positive,a great origin story
Feb 17 2024,negative,i just feel like everyone involved should have tried harder
Feb 17 2024,positive,dakota johnson decent performance as was all the supporting cast  plot and action hold your interest throughout the movie  primarily a flic for the teens but adults wont be disappointed
Feb 17 2024,positive,good plot would have been better placed as a prequel but i still hope there is a second id be excited to go see it
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie should have never been made just go watch morbius you will have a better time
Feb 17 2024,positive,its not great but its not bad the cinematography is interesting and very unique it has problems but what movie does not id see it again
Feb 17 2024,positive,honestly dont understand the bad reviews the movie was good and the relationship between the three girls was interesting and very realistic i hope a second part releases soon
Feb 17 2024,positive,i loved this movie  i would see this over oppenheimer or barbie anytime  its fresh and fun has great shots of nyc  fdny who could ask for anything more  plus some fun ideas in the plot overall a good night out at the theatre
Feb 17 2024,negative,beginning of movie was an odd rush into origin story acting was a bit stale and awkward between actors antagonists voice for some reason came off as being dubbed over ie his mouth movements didnt seemed synced with his voice main characters decisions made in the movie were unrealistic despite her position as a civil servant dealing with a crisis the dancing around numerous instances of characters saying some derivative of spiderman was a bit annoying after a while it was better than i thought it was going to be but to be honest i almost for got this movie had released in theaters
Feb 17 2024,negative,honestly i couldnt tell if this was comedy or an action movie it isnt even bad good its just bad how these films are getting the green light is amazing i need to get a job as a director or screen writer i have no skills in that realm but i could write something better or direct brainless actors better then who eve did this film
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie is good i dont know why there are so many people rating it badly  the ending is really cool btw
Feb 17 2024,negative,an hour and 49 minutes i cant take back this movie sucked
Feb 17 2024,neutral,its okay it definitely doesnt live up to marvels standards however its definitely better than the other recent marvel movies the cgi at the end of the final battle scene was kinda bad the excessive moaning made me very uncomfortable the costume design is bad the villans outfit was alright but the story was good in my opinion the execution was okay overall a pretty average movie     48 legs
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie was action filled   enjoyable with great action loved it
Feb 17 2024,negative,the costume were trash the some of the camera scenes didnt have the quality it needed the plot didnt hold on tell the end the whole beeging didnt really say what happend it wasnt like regular spider a very worse version of spiderman and the acting was horrible not a good movie my recommendation dont wach
Feb 17 2024,negative,overall just not good the acting and action just didnt feel natural there were scenes were you could it was a voice over and it was horrible i like dakota johnson as a person and actress but this movie just wasnt good
Feb 17 2024,negative,taxing on the brain didnt make any sense
Feb 17 2024,negative,we went to see madame web at the drive in near us i wore shorts and a t shirt because it was unusually warm that was a mistake i nearly froze to death  while  my family looked like desperate refugees trying to make heads or tails of this film one son played with gravel during the movie my brother spilled beer and diet coke on the pavement
Feb 17 2024,negative,very weak storylinedisjointed
Feb 17 2024,positive,good movie i enjoyed the story and want to see where they take it
Feb 17 2024,negative,glad i got in for free  if i paid id feel really bad
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie was great the details and multiversal theories are through the roof the critics can suck it
Feb 17 2024,positive,thought it was all around fun movie  something different but kept me interested the full time
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie should be an absolute career killer for everyone involved except adam scott who did what he could but somehow theyll keep on going the most onenote surface level characters in a script that seems to have been written in one pass this movie is not even sobaditsgood its sobaditsupsetting im telling you dont see this movie just read the reviews and piece together what you think the movie is like youll end up enjoying that version more than the real thing
Feb 17 2024,positive,i liked it because it is a different pov of what a superheroine movie could be like looking forward to the next one
Feb 17 2024,neutral,morbius was worse way worse though there are major issues with this movie  inconsistencies incongruous timelines questionable special effects i do not think it deserves all the hate it has received it follows the typical formulaic superhero pacing and does it well enough if youre able to look past the flaws youll have an okay time if you like super hero movies dont blame the formula blame the ingredients not all cakes are good some cakes are paul hollywood some are martha stewart after shes seen some things in prison but at the end of the day cake is cake if cake came out of a redbox thats where i would eat this one
Feb 17 2024,negative,unless you want to waste two hours of your life this might be the most garbage movie ever id rather watch late night infomercials about crockpots
Feb 17 2024,negative,the most weakest and perhaps wth movie plot and story line i have ever seen why how makes no sense why on earth even watching fox news and newsmax are more entertaining then this
Feb 17 2024,negative,once again sony proves why they should just sell the rights to marvel this movie sucked and nobody wanted it
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie manages to touch on the story between cassey and her mother cassey believes that she went to the amazon without considering the fact that she was in her womb later she learns a truth she did not expect  at first cassey shies away from emotional involvement because of this unknown truth it is the awakening of her powers that reunites her with three teenagers who like her harbor some resentment but the responsibility cassey takes on to save them from death will bind them tightly together  i think that despite the marvel stamp director sj clarkson failed to win over the masses of fans of the avengers or the multiverses and maybe that was not her intention personally im glad she didnt   on the other hand the superhero costumes worn by cassey julia anya and mattie were very unattractive nothing to do with the outfits of the avengers heroines for example  i liked the performances of the female leads and the actors who played ezekiel and ben  thank you sj clarkson and all the actresses actors and crew in general
Feb 17 2024,negative,nobody wanted this horrible  shame on you for creating this
Feb 17 2024,positive,great movie  its definitely a story origination
Feb 17 2024,negative,probably one of the most boring superhero films ive every watched i cant even recommend it to a certain audience
Feb 17 2024,neutral,its time for sony to just give all rights to marvel and let marvel do the movies right given that sony just cant
Feb 17 2024,positive,i was expecting it to be awful from the reviews but it wasnt bad at all   ive definitely seen way worse marvel movies than this one  not sure why its getting so much hate
Feb 17 2024,negative,garbage movie and another flop for sonys attempt to do anything with the spiderman franchise i am baffled how sony is not embarrassed by this dump of a movie
Feb 17 2024,positive,another great superhero movie from sony and columbia a good time travel movie
Feb 17 2024,neutral,the storyline had potential however the execution came across like a cw series
Feb 17 2024,negative,i caught madam web today and its safe to say it plunges below the already low expectations set by the online chatter this film manages to be an exemplary showcase of how not to execute superhero cinema with dialogue so cringeworthy it makes its webbing time sound almost shakespearean by comparison imagine the worst aspects of a cw superhero show devoid of the charm that made early smallville a hit and youre close to experiencing madam web in all honesty this movie is a tangled mess that i strongly recommend skipping it fails to weave any of the magic it so desperately reaches for leaving us with a web wed rather not get caught in
Feb 17 2024,positive,great movie nothing like spider man me and my son cant wait and hope they make a part 2
Feb 17 2024,positive,well i know what im buying next time i watch this movie ill be wearing my i eat math for breakfast tshirt this film was an elusive masterpiece that pushed every boundary known to man the amount of joy i felt while watching motivated me to ignore every plot hole this movie exemplified the theme of girl boss showing that they can run from anything to end this i have to mention how they featured professor xavier in this the multiverse really is real in the end she became a mom to three girls 5 years younger than her us strays need to stick together
Feb 17 2024,negative,everything about this movie sucked i felt like they really casted anybody for this movie by far the worst superhero movie of all time
Feb 17 2024,positive,best picture 2024 said no one ever
Feb 17 2024,positive,not nearly as bad as the critic rating would have you believe it was perfectly enjoyable but definitely not amazing if you want to go to the movies just because you like going to the movies then this is a good choice but i wouldnt recommend you go out of your way acting and dialogue was cheesy fairly often but never atrocious aside from everything the villain says
Feb 17 2024,negative,this shouldnt have ever came out
Feb 17 2024,positive,act impact from beginning to end seems to be origin  story cant wait for the next one to come out
Feb 17 2024,neutral,this movie couldnt quite figure out what it was an origin story a team up a mystery the leads certainly tried their best with the script they had i liked the main cast they were just lacking a cohesive story to be in overall this movie was about allowing a future movie that i would have rather seen
Feb 17 2024,negative,i feel sorry for dakota participating in this stupid and ridiculous movie i have been a long time fan of the spidey universe i know pretty much a lot of the characters background and story anyway the plot is nefarious the dialogues sequences the story makes no sense i was going to go on and on but i better stop here i love dakota johnson she is quite an actress and i am pretty sure she could get into more important movies or be part of the superhero moviesbut not while sony is in control and has the rights to destroy yes destroy the spidey universe
Feb 17 2024,positive,it wasnt that bad of a movie it was a little bit of a change from the normal superhero movies dakota johnson is no academy award winner but she did ok
Feb 17 2024,positive,i liked it its a bummer how it doesnt actually connect to mcu also it started interesting but went a bit flat towards the end i heard a theory how it was supposed to be a prequel to spiderman where the whole movie is about them protecting peters mom and making sure peters born but that was for some reason scrapped overall better than the reviews would lead you to believe
Feb 17 2024,positive,mediocre story line     acting great    picture and song also great
Feb 17 2024,positive,its a good movie it is not the worst for me i just wanted more scenes with the spider suits but it worked as a prequel and let us know how cassie got her powers and how spiderwomen got theirs
Feb 17 2024,positive,honestly it was funny
Feb 17 2024,negative,this was one of the worst movies i have seen since howard the duck  it was all over the place the pacing was weird the character development was bizarre and the details were awful  even if you have no idea what a paramedic does you will know that these two are the absolute worst medics and should never be allowed on an ambulance      so many incongruities and forced motivations why were the three girls in costume and why did they have powers in his nightmare but not really just kidding   campfire left burning in the woods  no problem and how did they start the fire to begin with  paramedics wife is in labor time to go into panic mode what  she teaches them cpr  barely so cringe  medic bag has flares and smoke grenades  of course it would  how did the bad guy find them at the warehouse      i swear the villain was voicedubbed  it was super annoying to watch his lips move but the words didnt match      so so dumb  dont waste your hard earned dollars
Feb 17 2024,neutral,this superhero movie was alright dakota johnson celeste oconnor isabela merced sydney sweeney tahar rahim adam scott and the rest of the cast did a decent job in this movie the plot of the movie was kind of dramatic and a little intense in my opinion the director shouldve done a better job on making this movie if you havent seen this movie yet you might enjoy it but it wont be spectacular
Feb 17 2024,positive,another origin story wasnt too bad tho expected a little more
Feb 17 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in the last 5 years i fell asleep it was that bad acting was terrible save your money im not even a hard critic of movies this was bad
Feb 17 2024,positive,mid    not bad not great fake crying was funny overall story was entertaining i give it a b
Feb 17 2024,negative,easily one of the worst movies ever made characters act hopeless and powerless for no other reason than to make dakota seem like shes able to actually do something of use sony must really hate their actors and staff for allowing this movie to be released
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie was really good how dare you guys rate it a 3
Feb 17 2024,negative,i feel sorry for the actors in this movie
Feb 17 2024,positive,its a comic book film that wasnt as bad as people maybe made it out to be i think it just lacks structure but acting was fine the villain is the problem just not really detailed like it needed to be
Feb 17 2024,positive,i loved the action and the story i cant wait to see it again with the grandkids
Feb 17 2024,positive,almost didnt see the it because of all the poor reviews had to see what they were talking about and they are absolutely wrong it was a good movie i recommend it its an origin story the audience gets to take a ride on with discovery with enough action mystery adrenaline rush plenty of entertainment with the characters this madam web movie is made up to expect a part two to see her in her full force i cant wait for part two its a must to completely see how powerful she is as a superhero the issue with everybody is they were expecting everything in one film as marvel usually does
Feb 17 2024,negative,ehm did i actually use my last 10 dollars on this shitty movie wtf man now my mom gotta drive me to work 0510
Feb 17 2024,negative,my mom died while she was researching this movie in the theatres
Feb 17 2024,positive,i think this was a very good movie perhaps nothing revolutionary but just a solid overall superhero movie and thats what it is a superhero movie i honestly dont know why people are giving it such a hard time yeah it is not particuarly complex but neither was john wick or fast and furious it is just a fun enjoyable movie nothing that will set the world on fire but a very good movie all the same
Feb 17 2024,negative,the movie was so bland and generic that it honestly sounded like it was written by a 5 year old dont even get me started on the horrible voice on the villain that sounds like a five year old playing with action figures
Feb 17 2024,negative,bad and just sad just feel sorry for the future people who will see that movie
Feb 17 2024,positive,watched madam web and glad i didnt pay attention to the reviews the movie was entertaining and caught my interest  i really hope there is a sequel so i can see future character developments honestly i liked this movie 10 times better than mean girls strongly recommend just watch a movie that interests you and do not let the media dissuade your decision to just have fun
Feb 17 2024,neutral,the story is a good idea but falls short i watched this movie with low expectations and was happy with the end result obviously this is not the conventional hero movie and i applaud that i think the cast was fine the script is probably the weakest point of the movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,i didnt think super hero movies could get worse but this is proving that each  film reaches a new low this movie is pure trash and is not worth the time and materials it took to make it  the acting is forced and fake the story is idiotic the filming would have gotten a d  in film school so heres a psa save your money and go watch paint drying it will be more satisfying entertainment
Feb 17 2024,negative,after sleeping on it this movies was so bad i decided to write a short story depicting what should have happened in this movie this movie had a couple of good scenes well only the subway scene and the rest was garbage yeow
Feb 17 2024,negative,have you ever graded your arm against the highway at 65 miles per hour no well let me tell ya this movie is fucking awful i genuinely felt pain while watching this movie there was no redeeming quality did you say web
Feb 17 2024,negative,so bad not well written at all i would make that the worst movie i have ever seen ever
Feb 17 2024,negative,horrible a new torrure method would be forcing someone to watch this alone with nothing to distract themselves
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie was surprisingly better than what i was expected no where as bad as the reviews have made it seem
Feb 17 2024,negative,i just cant with this
Feb 17 2024,negative,wasnt my jam lots of issue i hated the flash cuts that happen a lot
Feb 17 2024,negative,the set production was very poor everything felt like a stage or felt fake it seemed more like a play  i dont kniw if it was poor writing acting casting  script or set but it failed
Feb 17 2024,positive,not bad as a spiderman spinoff most of fans didnt like it because they were expecting a cameo for tobey or andrew or even tom but the movie focused on madame web and in the ending i think we now got a doctor strange in the sony spiderman universe
Feb 17 2024,negative,if i could give 0 stars i would ooff this was bad so bad in all areas the voice of the villain was out of sync the editing was shoddy the dialogues didnt sync and that ending was atrocious this movie will go down as the worst super hero movie ever made yes even worse than green lantern please do not watch this movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,no morbious but its alright
Feb 17 2024,positive,i havent read other reviews but ive seen the scores and honestly i have no idea what movie they watched it was a popcorn film similar to die hard in pacing slow in the beginning but then it turns out every little thing in the beginning was relevant just as the action kicks in is this an art house movie that will change your life no but to be honest there is plenty here to make you enjoy 2 hours i may even want to see it again once it comes to bluray it was made even more special that i brought my son to it and he turned to me to say this movie is so good right before the act 2 climax with a large smile on his face after a tough week at school he will be telling his friends about how good it is and i wanted to share it with the internet
Feb 17 2024,negative,the dialogue was bad the ending was convoluted mess
Feb 17 2024,negative,i always thought the worstcheesiest super hero movie was the 2011 ryan reynolds green lantern movie until today
Feb 17 2024,positive,suspenseful and great actoractress support the very ending scene made it a little cheesy
Feb 17 2024,negative,disney and in this case sony ruins everything
Feb 17 2024,positive,a recent article in hollywood reporter by richard newby bemoans the pathetic state of film criticism today noting the propensity for gleeful takedowns often predicated on false information andor intentional mischaracterizations that article offers a really excellent analysis of one of the major problems with so much of film criticism including what is often found here    i just got home from seeing madame web in the theater its not a great movie but it is not a terrible movie either the critics attacks were an exercise in oneupmanship as to who could offer the most excoriating oneliners the irony is that this was not a superhero movie it was an origin story with several intriguing premisessomewhat derivative as they nearly always areand yet interesting did it have plot holes and jumps in logic absolutely nearly every superhero story does    with so much of episodic tv these days i find myself feeling that so many of these six and a half hour 8episode miniseries or story arcs could have been a really good two hour movie or perhaps a three hour twopart series ironically i felt the opposite about this movie we actually could have used more of what we got the characters and their situations were introduced in a few 30second scenes and a few 20second autobiographical confessions in this case we might have used a fifteen or twenty minute exploration of the backstories of each of the six or seven main characters like you would get in a good threepart series not three two and a half hour movies but three hour long episodes clearly it has obvious spiderman parallels but it introduced some interesting premises on its own    it was a little like bumblebee in the transformer world that is it reduced the slambang factor by ten but it worked on the human level even humanizing the car to a much more compelling significance than any of the other movies in the transformer series madame web was certainly not as strong an entry as bumblebee but as a 2hour diversion it was a perfectly pleasant way to spend time in the movie theater
Feb 17 2024,negative,madame web is a cinematic disaster marred by a confusing plot lifeless characters and subpar visuals save yourself the agony  this film is best left unwatched
Feb 17 2024,positive,it was an interesting movie was very cliche and the line delivery wasnt the best and the editing was choppy but overall its an average film that you would expect from the 2000s
Feb 17 2024,negative,movie is awful sony marvel should stop putting out movie as it hurts the overall spiderman brand
Feb 17 2024,positive,honestly this movie is getting way too much hate there were obvious flaws throughout the film but when given a chance its actually quite entertaining
Feb 17 2024,positive,i understand why everyone is hating it but it isnt terrible it is worth watching dakota and sydney are amazing it in
Feb 17 2024,positive,overall i enjoyed this movie yes there were some places that couldve been reworked but i had a good time and loved the actors dakota johnson is coming into her own
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie was really good i loved it
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie was so story line was just terrible after the first trailer came out i knew it would just bomb
Feb 17 2024,negative,a boring horror movie that is marketed as a superhero movie
Feb 17 2024,positive,not as jumpy and action driven as the typical marvel superhero movie as always gaps in the plot but which movie doesnt i enjoyed it and will watch again when it goes online be forewarned there is no cut scene i never read the comics so im not sure what the three girls will become as i said i enjoyed it 
Feb 17 2024,positive,unique story interesting throughout
Feb 17 2024,positive,i personally really enjoyed this movie so much i really hoped for more suits screentime but we could get it in a sequel honestly i love the cast specially dakota johnson sydney sweeney celeste oconnor and isabela merced the plot is pretty simple but functional a possible madame web 2 could finally find the live action sony spiderverse to finish with i dont care about what people could say about my opinion because my opinion is mine and only mine thank you very much
Feb 17 2024,negative,written and directed by a child
Feb 17 2024,neutral,such a great concept but the dark cloud of the sony verse is all over it nothing to look to before or after
Feb 17 2024,negative,pile of shite why make these films if they arent going to make them right
Feb 17 2024,negative,can i give is zero what the hell did i just watch the world has gone mad
Feb 17 2024,negative,how can they keep making worst and worst heroes movies
Feb 17 2024,negative,it wasnt even a film to pass the time i nearly fell asleep a few times costumes were only part of one scene and it was messy with so many plot holes and inconsistencies that you just never get into the movie and they couldnt even get the line with great power comes great responsibility and went with an altered one which dulls the meaning of the line completely
Feb 17 2024,negative,so bad it is laughable 
Feb 17 2024,positive,i thought it was fantastic i highly recommend it i thought it was funny  emotional all at the right times the casting was perfect  overall a good watch
Feb 17 2024,negative,just terrible cant get much worse
Feb 17 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie its getting a lot of unnecessary hate i think people expect too much and compare everything yo the disney marvel when their 2 separate things
Feb 17 2024,positive,i loved it this is a great origin story
Feb 17 2024,negative,accept the fact that there are some super heroes or super heroines if you will that may be perceived as super only in the minds of their creators and the production companies who would like to at least cover their costs of production madame webb is intended to be an origin story for a female superhero who has the cognitive ability of portending the what is to come it is difficult to review a plot that is uninspiring challenges any and all aspects of realistic possibilities and is an ordeal to sit through a female scientist is in the amazon searching for a mythical spider whose venoms curative possibilities are purported to have almost miraculous healing properties she is pregnant with a fetus diagnosed as suffering from a critical disease that only the venom from this mythical amazonian spider might cure the mother is shot by a guide who is also searching for these same mythical spiders for his own financial gain quicky attempting to advance a story line that does not deserve the consideration the child is delivered in an amazonian river where first the mother dies and next some magicalmystical energy flows through the newborn instilling her with the ability to portend future actions and activities with a serious effort to push the illogical story line to its ultimate conclusion spider lady dakota johnson will meet and align herself with 3 youthful super wanna bees and they will become part of her future cadre of crime fighting spiderites with either a dramatic rewrite of the entire concept or immediate recognition of the shallowness of the female super spider venom ladies lack of screen value this should be the last web lady episode that will ever be made  rating a  t  c  a  a termination contract anticipated
Feb 17 2024,positive,movies actually really good dont believe the critics love anything spiderman madam web was a good adaption to the comics
Feb 17 2024,negative,story was predictable and preposterous at same time  script wasnt consistent and jumped around  i wanted to leave but was with friends
Feb 17 2024,positive,this movie wasnt nearly as bad as the professional reviewers give it i think theres a bias against sony spiderverse movies it was better than either of the venom movies and morbius    the acting was good all the way around which should be the case cause you hsve some solid veterans and some talented up and comers script was fine the villain was a bit disfocused though    its a pretty good origin story i would like to see more of these heros as they evolve but unfortunately we probably wont get the chance
Feb 17 2024,negative,ive never seen a marvel movie this horrendous
Feb 17 2024,positive,it was pretty good glad i went to see for myself
Feb 17 2024,negative,horrible adaptation that i truly regret seeing
Feb 16 2024,positive,definitely something different from marvel not sure how it will fit into the cinematic universe
Feb 16 2024,negative,oh no its morbin time again
Feb 16 2024,positive,its not much compared to past spiderman movies just gave me a reason to be in a 4dx theater
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was good for exposition dont watch the movie to explain the spiderverse
Feb 16 2024,neutral,in essence madame web is a mediocre film with an enjoyable story that is squandered due to its short duration and poor direction while the main characters are sufficient to carry the film unfortunately their adversaries pale in comparison the weakness of the antagonist automatically weakens the film however beyond everything else the biggest problem with the project is entrusting it to a tv director sj clarkson despite having a highly skilled cinematographer like mauro fiore behind it the decisionmaking process fell short in the hands of the director rather than being potentially much better it ended up resembling a simple and cheap action series from the early 2000s
Feb 16 2024,negative,this movie had terrible acting from almost every actoractress at some point in the movie everything about this movie was atrocious most likely due to the writing it was over edited and didnt even feel like a superhero movie or even a marvel movie at that please do better or dont even bother releasing the movie
Feb 16 2024,positive,its a fun movie it couldve been better with a better story but it does the job for a fun movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,the same tired formula disney has done over and over again how much money does disney need to lose until they realize we dont want this
Feb 16 2024,negative,an illogical situation that unfolds in an obvious way with poorer dialogue than the naughty connections with spiderman   the production focuses on a kind of cat and mouse game in which on one side there is a poorly developed villain and on the other there is a group of people reduced to archetypes by a script that seems to not know what to do with them 
Feb 16 2024,negative,moviereview madamewebb     so the movie is a origin story we knew that from the commercials plus shes new to the sony marvel associated project     the film wasnt as bad as the critics are putting it out to be it was just a bland and boring story it wasnt any kind of buildup or lead into anything more than what you got in the commercials or the trailers     shes pretty much a boring superhero who gives you the vibe of professor x without any credible fighting style it was sad to see the three actresses basically just be a running gag they were just three little girls trying to keep from being killed    the crazy thing is that all three of the actresses are actual actresses that have had legitimate roles chelsea is lucky from the ghostbuster franchise isabella is from the transformers franchise and sweeney is from the blockbuster hit in theaters currently anyone but you     and of course madame webb dakota johnson is from the fifty shades of grey franchise     so together this looks like an a outstanding phenomenal over the top successful combination but it is not it did not make me want more it did not make me want to see this movie again because it was just boring i think overall the film had a lot of potential if it wouldve been written better it could have actually done something     but it was almost 2 hours of straight dialogue flashbacks backandforth is this gonna work or not gonna work and then youre just like im over it when it over and do not wait there are no end credit scenes
Feb 16 2024,positive,better than everybody said
Feb 16 2024,positive,it doesnt deserve 5 stars but it also doesnt deserve 13 so i will give it 5 stars to up the rating even it out
Feb 16 2024,positive,madame web is an enjoyable  good movie despite the tiniest flaws it has but other than that i enjoyed it very much
Feb 16 2024,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen by a landslide congrats to everyone involved for not caring even a single bit about the final result love
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was a good movie 810 i think it told the story well and had a lot of interesting scenes some cringy moments but with the dialogue otherwise great 
Feb 16 2024,negative,you ever wonder what its like to shove razors in your eyeslook no further not even spiderman could save this movie best way to watch is with the projector turned off
Feb 16 2024,positive,my daughter and i loved it looking forward to the next one in the series
Feb 16 2024,positive,it really caught me it has a lot of easter eggs i really liked it
Feb 16 2024,positive,was surprised by this movie alot better than what i expected and good character development
Feb 16 2024,negative,i came into this being optimistic because i heard it was bad man were they right the plot is all over the place there are many inconsistencies that go unaddressed the dialogue is abysmal and dont even get me started on the delayed poorly dubbed voiceovers from the villain character they spend a lot of time trying to force the fact that youre  in the year 2003 while the characters and technology tell me they are far into the 2020s there was no care or thought put into this movie and any idea anyone had im sure they approved on the spot oh and lets not even mention the fact that the 3 girls never get any powers and arent in their costumes for more than 2 minutes total very bad you should all be ashamed
Feb 16 2024,positive,a fun movie felt like a brief introduction with more to come
Feb 16 2024,positive,i thought its going to be a bad movie i was wrongi hope they make a part 2 with more action
Feb 16 2024,positive,madame web starts off weak with its pacing but comes back strong and resolves some of its major issues this film still has its occasional struggles with cgi but what super hero movie doesnt have that there are some corny lines and some really interesting acting choices but with this being said the movie is not that bad this movie comes back strong after some of its struggles and creates a fun and interesting story with a nice premise to the introduction of madame web and the beginning of a possible liveaction spiderverse film series this is not a spiderman film there is not action in the sense like a spiderman film so please do not come into this thinking their is going to be intense action but the action that is there works well for this movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,this has got to be worst film of the year and we already at the start of the year were only in february but hey that is where hollywood puts the worst films of the years that they want to get out of the way
Feb 16 2024,positive,awesome incredibleand best storyline
Feb 16 2024,positive,i didnt think it was as awful as others did i thought the girl power comradery was better than the forced one in avengers endgame trust me i dont mean the movie was as good dakota johnson was very good in it i did expect to see more of the supporting cast as the superheroes they would become but i guess this was intended to be a setup movie 3 12 stars feels right to me
Feb 16 2024,negative,im positive tahar adims lines were all done via adr very disappointed with the film the cast is wasted with a muddled script
Feb 16 2024,negative,i just dont understand why they made it the way they did feels like a 90s comic book attempt but with a cringey story its absolutely meaningless and has no reason to exist in the marvel universe sony needs to give it up in general
Feb 16 2024,negative,very juvenile bad plot bad acting i didnt  lose any brain cells trying to figure out or follow the plot teenagers will like this
Feb 16 2024,negative,it was boring there are good moments but none memorable
Feb 16 2024,neutral,storyline and character development was so rushed didnt blow my mind its a shame especially coming from marvel as producers
Feb 16 2024,negative,just when i think hollywood cant get any lower they go and totally blow me away if i could give negative stars i would you have to listen to dakotas interviews for this film to truly understand that no one here has any idea how to make a super hero movie she literally said she would do anything to play a role after stating she has never watched even a marvel movie the director and writers have produced garbage and i cant believe they keep getting paid to do this please go on strike again we were much happier
Feb 16 2024,negative,couldnt stand this movie absolutely terrible from start to when i left didnt even watch the whole movie the writing was terrible the cgi was dreadful this isnt even laughable bad this was shocking and shouldnt be aloud to be called a film
Feb 16 2024,negative,nonsensical plot pointless spiderman references which are never paid off that awful afro terrible writing naf sfxwhy did we need this
Feb 16 2024,positive,truly one of the movies of all time madame web is a true masterpiece dethrones morbius as one of the worst sony verse films of all time 1010
Feb 16 2024,negative,an average flick  not great but watchable
Feb 16 2024,negative,weak in most regards the best part was ben  cassies conversations which added some dry wit to an otherwise dry boring and unexciting movie  the plot wasnt interesting as it went through its tired backstory and moral sections the villain was dull and didnt exude any menace and most of the dialogue was awkward and delivered poorly  the action scenes and special effects looked cheap the costumes at the end looked ridiculous and overall it lacked any charm or thrills
Feb 16 2024,negative,how did this movie get made its so bad its not even like funny bad just bad bad
Feb 16 2024,negative,one of the worst marvel movies ever so many plot holes and why to much foreshadowing with all the weblike things really dont know where marvel whats to go with all of this
Feb 16 2024,negative,what a waste of my 2 hrs indeed rotten poor execution poor dialogues extremely poorly excecuted action   story i realkt dont recommend this movie and should be voted as the worst marvelsony movie of all time if someone really wanted to have a super hero movie this was not it
Feb 16 2024,negative,it madame webbing time  to flop  hard
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was different not the classic superheroe movie there was no need to invest a lot money maybe it was not the best but you didnt spend an amount similar to ant man 3
Feb 16 2024,negative,marvel movies these days are such a bore and have completely lost their charm
Feb 16 2024,positive,i was pleasantly surprised i knew the reception was a mixed bag but oh my i felt so much nostalgia watching this it was the older style of superhero movies similar to first spiderman versions  without big bad wanting to rule the world without fights blown out of proportions and without unrealistic hyper powers that makes characters boring and i liked all female characters  very relatable and likable
Feb 16 2024,positive,different and it was good
Feb 16 2024,negative,ummmmmm dons daughter is vapid but still somewhat pretty and sydney is uglified so shes not prettier than dons daughter dumb story bad acting too long and what is this anyway the spiderman madame web was an old lady run away dont spend any of your money watching this
Feb 16 2024,negative,do not watch this film the films general look looked like it was filmed as a tv series spliced into a movie most of the scenes didnt make sense ie i am going to train you to harness your powers then cuts back to queens and suddenly is an expert in powers acting and choices of actors actresses were terrible the spider verse is ruined and sony need to sell all the rights of their marvel to disney please stop making shoddy associated marvel films again do not waste your time seeing this film
Feb 16 2024,negative,what fuck this please sony no no this its dont real
Feb 16 2024,negative,stan lee would be ashamed  do not i repeat do not go see this film  hands down the worst film i have ever seen in my life  sony please sell  the rights to disney marvel  or let me blipped back to yesterday and have not seen the movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,absolutely abysmal movie cw quality acting combined with a nonsensical script horrific writing and mailed in acting performances i have never given a movie a half star but this movie deserved none it was sloppy and thrown together and made exclusively for teenage girls with no thought whatsoever for the comic book fans
Feb 16 2024,negative,crapfest that is madame web
Feb 16 2024,negative,what the f was that
Feb 16 2024,negative,ill keep this as spoiler free as i could but i will say it is a bad film but is it the worst superhero film of all time  i mean this one is your average bad like say thor dark world bad  a couple of the scenes does feel like an actual madame web movie while the rest feels more of a terminator or even a final destination movie as a whole  the performance were actually not bad except for the villain who does it way too hard as the setting goes especially when the central characters shouldve been both cassie and ezekiel  the rest were more addins as i can say  actually i remember seeing an interview about a script before it was scrapped and they made a new one  in all honestly i can only feel sorry for the director and the performers as they did point out before this movies release  410
Feb 16 2024,negative,this the most horrible superhero movie i have ever seenthis is a disgrace to spidermanthe dialogue is awful cgi is horrible and is extremely boringhow can you call this a superhero movie with no super powers or fight scenesnot a single one of the fight the main villain  they dont even throw a punchthe suits that you seen in the all the marketing are barely shown in the last 2 min of the movieeveryone who saw this and thought this was a good should be ashamedwhy are there so many references to spidermanpeter if they wont use him in the futuresony why are you scared to make your characters say the name peter this is horrible i would give this film a zero if i could
Feb 16 2024,positive,not the worst movie of all time but couldve been better wonder what the future is for it
Feb 16 2024,negative,i was unable to go watch the film due to being sick and couldnt receive any type of refund
Feb 16 2024,positive,expected better story dragged a bit and the cast was just boring
Feb 16 2024,negative,madame web achieved the impossible being worse than catwoman and fantastic four 2015
Feb 16 2024,negative,i would have had a better time setting my money on fire
Feb 16 2024,negative,at 26 i have finally checked out of all marvel and star wars movies sad
Feb 16 2024,positive,i liked it pretty understandable plot fun to watch
Feb 16 2024,negative,i was expecting some top tier so bad its good hate watching but this movie was just bad i love sydney sweeney emma roberts and adam scott and i am excited for isabela merced and celeste oconnors future projects ive only seen dakota johnson in the social network but my friends say shes a good actress despite all this theyre all awful in this movie and they are not helped by the script costuming lighting directing or scoresound design
Feb 16 2024,negative,this is not a spider man environment  this is not comics super heroes movie  do not go to theaters  get from internet and watch at home 
Feb 16 2024,positive,ouch that average rating im not going to lie though i genuinely had a fun time watching madame web perhaps i should be keeping that fact quiet    i dont know what to say i found it to be suitably entertaining im sure there are plot holes aplenty i noticed a few and it probably makes zero senseisnt a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty i dont care it gave me enough enjoyment that i wasnt questioning anything about what i was watching    the cast are probably the key factors as to why i did enjoy this i previously knew of dakota johnson but hadnt actually seen her in anything properly i found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly the trio of sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor are positives too    tahar rahims antagonist meanwhile is poorly written and portrayed though i personally thought the actor did a good job i have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest away from them the pacing and score are also standouts    in my recollection of viewing this i truthfully havent got any issues with it if it wasnt for the slight bad murmurs that i did hear about prewatch though not much of it as i avoid as much as i can with movies and the reaction on sites like this postwatch id not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever    as i always say to each their own for me gimme a sequel as long as the cast remain mind not even sorry
Feb 16 2024,positive,good movie in general good performances by the 4 protagonists interesting plot good origin movie of madame web i liked that they linked this movie with the birth of peter parker
Feb 16 2024,negative,this is almost so bad that its good level but its not its just bad i feel sorry for dakota johnson who i really like  literally the reason she had fired her agent is the embarrassment of being in this movie its a thing you can google it
Feb 16 2024,negative,kindly save your time and money
Feb 16 2024,negative,as a longtime fan of superhero movies i was genuinely excited to see madame web hit the big screen however after enduring what felt like an eternity in the theater i left feeling utterly let down and unsatisfied    where do i even begin with this cinematic disaster lets start with the plotor lack thereof its as if the writers threw together a mishmash of random ideas and hoped for the best theres no coherent storyline to follow leaving audiences scratching their heads in confusion rather than being engaged in the narrative    and dont even get me started on the character development or lack thereof madame web herself is a onedimensional bore lacking any depth or complexity instead of a strong compelling protagonist were left with a cardboard cutout who fails to elicit any emotional investment from the audience    the dialogue is equally cringeworthy filled with clich√©s and uninspired exchanges that had me rolling my eyes in disbelief its almost as if the script was written by a middle schooler attempting their first fan fiction rather than seasoned professionals tasked with bringing a beloved character to life    but perhaps the most unforgivable sin of madame web is its utter disregard for continuity and respect for the source material diehard fans of the comics will be left fuming at the liberties taken with the story and characters with key elements either altered beyond recognition or simply ignored altogether    to add insult to injury the films special effects are laughably bad reminiscent of something youd see in a lowbudget madefortv movie from the 90s its clear that no expense was spared in cutting corners resulting in a visual experience that fails to impress on any level    in conclusion madame web is a colossal failure in every sense of the word save your time and money and steer clear of this cinematic train wreck its a shameless cash grab that does a disservice to both its source material and its audience consider yourself warned
Feb 16 2024,positive,do the critics get paid to give crappie reviews the film is not the best marvel film i have seen and it is not typical however i really enjoyed the film go make your own mind up  and go and see the film
Feb 16 2024,negative,my expectations were pretty low and it met them
Feb 16 2024,negative,worst marvel movie out there previews were better than the actual movie i recommend not to waste your money seeing this movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,againwokewhen is hollywood going to wake up horrible
Feb 16 2024,negative,only reason i paid to see this was so i could verify myself how bad it was i mean in the movie   they only showed about 3 minutes of screen time of the chracters in suit what kind of super hero movie does that the only reason morbius was slightly better is because they had some decent easter eggs sony just needs to stop expanding the spider man universe without spider man sad to see how far marvel movies have fallen since endgame my final saying will be that this is the final nail in the coffin for sonys marvel universe im not wasting my money to go see kraven
Feb 16 2024,positive,much better than anticipated well paced and credible performances
Feb 16 2024,negative,it was one of my least favorite films in a very long time i actually considered leaving before the movie finished
Feb 16 2024,negative,terrible bad dialogue writing editing and references it is laughably bad and somehow worse than morbius how do they manage to make these movies worse and worse an overall disaster
Feb 16 2024,negative,the edting pacing and cinematography are atrocious this is completely incoherent at certain points and alternates between boredom adn convuluted scenes that make no sense the acting is terrible filled with clunky dialouge generic side characters that all blend in together a subpar villian and dakota johnson half the time acting like she could care less the music is ok i guess though the pepsi fight at the end is so bad it shouldve been a super bowl commerical and it cant be stated enough how truly unfollowable this gets the story straight up doesnt make sense at certain times the cgi is atrocious the uncle ben age is so weird and bizarre you could spend hours trying to figure that out the ambulance scene is unintentionally hilarious this is edited at points like its trying to be a psychological horror movie from the 00s and boy does it succeed in terms of quality skip this completely this is truly one of the worst superhero movies ever made it really is that bad
Feb 16 2024,negative,i was a model foster kid i peed outside and everything      actual line reading from madame web every creative decision was incorrect its honestly incredible how this tire fire unfolded
Feb 16 2024,negative,just when you thought that the dei  wokies couldnt go any lower    if a spider crawled up the bung hole of shehulk and then was sharted out at the speed of sound against a brick wall now that would be a proper representation of madame web
Feb 16 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie i had never heard of this character before
Feb 16 2024,negative,actually the worst super hero movie in recent memory the writing was some of the worst ive seen and did not make any sense throughout all 2 hours of horrible acting by everyone involved not once was i able to even act like the movie interested me the script felt like it was written by 4 people who did not share what the other had written until the last day of shooting   horrendous
Feb 16 2024,positive,so good  unexpected
Feb 16 2024,negative,the room was better
Feb 16 2024,negative,there are no words to describe how awful this movie was the story line made no sense whatsoever the action was dumb and senseless  it got to the point where it was obvious that dakota johnson and sydney sweeney knew its a bad movie during filming and they just give up half the time they just read their lines without any emotion whatsoever   i will be the one to say it  i actually liked morbius better than this and thats not saying much at all
Feb 16 2024,negative,absolutely horrible dialog so many plot holes and cardboard acting
Feb 16 2024,negative,once again marvel really did die after endgame this movie is exactly whats wrong with hollywood
Feb 16 2024,positive,awesome fun movie dont listen to critics
Feb 16 2024,negative,i want to rate zero but i cant
Feb 16 2024,positive,its a great beginning movie  girls sticking together and fighting for themselves   must see
Feb 16 2024,negative,is this supposed to be a movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,at no point was this movie even remotely entertaining not even for this nerd who loves deep cut comic book lore there is none unless you count cassandras cringe worthy glassware at the end i can even get past the terrible writing if the action was good but madame web is incredibly boring anything interesting in the trailer flashes by in an instant when watching the full film the finale is very choppy and the only payoff is seeing cassandra blind in a wheelchair which to be fair is actually comic book accurate lol
Feb 16 2024,negative,where was this movie going  past present or future hopefully they  dont see deadpool coming for them
Feb 16 2024,positive,honestly it was the best setup for a prequel of spiderman i felt like seeing the story  before his time  and can make the connection between the two story  i think people want to say it is bad  just because others are saying so  or they want to hate on sony but it was even better then morbius to be honest  the movie was simple it reminds e a little bit of the sam raimi spiderman  and also a lot of elder people where commenting  come on this is a pg 13 movie  we enjoy it  superhero movie for teenagers  let us comment and say if it is good or  not  maybe you were expecting a big clash ect  but the storyline was perfect  whoever wrote it did a good job at maintaining the connection of the real spiderman in the mvoie  while the other movies as morbius and venom kind of cut it out  and in my head i can already imagine madame web meeting the real spiderman  and imagine the real crossover but the story would have to be perfect  not just a simple movie where you put a bunch of character  come on guys  give it a chance and watch the movie again  and while watching it  try to imagine the first spiderman 
Feb 16 2024,negative,another pile of doodoo from fallingwood
Feb 16 2024,negative,please stop  make marvel great again
Feb 16 2024,negative,waste of time couldnt even justify its existence
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was a fun watch definitely a pg13 movie with a few cheesy linesactions but overall a fun watch i loved that it didnt focus entirely on the superhero aspect and was more of an origin story
Feb 16 2024,positive,madame web is not the disaster she is labeling her   okay its not a movie either  even so its a film with an interesting story that i at least understood why the character doesnt like spiderman in the future and at least in this film she mentions the neighborhood friend in brief indirect moments   the performances are very cool and even though the villain is a bit generic at the beginning in the end he ends up becoming a typical villain of the universe even miranhas   but even so these ignorant critics who say they understand films but dont even delve into the material from which the idea of making a cinematographic work about a certain character originated so they keep talking nonsense just because they didnt understand parts of the film   its the little people wanting to throw rocks just because of the female protagonism and the marvetes defecating through their mouths just because some dont know the character or those who want loyalty to the comics blahblahblah
Feb 16 2024,negative,definitely some fun moments but the writing is pretty bad and some of the plot holes are ridiculous
Feb 16 2024,positive,felt just like a pre mcu super hero flick period appropriate even  disappointed its just a one off but it was a good time definitely worth the ticket
Feb 16 2024,negative,as bad as youve heard i was hoping for much better given sonys venom films and the upcoming kraven the hunter just wait until its out on a streaming site its not worth a trip to the cinema
Feb 16 2024,negative,sony stop making marvel movies
Feb 16 2024,positive,i dont understand where these criticisms come from the story may be simple and the idea for the script is welldone but its a piece of good oldstyle cinema comic book fans should be happy i highly recommend watching the show to form your own opinion
Feb 16 2024,negative,honestly the movie was awful i didnt expect too much but dakota johnson is just a terrible actress if the role went to any other female it might have been ok she lacks character and is boring to listen to and watch
Feb 16 2024,negative,the name of the film should be ambulance driver fights over food with other girls
Feb 16 2024,negative,madame web was surely one of the movies that sony had made in their criticly reviewed universe they surely can make movies    the villain is an antagonist and the main character and the side characters are protagonists  cant wait to not see this at the oscars
Feb 16 2024,negative,the first half of the movie was hard to follow and had very bad dialogue every time we are introduced to a character there is no way to connect or even see relevance in relation to the plot the villain doesnt seem to have motive besides being strong and its very boring when the main character finds the girls the whole thing with her vision is visually very unappealing and disorienting every camera angle had to be weird and distorted and they could have gotten the same point across with less of a migraine like i said before the characters werw barely introduced and explained so by the climax of the movie i felt i had no need to see the ending i already knew what would happen i would not recommend anyone watch this movie the worst part is it had so much potential to be interesting and captivating but instead they wanted to focus on bad jokes and dialogue
Feb 16 2024,negative,they really messed up a character with so much potential
Feb 16 2024,negative,greys anatomy purinho
Feb 16 2024,positive,really enjoyable plenty of the same tropes as other hero movies and thats what i wanted from it  100 here for the sonyverse continuing hope we do get that sinister six and that these gals make an appearance
Feb 16 2024,positive,the movie wasnt bad the ending was just the intl bad part and like little things such has things i was hoping to see more when i saw the trailer but really it was terrible how people are defining it it was a fun nice watch
Feb 16 2024,negative,madame web the latest addition to sonys spiderman universe spins a web of confusion and disappointment from start to finish
Feb 16 2024,negative,a disjointed movie lacking connection in the story line  the superpower of the villain is sometimes strong sometimes weak  the films effects are also very bad
Feb 16 2024,negative,i wish i could give it zero stars no clue why they made that movie there was no action at all the villian was lame and the acting was cheesy definitely a huge l for sony
Feb 16 2024,neutral,movie wasnt as action packed as they say  could have been better 25 stars
Feb 16 2024,negative,how could this been approved for the big screen directors and staff are using to much drugs to think this was even a bare minimum acceptable    better go back home and rewatch 50 shades    cinema is dead
Feb 16 2024,negative,mid was all running away from a fight and no action at all
Feb 16 2024,negative,i cannot believe this movie was made let alone released sony you should be embarrassed and youre going to release kraven after this unreal
Feb 16 2024,positive,i enjoyed this one despite of the plot holes i went in not expecting too much and came out satisfied
Feb 16 2024,negative,it was so bad i almost liked it but not for any of the reasons the director would like
Feb 16 2024,neutral,not bad but not amazing either and very forgetable would have been better as a tv movie
Feb 16 2024,positive,the movie was perfection until the end ending felt rushed and should have gone a different route however it was an amazing origin story fans need to stop holding all super hero movies to the avengers infinity saga standard and appreciate a good comic movie when they see one
Feb 16 2024,negative,i cant think of positives to continue
Feb 16 2024,positive,the most important movie of all time
Feb 16 2024,positive,good movie not the best not the worse see it youserlf i passed a good time seeing this
Feb 16 2024,negative,pretty terrible lots of questions that just never get answered and sydney sweeney is 26 year old vixen ffs playing a minor 
Feb 16 2024,positive,absaloute best movie ive seen in a long time very exicited to see some new spiderman content hoghly recomended
Feb 16 2024,negative,madame web creates an action movie with no action  even worse how about an origin story about superheroes that never get their superpowers      madame web is probably the worst superhero movie created to date with dialogue so clunky that the main bad guy seems to be voiceover dubbed  does this actor not speak english  90 of his lines are given with his back to the camera probably because the dubbing isnt even that good zero stars if i could
Feb 16 2024,positive,i dont understand why people hate this movie i get it that this is not like the other marvell movie but i love that its an easy movie and happy ending
Feb 16 2024,negative,this movie made the wiggles look like a cinematic masterpiece what was this
Feb 16 2024,negative,wow just wow  they did the i mpossible they made a worst movie than morbius
Feb 16 2024,positive,the concept is great and the performances are brilliant its webbing time
Feb 16 2024,negative,oof this was this was definitely not good enough for the price i no longer have any hopes for deadpool3 being good this made me want a refund its like i dont even mind it wasnt a superhero movie but at least make it a movie something interesting god had to walk out of the theater not soon enough
Feb 16 2024,negative,this was such an excruciatingly bad and boring movie i walked out an hour or so into the movie and just looked up the ending at home and nothing interesting happened they probably shouldve passed on this one
Feb 16 2024,positive,if you are expecting a traditional super hero movie this isnt it this has more of a thriller vibe with a dash of super aspects very much so an origin story it was a good movie but not great it did serve its purpose though of what the director was aiming for movie was set in 2003 and felt like it was filmed in 2003 but not in a bad way more so a creative way
Feb 16 2024,negative,it had the potential to be really good it had a unique premise with a lot of opportunities but the acting and writing was just so bland the main actresses moods had a range of charmingly fond to vaguely frustrated the villain was so monotone and gravelly and the lines sounded like they came out of a fortune cookie    at least the main point of the movie the visions of the future were well done and fun to watch i loved how having a superhero with no combat abilities forced her to get super creative and the final fight was probably the most fun ive had in a superhero movie in years it was a snapshot into what a great movie this could have been if the parts were recast and they got a better writers room
Feb 16 2024,positive,no end credits  it was at least better than the marvels i think
Feb 16 2024,negative,its extremely bad  its a sin to watch this movie  worst movie of altime
Feb 16 2024,neutral,this is a spiderman spin off what now this isnt madame web this is little girl string
Feb 16 2024,negative,the best part of this movie is that it ended i couldnt think of a single redeeming feature of the film    i really really feel sorry for the actors who were dragged into this probably blindsided by their agents    on top of this the best acting was dakota telling us wed want to see it twice    the story is all over the place the acting was uninspired and dialog and directing was terrible and the product placement being forced down your throat was an absolute terrible experience however it feels like they knew it would be a flop in the box offices so they sold it out to whomever they could    do not watch
Feb 16 2024,positive,very good movie based on narrative visual effects soundtrack and character development 
Feb 16 2024,negative,youll have a better time watching diarrhea in slow motion a lot of bots in the reviews giving it 5 stars one person called it amazing and i think this is the fault of the american education system
Feb 16 2024,negative,madame web is possibly one of the worst sonymarvel based superheroes i have ever watched    with poor to mediocre performances from its cast choppy editing shots and poorly executed dialogue underwhelming characters a soulless and messy script boring plot and little action sequences not even dakota johnson could do anything to prevent madame web from being an absolute disaster
Feb 16 2024,negative,the only redeemable thing is the battle but the villain has very little substance his suit looks like something out of another movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,50 shades of spiderman its just hard to get past what a terrible actress dakota johnson is everybody else is believable in their roles then dakota wanders on screen like somebody who snuck on the set when she talks all we hear is im acting im acting my mom and dad got me this role crikey shes bad the extras in the background pretending to talk are better actors as one critic noted its the tofu of spiderman movies
Feb 16 2024,positive,i might be going against the flow here but it was refreshing to me to watch a superhero movie with good acting less green screen and focused on relationship development were those the best characters to add from the spidey universe i dont know but the film was reminiscent of the older superhero movies that focused a lot on the human side of those heroes as well the villain was a bit weak but i also dont believe this was about him anyway    well i left the session very pleased the downside for me were actually the couple of cgi scenes in the movie but they were also not long
Feb 16 2024,negative,dialogue that of a power ranger episode every cliche evil villain phrase check marked   just all around very corny it feels like they couldve got away with this in early 90s but not now dontwasteyourmoneyortime
Feb 16 2024,negative,this is not a movie that should be released in the cinema  please refund me my 5 sony or even better if you leave this spiderman character to marvel my childhood was hampered by this movie 
Feb 16 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie another movie highly criticized
Feb 16 2024,positive,it could have been worse what people sometimes expect from the superhero genre is frustrating dakota saving the movie although i missed some connection to a universe but its watchable
Feb 16 2024,positive,it had some good moments but really needed more plotcharacter development why were the mother and the evil bad guy wanting spiders so bad why didnt the tree spider people stop him back at the beginning why did spiders give you these various powers acting was good the action scenes were ok but all in all it seemed a bit disjointed
Feb 16 2024,negative,absolutely horrendous movie save your money the most notable thing was the in your face soft drink product placement even then i dont like pepsi much prefer coca cola  seriously i really thought things couldnt get worse but they did its very nice to see the critics being honest for a change
Feb 16 2024,negative,what happened here terrible
Feb 16 2024,negative,no literally it passed the timesony do better
Feb 16 2024,negative,things went a little bit too far with this movie wait for this one to be free on streaming and then see it sony has not learned any lessons on movie making
Feb 16 2024,positive,the movie was awesome its the beginning of spider girls i cant wait to see the new movies in the future loved it
Feb 16 2024,positive,not the best movie ever created but certainly not the worst it was better than venom 2 for sure i learned about the character thought it was a good popcorn movie and would like to see it get a sequel people who lambasted this film are either paid to do so or just arent very inceptive to new ideas and characters 
Feb 16 2024,positive,a different kind of super hero movie a different kind of story great exhibition by dakota johnson hope to see a sequel
Feb 16 2024,negative,this just isnt a hero movie
Feb 16 2024,positive,morbinamenal a summer movie during winter oh what blockbuster fun they actually did the thing where they brought the morbengers together to defeat the evil and conniving morb it was morrific and i highly recommend everyone watches this master class in film production this is what the movies are all about
Feb 16 2024,positive,lots of fun considering the characters arent super well known
Feb 16 2024,positive,the movie was great my only gripe was that didnt have enough spiders suites for me but action was good story line was decent worth going to the movies and giving it your support
Feb 16 2024,negative,i wanted to like it i go into all movies to see it for myself i dont just go by what the critics say  but right from the beginning this movie felt awkward it couldnt get out of its own way i like dakota johnson but she wasnt right for this casting its was painfully bad cringy bad story  bad casting  bad editing i lasted 45 minutes 
Feb 16 2024,negative,the worst superhero movies ive ever seen the script is ridiculous  it tries everything and delivers nothing entertaining
Feb 16 2024,negative,for a thousand different reasons one of the worst movies ive ever seen easily the worst writing ive seen and ive seen the room twice
Feb 16 2024,negative,awful i think the writers may have been on a secret strike
Feb 16 2024,positive,madame web was decent  started off kind different knowing it was a marvel movie i expected a little more in depth meat to the movie the film did ok  it did not explain a couple of things at the end i knew i seen the movie on tv as a cartoon as a child
Feb 16 2024,negative,it was bad movie very upset 
Feb 16 2024,positive,if it was a tv show pilot it would be 8 out if 10 as a theatre movie its a 60 at best its not near as bad as people say it is much better then fantastic 4 by mr trank its a touch better then morbius also not as corny the budget seemed low if it was over 50 million then someone is laundering money its worth seeing on tv
Feb 16 2024,negative,i really wanted to like this film but unfortunately my eyes and ears work so i just couldnt    right away the forced ben parker connection felt just that  forced it was a needless tiein that did nothing for the story and while were talking storywhat the actual f there is no real story     im a longtime spiderman comic collector reader and watcher and the changing of cassandras character is another sony fail im sure they couldnt call her a mutant bc marvel owns that somehow but the entire jungle and spider bite thing just doesnt work what else doesnt work  well everything tbh     the cinematography and direction seem to be at a tv movie level from the 90s  even the actors i typically enjoy dakota johnson  sydney sweeney seemed to phone in their performances the only actors who brought anything to the table were adam scott  emma roberts who was weirdly cast as mary parker but okay     overall this film further solidifies that sony have zero idea with what to do with spiderman characters and i am now genuinely afraid for the upcoming kraven the hunter film bc this film left me longing for the tortured cinematic disaster of morbius and more morbin time rather than sitting through another uninspired minute of the female led cast that failed to deliver on any level
Feb 16 2024,positive,i liked this movie the first half you can laugh at but the second half is fun and the acting from sydney sweeney and dakota johnson was good
Feb 16 2024,positive,funny good balance of story and action solid movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,just the worst it doesnt deserve more than that
Feb 16 2024,negative,pointless and sloppy keeping the spiderman title and money are the only reason this was released praying they give the title to disney for good
Feb 16 2024,positive,i actually enjoyed watching this movie allot i know it wasnt endgame level good but its a average movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,the first 23 of this movie are absolutely fine nothing good or bad besides a very forgettable villain with a generic bad guy voice and obviously adrd lines     the final 13 of the movie is like the people behind the movie just went she has vague future sight powers well thats not visually interesting lets add to this power set and make it very bad the epilogue only makes things worse    theres also no postcredit scene so if youre curious you can leave asap
Feb 16 2024,negative,madame web is a subpar superhero feature failed by its clunky and messy execution
Feb 16 2024,positive,had a ball loved the story and characters in it very different goes against the grain a good thing dakota was brilliant
Feb 16 2024,positive,it really wasnt as bad people were making out in the initial reviews it was a fun movie like movies should be
Feb 16 2024,negative,its just a boring movie so much potential totally wasted on a boring movie  boring plot  boring dialogs  boring action  boring boring
Feb 16 2024,positive,i like the superhero movies the origin stories so i like the movie very much except some of the cgi works but it can be overlooked this was a beginning so i am looking forward to another part
Feb 16 2024,positive,i really love the movie it was very good action a lot of action through it so hopefully theyre make another one is it very different to the spiderman movie i liked it if you like marvel go to see it if you dont like marvel dont go see it thats my opinion
Feb 16 2024,positive,absolute stunning to see these 4 girls outstanding performances love the way they introduce the background story of madame web
Feb 16 2024,negative,puff   it is very strange indeed    its not the fault of the actresses its the script and the trailer is a big rip off everything they show there is just the interesting stuff too much comedy added  you can tell its marvel 20  and again i repeat its very strange    and also when something interesting happens it doesnt last at all    it happens all too fast even if they should improve the movie it would need more length and better explained    and not be so boring    i wouldnt even give it a 510    its more like a 210
Feb 16 2024,negative,i really wanted to like this movie dakota johnson is a likeable actress but unfortunately it is the only thing that webs this film together messy editing poor dialogue predictable writing and underwhelming performances by supporting actors passed the time but stretched for too long of what could have been an entertaining film with intriguing components
Feb 16 2024,positive,yall are insane if you think madame web is bad i just saw it the movie is good yeah its not endgame level good but all you marvel and marvelsony fans just remember its a average movie not a fucking 500m budget movie and for what we got i thought it was pretty good and with the visuals i reckon they were pretty close to being loki season 2 finales visuals
Feb 16 2024,negative,only because of dakata johnson otherwise 0 star from me
Feb 16 2024,positive,1 people need to realize this that marvel didnt make this movie sony did   2 i enjoyed the movie i was never bored or confused i laughed at the jokes and i thought dakota did a great job with what she was given   3 the villain voice actor was distracting i dont know if its his voice or someone else but all of his dialogue acting was bad   4 the plot was good but some of the dialogue towards the last third of the movie was cheesy and too much saying whats happening rather than showing whats happening   5 so overall better castingsound editing  on the villain and better dialogue during the serious parts of the film would have made this a 5 star
Feb 16 2024,negative,jeez erm some positives first     right now the positives are all listed we can get on with the negatives but roll them all up in to a neat bow by saying  this is awful   this is worse that ff4 worse than morbius dont waste your time
Feb 16 2024,positive,the action was pretty good
Feb 16 2024,negative,people giving this anything more than 2 stars are mentally ill this is a garbage film atrocious acting laughable plot and completely void of any point in existing who wanted this sony has got to be the most out of touch studio of all time do not support this abysmal movie 
Feb 16 2024,negative,most boring and pointless movie ive ever seen acting was horrendous script was laughably dull and dont even get me started on the effects if youre going to watch a movie pick literally anything other than this
Feb 16 2024,negative,just why this movie was awful the idea was awful everything about it was awful
Feb 16 2024,positive,i dont know what everyones problem is i thought it was a great movie what did you guys expect honestly the scenes are amazing and the bond three girls and madam webb build throughout the movie was beautiful and had me crying but i guess most people nowadays dont care about that kind of stuff right you guys dont care about love or being positive which anyone who disliked this movie definitely does not have love or compassion for others and just takes daytoday life for granted until something tragic happens in your life i dont know why alot of people live like that but im the one who doesnt and despite the mental health i have and what im going through and how most days i dont even want to get out of bed i still am the kind of person who always asks someone how theyre doing or how their day is going i mean i literally talked to a few staff in the theater and ask them that because its called being considerate and caring of others besides yourself and thats how im always able to connect with a lot of people again anyone who disliked the movie is wrong this movie was amazing in my book and i hope they make a madame web 2 
Feb 16 2024,positive,people are so hard to please this movie was good dont go into it expecting it to link to spiderman and take it for what it is and youll enjoy it just fine
Feb 16 2024,negative,nepotism is going to sink hollywood if it isnt careful they should consider giving opportunities to people with talent and training for a change
Feb 16 2024,positive,i really enjoyed madame web and hope to see her spiderling saga continue it was interesting to see a new and far more intuitive superhero and one who foster children and those who have lost a parent young can relate to madame web is a unique glimpse into a maternal instinctdriven character who embodies female empowerment and leans into an extrasensory perception that otherwise might be dismissed it seems like a fragile ability that can only do so much still when cassie begins to connect with her inner self and revelations about pain and ancestral trauma are laid to rest she becomes a fierce opponent and carries through to shine brilliantly as a victorious protective powerhouse with a soft and golden heart
Feb 16 2024,negative,its hard to make a movie worse than mobius but sony did it  sony is trying to make disney look good with those awfull movies in 2023
Feb 16 2024,positive,i had low expectations but the movie is actually good there story is actually good and there are some really interesting scenes  it had lots of potential but unfortunately they didnt use them all
Feb 16 2024,negative,so bad its fun just to watch how bad it is
Feb 16 2024,positive,i think this movie is fantastic at this point if you expect more from sony then camp pulp garbage slop you are fucking stupid this movie was fine its cheesy and fun at times its kinda of ballsy i really think this movie has potential and a sequel would be really good yes i am aware of the bad adr and acting i dont give a fuck
Feb 16 2024,positive,it has a plot hole central conceit so large you could drive webbs ambulance through it but it was a fun watch and added a few nice levels to the spiderverse lore
Feb 16 2024,positive,such a fun watch i really ended up admiring the film for the origin story it is and told us it was going to be everyone should give this film a chance i left the theater wanting more and wishing the film was longer
Feb 16 2024,positive,definitely worth watching again
Feb 16 2024,positive,amazing movie funny plot was great but lets be real its a marvel comic based movie where was the post credits scene
Feb 16 2024,negative,the plot hole was so big optimus prime can drive right thru it without touching either side
Feb 16 2024,positive,the previous marvel movies from 2023 was just bad news but this one it was good not great just good
Feb 16 2024,negative,omggggg i couldnt stand it a went out of the cinema i love dakota but this movie is so boring 
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was an originstory like the old marvelmovies like iron man or spiderman people always cried after this and when it happens they act like thats the worst film ever released
Feb 16 2024,positive,was weird but i enjoyed it dakota is amazing
Feb 16 2024,negative,unexplained characters and story line amazing this was even made
Feb 16 2024,negative,just another total waste of time
Feb 16 2024,negative,title madame web a tangled mess in marvels cinematic universe    in the latest installment of marvels cinematic universe madame web attempts to weave a complex narrative but ends up entangling itself in its own web of confusion and mediocrity despite the anticipation and potential for a deep dive into the mystic and psychic realms of marvel the film disappoints on multiple levels leaving fans bewildered and underwhelmed    the storyline which ambitiously tries to intertwine multiple timelines and dimensions is as clear as mud its evident that the writers attempted to create a rich tapestry of interconnected stories but the execution falls flat leaving the audience more lost than intrigued the plot holes are so vast that not even madame webs psychic abilities could predict where the narrative is headed next    performancewise the cast seems as disoriented by the script as the viewers despite their best efforts their portrayals lack the depth and charisma expected from marvels usually dynamic characters the dialogue intended to be witty and profound often comes across as forced and uninspired missing the mark on both humor and emotional impact    visually the film is a mixed bag while some cgi sequences are impressive others are surprisingly lackluster for marvels high standards breaking the immersion and making it hard to stay engaged in the supposed spectacle the action scenes a staple of superhero movies are oddly paced and choreographed lacking the exhilaration and creativity seen in the franchises better entries    perhaps the most perplexing aspect of madame web is its seeming forgetfulness of what makes marvel movies special heart humor and heroism this film feels like a departure from those principles prioritizing convoluted storytelling over character development and genuine engagement with the audience    in conclusion madame web is a missed opportunity to explore one of marvels most intriguing characters its a bewildering journey through a poorly constructed narrative that even the most loyal of marvel fans might find hard to follow instead of adding a rich layer to the mcu it feels like a detour into mediocrity lets hope future projects can untangle this mess and bring back the magic that fans know and love
Feb 16 2024,negative,one of the absolute worst movies ive ever seen have never felt as if i wasted something as much as the money i spent to go see this
Feb 16 2024,positive,did not deserve the hate if you watch super hero movies its a standard film and was enjoyable are there some immersion and plot issues sure but is it still better than a lot of other films yeah especially most dc and most sony standalone superhero movies
Feb 16 2024,positive,i just loved it stop saying the movie is bad every time theres a movie about a hero girl people started to criticize the movie saying that they cant act the storyis horrible i watch the movie and i love it dakota johnson did a great job celeste o connor did a great job isabela merced did a great job sydney sweeney did a great job and all the rest of the cast so stop saying the movie is bad your expectations are too high for everything i can honestly say that i will go back to the theatre and watch it again   thank u
Feb 16 2024,neutral,weak writing and directing i didnt like that these performers delivered these lines the way they did when in other movies theyve done way better
Feb 16 2024,negative,eh  what was the whole point of this i went into it not expecting to be blown away but hoping it would at least be somewhat enjoyable and it was just so  bland unfortunately dakota johnson just doesnt have the charisma or talent to carry a film and thats just one of the problems with this film video review youtubet4h1htpruxo
Feb 16 2024,negative,forbidden do not even think about going there the absolute worst
Feb 16 2024,positive,i feel like this movie brings out a sense of belonging in between madame web and the girls it is a great movie which i recommend because it is actionpacked and filled  with sequences it may seem a little confusing but you will get the whole storyline
Feb 16 2024,positive,i thought the movie was great gave me a laugh
Feb 16 2024,negative,if we could only see the future to know how awful this movie was not the typical marvel movie very cheesy bad scripting and i think the villain was dubbed or something man i was looking forward to a great movie and this was trash but hey if you have nothing to do and have an unlimited movie pass go see it its hilarious 
Feb 16 2024,positive,just saw madame webb tonight with my best friend we absolutely loved it it was very well done dakota did a great job loved the story and cant wait to see more out of the future superheroes ladies i laughed i cried i was on the edge of my seat i jumped quite a few times and it had some great action scenes it was so good the effects were stellar and the way it was shot was really cool i hope there are more of these madame webb movies very excited to see where the story goes
Feb 16 2024,positive,wasnt as bad as people make it to be i enjoyed it with my kids
Feb 16 2024,positive,such a great movie highly recommend found the movie very interesting cant wait to watch again
Feb 16 2024,negative,madame web introduces a fresh character to the superhero universe but the film itself plays it safe the screenplay offers some decent moments but overall it feels like a missed opportunity theres potential here yet the execution leaves it feeling just okay its still a watchable film if youre a fan of the genre however dont expect a groundbreaking addition to the spiderverse madame web ultimately settles for a predictable formula  dakota johnson delivers a solid performance as cassandra webb but the supporting cast feels underdeveloped the films visuals are occasionally striking but lack the distinct style that could have elevated the material while there are hints of a more compelling story madame web never quite finds its footing
Feb 16 2024,negative,the best part of this movie were easter eggs where it hinted at peter parkers parentsuncle before he was born seeing that connection was cool the acting graphics and camera zoom were pretty bad though definitely a low budget film the actor who was the main villain azekiel was probably the worst actor ive ever seen in a marvel associated film
Feb 16 2024,positive,this is an amazing thrilling film from the beginning to end i was at the edge of my seat it didnt have a boring moment
Feb 16 2024,positive,loved and enjoyed highly recommend it
Feb 16 2024,positive,considering this to be an intro movie it intrigued me on whats to come lacking on the fight scenes because there isnt any real fighting just the 3 girls getting destroyed in potential futures the depiction of the main characters ability to see the future was pretty cool and made up for it overall decent movie with an almost nostalgic feel with its contemporary references
Feb 16 2024,negative,toxic by britney spears was genuinely the only good thing in this movie    also the product placement was craaaazy
Feb 16 2024,neutral,it was kinda boring  i understand its setting a story for her but it could of been better
Feb 16 2024,positive,a solid base for a spiderwoman film franchise enjoyable to hero film looking forward to it exceeding critics expectations and reaching its full potential
Feb 16 2024,negative,it couldve been so much more its time for sony to just call it quits and let marvel take over
Feb 16 2024,negative,red flag  from the start to finish horrible
Feb 16 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie is it mcu nope but it is a good sony movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,the worst movie of all time
Feb 16 2024,negative,this was legitimately one of the worst superhero movies ive ever seen venom and morbius were mediocre but still enjoyable madame web was a disappointment on nearly every level
Feb 16 2024,negative,although the idea of seeing all of these different characters be introduced was exciting the execution was not as someone who loves to see these movies i figured that most of the people saying this movie was bad were exaggeratingthey were not the story is all over the place the characters felt hollow not to mention within an hour the 3 teenage girls are all trauma dumping and completely discrediting their backstories the beginning and end of the movie felt incredibly rushed the editing seemed unfinished and the villain was a generic man who had a bad life i love these actresses and it would have been incredible to see them get to play these characters in full depth not just throwing all of their backstories together in a hope that people would get the full story on them it was incredibly disappointing to watch two hours of absolute confusion and lack of good writing when i was super excited to see these characters be introduced
Feb 16 2024,negative,if madame webs web ties them all id like her web to tie me to the ceiling after watching this movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,decided to watch this movie thinking it was going to be good and was left disappointed the plot of the movie was very hard to follow because of how badly the future scenes were presented sure the movie was trying to confuse the audience which is fine but the creators could have had a much better approach along with all of the problems it felt super rushed and not properly planned the movie had loads of inconsistencies that left the audience feeling dissatisfied
Feb 16 2024,positive,cassie is selfless those who say its a dud or not worth watching clearly do not have a heart     dakota did an amazing job and im ready for the next movie great actress with true emotions
Feb 16 2024,positive,good direction to a more aggressive take of manspider his moves are unmatched by spiderman sadly the ambulance scenes beat the movie then it goes downhill despite the cool action sequences the marvels have to work together without laser beam powers instead of controlling time they can occasionally adapt to the future not as ambitious as the cover poster suggested
Feb 16 2024,negative,sony needs to give up the rights to anything marvel i love everything about marvel this was awful the antagonists words were edited in post making his mouth not match what was being said the storyline didnt make sense and how is peter parker born in 2003 when spider man was released in 2002 also why is ben parker so young in 2003
Feb 16 2024,negative,this movie is a rough one didnt like the villain and i dont blame the actors i blame the writers final fight was best part and even that was lackluster imo something tells me they made this just to keep the rights to the spiderman franchise
Feb 16 2024,negative,badly written poorly executed terrible casting and boring tbh save your money this is not must see marvel
Feb 16 2024,positive,this film is amazing oscar worthy dialogue keeps you gripped the tension keeps building the acting is truly top shelf stuff a triumph i think sj clarkson has a bright career ahead of her after this just as superhero movies are failing to entertain out of the shadows comes madam web it was equivalent to watching endgame and infinity war for the first time watch watch watch
Feb 16 2024,positive,confused on the hate i really enjoyed this movie i really hope they do another dakota was perfect for the role glad i went to see it
Feb 16 2024,positive,i have become a big marvel fan i love the way they are introducing new characters since most of the classic one are getting too old or dying loved the movie it was entertaining for us fun and will keep ok watching all marvel movies
Feb 16 2024,positive,i dont know why people are hating i thought it was a good movie i think a lot of people are giving bad reviews just because sony was involved it could have been better but i want a sequel edit nevermind the last fight was terrible 
Feb 16 2024,negative,man i went in hoping that there would have been some redeeming quality but the wooden acting in the opening scene lived up to the hype i had heard i tried to be interested in the story line just was so tough even morbius was better than this and that is saying something
Feb 16 2024,positive,was a great movie if you seen the preview of it you still want to go see it there so much more not shown on the preview
Feb 16 2024,positive,its not as bad as many people say    there is one thing that really annoyed me the trailer showed action and the presence of 3 spider girls but in the movie there was no such so at some point i felt scammed
Feb 16 2024,positive,ok it wasnt that bad people gotta chill
Feb 16 2024,negative,someone walking out the theater said sharknado was better then this
Feb 16 2024,neutral,it wasnt terrible but it wasnt great a very 5050 movie for me the visual effects were pretty good for mos of the movie the last act was were i felt  the story went off the rails
Feb 16 2024,negative,some cool ideas but really clunky dialog and stilted action
Feb 16 2024,positive,dont listen to the haters this is a scream eat some gummies and laugh
Feb 16 2024,negative,not good  not good at all
Feb 16 2024,negative,this movie is not what i expected i thought it was gonna be action and fighting because of all the trailers ive been seeing on tiktok but in fact its nothing like it would have rather seen it at home than waste money on it
Feb 16 2024,negative,i think the idea for this movie was great but felt it just fell short everywhere to keep it simple i found the actors poor maybe because the dialogue was that bad and they had to work with what they had the plot was choppy and an action movie had like no action didnt need the 3 spiderwomen either wouldve been better if we just focused on ms web
Feb 16 2024,negative,i dont read reviews before i go to a movie but for madame web i wish i had i  havent seen anything else dakota johnson has been in but i get the feeling she was cast because people thinks shes sexy her acting in this movie was like suffering through ten hours of someone scraping their fingernails on a chalkboardthe bad guy     tahar rahims villain was a bad joke    i dont expect masterpieces from movies but this mess didnt even meet my low movie standards of simply being a bit of entertainment away from the house
Feb 16 2024,negative,misleading trailer bad script terrible dialogue bad editing and sound  why did they make this movie
Feb 16 2024,positive,name a better pepsi cola ad you cant
Feb 16 2024,positive,i absolutely adored this movie it had great camera work wonderful score the cast absolutely smashed it it felt so immersive a definite recommend
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was okay but the movie takes place in different universe like we are watching origin story
Feb 16 2024,negative,cheesy and not very marvel
Feb 16 2024,positive,it wasnt as bad as how critics are describing it yes its kind of clickbaity when it comes to the 3 spiderwomen but the title of the movie is madame web and it is her origin story and not of the 3 other girls
Feb 16 2024,negative,admit i knew the tomatometer score before going so i wasnt expecting too much i knew the character from the comics but the one i knew was a wheelchair boundblind old lady so i have no idea how this story is going to work work well not very well not only does this movie have plot hole you can drive a truck through you can sail a cruise ship through them stealing cabs and ambulances i doubt nypd is that cavalier towards these incidents an ending where the ignored semiignored girl the runaway and the illegal alien all get to live with the lady who kidnapped them and now has no visible means of support a forest in new jersey within nearby driving distance 15 hr of queens to be fair the story doesnt get too weird until the second half until then its just an odd origins story where a neardeath experience causes her latent prescient  abilities are activated past that it gets crazy   p2 a5 d3fx6 ev3  38
Feb 16 2024,positive,the movie is very good
Feb 16 2024,negative,this movie gives hot garbage a bad name so many plot holes stupid characters and an incomprehensible story what the hell was that please save yourself the brain cancer and do not go see this movie anyone that likes this drippy scab of a movie is clearly not in the right frame of mind the only thing that kept me sane was the popcorn and soda when i ran out i went to the bathroom for a few minutes just to wash the stank off
Feb 16 2024,negative,i wish i could give it zero stars it was that bad no plot bad dialogue dakota johnson is overrated she has been so bored during press it was obvious she doesnt care total waste of money and time
Feb 16 2024,negative,yeah enhance i cant even make a joke about this one
Feb 16 2024,negative,yet more evidence sony cant recreate the marvel magic and that superhero fatigue is real
Feb 16 2024,positive,i went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised i really enjoyed this i had wondered since this was announced about how this was going to work and they did a pretty good job with a number of aspects of the character some scenes are a amazing the script was pretty bad in places but quite clever in others the cast was great and it was quite tense at times this is way better than people made out i hope we see this character in the next spiderman film
Feb 16 2024,positive,i liked the movie  i understood the plot
Feb 16 2024,negative,this is a low point for humanity
Feb 16 2024,positive,dialogue was not the best but i have faith in the next one
Feb 16 2024,negative,not gonna liethis movie was worse than love and thunder and thats saying something i dont think the right people were cast for the roles and the acting was not it either i hope the next deadpool movie saves marvel
Feb 16 2024,negative,its like they lost their budget and writers halfway through the movie sony needs to sell the rights to disney already and stop milking the franchise
Feb 16 2024,negative,honestly i wanted to like it the acting was obviously bad it almost felt like dakota didnt want to do the movie then she saves the girls then she cant stand them then she wants to teach them then shes like their mother lol the writing was awful lets just say if these writers went on strike id ask for what
Feb 16 2024,negative,came in with low expectations it was worse complete trash  
Feb 16 2024,positive,ok once again my weekly rant about the movie rating system   i think critics and audience reviews should be required to show a ticket stub or something to post a review   i think 75 of audience reviews and 50 of critic reviews dont even see the actual movie   certainly all the negative reviews i have read are not talking about the same movie i just saw    madame web was a very good movie   my only complaint is i wish it was longer especially since all the negative reviews will probably kill the box office and thus scrap the sequel and extended sony universe plans    the movie had a great flow it explained what was going on  it was exciting to see show and tell us how madame web learned to use her powers   i guess honestly the her exploring her powers could have been a little longer thus my comment about it being too short of a movie may be justified   the acting was good the story was good it had a good mix of humor drama and action and it was just a very good entertaining movie
Feb 16 2024,positive,agood detailed beginning to a new series in the mcu
Feb 16 2024,negative,i made an account just to say how bad the writing directing and film was i could of written a better script in a day sony if your hiring im available
Feb 16 2024,positive,a bit slow at times but loved it i cant wait for the next installment well done sonymarvel
Feb 16 2024,positive,i thought is was full of surprises and very entertaining just watch out for the boom
Feb 16 2024,negative,madame web to put it lightly was incredibly boring to give a better understanding it felt like final destination the later films and no aspects of horror to think this was made by sony who has the rights to the spiderman ip this felt like a generic film studio trying to use spiderman esque gimmicks but trying to avoid being sued for copyright infringement even if the studio was unsure which spidermans universe this would take place in what does it hurt to reveal mary parkers babys name or even to hint that uncle ben ben parker is dating someone and they wont even say mays name like huh but enough of that the two portrayals im only going to critique are dakota johnsons and tahar rahims in short the latters portrayal as the main villain ezekiel was so superficial and cw like this was definitely not a movie worthy portrayal more like tv i blame the writing and directing the same goes for dakota johnsons part but man was that some bad acting sony needs to stick to the animated spiderverse films and leave live action to marvel studios
Feb 16 2024,positive,it wasnt a perfect movie but it kept me entertained and it gave off different vibes at times that were all good the story was nice and it has some nice little nods to the spiderman universe the acting was good they could have left a couple things out but it was a lot better than some of the stuff i recently watched from marvel i think only a couple shows and movies from marvel last couple phases were better
Feb 16 2024,negative,this move proves marvel is on a downfall and that only deadpool 3 can revive it
Feb 16 2024,negative,why was this made i want a sequel though just to see how low the ratings can go
Feb 16 2024,positive,when toby maguires spiderman movie came out people didnt liked it when andrew garfields the amazing spiderman movie came out people didnt liked it when tom hollands spiderman homecoming movie came out nobody liked it after some time those movies starting to grow on people and they started to see those movies for what they really are i feel like thats whats happening to madame web right now i enjoyed it i liked it and i would watch it again i understood the plot of the movie the story the visual effects are insane and there was humor i see peter takes after his mom i do wish sony didnt cut the connection between andrews spiderman or even toms but stuff happens im not a director or anything like that i just know what i like and madame web is something i like
Feb 16 2024,negative,i cant wait for the midnight screenings where people throw things at the screen to start
Feb 16 2024,positive,i walked into the spiderweb my spidey senses were going off i walked out of this movie feeling very satisfied loved the webs loved the spiderman costume play i walked out with the peter tingle
Feb 16 2024,positive,madame web was a fun ride for any fan of the spiderverse showcase some lesser known heroes and a wild villian this film was a fun trippy ride the whole way through   with many nods to the comic franchise and the other movies realities mw shos great potential for the future of superhero films i for one hope to see lots of other characters and stories getting a similar treatment in the future
Feb 16 2024,positive,yall are some haters for sure madame web was better than the marvels msmarvel shehulk and morbius the visuals were pretty solid i guess if there was terrible looking blue screen in every shot like a marvel studios movie yall would be drooling over this movie this actually told a cohesive story with tons of heart while you could argue about all the plot points you didnt like all day from a production standpoint its a well made film the cinematography color grade was fantastic the set design actually blended in so well i couldnt tell where the blue screen normally is also i loved the editing surrounding her premonitions the quick paced editing actually moves the movie along quite well curious to see where sony takes these characters next
Feb 16 2024,negative,this is movie was a disaster from start to finish
Feb 16 2024,negative,the villian was a waste of time unforgettable and not likable dakota johnson did the best she could with the script she was given but ultimately was a let down sony needs to step up their game with their next installation otherwise they might have to sell spideran back to disney
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was nice to see a new super hero  however the beginning of the movie was very slow  but it got more exciting in the middle of the movie  dakota johnson did a fairly good job
Feb 16 2024,positive,cant wait for the 2 one
Feb 16 2024,negative,the story feels completely pointless there are hints of plot lines that were originally intended but then abandoned the acting is embarrassingly bad but ill chalk that up to direction and writing because the writing is really really bad    they wanted this early 2000s aesthetic but honestly this all just makes it seem even more like a horrible superhero movie thats actually from that time period daredevil catwoman etc this was just an absolutely despicable movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,the only thing that surprised me in this movie was i didnt need to use my brain to think about what was going to happen next but i knew it its so boring nothing new its like a comic book for 7 year old kids level 2 or 3 reading except the killing part i would rate 0
Feb 16 2024,negative,this movie is so messy and boring
Feb 16 2024,positive,dakota johnson is so good honestly not as bad as people say
Feb 16 2024,positive,the film fulfills its role as entertainment i went to the cinema thinking i was going to find a disaster and it was a great surprise to find madame web the critics are very bitter
Feb 16 2024,positive,movie is great not perfect but great  dont see why so many bad reviews
Feb 16 2024,positive,great movie the acting was outstanding i do believe that this movie was to set up the sequel but would have had liked to have seen the whole crew play a role does it deserve a sequel absolutely
Feb 16 2024,positive,this was such an amazing action movie its a movie you will never forget
Feb 16 2024,negative,i have to say this was legitimately one of the worst superhero movies ive ever seen while films like venom and morbius were mediocre they still managed to provide some level of enjoyment with their actionpacked sequences and intriguing characters however madame web unfortunately fell short on nearly every level    from the storyline to the character development madame web left much to be desired the plot felt convoluted and disjointed lacking the cohesive narrative that is essential for any successful superhero movie additionally the character of madame web herself failed to captivate audiences in the same way as other iconic superheroes    furthermore the visual effects and cgi in madame web were subpar failing to deliver the immersive experience that audiences have come to expect from modern superhero films the action scenes felt uninspired lacking the excitement and intensity that are characteristic of the genre    overall while venom and morbius may not have been masterpieces they at least managed to entertain audiences to some extent however madame web failed to live up to even the lowest of expectations making it a disappointment for fans of the superhero genre
Feb 16 2024,positive,great movie it fulfills its function of entertaining
Feb 16 2024,negative,this was awful so bad its a girl power movie where everything feels forced the characters are poorly represented they shouldnt have been introduced in an ensemble movie everything feels super cringe how spiderman is to exist in this universe is laughable especially with evil spiderman running rampant what the hell was sony thinking
Feb 16 2024,positive,the film is amazing there is no other way to describe it the performances were impeccable the characters were so charismatic that they won us over the feeling of feeling close to all the girls was the best  cassie was such a wellconstructed character the best superhero origin for sure this film came to revolutionize the entire concept we have of superheroes the references to the 2000s the very well executed frantic and intense action scenes made the film exciting and insane it was another level for superhero action films in other words this film arrived to break everything besides definitely a perfect heroine dakota johnson was right to say that the best part about cassie is that her power is her mind
Feb 16 2024,positive,its not as horrible as some may say  definitely not as great as some say  its an entertaining movieyes it couldve been better
Feb 16 2024,negative,a hard watch acting effects filming style make it all unlikeable and very boring
Feb 16 2024,positive,i think its a good movie not the best and it could be better but its not that trash that the cr√≠tica are saying
Feb 16 2024,positive,new york paramedic cassandra webb dakota johnson gains clairvoyant powers after surviving a near death experience shortly thereafter she begins having visions of 3 girls whom shes briefly had runins with before julia cornwall sydney sweeney anya corazon isabela merced and mattie franklin celeste oconnor in all of her visions theyre all killed by ezekiel sims tahar rahim who has visions himself of his death at the hands of cornwall corazon and franklin his plan is to kill them before they have the opportunity to kill him i went into this expecting the worst because sonys spiderman universe has now trained us to expect that however i was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed this i was hearing a lot of negative press going into it but im glad its been better than most of what sony has offered up to this point the film does have its faults the writers could have done a better job at explaining how exactly cassie gains her powers during her brush with death in addition for twothirds of the film the only power cassie has is seeing the future meaning the rest of the time in order to save the girls from ezekiel shes literally just pushing them out of harms way and running away from him im sure this wont do well financially at the box office nor will a sequel be green lit but it does give me some optimism heading into kraven the hunter later this year
Feb 16 2024,positive,very mais melhor que infernal soldier
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was a great starter movie for the beginning of a franchise buuuut it was anticlimactic it teased characters that would never actually get to be that great even by the end of the movie so many unanswered questions especially which spiderverse it was supposed to take place in i dont know dakota makes everything funny i just wish the plot was thought through
Feb 16 2024,positive,i really like the movie i dont know why everyone say it was bad as morvius as but i saw the movie yesterday and i know that got some mistakes but it was really funny i think the movie has like that things that the old marvel movies have and i enjoy it very much seriously
Feb 16 2024,positive,while there are some problemsmadame web weaves a fresh new take into marveleven though emma roberts was utterly wasted
Feb 16 2024,negative,the movie was a waste of time the story dialogue acting editing and camera work were terrible
Feb 16 2024,positive,its a solid origin story type of movie stop complaining just bcs its hot 3
Feb 16 2024,negative,one of the worst movies that ive seen in recent years
Feb 16 2024,positive,this was the best movie i have ever seen please they have my family
Feb 16 2024,positive,great into to madame web  allow your mind to be free and enjoy the story
Feb 16 2024,positive,it may not be shakespeare but an entertaining comic book movie
Feb 16 2024,positive,i loved it really enjoyable if you sit back and enjoy the mystery lots of cool action scenes and the acting was super well done probably one of the best spiderverse movies in a long time hoping we get more of all of the characters involved
Feb 16 2024,negative,i mean the script was awful the idea was poorly executed and the villain was underdeveloped the whole thing was weak and lacking anything to really draw you in on the plus side i could leave the theater for a snack or bathroom break without any fear of missing anything
Feb 16 2024,negative,no post credits  no spiderman  suits barely shown   cpr scene was stupid  villain wasnt even menacing   it screams i want my money back after watching it
Feb 16 2024,negative,this movie is horrible worst film of all time it doesnt even have a reason to exist pure deception
Feb 16 2024,positive,the movie was great all these negative reviews for what its not like every other movie not like the comics so what they took their time explaining how everything happened it was a great movie even without much action
Feb 16 2024,positive,excellent movie  will see it again
Feb 16 2024,negative,it was a rough watch i dont believe dakota johnson sells movies but she was the only nonawful part of this film as someone whos had an attachment to madame web since i was a kid its upsetting to have watched what the studio did with the character she deserved so much better    this film was poorly casted the writing is extremely sloppy heavily lacked direction and the production didnt translate to the film the bits of humor and charisma dakota showed throughout the movie are what makes it watchable no one elses acting matched that energy though
Feb 16 2024,positive,dakota is amazing and stunning performance as usual
Feb 16 2024,negative,dakota johnson couldnt act her way out of a wet paper bag so how she continues to get roles i dont know seeing the trailer at the cinema was enough for me to decide i wasnt watching this as the trailer was already bad but sadly i paid for the displeasure of viewing it where there was no escape we just need to acknowledge shes not a good actress just because shes has had decent scripts that have translated well on screen to get good ratings the irony of her leading  a movie that is associated with marvel for it to bomb this badly tells you all you need to know
Feb 16 2024,negative,i never particularly thought dekota was a good actress but shes terrible in this role overall the movie is slow under written and poorly acted i suggest a hard pass
Feb 15 2024,positive,okay not great but also not terrible solidly good with some odd choices made along the way honestly felt like it would have made a pretty good disney show instead of a feature movie dakota johnson is really pretty from most angles but nearly everyone in the movie was seriously underacting for some weird reason like they had put muscle relaxers in all the on set snacks a few niggling plot issues and no mid or postcredit scenes which now feels like a ripoff especially since all of sonys spider movies have had them better than mobius probably about as good as the venom movies weird sony is struggling so much with this since theyve made some pretty decent spiderman movies 
Feb 15 2024,neutral,you guys remember that nic cage movie next yeah well its like that but with spiderman except without the wonky ending where nic just kinda flashbacks the whole damn thing like it never happened which to be honest i was kinda expecting that     its a popcorn movie i dont know why people were expecting high art or something deeper than that but yeah comics are weird it more about the self fulling prophecy of the bad guy where had he just left it to time accidents happen all the time     i have seen worse but this not ending up in my top ten for sure
Feb 15 2024,positive,ok i realize im going to be a minority but my kids and i saw madame web today  my daughter and i thought it was awesome  although it didnt have the captain marvel and the marvels type of humor i really enjoyed the whole show  i enjoyed the action  i also liked the caring nature of the main character  evan said it was ok  although in general i dont think the guys tend to like the same thing that girls do in super hero movies  just my two cents for what its worth  i give it two thumbs up  but know i am a big fan of most of the female marvel action adventures
Feb 15 2024,negative,was a real stretch even for marvel  gratuitous and obnoxiously high volume too often
Feb 15 2024,negative,i had to leave after 40 mins it was all over the place i was resolved to see it through as i usually do with films im not enjoying but in the end decided my time was worth more
Feb 15 2024,negative,madam web falls short of expectations failing to deliver on multiple fronts the plot is convoluted and disjointed making it hard to follow and leaving audiences feeling disconnected from the story the film leaves gaping plot holes and unanswered questions    the character development is lacking with shallow and uninteresting protagonists that fail to evoke any emotional investment from the audience the performances feel uninspired with  actors unable to elevate the material theyre given    the direction lacks creativity resulting in a horrible and forgettable viewing experience    overall madam web is a disappointment failing to live up to its potential and leaving audiences feeling underwhelmed and unsatisfied its a forgettable addition to the superhero genre that ultimately falls flat
Feb 15 2024,negative,really hoped this would be good and the critics were just harsh but nope super confusing plot that made little sense and edited like it was done by 25 studio execs that have no idea how to make a movie   just all around not a good movie and only would recommend if you are looking for the worst movie to watch   plus side is the cast does seem to be trying their best for the most part dakota johnson seems like shes giving her all
Feb 15 2024,negative,there is absolutely nothing good about this movie it is the worst superhero movie ive ever seen and ive watched the fantastic four that was made in the 90s
Feb 15 2024,negative,how was this allowed to come out    seriously there is absolutely no redeeming feature to this movie all the main characters are completely insufferable the plot is a jangled mess the acting if you can all it that is so mid you would think everyone was chugging cough syrup the whole shoot its like someone saw catwoman  said lets do that it reminds me of the birds of prey series from the 00s  thats not a good thing     whats even worse they ham fist the fact its set in the 90s with the music so hard its the equivalent of your parents saying somethings lit     its funny that a movie about a character that can see the future has literally no future as a franchise
Feb 15 2024,positive,overall enjoyed the film was really confused to see people didnt really like it a overall different take on a spiderman style movie and seems to set up a sequel which i am quite excited for
Feb 15 2024,positive,when madame web said love you webillion i cried and shat my pants one of if not a movie ever made in the history of cinema right up there with morbius
Feb 15 2024,positive,its an decent movie kind  of silly  but its fun
Feb 15 2024,positive,the movie is poorly constructed and conceived im not sure any of the actors wanted to be there the cgi is subpar at best but i had a blast at the theater maybe i watched it the wrong way but i had a smile on my face the entire time
Feb 15 2024,neutral,ummm the main actor guy cannot act and a lot of his words are not properly aligned with his mouth like they did a voice over and just chose not to match them together also this movie couldve been cut down to 1 hour and some minutes it was too long and had a lot of unnecessary scenes that dragged on i would not ever watch this again i just watched it because ive seen every marvel movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,empty movie theatre makes complete sense
Feb 15 2024,negative,in the famous words of joe pesci   what the f is this piece of sh  seriously how did this movie even get made
Feb 15 2024,negative,it one of the worst than morbius it couldve been better 110
Feb 15 2024,negative,absolutely terrible movie as a comic book fan i loath the corporate stank on these movies doesnt feel like the writers or director ever read a comic book
Feb 15 2024,positive,the whole movie was great
Feb 15 2024,positive,an excellent new superhero movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,madame web has the most insatiable appetite for getting things wrong maybe the most comprehensive cinematic disaster in my lifetime choppy underdone  laughably absentminded at every turn     you have never read a worse script the execution is an utter disaster for every second youve never heard worse delivery the delivery is so bad youd think it was done by evri we cannot become numb to this treatment this movie is an offensive sin on the fabric of nature    as some have said morbius on steroids a fate worse than death avoid at all costs
Feb 15 2024,positive,i actually found 80 of this interesting as a story much more so than most recent super hero stories a few bits not so good if they got cheesy but not knowing the story and not really caring about the original comic aspects the story was engaging overall to see what happened dakota was watchable and i liked her spiky character a lot more than when she had to be super cheesy at the end
Feb 15 2024,positive,entertaining and fairly enjoyable  not excellent and definitely some cheese but nowhere near as awful as the critics score would make you think
Feb 15 2024,positive,its just ok it has some good plot points looking forward to other things in the spider verse
Feb 15 2024,positive,i liked it i can see rotten tomatoes is doing another of there marvel hatchet jobs gotta wonder whos financing that
Feb 15 2024,negative,the film lacks any sort of cohesion and is more various threads pulled together in a web no pun intended there is a lot in the film that could be removed which wouldnt change anything in the overall story or stakes of which there are barely any the sheer amount of adr used in this also makes for a tough watch that made me physically cringe in some moments that were supposed to have weight and impact to them the only redeeming quality of this film is the source material it is based on
Feb 15 2024,positive,i got paid to rate it 5 stars 
Feb 15 2024,positive,really not as bad as people said on the same level as the other sony superhero movies better than morbius by a mile 
Feb 15 2024,positive,this movie was actually really sweet i thought the connections to the spiderverse was neat and it was an intriguing origin story
Feb 15 2024,positive,i thought it was quite well written and the casting was excellent dakota johnson is just fantastic in this role ive never seen the actor who plays the bad guy before but he is very very good i love the storyline a well rounded explanation of how it began moving into whats going on now my wife and i both loved it and came out of theater saying we hope they make another one depicting the girls getting their powers and becoming a team but only if they use the same cast just an excellent superhero movie and i highly recommend it to anyone who likes superhero movies personally i cant get enough of them
Feb 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie saw it today    i know there has been a lot of negative comments however if they make a sequel as the end of the film suggests then they need a whole new team to produce write
Feb 15 2024,negative,what do i have to say the entire movie sucks
Feb 15 2024,positive,still beter than the marvels
Feb 15 2024,negative,what on earth is marvel doing this may have been written by a 12 year old the script acting and general filming would have a tough time appealing to a child marvel needs to negotiate more with pepsi on their product placement to get more money to spend on the script this movie is giving cats a run for its money for worst film ever 
Feb 15 2024,negative,ass movie i dont want this to be the next morbius meme
Feb 15 2024,negative,nothing to see in this movie plss dont make part2
Feb 15 2024,negative,sony  youre a shitty company with this kind of movies give up man return the rights of spider no one cares
Feb 15 2024,positive,very entertaining female lead cast with special guest  peter parker dont let the bad reviews fool you this is a marvel movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,the movie is okay for looking on time
Feb 15 2024,negative,anticipation for new characters was let down by an oddly executed film   while the film did genuinely have some good moments of emotion good acting and was interesting to watch the film weave the intricacies of foresight the logic of putting the story elements together in other areas was just oddly done like here friend watch these 3 kids i just met in this house with your pregnant sister oh and they are in dangerok  the film opened to your unsurprising jungle search for a special spider to learn the origins of the main character and how she got her powers through her mother in the womb we dont learn why her pregnant mother was in a rainforest trying to find a special spider while 9 months pregnant until late in the film used as a catalyst to push the lead character forward to save the day in the comics madame web has a crippling disease and uses a chair in the film she does not have the disease but it is addressed in the story but then strangely the film ends with her in an almost professor x like wheelchair due to an accident to her eyes in the final battle blind people can still walk made no sense  what we got from the trailer was the anticipation of new female spider heroes when in reality of the film those were just visions of what will perhaps be in a sequel those new characters would likely have been the greatest part to the film but all we got were snippets of visions the films creation of a spiderpeoplejungleclan used as spiritual guidance was an odd element that used a cheesy rewording of great power comes great responsibility  it even annoyingly had moments where there were seemingly audio sync issues with the villain even appearing to use off camera dialogue and cuts to avoid watching him talk the film also doesnt seem to connect with the mcu or even any of the versions of spiderman as all of the characters act as if the villain is the first time theyve ever seen or heard of anybody with those abilities  had potential but was poorly executed
Feb 15 2024,negative,to call it a movie would be an insult to call it a superhero movie would be a crime sony should let the spiderverse guys helm that department and fire the rest
Feb 15 2024,negative,so stupid and lazy storytelling sony please stop
Feb 15 2024,positive,wasnt as bad as people are saying its mostly ok to pass the time a few action scenes but nothing great the acting did need some work
Feb 15 2024,positive,movie slightly dragged but delivered an old school comic book movie its on par with movies before the mcu     much better than what disney is pumping out but felt like it was the build up to a movie that may never come
Feb 15 2024,negative,total waste of time and money  story of a superhero who doesnt understand or can use her powers to the end of the movie  an obvious springboard introducing 3 future superheros  who couldnt do anything presently but will in future spinoffs  blatant attempt just to make money  the previous mcu movie ie eternals still made money but did not receive generally favorable reviews  madame web is so much worse   dakota johnsons talents were wasted as were the other costars   adam scott was excellent    the story the villain was pathetic
Feb 15 2024,positive,so much potential missed
Feb 15 2024,positive,i thought this was great and entertaining  definitely above average and why you shud never trust critics  at first watch some events seem non sensical but keep in mind shes able to predict future so it does make sense no matter how crazy the action sequences  action and story is very coherent  i was expecting frenetic action that you cant follow like latter die hard sequels from reading reviews but nothing far from truth  the young actresses were great as was johnson  jokes were really funny and frequent so very pleasant indeed
Feb 15 2024,positive,who cares what critics say anyways  the real score to trust is the audience  and honestly the movie wasnt that bad   i enjoyed the story of madame web and how she really becomes the madame web but also i think thats what people need to focus on and not compare it to other spiderman films  take it for what it is and it is the origin story of madame web and i think they did a good job explaining her origin  its a fun film to watch  especially if you go into it with a open mind
Feb 15 2024,negative,leave spiderman to marvel please
Feb 15 2024,positive,not like the others super hero movies a nice suspense drama love that they give us a new perspective on ben parker
Feb 15 2024,positive,as a dakota johnson fan since she was announced i knew it would be a love or hate it i knew nothing about this character and i loved the fact is a stand alone and dont need to watch other 10 movies to understand i enjoyed the idea of her superpower being her mind and how empowering female super heroes are its amazing to see her explore action movies with a touch of humor some scenes seemed weird to me but they made sense for the story in general cassies journey learning about her powers and her bond with the other girl is something fun to watch it
Feb 15 2024,positive,i agree its not the best superhero movie nor the best origin story ive seen yet its still in my opinion a solid origin story it does well to establish the use of her power in this universe as awhole yet keeps the mystery of the powers origin as something to explore in the future i feel like a lot of peoplecritics are forgetting the basic idea of what a movieorigin story is its a story no more no less it doesnt have to have deeper meaning than what it shows on the surface if you cant accept that i suggest you stop pretending to know how a movie should be made but that is just my point of view as a more than avid movie watcheranalyst for my entire life
Feb 15 2024,negative,by far the most boring a worst marvel movie ive ever seen with such a power house cast it was a real shame that this movie was not executed properly this belongs in the dc universe
Feb 15 2024,positive,i liked the subway scene
Feb 15 2024,positive,well its not a superhero movie with a lot of action maybe not so psychological deep either but for pure entertainment it is good i liked it and sometimes its also nice to watch something which doesnt have full speed all the time it would be nice with an appearance of madame web with her spiders in a future spider man movie as a complement
Feb 15 2024,positive,after seeing this movie i definitely believe that critics are conducting a review embargo of this movie it isnt as bad as theyre saying just as the movie is about manipulating the outcome of events i now believe that there is something going on trying to manipulate and pull the strings of the public in hollywood movie success here 1 acting  355  most of the cast fell flat in human emotion 2 sound  45  a little inconsistent 3 character development  35  biggest penalty is for not developing the villain more in terms of his why 4 visuals  45  made me believe the settings and i enjoyed most of the visual choices 5 plotstory  355  really enjoyed the journey but there were a couple plot holes or unexplained reasons for things happening as they do 6 dialog  45  basically all of the dialog from the villain is bad writing but besides that it was solid and believable 7 pace  45  could have been trimmed up a little more but so glad to see this just under two hours 8 themesmessaging  355  forgiveness protecting the innocent healing and moving past trauma choosing to be good in a hard world its left unclear the main takeaways and lessons
Feb 15 2024,positive,pretty good some actors were better than others
Feb 15 2024,negative,they had the perfect cast but the script was horrible
Feb 15 2024,positive,it is very entertaining much better than the latest superhero movies
Feb 15 2024,negative,this movie was one of the worse sony spider man movies and morbius is still better then this garbage
Feb 15 2024,neutral,meh it passed the time until my next work shift
Feb 15 2024,negative,featuring a what were they thinking screenplay this is the worst marvel movie ever even worse than the marvels it should have the lowest grosses of all marvel movies the marvels holds that record for the moment
Feb 15 2024,positive,not as bad as some people are making it
Feb 15 2024,negative,absolute disgrace it shocks me how stupid the people at sony are venom morbius now this someone has to end this literally the worst comic book movies ever
Feb 15 2024,negative,this had so much potential with characters from a rich mythology and it just falls flat on its face
Feb 15 2024,negative,truly one of the worst superheromovies ever made   the room and catwoman meets neil breen the room was a better movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,probably the most awkward uncomfortable movie i had ever seen looks like the spent all there money on actors in a kids movie how have we gone back this far in progress people
Feb 15 2024,positive,good action superhero movie with a good strong cast
Feb 15 2024,positive,the film is great if you want a relaxed film the action scene are small but its comfortable to see
Feb 15 2024,negative,i am only giving this half a star because the site doesnt allow me to give it five poo emojis the problem with the movie is  insert any issue you could have with a movie here
Feb 15 2024,positive,i had a great time with madame web and it delivered everything i wanted to see  enough of a divergence from the source material to be interesting but enough callbacks to her comic appearance to please my nerdy heart i thought it was well paced and exciting possibly my favorite spider villain experience so far
Feb 15 2024,negative,in an attempt to reel an audience it instead castaway all hopes fans have for the sony spiderman universe between the nauseating plot poor voice dubbing and innocuous acting this is a new low for comic book movies
Feb 15 2024,positive,i really liked this film and cant understand why the negative reviews are so harsh its slow moving and the villain isnt as menacing as he should be but loved dakota johnson and the strong female cast not the best marvel film but definitely worth a watch  hope they continue the story
Feb 15 2024,negative,it wasnt as bad as everyone made it out to be some bits were entertaining and other bits were kinda head scratching but overall not bad
Feb 15 2024,negative,boring storyline bad effects
Feb 15 2024,negative,terrible just terrible waste of money
Feb 15 2024,negative,they finally created a superhero whose superpower is causing people to leap over tall buildings in a single bound to get away from movie theaters it also proves one thing nobody associated with this movie can see into the future otherwise they never would have made it
Feb 15 2024,negative,sony and disney marvel are in a competition to see who can make the worst movie you thought the marvels was bad sony wins with this piece of hot garbage    cringe all the way
Feb 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed it which means im happier than all of you i win
Feb 15 2024,negative,there was no redeeming factor in this film the cinematography was awful and the dubbing didnt follow the characters lips and the editing was very off putting save your money and wait for streaming
Feb 15 2024,positive,first off lets just say i dont want the movie industry or theatre industry to die   im very fond of cinema and  being able to make an event of things going out to see the newest and greatest that filmmakers have to offer   that being said although i do go to a lot of films since covid ended i certainly dont go to see them all just because   and although i grew up watching spiderman cartoons playing with toys watching all the live action adaptations over years i didnt follow the comic books closely enough to learn about all the subcharactersstories and with that being the case not even really knowing who or what madame web even is or that it was tied into the spiderman universe that was all entirely irrelevant  i saw many previews leading up to its valentines day premier and financial aspect of going to see movie in theatre aside myself 33 and my two daughters aged 1510 were more then into checking it out   going into this movie with totally open mind i can say i enjoyed it  you dont have to know or follow any of the back story or comics to understand or enjoy this film   its not comic book cliche or fodder like critics have labelled it and all the so called b or nonalist actors were phenomenal and did fantastic job   from back story to current day from scene to scene until ending theres nothing disappointing about madame web what so ever writing casting performances action sequences all top notch thank you sony and crew   would be welcomed addition to see some spin off sequels that include spider manpeter parker   get out and support good films period
Feb 15 2024,negative,very bad very very bad
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was a okay movie but for people who dont know spiderman universe lore would probably be confusing if this is the start of a new spider man universe connecting with the upcoming kraken movie sign me up but if this is it i dont find any reason to watch or come back to this movie in the future
Feb 15 2024,negative,it had potential to not suck as bad as it did  i was very disappointed i really expected it to have more action  more actual spidery scenes  as a die hard marvel fan i was very much let down
Feb 15 2024,negative,madame web struggles with a convoluted storyline that often loses its thread leaving audiences more perplexed than intrigued character development is thinly veiled making it hard to empathize with or understand key motivations despite a potentially stellar cast performances feel hampered by the scripts limitations visual effects usually a high point in superhero cinema are surprisingly lackluster failing to compensate for the narrative and emotional gaps pacing issues further detract from the engagement leading to a viewing experience that feels both drawnout and unfulfilling marking a missed opportunity in an otherwise rich cinematic universe
Feb 15 2024,positive,another one where i dont know what the critics are talking about is it the best movie ever no but it is good starts out quick and continues at a decent pace slowing revealing more details along the way not over the top or a more realistic superhero movie most of the runtime at the very least quite entertaining
Feb 15 2024,positive,went to see the film on 140224 and honestly thoroughly enjoyed the film the story was enticing the dialogue was brilliant one of the top films ive seen in a while highly recommend to go and see it
Feb 15 2024,negative,theres no character development in this movie neither villain or protagonist sweeney sydneyceleste oconnor and isabela moner are just keep running like an helpless sheep actually the movie can still continue without them als the villain doesnt have any attractiveness he gives the normal bad folks feel all he does is just keep chasing the protagonists weak background info and motion i just couldnt feel any points that i should fear him the plot is really boring zero incentive for me to try it once again
Feb 15 2024,positive,totally acurrate to the c√≥mic good characters but a bad script and that isnt enought to say its a bad movie actually is quite better than expected
Feb 15 2024,negative,it really is as bad as they say but i found myself laughing throughout the whole movie not for what they intended it actually was enjoyable to watch for how bad it was how they turned her into the comic character at the end is one of the funniest things ive seen in a long time
Feb 15 2024,positive,awesome film kept me laughing and such a great period piece
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was a good movie overall kind of slow and lacked action for a superhero movie but it takes you to a well deserved break from all the cgi overload from 16 years of mcu dominating the genre making us dizzy full throttle good plot and dakota made a great job
Feb 15 2024,negative,if you thought aquaman was bad this movie is atrocious
Feb 15 2024,negative,it can be disappointing to fall asleep during a film especially if you were hoping for some exciting parts not worth the ticket price 
Feb 15 2024,neutral,dakota and sydney did great celeste and isabel did a good job tahar as the villain was terrible the script is terrible and cgi is horrendous i think this couldve been decent but it falls as a meh still better than morbius
Feb 15 2024,negative,more horrible writing and stories  save your money  this is the worst sony mcu movie to date
Feb 15 2024,negative,disgusting movie need my money back
Feb 15 2024,positive,i thought it was good like that it was different yes some parts was slow but overall i enjoyed it its not as bad as what some people or critics are saying they seem to like the boring and slow paced movies stop worrying about what people are saying and just watch it yourself and make up your mind be a leader and not a senseless robot
Feb 15 2024,negative,i thought the movie was alright  the story was meh and so were the characters the costumes  looked alright not that comic book accurate but good enough however the villain was so bad and trash it made my brain hurt just trying to watch it  over all its a was of a theater room use marvel fans cant catch a brake hopefully deadpool 3 saves us all from this sony hot garbage
Feb 15 2024,negative,the most generic film ever made it makes morbius transform and a good film the script is rubbish the production looks like money laundering what saves the film are the actresses
Feb 15 2024,positive,honestly i accepted the movie for what it was and enjoyed it more than expected took me back to those movies around the time set within the movie of daredevil catwoman elektra and fantastic four     much better than venom 12
Feb 15 2024,negative,one of if not the worst movies i have yet to see walking this planet visual effects poor acting poor it was a couple of hours i beg i could get back to instead watch the remake of the little mermaid
Feb 15 2024,negative,its just so very very bad
Feb 15 2024,neutral, not a great movie but better than the other sony marvel movies
Feb 15 2024,negative,most of the storyline doesnt make a lick of sense and at times this movie is very hard to watch its a rare instance of the trailer promoting an entirely different film its crystal clear that this is not a marvel studios project and just in association with marvel the best part was the ending teasing the audience of an actual good story that might come around if we wait another 2 years
Feb 15 2024,negative,id rather drown in wet paint than watch this movie again acting cinematography story all of it a total waste of life
Feb 15 2024,negative,i felt this movie could have been something big but it appears the director lost their direction and just delivered anything  no big bad guy snobby protagonist not sure who they were targeting for an audience but not the average moviegoer
Feb 15 2024,positive,not as bad as i expected its a mess but was semi interesting not a complete flop
Feb 15 2024,negative,this movie is so bad its good but definitely not worth buying a ticket wait for streaming
Feb 15 2024,positive,i cant seem to understand all these negative reviews toward madame web as someone who loves the spider verse and knowing basic lore about cassie web i enjoyed the movie from every little bit of foreshadowing it if offered to other spider verse knowledge we have to the story it built to the characters introduced yes ill say dakota johnson isnt the most entertaining actress but she has her moments and she did play the role well i feel like this movie deserves more than it is getting the comedy was subtle the drama wasnt bad acting it was just enjoyable i left the theater with a huge smile on my face i was gitty in my seat with every little foreshadow its no across the spider verse or no way home but it is madame web
Feb 15 2024,positive,i like it i enjoyed the story line had my attention from the beginning hope it continues
Feb 15 2024,positive,ehh was kewlno end credit scene   way better than morbious
Feb 15 2024,negative,this has to be one of the worst superhero movies in history im serious this movie is horrible bad directing bad writing bad dialogue boring and a non interesting story dont waste your money on a ticket sony has turned into a complete joke with these embarrassing spin off films for spiderman sony should just give us spiderman not these spin off movies  please do better sony
Feb 15 2024,neutral,i think the movie is not all bad it had good very memorable moments but the plot was so predictable that you already knew where it was going to end and the development felt a little forced
Feb 15 2024,positive,i know i know im in the minority here and please spare me the youre the only one blah blah blah because i dont care i really enjoyed it i really had a good time with my fianc√©e i liked it way better than morbius
Feb 15 2024,positive,the film is not bad the development of madame web is well constructed but it is spoiled by the three girls who have no development and are not really useful it would have been more judicious to just have just one of the three girls in order to create a better bond better character development and a better final fight the villain was too easy to beat
Feb 15 2024,positive,i liked it i would recommend the movie but dont go in expecting an avengers movie or even a perfect film to be transparent with you     dont get me wrong it had its struggles and needed an actual superhero fans touch but i liked how the action scenes werent like all other superhero movies and i could see a pretty exciting sequel come out of it     as a fan of the 90s spiderman animated series this wasnt my first time being introduced to madame webb i enjoyed the parallels to the cartoon unfortunately it seems the writers took a little too much influence from the cartoon because some of the writing was so cheesy that it could only fit in a 90s cartoon     the movie was slow at times but many movies dealing with multiple timelinesmultiverses speed through the framework and for casual viewers its confusing i think sony wanted this to be their intro to the multiverse so i appreciate the focus on the details     it does make me wonder how different the movie was before the obvious rewrites and changes postfilming maybe they will rerelease like zack snyders justice league overall i liked it but i hope sony will start investing in good writers and better directors for future projects
Feb 15 2024,positive,not the greatest but had the potential for something big
Feb 15 2024,negative,all the actors look like they all want to go home
Feb 15 2024,negative,you can tell this is a sony movie not a full marvel movie it was less than mid and a horrible depiction of the characters i recommend watching it so you understand how horrible it is    the main villain had no storyline and his voice didnt always match his lips when he talked they didnt explain how he gained wealth after stealing a spider how does he have a digital image of the three girls when he only saw them in a dream he could have easily killed all four of them at the end by snapping their necks or smashing their skulls with his feet but instead he throws them in various directions so they are hanging on to something and webb has to suddenly master a new power to save them his death was so stupid hes incredibly strong and yet a piece of metal signage was enough to pin him down then he falls and doesnt land on his feet then more signage falls on top of him and kills him so stupid    dakota johnsons character was the only one with a semicomplete story no mention of her dad or grandparents when she starts having the visions she goes to all these doctors which implies shes freaked out but dakota doesnt look freaked out or act like shes losing her mind she could have talked with ben and checked herself into a psych ward then gone through an elaborate escape using her visions to save the girls her friend and coworker died and she didnt seem that torn up about it she stole a taxi and an ambulance with no mentioned repercussions she called a helicopter to a building she was planning to blow up and then the helicopter crashed and she killed two people also webb randomly taught them cpr so they could use it in the storyline to save her life at the end so obvious so stupid so unnecessary they could have just made the blonde girl know cpr from being a lifeguard or something    the three girls had no character arc the trailer made it seem like we would see them mostly in costume with powers they started as impulsive teenagers who didnt listen to any of webbs directions  even though they saw a guy kill multiple police officers and crawl on the ceiling none of them seemed as scared as they should be in the end they were still impulsive teenagers but they listened to most of webbs directions conveniently all three of the girls have no parentguardian worried about them theres no explanation for how the girls get powers  we can assume its from the villains spider    155 stars  310 stars
Feb 15 2024,positive,not as bad as some people make out ive seen better granted but its a kids film and a car crashing through a wall and it not breaking the headlights is just as believable as spider venom making you clairvoyant
Feb 15 2024,positive,good movie dakota and all the girls were entertaining how ezekiel audio was off and did not match is voice good thing they always cut away when he was talking but overall good orgin movie and lots a reference to spiderman
Feb 15 2024,negative,dead on arrival make morbius look  like the godfather almost like they dismissed the fact that audiences have already seen this superhero movie 19 times over the last 10 years and then to make it worse it does nothing to improve on a tired formula except completely exhaust the genre meh acting lazy script silly final act not even so bad that its campy good its just flat and vapid of any true imagination or style
Feb 15 2024,negative,aaaaand another miscarriage from marveldisney nobody asked for it wasnt that bad its worse dont waste your lifetime watching it
Feb 15 2024,positive,it wasnt as bad as people say yeah its not perfect and definitely has flaws but not horrible just try to go into it with no expectations
Feb 15 2024,negative,horrible in every way and boring  nothing happens throughout the  entire film the acting is painful  especially johnsons the worst  movie lve ever seen in my life
Feb 15 2024,positive,dakota johnson is worth watching this is an origin story and had some good elements regarding learning ones superpower though here the action is limited because her power isnt physical  it could never ever match up with any of the traditional superhero origin stories because of that the actor playing the villain is absolutely horrible  would have been more interesting to see the backstories of the three future spiders instead of being told briefly about them by mere exposition  some absurd plot holes in moving things along in this one but it was worth watching for a departure from the world once again ending and being saved from an overly powerful villain only to be vanguished by overwhelming cgi errrr i mean the hero  this one had great potential for and did achieve some interesting character development via dakotas skills as an actress but more could have done with her character and the others  not a waste of time  not the best by any measure
Feb 15 2024,negative,very disappointed it was so clich√© i almost knew what each actor was going to say next the acting was not very good and i was just very disappointed almost left early on but decided to see it through
Feb 15 2024,positive,one of the better movies ive seen from marvel in a while it kept me on the edge of my seat definitely different from what marvelsony has been doing with the spider verse lately but i thoroughly enjoyed it it wasnt just about a superhero who immediately wants to help the world and knows all about their powers its the origin to what hopefully will be the future of the spider verse cant wait to see whats next
Feb 15 2024,negative,why they have to make madame web so young for
Feb 15 2024,negative,absolutely terrible it took my everything to stay awake during this snoozefest
Feb 15 2024,neutral,missed the mark and tops marvels worst movie yet the acting wasnt bad but the story line and ability to keep me from checking my watch just wasnt there   the fact they made a cheap attempt to style the xmen franchise really made this a  truly cheezy movie   wait for streaming and dont bother pausing if you need to use the bathroom
Feb 15 2024,negative,it was a bad movie it felt rushed and waste of time
Feb 15 2024,negative,bad scirpt bad cgi bad actors
Feb 15 2024,positive,i am surprised by the negative reviews i really liked this movie granted it was not perfect but i would recommend it to any superhero movie lover like myself it was fun and the characters evolved throughout the movie there were some great action scenes the villain was predictable and onedimensional unfortunately but the heroes were fantastic
Feb 15 2024,positive,sony spiderman universe is very underrated universe madame web is next hidden gem of sony
Feb 15 2024,positive,with the initial reviews i saw i thought this movie was going to be awful and unwatchable i was surprised to learn it was at least entertaining there were some corny parts but it definitely isnt as bad as the 14 listed at the time im writing this id recommend seeing it if youre interested but dont have high expectations for greatness its an entertaining movie and worth a viewing during a matinee walking out of the theater i liked it more than morbius and venom
Feb 15 2024,negative,i cant even it was bad this is the wish of spiderman movies the writing was so bad the acting was so bad  this movie made morbius look good   i have only walked out of 1 movie and that was dreamcatcher this was all most 2 save your money and wait for it to show up free on a streaming service 
Feb 15 2024,negative,worst movie of the 20th century
Feb 15 2024,negative,this movie is so bad on many levels sony just said to hell with it and take it as it is
Feb 15 2024,positive,i loved that it wasnt the usual marvel movie i loved that cassie was the hero even though she didnt have the spiderlike capabilities she was just able to see the future i also loved the backstory and history of her mother and how she went back to get answers about her mom overall loved the movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,disney and marvel have taken what was only a few years ago a beloved cinematic universe and turned it into a laughable mess i rarely leave the theatre early but after the first 40 minutes or so i crept out and snuck in to watch wonka madame web is a massive silly and downright insulting pile of dog poo
Feb 15 2024,neutral,story feels incomplete meh villain
Feb 15 2024,negative,that was worse than the marvels its like all the sudden every super hero is a 13 year old girl who cant act not worth your time plus the voice over was so bad i felt like i was watching an old kung fu movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,its not even meme worthy
Feb 15 2024,negative,the acting wasnt very good  i wish i would have waited till it was free   it was probably on par with the eternals
Feb 15 2024,negative,this film is a complete disaster first the marvels now this film disney is destroying marvel studios
Feb 15 2024,negative,my wife and i left after an hour boring
Feb 15 2024,negative,spiderman is my ultimate favorite superhero and was excited to see madame web come to life however what the heck was this heap of garbage  everything from the story direction and acting was absolutely cringeworthy  ezekiel the main villain was extremely hard to watch and listen to  a lot of the time his lips didnt even match the words which made me think they had to go back and do some voiceover work  the acting from dakota johnson seemed extremely forced throughout the entire movie  i agree with a lot of these other reviewers in which they should have paid us to go and see the movie instead because wow
Feb 15 2024,negative,truly terrible script and some of the worst chemistry i have ever seen on screen highly recommend if you want to go to a cinema and giggle hence 2 not 1 star went with my girlfriend and she shares the same thoughts remarkable amount of fake best friend energy between the three girls just sell this back to marvel at this point highlight is watching people say spider like man or man spider avoiding the word spiderman like its voldemort
Feb 15 2024,negative,saw this with my wife on valentines day after dinner at mcdonalds and mcdonalds was not the most disappointing part of the evening there were a lot of little issues that make this movie pretty terrible there are plot issues not to spoil things but where was that dump truck going to at that speed the water was only like 100 feet away a building with there were just a bunch of those little stupid things commenting about how small the spider is but the thing was the size of a mouse    the acting was pretty horrible almost like they were given their lines two minutes before each shot they had time to remember them but not the time to figure out how to deliver them the bad guys dialogue seemed to be completely and obviously dubbed over one scene was almost like an audio sync issue i get with my tv     the real shame is that the cast was a pretty quality group of actors and actresses its not the worst movie i have ever seen  it is definitely no where near the most average film i have ever watched
Feb 15 2024,positive,madame web is a movie with problems but it is in many ways a return to form for comic book movies it takes some big swings and seemed to suffer from last minute edits but ultimately i dont understand why people are immediately trashing this film its not any worse than venom and so much less miserable than morbius
Feb 15 2024,negative,oh boy this movie was hot gaaaarrrbage avoid this movie spider fans just avoid it
Feb 15 2024,negative,movie was honestly trash  dont waste your time or money until this streams on a streaming platform went to sleep 3 times and when i was watching the movie went from one plot to another with no contexthorrible and its crazy to think morbius is better than this garbage sony do better
Feb 15 2024,positive,good movie  excellent character development fans have to remember its an origin story its not gonna have a trama of a sequel
Feb 15 2024,negative,sony you play too much i lost 2 hours of my life with this garbage sony yall should fire the executives who green lighted this garbage asap i think hollywood is done for this is sad
Feb 15 2024,positive,solid plot but lacking enough interest kept waiting for it to get better potential to to super but fell flat like the whole thing was rushed c  maybe it was the direction was all over i wanted to like it more
Feb 15 2024,negative,im not here to bash anyone ultimately the main screen writers have had mostly duds 2017 power rangers etc etc and this isnt much different i dont understand why people choose to take a comic book character that no one really asked to see on the big screen and still cant even do it justice you can tell they have not looked into the comics even on bit which means they tried to make a quirky enough random story with a bunch of the industries hottest of the month and dont get me started on the adr line delivery for a certain character they couldnt even be bothered with
Feb 15 2024,negative,a spiderman movie without spiderman and  very poorly done nothing like the comics this  is how you ruin a movie not how you make a  successful one spiderman is arguably the  most popular comic book character today so  why would they leave out peter parker i dont  have a clue
Feb 15 2024,negative,decent premise but dakota johnson the worst actress on earth
Feb 15 2024,positive,the movie wasn decent ill give it a 6870 but please guys dont ever go by reviews  go see it for yourself   they rated it a 17   that was very incorrect it was a decent movie its more of a kids movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,madame web arrives onscreen barely registering a pulse thanks to a bland script and a cast thats as disinterested as the audience    full review    
Feb 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed it doesnt deserve the hate its getting
Feb 15 2024,negative,a film not worthy of anyones eyes
Feb 15 2024,negative,its like eating junk food if the junk food was also coverd in rat poison
Feb 15 2024,negative,there wasnt much to like sadly i do remember at one point thinking that was cool but i have already forgot what that was because the rest was so terrible
Feb 15 2024,negative,it was like morbuios but wow that needed marvel touch up tho marvel aint helping much
Feb 15 2024,negative,i dont know what i just watchedi have seen movies  made by high schools students better edited than this excuse of a movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,honestly not that bad little long of a runtime with clunky dialogue but i felt the movie served its purpose only if sony does right with a sequel the ben parker character was in this more than i thought i really enjoyed the cast as a whole minus the villain
Feb 15 2024,negative,the question remains why do they let dakota johnson be the protagonist in any movie whatsoever
Feb 15 2024,negative,what happened to marvel movies this was terrible 
Feb 15 2024,positive,madame web gets a c  for dialogue and an a for storytelling the birth of peter parker at the end of the film is an unexpected surprise the changes to madame webs origin were very wise and really help put some more meat on the bones of the plot the dialogue for johnson and bishe is really the most meaningful dialogue here but everyone elses dialogue is very stilted and cheesy which makes the film drag quite a bit some of the decisions made by various characters in this film are laughably stupid and worthy of the critical scorn they have received the payoff for this film is in its ending which is very cool there must have been a better way to execute this film and introduce madame web to the masses than this convoluted mess anybody who knows nothing about the character as shes depicted in marvel comics or only knows madame web from spiderman the animated series and the spiderman shattered dimensions video game is gonna be lost an omniscient narrator a la michael c halls dexter morgan would have made the film easier for viewers unfamiliar with madame webb to understand its difficult to understand how shes experiencing the extent of her powers and how to use them more effectively unless youve read the source material the movie assumes viewers have a basic understanding of the character before going in to see the film its obvious from many of the online reviews that most of the critics and fans alike are clueless about the character and unfortunately the film fails to make viewers sympathetic towards her and to understand her importance within spidermans world why cant people admit honestly when they dont know who a character is that has been a fixture in spiderman mythos since 1980 its obvious that most of the professional critics reasons for completely lampooning this film have more to do with wanting to see sonys cinematic efforts fail in hopes that the studio will sell 100 of the spiderman rights back to disney along with his pantheon of characters 
Feb 15 2024,negative,dear sonyplease stop
Feb 15 2024,positive,really great movie with a little freshness i think its perfect
Feb 15 2024,negative,in a time when superhero movies are everywhere madame web stands out but not in a good way
Feb 15 2024,negative,its probably one of the worst films yet they arent even in the suits for that long the main villain just dies and the main character hide blind
Feb 15 2024,positive,i am no expert  obviously before watching  i read some reviews about how awful this movie is  however it is not that bad 
Feb 15 2024,positive,i like it when they do something different in a superheroes movie it not what you expected but wasnt that bad though quite a solid film 
Feb 15 2024,positive,this movie was so good i really wanna watch it again
Feb 15 2024,negative,horrible
Feb 15 2024,negative,the acting was meh not the best almost felt like a voice over from one character took a while to get started but never really delivered felt poorly executed and forced there was one part thats amazing but otherwise meh
Feb 15 2024,negative,just clunky the editing and writing just felt off the adr for the villain was off too so there were technical issues as well i really like dakota johnson but this is just a poorly executed movie they wasted a lot of talent to spin up a franchise and i just dont want to see anything else by this director poorly done
Feb 15 2024,negative,i dont understand how anyone could have enjoyed this i watched with my partner and the only times i laughed were when we made fun of it story was stilted dialogue was dry cgi was fine at best iffy at worst not a single character was likeable and their backstories felt rushed if i could give this 0 stars i would
Feb 15 2024,negative,i cant believe this is actually a movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,oh my god this was morbious level bad  i mean i get this was only made to keep rights with sony but they could have at least tried to get in some cohesiveness in the story    no chemistry between characters the funny bits are well not and hardly any character  let alone the lead  is even remotely likable  if this was setting up the for some future sony scu i doubt anyone would be interested    just bad
Feb 15 2024,positive,really enjoyed this film dakota was amazing in it role suited her really well loved the connections it makes to other marvel films and the twists in it dont listen to the rubbish reviews see it for yourself
Feb 15 2024,positive,definitely a superhero movie you dont expect  in a completely positive sense a great change from the shallow and cheap humor that permeates superhero movies lately
Feb 15 2024,positive,an exciting watch and a perfect set up for the start of a franchise thoroughly enjoyed every second and the sneak peeks of the upcoming heroes will definitely be continuing this
Feb 15 2024,positive,i loved this film no matter what others say it was a great thrill ride love this film
Feb 15 2024,negative,probably the worst movie i ever seen in my whole entire life bad editind bad script everything is bad about it     dont watch this movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,honestly i enjoyed every second of this movie its way too overhated even though some of the writing wasnt top of the line the actresses did an amazing job with what they were given definitely going to see it again
Feb 15 2024,negative,so bad its good  but not good enough to give it more stars    i chuckled my way through many of the serious parts of this movie there are some really interesting ideas but the execution just wasnt there so nothing pays off
Feb 15 2024,negative,i actually think that this was the worst movie that ive ever seen
Feb 15 2024,negative,obvious story predictable the voiceover in some scenes was terrible   dakota was solid though
Feb 15 2024,negative,one of the worst marveldc movies to come out devoid of any love of the source material boring story with zero character development
Feb 15 2024,positive,i think everyone hates it because theres no spiderman cameo and thats unfair the villain was the worst part of this film because of the fact that it sounded like it was dubbed and his lips werent moving besides that it was funny and a different story than what everyone is used to
Feb 15 2024,positive,dakota johnson saved this film thanks to her talent and charisma
Feb 15 2024,positive,2003 all over again dakota johnson i love your wit you are naturally so talented thank u 4 saving tis movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was a fun comic book movie they were able to take madame web and make her feel like a big deal within a small story definitely worth a watch
Feb 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed with watching this with my daughters dakota sydney celeste and isabella have great chemistry together dakota is so beautiful 
Feb 15 2024,negative,a flop can i get those 2 hours of my life back
Feb 15 2024,negative,tangled web of disappointment madame web movie review    i had high hopes for madame web but boy did it miss the mark this movie spins a convoluted web of confusion that even spiderman would struggle to untangle the story is as tangled as a web left unattended in a dusty corner    the acting is so stiff its like the cast got bitten by the wooden acting bug madame web herself is about as expressive as a spider in a rainstorm the dialogue feels forced like they were trying to weave a tapestry of words but ended up in a tangled mess    the special effects are as jarring as a spider crawling up your arm its clear they spent more time on cgi spiders than on developing a coherent plot its like they got caught in a web of their own making trying to cram in every superhero clich√© they could think of    after watching this movie im suffering from superhero fatigue so severe i might need a superherosized nap save yourself the trouble and dont get caught in this tangled web of a movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,this is the type of movie that will turn you atheist if youre already an atheist this movie will support your theory of there being no god
Feb 15 2024,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen actors were completely fucked over
Feb 15 2024,negative,sydney was one of the reasons this movie has a star the trailers failed to give what you wanted to see which was a team of spiderpeople instead it was a 2 hour origin movie that couldve been explained in 20 minutes terrible writing but the actors and actresses make it work a terribly written villain who only chases people over a thought i know a lot of people dislike the idea of building up a cinematic multiverse but when the main character has the power to do so set it up the suits were good thats the reason for the other star i wish the studio had her powers and saw how the movie wouldve performed in the future maybe they wouldve changed the outcome of it
Feb 15 2024,positive,although the lack luster prerelease hype i went and saw the movie on opening day i was pleasantly surprised on how much i liked it it wasnt perfect by any means but it was an interesting origin story with likable characters and a good jumping off point to other projects 
Feb 15 2024,positive,this movie is one of the best movies ive seen in a long time i hope there is a part 2 everyone who is low scoring this movie doesnt know what they are talking about it was an amazing movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,a very decent action packed movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,this movie couldnt be more shameless as the marvel franchise continues to try the make this girl a boss formula that has led to bomb after bomb over the past yearplus i usually would give movies the benefit of a doubt if theyre a good way to kill time but sitting through this mess is more of a movie enjoyment killer than time killer
Feb 15 2024,positive,my sweet dakota was absolutely amazing i personally did not need the girls group   go watch it and see for yourself its great
Feb 15 2024,negative,for a pepsi commercial it is pretty darn good for a feature film wow what a mess  the positives dakota johnson has perfect lipstick at times   the negatives pretty much everything  pacing  dialog story adherence to canon etc
Feb 15 2024,negative,terrible movie overall the acting was so bad the score was so boring the storyline was inconsistent and confusing the movie was a laughable disaster i wish i could get a refund
Feb 15 2024,negative,id rather drink 2 day old hot dog water than to have to sit through this movie again
Feb 15 2024,negative,that had to be one of the most boring films ive ever seen in my life the dialogue is absurd and despite constant developments  nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep twice watching it but luckily my iced drink would spill and wake me up whenever i briefly nodded off     oh and another dakota johnson movie that isnt memorable who would of guessed maybe the nepo baby will stop getting free parts for what is an abysmal credits
Feb 15 2024,neutral,it wasnt that bad the story wasnt there but the whole film is comic book look like everything from the madame web comic was in this film not much of the superhero suits but it wasnt that bad i give it a rating 5410
Feb 15 2024,negative,horrible very bad performances
Feb 15 2024,negative,a generic soulless movie with flat characters and bad acting only enjoyable parts were that one funny scene and those nostalgic 2000s songs
Feb 15 2024,negative,sony needs to stop with these spiderman spin off films because theyre making the hero and the mcu look bad this madame web character shouldve never gotten a movie to begin with because shes just a lesser known supporting character
Feb 15 2024,negative,you cant keep having spiderman movies without spiderman i understand sony has to make a movie to keep the rights but please just let the rights go this is causing harm to humanity
Feb 15 2024,positive,madame web is one of the better spiderman character origin stories directed by sj clarkson who directed the jessica jones series this film is very well paced it doesnt try to be a set up to another film dakota johnson carries this film on her shoulders with very good performance playing the paramedic cassie webb with such straight deadpan humor a great supporting cast including an exciting daniel br√ºhl style villainous performance by tahar rahim and a riveting score by johan s√∂derqvist its a great dark standalone thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat in a way thats more interesting than the marvels and antman quantumania
Feb 15 2024,positive,solid story line all in all beautiful origin for madam web accurate madam web from 1999 cartoon great standalone family movie  i hope she ends up in a future spiderman film
Feb 15 2024,positive,if youre a die hard fan of the comics this might not be what you want it to be but overall i thought it was a good movie and a good setup for future movies
Feb 15 2024,negative,what a travesty bad acting bad story bad everything sony please give up the spiderman universe without spiderman and focus on something else
Feb 15 2024,negative,who cast dakota as an action hero
Feb 15 2024,negative,doodoo fr sony just give up lmao
Feb 15 2024,negative,disappointing underwhelming frustrating are some of the best ways to describe this film thankfully the cast did their jobs pretty well
Feb 15 2024,positive,not as bad as everyone made it out to be just lower your expectations and enjoy it for what it is
Feb 15 2024,positive,well nothing is perfect madame web have at less good action scenes for me is in the category so bad that is good
Feb 15 2024,negative,sonys attempt at moneygrab which failed miserably
Feb 15 2024,positive,excellent movie really enjoyed it
Feb 15 2024,negative,started off extremely excited to check this one out unfortunately from the voice over fake accents to the non believable teenage wannabes to the overly placed pepsico branding man what a disappointment the costuming could have been so much better but it just wouldnt have been able to overcome the absolute terrible acting zero stars if possible
Feb 15 2024,negative,wtf did i just watch  are you serious sony  stop screwing up the marvel comics smh
Feb 15 2024,negative,it would be one star but the cringiness made me laugh i would wait till this movies is out  you dont have to pay to watch it ive watched a lot of there super hero movies but this one was crazy the camera movement was terrible the movie itself was questionable i feel like this movie had potential but it was wasted
Feb 15 2024,negative,meh sums up my feelings about the movie you know dont get me wrong love these actors big fan of the spiderman world but this one just didnt hit the mark for me i waited and waited for that big moment that crescendo but it just never landed i suppose setting the bar too high going in was the problem
Feb 15 2024,positive,was this the best movie ever made no was it the worst absolutely not it was a decent film that kept my attention and passed the time the acting was surprisingly decent as good as it can be with the script and there were a few cheesyeye roll moments but overall worth a watch ignore critics and decide on your own
Feb 15 2024,positive,this is not the worst superhero movie i have seen lots of great cast members and funny moments referencing 2003 go in with low expectations or a high state of mind and you will have a fun time at the ridiculousness that comes with the superhero genre i think the movie starts out strong too no end credits scene which is a bummer
Feb 15 2024,negative,the movie feels like a product of the early 20s when superhero movies were still finding their footing it suffers from stiff acting characters lacking chemistry inconcise plot elements a certain tv show feel odd editing slow pacing and some very peculiar choices overall somehow it feels soulless
Feb 15 2024,negative,the bots on this page saying the movie was in any way good is insulting to ppl with even minimal intelligence rt obviously has no integrity
Feb 15 2024,negative,what did i just watch
Feb 15 2024,positive,i had seen the trailer for this movie already before watching it i went in knowing what to expect i had also done some reading up on the character that is madame web and the powers wed be expecting her to have being aware that this wouldnt be your typical actionpacked spiderman movie but i was still curious to see how madame web would utilize her powers to counter the mysterious new bad guy who did have physical super powers     the writing couldve been better the lines if they were from the script directly definitely couldve been better sometimes sacrifices have to be made for those you love and with the responsibility comes great power or something like that these references and quotes that were supposed to mean something in serious moments just came off as corny and really not memorable     in terms of the filming the only negative that really stood out to me was one of the early scenes constance was interrupted during her photograph session by her baby the snap scene to her bending over was extremely unnatural     outside all of that i actually didnt mind the story and the rest of the movie i think dakota johnson was a pretty good fit for the character i did go into the movie hoping that shed be able to avoid the fate of her comic book state blind and locked into a wheel chair but unfortunately that still did end up happening     the villain ezekiel i cant seem to isolate if it was his acting or the scripture that portrayed him but it did leave me wanting for more of a challenge i wasnt too satisfied with the evilness of his deeds his character was a bit too 2d i wouldnt have minded a little more depth to his villainy
Feb 15 2024,negative,the acting was so bad i couldnt wait for it to end the writing was so cringe they were right when they said it makes you almost angry at how bad it is
Feb 15 2024,negative,this movie is a must watch magic spider people birth of peter parker sony is wild doing this crazy thing this will 100 beat deadpool this year  best part is how they ignored every comic ever made and just did their own thing literally no one asked and yet they still did it 
Feb 15 2024,positive,the movie is not nearly as bad as the critics are claiming it is sure there are some things it does poorly the actions scenes are poorly edited and the acting and dialogue are pretty poor for the most part but the story was pretty solid with some creepy stalkerhorror vibes going on along with some intentional and unintentional humor that kept it entertaining i think there would be a lot more potential in a sequel since it ended with a very solid setup for a movie about a team of teenage spiderwomen that could be reminiscent of teenage mutant ninja turtles with madame web as their sensei who guides them with her clairvoyance
Feb 15 2024,negative,who hired the directors this movie is just a cash grab and you will have a better time watching paint dry or watching morbius
Feb 15 2024,negative,straight garbage anyone who dares rate this above 1 star has zero clue what true cinema is and let alone know anything about comics worst movie ive ever seen in my entire life the script was dull editing was basic definitely dont recommend anyone to watch this
Feb 15 2024,negative,as they lied to the actors they lie to us in the same way it could be said that this is the extended trailer the effects are horrible even though the story would be very good if it were final destination but nooo it has the marvel seal  remember that this movie has nothing to do with the mcu
Feb 15 2024,negative,movie was absolutely terrible who seriously green lighted this movie this movie is a disgrace to morbius
Feb 15 2024,positive,its not bad go see it
Feb 15 2024,positive,not as bad as expected even though theres a few tangles in this web    i thought the story was simple and straightforward also had a few nods to spidey fans and fun action sequences throughout the movie i do like the further exploration on cassies abilities but it just came across too dull    i think the villian was pretty disappointing boring motive and the voice over on the actor was soo poorly edited which shouldnt be surprising as the rest of the movie has some moments on slipping up on there editing the dialogue between the 3 girls was too cringy and the story leaves too much of a mess on whats to be there origin story     this may not be the answer to making the sony verse better but it still has its moments on being a fun popcorn flick
Feb 15 2024,positive,a great storyline and script that leaves you wanting more and grateful for the message of the movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,best marvel movie ive seen in ages ignore the stupid critic reviews they dont have a clue what they are talking about completely straight forward easy to understand story even my old man who knows nothing about superheroes couldnt understand why critics are saying tangled mess entertaining funny and actors were great
Feb 15 2024,negative,id give it zero stars if it was possible horrible movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,a super hero origin that follows many of the tropes theres a reluctant hero who starts realizing she has special abilities and ultimately she answers the call a villain that is fairly lackluster and imitates the abilities of the hero while these elements keep the movie from elevating to something more i dont really hold them against the film because whats the rest was different enough and interesting its still cool to get more films focused on female heroes its still fun to see nods to other spiderverse properties its interesting to see the main characters literally be hunted as the main driver of the film i have some other gripes like awkward cinematography at times and some instances of characters telling us something that would have done better with subtlety the cpr scene in the motel comes to mind but overall i was satisfied with the end product
Feb 15 2024,negative,being a superhero and comic fan it pains me to see sony yet again butcher one of the best superheroes of all time spiderman its never good when you have a spiderman universe without a a spiderman in yet alone when the movies arent good i feel bad for the actors in the because i like them all but this movie wasnt at all it the story and cinematography wasnt good there are so many plot wholes to where this fits into the sony universe overall just a mess of a movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,dakota perfect as a madame web good origen history hope she back in spiderman project
Feb 15 2024,negative,this was absolutely the worst movie i have watched in the last 5 years
Feb 15 2024,positive,not only me but a lot of my friends enjoy it  i guess it doesnt please the basic audience or the reviewers here but i definitely recommend watching it in the cinema
Feb 15 2024,positive,after all the fail attempts of sonys movies i really enjoyed madam web i think the casting choice was amazing really reallly was looking forward to the action scenes of the girls but understand the plot and the reasons behind everything i hope this gets a sequel or pulled into the mcu had a great time and was locked in the whole time
Feb 15 2024,positive,the story is very good the 4 actress make a great first appear in the movie i like it please connect with all mcu
Feb 15 2024,neutral,i respect dakota johnson she wasnt badbut the movie was really cheesy if you want a womens superhero movement  you better be smart about who your supporting cast is going to be
Feb 15 2024,positive,upon first viewing this movie is not bad and it certainly doesnt represent the current 17 rt score sony has always impressed me with their technical proficiencies thus the visual style and fx along with the excellent score and sound design are very interesting and well executed   the performances of the actors are great in my opinion dakota johnson totally steals the show and manages to turn any amount of plot insanity into something that is believable and even adam scott absolutely kills it as a side character sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor also give great performances that all attempt to lend more dimension to their characters sometimes successfully sometimes not  which brings me to the films drawbacks the plot is at best fairly clumsy some parts are incomplete the structure feels uneven and is often confusing im not sure if the problem is the script story or the editing if there were specific problems with any one of those elements i feel they could be excused but there are problems with all of them which leaves us with a bit of a mess with a few too many holes   overall i dont dislike this movie it is excellent to look at and listen to and dakota johnson gives us a worthy introduction to an excellent character from the comics i truly look forward to seeing her again at some point sadly i dont feel inclined to watch the movie again any time soon the issues which i assume to be caused primarily by unwelcome studio executive interference really block the character of madame web from having the unique and excellent movie she deserves
Feb 15 2024,positive,its a really fun movies it feels like the marvel movies before the mcu and i was missing that feeling its not like its my favorite movie but a movie to have a fun time the characters are great loved the dynamic i recommend it
Feb 15 2024,neutral,bad writing halfway decent plot idea its a bad movie but definitely watchable    the dialogue was cringe at times and there were more than a few continuity errors i would have cut out a large chunk of the important scenes
Feb 15 2024,positive,got into the action very fast and a new fresh take on superheros instead of just run and fight
Feb 15 2024,positive,unique take on the the spider man legacy intense enertaining an funnyl
Feb 15 2024,positive,if i could give it more stars i so would absolutely 2010 recommend this movie to anyone whos been waiting for the perfect female spiderman spidergwen doesnt really count because shes her own entity the storyline was superb and everything connected so good that my mind was blown got literal chills every 5 minutes which never happens when i watch movies go see it right now
Feb 15 2024,positive,im not sure why people are giving this movie such a bad wrap yes it had its moments but overall this movie was great the storyline was there and it left for a great continuation of the story as well as great character development stop hating
Feb 15 2024,negative,honestly i expected a lot more the girls did absolutely nothing they just followed orders and never took initiative to help the villain had no purpose for doing things it is clear that he is bad because yes they did not explain where he comes from either
Feb 15 2024,negative,i want my money back
Feb 15 2024,positive,interesting take on the character well worth the price of admission for the talent and action presented could be a great start to the spiderverse
Feb 15 2024,positive,aewsome job loved it  madame web reminded me of the 90s   spiderman cartoon
Feb 15 2024,negative,omg i dont think ive ever seen such a bad movie like the acting is so cringe throughout the whole movie you keep pausing to yourself like dang this is awful
Feb 15 2024,positive,shitty acting from villain could be funnier but solid watch
Feb 15 2024,negative,sony needs to sell the rights to spiderman to disney so we can get better spin off movies i loved dakota in suspiria 2018 she was casted incorrectly for this movie and frankly she deserves to be in better films
Feb 15 2024,negative,i lost a bet and had to go see madame web by myself on valentines day i was a couple minutes late and accidentally went to the wrong showing walking in half way through i only realized this when the credits rolled after 1 hour of sitting down as painful as it was i felt like i cheated the bet so i walked over to the correct showing of madame web that was also half way through it was only during this second viewing of the second half of madame web that made me realize what an absolute masterpiece this was
Feb 15 2024,negative,boring boring boring    subpar performances and story telling
Feb 15 2024,positive,absolute must watch loved the story loved the action even cried a little in a couple scenes sure its not for everyone but if its for you youll laugh cry and cheer
Feb 15 2024,positive,the movie was great the people sitting around us  not so much
Feb 15 2024,positive,great movie perfect beginning to a great film series hopefully i loved everything about it 4stars because at times the pacing was off like having short parts that needed to be longer or long parts that shouldve been shorter regardless great movie overall it surpassed my expectations by 1000
Feb 15 2024,positive,madame web stands on its own as a decent installment to sonys spiderverse that being said it wasnt awful but there were small i didnt like all in all though solid film
Feb 15 2024,negative,terribly written and produced some humor landed but not enough to make up for the price of admission
Feb 15 2024,neutral,not bad but not good its just there
Feb 15 2024,positive,star wars is a great series and i love how they did yoda in this movie the lightsaber fights in this movies were phenomenal and the cgi for the nonhuman creatures was amazing i really felt it when darth vader said i am your father madame web on the other hand was absolutely horrendous
Feb 15 2024,negative,horrific like actually so bad it cant be humorous terrified that anyone thought this could lead to anything especially if those people are execs absolutely garbage
Feb 15 2024,negative,the movie was absolutely terrible cringy and deserved a way better story start to finish lazy writing
Feb 15 2024,negative,madam web left me lost in its convoluted mess the plot felt more like a madefortv drama than a gripping movie experience save yourself from this web of nonsense
Feb 15 2024,negative,this movie is horrible the acting the lack of a functioning plot line and the director are all to blame for this flop it should have been so much better
Feb 15 2024,negative,honestly the worst movie ive ever seen
Feb 15 2024,positive,the action the group effort to work together
Feb 15 2024,negative,a movie with three extremely interesting and cool spiderpeople who in the end spoiler are not gonna become spiderpeople in the actual movie talk about false marketing   the villain had no real motive nor backstory the acting was flat and theres just so much potential wasted by sony once again this is an origin story without the actual origin
Feb 15 2024,positive,better than people are saying but definitely not the best
Feb 15 2024,positive,couldve been more but in my opinion it was good 
Feb 15 2024,negative,it had potential until the three annoying bad acting girls showed up then it went downhill movie didnt make any sense it was awful
Feb 15 2024,negative,i was going into the movie thinking the critic reviews were harsh and not fair however i realized they were 100 in saying the movie is a miserable train ambulance wreck this movie can be summed up in one word dreadful
Feb 15 2024,positive,good movie to watch with your family its not bad its entertaining i would say its okay
Feb 15 2024,positive,other than a horribly acted main villain and a few plot holes i thought the movie was entertaining enough and a good origin story for madame web
Feb 15 2024,positive,decent story acting was meh has potential
Feb 15 2024,negative,ohhh mynot only was this straight trash it was also the reason i went straight home and drank a bottle of moonshineterrible from start to finish sony  marvel should be ashamed of themselves for supplying such garbage to the big screen i wouldnt buy this on bootleg from the guy in the walmart parking lot
Feb 15 2024,negative,its a no go this is by no means a marvel movie i understand its not part of the mcu but this was absolute garbage storyline was horrid actors were decent but holy s do not feel a need to watch this film wait for it to come to streaming or simply dont waste your time and money at all
Feb 15 2024,negative,the acting was pretty bad it had the potential to be a good story but it really wasnt
Feb 15 2024,negative,had hopes for this movie went in thinking that if anything it might explain whats going on with the rest of the sony spiderverse movies was severely disappointed came out like a c class movie and every plot point hit like sandpaper on an open wound i would not recommend to anybody
Feb 15 2024,positive,wasnt bad just needed a little bit more to it a few spots had me excited but they had a hard time following thru and keeping it going if you know anything about the characters from the comics johnson was excellent as cassandra
Feb 15 2024,positive,movie was honestly really good rotten tomatoes critics often dont know what a good movie looks like in my opinion never trust what they say and always just go and watch it for yourself and form your own opinion they gave this movie a 16 but it deserves way higher
Feb 15 2024,positive,very entertaining it was funny nostalgic and moving good job everyone
Feb 15 2024,negative,save your money  watch paint dry it has better character development
Feb 15 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie go watch it for yourself maybe not  the top  paid actors you wish you wish for but they all did capture my attention and kept me engaged
Feb 15 2024,negative,no exaggeration the worst film ive ever seen
Feb 15 2024,positive,the movie was great 
Feb 15 2024,negative,slow and kinda pointless left with more questions than before i watched it get ready to see more plot armor than youve ever seen smh 
Feb 15 2024,neutral,ill be honest without spoiling the entire film  imo its an origin story but the trailer is very miss leading  lots of teasers and easter eggs but not a lot of what the studio uses to lure you in with the trailer
Feb 15 2024,neutral,it was okay but no real plot
Feb 15 2024,positive,not bad but could have been better
Feb 15 2024,positive,hits nostalgia and is not as bad as they say
Feb 15 2024,positive,great movie looks like potential for a second one in the future
Feb 15 2024,negative,very underwhelming   expected more from sony tbh
Feb 15 2024,positive,i liked the girl power
Feb 15 2024,positive,if you rated this anything lower than 4 stars then you shouldnt be allowed to rate things most of you arent even real fans and just want something to be negative about well thats what x is for this movie was better than expected and actually had good fight scenes with a great story easter egg with peter too the one bad part was that they left the end scene credit out
Feb 15 2024,negative,it was great at some points in the movie as a marvel fan i didnt really love it or enjoy it as much i feel like it was not worth the time to watch it personally some peoples opinions may differ but i most certainly think that this film couldve been better since it was a marvel production
Feb 15 2024,positive,awesome wished there were more superpower scenes but great origin story overall
Feb 15 2024,negative,not a superhero movie  sucked beyond belief
Feb 15 2024,negative,the worst superh whatever movie ever  a complete messsssss
Feb 15 2024,positive,being a massive fan of dakota johnson i had to see this film   even though this film was very slow building and some of the plot didnt make sense  i did enjoy it particularly the cinematography  i feel it was the right cast but just the script didnt really do it justice to what it could be  i am hoping there is a sequel as i still enjoyed it but get better screenwriters as the story felt a bit pieced together 
Feb 15 2024,positive,very entertaining movie will make a madamebillion dollars
Feb 15 2024,negative,the writing and acting was so bad
Feb 15 2024,positive,it is not that bad you can enjoy a simple and fun story the movie did not try explain too much just put some characters in a bowl and add the most simple story line that they could
Feb 15 2024,positive,must see many points in this movie obvious and so im not so obvious but i dont wanna give spoilers it connects many movies and is the foundation of whats to come  the acting affects and everything else around the whole movie process were top notch this is a muchneeded movie for our universe as well as others in the multiverse
Feb 15 2024,negative,i wanted to die watching this movie like actually rather just die than sit there and watch it
Feb 15 2024,negative,ayo lemme get this straight  so shawty got hit by a fireworkunderwater that blinded her cmon bruh this director should retire  live off grid for the rest of eternity im appalled i was scammed into spending more than a nickel to see this movie not 100 positive but i believe i woulda rather been buried alive
Feb 15 2024,positive,the movie kept me entertained and asking questions overall i enjoyed it
Feb 15 2024,positive,its a good film to take on a new character its really a side story i dont see how to integrate it into a spideyverse its not the film of the century but its a good film to see especially for comic book fans
Feb 15 2024,positive,considering all things it is not that terrible not that great either i love the apperances of actors i wouldnt expect in a marvel movie and dakota johnson is alright what i didnt like is the writing at times it was alright but at times it was terrible why does sony do this though is a great question there is potential within the movie i suppose but sony being sony
Feb 15 2024,positive,i liked the movie i might have to watch it a second time to fully love it dakota johnson did spectacular so did the girls in the movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,its a good movie if you like a thillerslasher movie and dont care about the origins of madame web besides that it was enjoyable to watch
Feb 15 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Feb 15 2024,negative,dont watch this bs spiderman didnt even pop up flashbacks was goin crazy whole movie im still confused tbh
Feb 15 2024,positive,i honestly enjoyed it there was a couple of parts where the cgi sucked but other than that i enjoyed the story
Feb 15 2024,positive,amazing movie definitely worth it i will spend money to get a hard copy of this film
Feb 15 2024,positive,ok movie still bummed why sony doesnt let marvel studios handle all the spiderman related characters and sony can still produce the movies but under marvel studioss creative direction
Feb 15 2024,neutral,crazy how they changed the uncle ben quote to him getting it from a fortune cookie then having madame web change it into something worst    the red carpet pictorial was better than the whole movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,this movie sucked ass
Feb 15 2024,negative,they disrespect spiderman stop making spiderman spin offs
Feb 15 2024,negative,cant believe this is a sony movie worst superheroe movie ever feels like a fan made bad movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,yes it really is that bad
Feb 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed the fresh take on the story and building out the universe with more characters
Feb 15 2024,positive,good movie dont listen to critics
Feb 15 2024,positive,decent family movie simple yet entertaining good origin story looking forward to madam webs next appearance  sequel dont go expecting a big scale marvel superhero movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,this film is a snooze fest wooden dialogue the lack of character development to care very little action in this movie i dont think there is
Feb 15 2024,negative,i wanted this to be good as i love dakota johnson but sadly it wasnt very good  she was the only actressactor i liked in the film though  solidifies the 50 shades movies as better which is not praise  i think dakota should do more serious films than stuff like this     i also am familiar with the comic book characters and nothing felt right about that aspect but going in and based on movies and tv shows disney and most other studios have done of late i wasnt expecting it to be  i was mostly going for the acting and to judge how the director framed shows and transitions but nothing stood out  even the soundtrack lacked but again no surprise there either    also why did this come out today its not a valentines day movie in any way i miss a decade ago when we got films like that now we get this
Feb 15 2024,positive,i am a film critic for the greatestmoviescom now i havent seen this movie yet but this looks like the greatest movie ever made next to morbius now i see a lot of reviews that were horrible movies but got five star reviews so im trying to level the field
Feb 15 2024,negative,dakotah johnson sounds like she is about to cry for most of her lines i feel like the industry peppers her in places to see where she might fit without asking the audience if it works she is not a comedian and she is not an action star there is just way too many corny lines that watching this was painful this movie was a nonstarter maybe go back to having focus groups before giving us a movie we didnt ask for
Feb 15 2024,negative,this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen was it written by an eighth grader
Feb 15 2024,negative,if youre considering watching this movie as i was just a few hours ago i strongly advise you to rethink that insane idea this is the single worst piece of cinema i have ever had the misfortune of witnessing the dialogue is laughable and full of meaningless conversations even dakota johnson couldnt save this train wreck yeah just dont do it to yourself im begging
Feb 15 2024,negative,not the worst sonymarvel movie actually but madame web is a mess strange and weird movie the plot were boring and its not the superhero movies we expected to see sydnee sweeny plays julia good
Feb 15 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie isnt meant to be a masterpiece like the critics and the pseudocritics desire its just a good superheroine movie with a great story a great cast and great 2003 soundtrack let aside the hate of the internet and go see the movie and have fun a movie dont need to be always a oscarworthy movies are also about fun i hope we get a sequel of madame web
Feb 15 2024,positive,read the critic reviews before seeing this and i think they were off a lot of criticism about the pacing and movie being slow i would argue the slower pace was what made this movie better than newer disney marvel movies too many superhero movies rush from action scene to action scene without developing characters this was a return to the original formula of getting to know a character and watching them develop their powers really liked it and i didnt find it boring there were thrilling moments throughout the film definitely like sony marvel more than disney marvel these days
Feb 15 2024,negative,sj parker is a tv director who has never created a show besides mistress which was terrible never written a film script or had to do anything original at her helm and it shows dialogue is so bad the shot selections are idiotic and take you out of the movie she kept adding lines explaining what the characters were thinking when it was obvious its like she thinks the audience is mentally disabled studios need to hire talent female directors that have proven themselves not this i hope she is never allowed to make a movie again stick to basic cable she was unqualified and clearly never read the comics and it looks like she hates comics it was almost like she was making fun of comic book stories shockingly horrible no one should watch this the poor actors were trying so hard to save this movie but couldnt could have easily been an awesome movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,the story line is everywhere so confused at the end theres so many holes in the film
Feb 15 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,looking for the next
Feb 15 2024,negative,what an embarrassing steaming pile of diarrhea
Feb 15 2024,positive,ending gave me chills cant wait for more of madame web
Feb 15 2024,positive,it is like seeing an oldschool superhero movie seasoned with suspense great cast it is a must for sony to connect with any spiderverse
Feb 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed it even though it was a bit slow at times
Feb 15 2024,positive,i wasnt expecting much after the low critics scores but i dont know what movie they were watching this is one of the better marvel films that has come out in the last couple years it was very intense the action was very thrilling imho all the ladies did great in their roles and the villain was one of the better antagonists ive seen in a marvel film in a while i highly recommend this movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,a refreshing thriller with lots of action l it felt like the same pace of the series loki left us wanting to watch more but also satisfied cant wait to see what else they create out of this universe with more spider girls
Feb 15 2024,positive,this was such a good movie i seriously am starting to simply despise all movie critics as being bandwagon jumpers
Feb 15 2024,positive,not a bad addition to the marvel franchises but i would have liked the overall story either be focused on just madame webb or a full blown origin story for all four main characters  as it was the flashes of their futures was lacking  i did enjoy the film and will most likely watch it again when it is released to streaming
Feb 15 2024,positive,i think its a pretty good movie definitely a bit corny in terms of dialogue and moments some issues with audio and visual recording mainly with the antagonist the writing isnt top tier however its still a pretty good movie i feel that more good outweighs the bad it works as an origin story and im pretty excited to see where they go with it
Feb 15 2024,negative,that audience score can never even be right
Feb 15 2024,negative,it has potential unfortunately its all over the place and the storyline is low  key bad
Feb 15 2024,positive,wow blown away amazing movie 5 stars
Feb 15 2024,positive,i dont understand why the reviews are so low even though this was by sony it finally felt like a marvel movie it was slow at times but the storytelling was absolutely phenomenal the acting was on point marvel finally got back to storytelling which is always the strongest part about marvel go see the movie and ignore the critic reviews this is a great movie the easter eggs in this movie were phenomenal i cant wait to see see this spiderverse really get going
Feb 15 2024,negative,corny any overall boring
Feb 15 2024,negative,this film started out well but seems out of place in the grand story i dont recommend based on this story being completely irrelevant
Feb 15 2024,positive,they just dont make movies like this anymore its some of the worst directing and campiest acting youve ever seen but the movie is very self aware and consistent in its voice its a breath of fresh air in a world full of repetitive origin stories and superhero movies that all have the same ending cant wait to see the sequel
Feb 15 2024,negative,over acted felt dubbed and unintentionally corny
Feb 15 2024,positive,i dont understand why people hate this film its good
Feb 15 2024,positive,my family and i loved it
Feb 15 2024,negative,i wanted it to be good  the writing directing and acting was awful
Feb 15 2024,negative,i havent seen all the marvel movies but ive seen most of them and this is by far the worst the bad guy is just poorly dubbed half the time and this even happens for the main character cassie a few times the story is halfbaked and makes very little sensedont see this
Feb 15 2024,positive,movie was great the story itself was very cool the way they portrayed madame webs powers was awesome and the villain was also very cool i will definitely see it again 
Feb 15 2024,positive,normal movie it amazing for me cause madame web begin for everything of spider web
Feb 15 2024,negative,its a trainwreck so much bad its hard where to start the villains acting stands out to me as most terrible
Feb 15 2024,positive,i loved it  the action was good  johnson did an awesome job playing madam webb i liked how realistic it was and the storyline
Feb 15 2024,positive,this is a begin hero when you were seeing the movie in period same of amazing spiderman and i want to see next more
Feb 15 2024,negative,let me start off by saying this is by far one of the worst movies ive ever seen this movie was shameful the story goes nowhere the characters are bland and uninteresting and the dialogue is complete and utter garbage anyone who leaves a good review is either lying or has never seen a movie before id like to personally let the writers directors and editors that they have reached their low point and should find a new profession there is absolutely no care put into the characters the acting in this movie might be the worst part adam scott was the only one who actually delivered lines well though he wasnt given much to work with if you or someone you know worked on this movie please seek help you have made the biggest pile of trash ive ever seen disgraceful
Feb 15 2024,positive,the movie was good not great i think that the concept alone is a cool idea but not executed well enough when it should have an enjoyable movie that im assuming is setting up something for the future not much action or fighting at all and the girls were never suited up other villain was okay nothing special  would rewatch it again in the background while doing something and would wait to stream it 
Feb 15 2024,negative,horrible voice acting for a lot of the film story falls flat every time it tries to pick up bad cuts terrible  highly noticeable lip sync issues with ezekiel for the entire film special effects editing has its good and very bad moments entertainingly bad
Feb 15 2024,positive,i like this movie cause normal timeline in ny2000 not over hero
Feb 15 2024,negative,dont waste your money
Feb 15 2024,negative,hearing people walking out of the theaters 30 minutes into the movie says it all
Feb 15 2024,positive,far from great but far from terrible too the script is weak but the directing saves it the villain is much better than recent villains in comic book films dakota johnsons acting was pitiful though overall not as bad as everyone makes it seem
Feb 15 2024,negative,yikes what a horrible movie i dont know how this has a 68 on the audience score because this is among the worst movies ive ever seen im not even gonna waste my time talking about why this is bad so ill just tell you now dont watch it
Feb 15 2024,positive,this movie was so good and dakota johnson looked and acted fabulous
Feb 15 2024,positive,this movie rules i hope they make 6 more of these
Feb 15 2024,negative,the movie was okay up until the end but the ending was corny
Feb 15 2024,negative,not even motivated to watch the commercials for this movie and why was this an idea to make i have no idea definitely one youd want to save the price of admission for something else like a great dinner with a date
Feb 15 2024,negative,i just this is not only not really a super hero movie its hard to say just what i watched its a mess and wastes some interesting actresses in a script that had to be partially created by ai
Feb 15 2024,positive,we had the honor of attending the premiere last night in la and this movie is full of action mystery suspense sisterhood and girl power it is perfect for date night or a family movie night everyone will love it the best part is that if you are a fan of marvel movies you dont have to see any previous movies to understand madame web this movie stands alone with a phenomenal cast and great story line it is rated pg13 and it is 1 hour and 54 minutes  there are also no mid or end credit scenes
Feb 15 2024,positive,i liked it it was different  funny dakota and sydney were great in it i like seeing majority female cast editing was off in a few areas but ive seen much worse
Feb 15 2024,negative,horrid awful story awful plot awful characters
Feb 15 2024,negative,contrived poor acting and misleading sony please try hard
Feb 15 2024,positive,trashy hilarious fun if youve seen venom you know exactly what to expect buy extra popcorn to throw at the screen
Feb 15 2024,positive,i actually liked it idk
Feb 15 2024,negative,poor acting crying scenes with no tears deadpan performance by the lead actress weird backstory seemed rushed and just boring all the way around for a marvel movie another dud
Feb 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed it alote but the beginning was kinda bland but then it got better i liked how they put spider man as a baby witch we never scean peter as a baby before but like the fnaf movie the critics tackled it too much so for this one i would say dont trust the critics i would probably buy this movie no doubt
Feb 15 2024,positive,i honestly was baffled and delighted by this movie they did a nice job of revealing motivations for why characters behaved the way they did i thought the acting was superb i felt i was learning the main characters powers at the same time they were figuring it out really fun watch
Feb 15 2024,negative,there are not enough words to express how absolutely lame this movie is  a complete waste of space marvel is dead
Feb 15 2024,negative,honestly that was the worst movie ive watched in 12mths  disjointed and action scenesnot many for the length were just a lot of flashes of single scenes  marvel should be ashamed and pepsi cola invested in the wrong movie  made aquaman look like an oscar winner
Feb 15 2024,positive,this movie was fantastic it presented a compelling plot and storyline something lacking in many recent superhero franchise films definitely a mustsee
Feb 15 2024,negative,good lord this was a mess  terrible editing disaster of a plot completely diverged from its source material and a cast that seemed to know it was going to be hot garbage even during filming  i really miss the days of good comic movies  i really want to start looking forward to them again but stuff like this ruins that
Feb 15 2024,positive,we went to see this movie for valentines day and we enjoyed it  the special effects were great  i hope that they come out with a second movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,dull overly complicated in its plotting and riddled with sloppy editing stilted performances and poor character development madame web is a spiderman spinoff thats so bad i had to resort to quoting jay sherman from the critic hotchie motchie it stinks
Feb 15 2024,positive,its fresh makes you feel suspense amazing story i like it
Feb 15 2024,positive,this movie is not near as bad as the current reviews for it i found it to be engaging and interesting sometimes the dialogue was a little awkward and the action sequences were a little jumbled and hard to follow but overall it was an enjoyable movie to add to the super hero genre there are only so many comic book characters that can get a movie can be made about so at this point i almost do not fault them when some do not land as well
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was very good it was worth seeing it really surprised me a lot
Feb 15 2024,negative,starts out ok but then the dialogue gets worse the story gets more muddled and all the performances take a dive this was a huge whiff and one of the most poorly directed and shot films in recent memory
Feb 15 2024,positive,whomever wrote this should be banned from mcu this more like a dc movie some of the dialog is worst than dune the writer has no clue about the madam web character at all
Feb 15 2024,positive,story was solid and linear the acting wasnt the best but the characters were enjoyable
Feb 15 2024,negative,the believability of the plot and everything and anything that happens is zero  the character development is zero  i had zero care in the world about any one of the characters  i didnt thing marvel could get worsethey did
Feb 15 2024,negative,was waiting for nothing still disappointed   probably the worst marvel movie ever made with morbius and quantumania
Feb 15 2024,positive,great origin story for looks like itll be a spectacular trilogy so much fun and smartly put together    perfectly wove the spiderverse into it cant wait to see the sequels
Feb 15 2024,negative,simply ass movie by sony
Feb 15 2024,negative,if you cant enjoy a movie when its poorly made dont see this if you dont care how poorly made a movie is you just like costumes and action go see it the best part of this movie was the soundtrack consisting of 2000s divas the script is bad the editing is awful and most of the dialogue feels like a mad lib
Feb 15 2024,negative,terrible dialouge and editing just awkward amateur and basic
Feb 15 2024,negative,this is worse than the marvels garbage if anyone in gunpoint told me to either rewatch madame web or the marvels id ask them to shoot me dead
Feb 15 2024,positive,this was a fun watch  really hope to see them again honestly  
Feb 15 2024,positive,i thought it was quite refreshing honestly didnt need many action scenes to tell a nice story acting wasnt the greatest but seemed to get better as the movie went on also sydney sweeney is my new crush lol
Feb 15 2024,negative,the worst marvel ive ever seen like literally do not make a sequel 
Feb 15 2024,negative,one of the worst superhero films in the past 20 years
Feb 15 2024,positive,dakota and the kids are great theres a weird dub for the villain with horrible onthenose dialogue in his scenes but hes not the true focus of the film is he
Feb 15 2024,negative,what ever you do dont pay to watch this it was bambling incoherent mess
Feb 15 2024,positive,its a good movie not perfect but a good and funny one  i dont know why people are complaining about the lack of action the powers of her are not physical i think its a good balance of action  if you dont go to the theater expecting something bad you will enjoying the movie    my rate is a solid 7910
Feb 15 2024,negative,pains me to say that this is one of the worst comic book movies ive ever seen and one of my worst of this year the cast was wasted the editing in this is atrocious but none of it matches how horrendous the writing in this is the story was a great concept but it was executed in every wrong way possible the villain was laughably bad and for a superhero movie there was almost nothing superhero and there was no fun whatsoever to have with this besides the diner scene maybe this makes morbius look like grand budapest hotel
Feb 15 2024,positive,great background story telling of madame web for those that dont know about the character it had its comedic scenes and a great build up overall highly recommend to watch
Feb 15 2024,negative,i dont know what sony is trying to do but damn it was so boring and cringe seeing that movie i recommend to watch morbius better
Feb 15 2024,negative,i dont know where to start      i like bad movies sometimes i can see the value of a good laugh this wasnt a film i wanted to end up like that yet thats what this ended up being not even a goodbad film just a really tough watch i feel for dakota johnson and sidney sweeney though they actually had some of the better acting moments in the film also shout out to isabel merced she was good too the film felt like the editing team didnt know what to do and just left broll in scenes hung too long and others telegraphed their relation to the end of the film way too hard the villain was also justbad it was a bad experience overall
Feb 15 2024,negative,the movie is so terribly flawed that its just not worth seeing starting with dakota johnson who is possibly the worst choice for a marvel movie tbh she was hard to watch in this movie the story line and the nearly all female cast leaves much to be desired special effects too were lacking
Feb 15 2024,positive,madam web is clearly meant to set up a new marvel universe weather this happens or not is yet to be seen but the film itself was inoffensive it had some interesting ideas ok action soso characters  a story that piques my curiosity for the future lets see where this thread takes us hopefully without any tangling
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was not what i expected but worth checking out  the story was interesting and even had me laughing at times
Feb 15 2024,positive,this movie concept was way better than expectations this is the best movie that could be possibly made based on source material  left me on the edge of my seat unique way to showing clairvoyance
Feb 15 2024,positive,a very good story which starts off a little slow and maybe could need some more work but holds well true out is it one of the all top marvel movies no but its definitely a very good and sometimes suspenseful  fun ride all actors are very good just wish we got to see the spider costumes a little more but thats fine the visuals are what i liked the most especially whit cassandras visions plus the action was good wish we got even more of it tough over all very happy whit this movie i hope somehow we see these characters again
Feb 15 2024,positive,awesome cast movie and ending
Feb 15 2024,positive,i heard a lot of bad things about this movie but went to see it on opening night anyway the movie is much better than critics make it out to be no its not the usual spiderman movie and it has no extra scene you have to have an extra scene but the story is quite interesting it is the typical kids in a superhero movie but it focuses on outwitting the bad guy not overpowering them casting was good except the villain overall pretty good
Feb 15 2024,negative,the villains acting was horrible not only that i literally fell asleep during the movie twice im a huge marvel fan and this is for sure the worst marvel film
Feb 15 2024,positive,good to see marvel trying something new and exploring new characters its exciting to see more world building beginning to cement new characters into the mcu   the story was thrilling and kept me on edge as well as amusing to see familiar faces and names from a different perspective
Feb 15 2024,positive,definitely go see this movie madame web  i loved it  i was mesmerized throughout the entire two hours of the movie as were all other members of my group  i dont understand these critics  were they watching the same movie  the girls were great and their onscreen chemistry was high  the only fault i found was that we didnt see dakota and the girls in their suits more often
Feb 15 2024,positive,way too much and yet not enough fun but only after half of the movie is over
Feb 15 2024,positive,i went to see this movie in wednesday night valentines day this movie was so great i think this is a good movie madame web better than all the movies that have come out years ago if you trying to see this movie im going to let you know if you are waiting for postcredit scenes you are wasting your time for this movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,i dont know if id say the dialogue is cringy but it definitely isnt good the choices made with dialogue as well as imagery to connect this film to a character who hasnt been born in this universe yet were definitely cringy to me overall the story wasnt great i would love to see the 3 up and coming heroinesactresses in future stories but this film most likely put an end to that
Feb 15 2024,negative,one of the worst i have ever seen
Feb 15 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this film a basic marvel movie that reminds me of a 2000s comic book film and i love that about it dakota johnson gives a great performance
Feb 15 2024,positive,was the movie the best quality in the world absolutely not do i need three more movies absolutely i do because oh my god was there an issue for most of the movie with the syncing of the audio yea did i care more about what happened to the characters more than i have for most of the movies ive seen in recent time 10000
Feb 15 2024,negative,just when i thought a marvel movie could not get any worse than the recent flops i see they have hit a new low with this mess
Feb 15 2024,negative,bad doesnt begin to describe this movie the acting  the dialogue the plot full of holes maybe it was made for kids even then most kids movies arent this bad i tried to give it a shot and i was horribly disappointed save your money
Feb 15 2024,positive,very different interesting twist
Feb 15 2024,positive,not as bad as people are saying critics are sad people
Feb 15 2024,negative,dallas johnson not good in this movie it was silly but entertaining    madame web
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was a great movie that stayed relatively comic accurate i would recommend the movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,it was bad i went to the premiere for the hell of it and i have to say the select actors were a solid choice but the direction of the movie was over all mid and the villain was mediocre
Feb 15 2024,positive,intense emotional and nostalgic
Feb 15 2024,positive,loved it the cast was awesome too
Feb 15 2024,positive,its a very good movie it respects the character very well and does not get bored the work done is appreciated since he is a very difficult character to bring to the big screen i hope to see one more together with the 3 spiderwomens
Feb 15 2024,negative,a waste of time nothing more to say
Feb 15 2024,negative,i literally fell asleep from how boring the movie was
Feb 15 2024,positive,i rate this movie a 7 out of 10
Feb 15 2024,positive,amazing the scenes were intense and suspenseful in all the right places perfect comedic timing acting was astounding felt it was a real homage to the comics only downside was the villain i felt he maybe wasnt best suited to role his physical capabilities were insane but his acting i felt fell flat other than an a defo must see planning on seeing it again in a weeks time
Feb 15 2024,positive,horrible movie i want to die please
Feb 15 2024,negative,madame web like morbius doesnt justify its existence the film is a cringe fest i dont recommend it
Feb 15 2024,positive,honestly pretty good story i adored the characters and the pacing of it my only complaint was the quality of the movie and filming you could tell when someone was being voiced over by their lips not matching the sound and there was a lot of frame drops other than the lacking quality i loved the movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,not as enterainring as other marvel movies seems like they just spent the whole movie budget on the cast and not on the actual movie
Feb 15 2024,negative,why does this film exist and why are we going to watch it
Feb 15 2024,positive,its amazing i love it
Feb 15 2024,positive,you so called critics who hated this movie need to get the stick out of your  will it win a oscar no but it was sooooo much better than marvels or aquaman dont let those stinkers stop you from going its a really fun wild ride and dakota johnson is really wonderful
Feb 15 2024,negative,hot garbage anyone that tells you otherwise is lying doesnt even count as a superhero movie in my book cuz the characters never get their powers or suits any image youve seen of them in costume was a vision the finale consists of dakota johnson basically using her ability to see the future to tell them duck now jump at this point sony making spiderman movies without spiderman feels like some kind of money laundering scheme
Feb 15 2024,negative,bad pacing bad writing bad acting just everything about this movie was bad in some way i honestly cant express how boring the first 34 of the film are meanwhile the last quarter is a jumbled mess thats rushing to get everything done before the 2 hour mark ending quite abruptly with one of the worst endings ive ever seen just save your money and save your time
Feb 15 2024,negative,its funny to watch how bad it is
Feb 15 2024,positive,i understand that it was an origin movie now i was expecting a lot more costumes and action but im looking forward to seeing the next installment
Feb 15 2024,positive,i loved all the characters they did an awsome job 
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was a good entry that might have used some brushing up with respect to the dialogue the final destination like ability was pretty cool and seeing the origin story of the character was enjoyable hopefully sony sticks to tying the live action entries together
Feb 15 2024,negative,oof a lot of nothing cast did very well
Feb 15 2024,negative,for the love of god stop letting people with no talent make movies
Feb 15 2024,positive,honestly it was very good yes some parts were a bit awkward and cheesy but its a marvel movie its meant to be for kids and teens im definitely buying it when it comes out
Feb 15 2024,positive,i think its definitely worth a watch
Feb 15 2024,positive,the movie was slow but enjoyable because not every movie needs to be packed with action for future generations this is going to be good for the kids especially young girls
Feb 15 2024,negative,barley any action and the girls were only in suit for barley 2 minutes you can tell sony  has no idea what they are doing with this spiderman spin off universe bad acting and lacked action dont waste your time watching this
Feb 15 2024,negative,unbelievably boring and tired in its plot and script i dont understand how you make a spiderman film without spiderman the whole girl empowerment theme is so incredibly boring watching the movie was a form of torture that is not for the faint of heart dont waste your time or money
Feb 15 2024,negative, this movie plagued with illogical plot holes features three spiderwomen reduced to mere extras engaging in sarcastic banter while the best scenes seemingly fell victim to excessive editing       this movie plagued with illogical plot holes features three spiderwomen reduced to mere extras engaging in sarcastic banter while the best scenes seemingly fell victim to excessive editing
Feb 15 2024,positive,its a good film if you grew up watching or reading spiderman you will probably enjoy this movie the camera work is amazing and they do a great job showing the difference between madame web powers and ezekiel sims powers the characters are pretty cool and overall its a good film not the best but not the worst
Feb 15 2024,negative,this movie just flat out sucks
Feb 15 2024,negative,that was the worst spiderman movie i have ever watched the worst one ever created
Feb 14 2024,positive,i thought this movie was amazing especially for an origin story i was very excited about it and i hope everyone else ignores all the negative reviews and goes to watch it for themselves i cant wait for the story to be continued ill be at the movie theater every time to be eating my popcorn and watching
Feb 14 2024,positive,overall a good movie gets corny the last 10 minutes so just be ready for that
Feb 14 2024,positive,enthralling to watch the action scenes were thrilling and well balanced with the story absolutely loved how they showed her powers excited to see where this goes and always a joy to see more things from the spiderverse
Feb 14 2024,negative,please dont waste your money and time
Feb 14 2024,negative,not even kidding when i say i feel dumber after watching this not even so bad its good i was going into this hoping for another so bad its good movie like morbius and somehow was still disappointed
Feb 14 2024,negative,madam web disappoints with a weak plot shallow characters and uninspired direction it lacks substance and coherence failing to justify its existence in the crowded superhero genre
Feb 14 2024,positive,very good movie i dont know why people are hating it so much its fun i didnt see bad acting or bad script okay fx are not excellent but still very good movie im hoping to see second movie or something with girls
Feb 14 2024,positive,it was an amazing movie she doesnt have super powers so if you want to see a movie with super hero this is not the movie the actors are amazing it was wellwritten so stop expecting so much and stop being a hater please
Feb 14 2024,positive,easily my favourite spumc movie i know its a low bar    some clunky writing set up for a sequel that wont happen a waste of some talented actors and eye rolling parker tieins aside i had a pretty fun time    none of the problems were dakota johnsons fault she was pretty good i enjoyed the future visions and there was some fun action    i also really enjoyed that it didnt look like it was filmed in a green screen cupboard like recent mcu stuff
Feb 14 2024,positive,its not that bad  not sure why the critics are marking it so low not perfect but enjoyable for these types of movies 
Feb 14 2024,negative,after the marvels i thought im not gonna see something worst i was wrong
Feb 14 2024,positive,its very mid kinda boring actually but dakota johnson is great
Feb 14 2024,positive,i personally really liked it theres a ton of fun references to spiderman media and its a really good setup for these characters a couple of the vfx shots were a little bit spotty but overall it was a fun movie
Feb 14 2024,positive,i honestly dont think its that bad like most critics say its true that the story is kind of flat and this movie would have been a better one in early 2000s when super hero movies just came out but to me at least this movie knows what its doing and does not attempt to overachieve the leading characters ability is also more on the strategic side so its not like she would be shooting webs and crawl all over the walls like spiderman does its also much better than most superhero movies came out last year it knows what its doing and it does a decent job
Feb 14 2024,negative,the worst super hero film or just film ive ever seen  worth seeing just because of how hilariously bad it is  drink before watching
Feb 14 2024,negative,no action no suits no nothing theres like 2 min max of action with suits which is in his dream
Feb 14 2024,positive,more or less the movie but i love it because my favorite spider female is anya corazon and i hope in the future isabela merced coming back as anya corazon solo movie 
Feb 14 2024,negative,im sorry but this was completely unwatchable
Feb 14 2024,positive,liked this way better than the other reviewers did it wasnt perfect but it certainly was fun
Feb 14 2024,positive,i understand where the frustration is coming from these days we have something called social media that highers the expectations of people everyone thought there will be at least one of our spidermen tobey andrew tom showing up and when they actually saw the movie no it didnt happen they also wanted to see some action from the female spideys no that didnt happen     i mean the movie is literally called madame web so shouldnt it be more logical to show her origins and make the movie more about her thats what they did also its just the first movie where they are introducing four new characters on the silverscreens so whatever they showed i think its enough theres no postcredit scene is that bothering people so much oh come on its sony they dont like to play with postcredits it was decent to me     funny how social media always works one person bashes a content and then weve got another army of peeps coming up right then to bash the same content it seems as if everyone has lost their individual opinions these days and choose to go with what the mass audience says
Feb 14 2024,positive,great movie i hope they make a sequel
Feb 14 2024,positive,critics are being mean for no reason great movie 
Feb 14 2024,positive,genuinely do not understand all the overly harsh reviews this is a fun movie with a great cast and not nearly as bad as everyone is making it out to be
Feb 14 2024,negative,rolling stones put it perfectly madame web isnt as bad a youve heard its so much worse sony please stop l
Feb 14 2024,negative,script was horrible and plot was dumb
Feb 14 2024,positive,the movie was excellent  great story from start to finish
Feb 14 2024,positive,honestly i had a great time watching madame web it isnt citizen kane but its fine for a superhero movie it feels very early aughts which might have been an issue to some but i loved it it felt nostalgic dakota did a good job with what she had to work it the rest of the cast was fine too
Feb 14 2024,positive,the most movie to movie ever it had actors a director it had a story it is truly the film of all time
Feb 14 2024,positive,comparing it to the ssu films madame web is the best
Feb 14 2024,positive,it was good but couldve been better
Feb 14 2024,positive,very slow start but excelled at the end making it a good film
Feb 14 2024,positive,it was a pretty good movie kept me entertained the whole time
Feb 14 2024,negative,best part is the pepsi product placement 
Feb 14 2024,positive,well i went to see it on imax and it did not disappointed too much  yes it might be a bit slow and difficult to track but overall it is a good movie i would watch it again
Feb 14 2024,positive,great movie cant wait to see part 2
Feb 14 2024,positive,the story jumped around too much maybe later we will learn more about the 3 girls
Feb 14 2024,positive,intriguing movie with a good start but fails to make use of the spidermen like characters action wise
Feb 14 2024,positive,the film is ok fun you can watch and relax but it would be better if it were straight to streaming
Feb 14 2024,positive,peak fiction
Feb 14 2024,positive,its a pleasant movie much better than i expected considering all the bad reviews i could read i enjoyed it
Feb 14 2024,positive,i can honestly say i think that this movie was a perfect beginning to something greater    also i got to meet one of the writers parents talk about one in infinite
Feb 14 2024,positive,the film is incredible the chemistry between the characters is incredible it seems like they are sisters in real life and were born to be together
Feb 14 2024,positive,so first off this movie was not in promotion mode at all let me just say that secondly this movie was set  in 2003 and thats exactly what the movie looked like and felt like as well it was kind of ben afflecks daredevil feel to it but the movie was good it was watchable i gave it 4 stars because the acting was phenomenal and the story line was great now this movie is a originintro to the marvel cinematic also there is no post credit scene i repeat no post credit scene but go watch the movie it is enjoyable
Feb 14 2024,positive,a novel approach to the spiderman legend not too long and very enjoyable i liked the actors appearing in this story i hope marvel continue this storyline
Feb 14 2024,positive,the movie is really good cast did the really good job and the story is different yeah it is unlike other marvel movies but not everything need to be going in the same direction always great movie to watch dakota did so good recommend    ps whole theater laughed at funny moments cassies humor etc so everyone that is writing the movie is really bad or bad acting apparently cant enjoy movies and is too critical have life guys comparing to other movies on the market this is like oscars
Feb 14 2024,negative,madame web a ridiculous title for a film without merit hollow empty without direction and extremely boring dakota shows a poor and weak performance if you can call her presence acting since she seems more like an acting student in her first performance which makes her look like deleted scenes from 50 shades of grey a mockery of the spiderman saga the worst thing sony has created even the villain is a mediocre parody of what a villain should be there is no way to argue anything positive about this movie its just a waste of time
Feb 14 2024,negative,another movie for a modern audience failed again the film editing was terrible and the movie was very difficult to watch
Feb 14 2024,negative,only because i cant give it nothing  dear god if you want to experience the first train wreck of 2024 then have fun for two mf hours baffled
Feb 14 2024,negative,i wasted my money on this shitty movie not worth watching its awful in everything cinemas must add a refund option for this kind of situations im so pissed i lost my money on something so gross and unwatchable
Feb 14 2024,negative,two questions first can we get rid of zasama and sharpless and second can we sue sonys marketing team this movie is not what the trailers told us it was
Feb 14 2024,positive,i dont know the comic bok version but as a single marvel story i really liked the story acting and the action was surprising  there is some humor in the beginning that i enjoy as well not amazing but not bad as well i dont regret ignoring the bad review online and going to see it
Feb 14 2024,positive,do not understand the hate people hate just to hate nowadays
Feb 14 2024,positive,really enjoyed the movie to be honest great characters and acting
Feb 14 2024,neutral,harmless expectations low
Feb 14 2024,positive,i loved this movie the soundtrack was great the acting was amazing and the action and comedy is definitely 5 stars but the camera work is a little bit strange because it randomly zooms in the writing could be dumb at times and the ending wasnt necessarily terrible but its definitely not good
Feb 14 2024,positive,perfect i love this move
Feb 14 2024,negative,this is not a good movie they just ruined spiderman it is sad that marvel will go down this route of horrible movie
Feb 14 2024,positive,madame web was a treat to watch dakota as casey web was exceptional the movie the story line every character will leave a mark its a must watch
Feb 14 2024,negative,one of the worst films ive ever seen horrendous writing directing audio cgi acting  you name it its awful nothing about this film is redeeming avoid it
Feb 14 2024,negative,the acting is horrible all spiderman movies before this one were great but absolutely not this venom and morbius blow this movie out the water
Feb 14 2024,negative,wish i had kept my money instead really dont waste your time the story is all over and makes no sense at all
Feb 14 2024,negative,the movie was not well paced often random things happend just to explain why the next thing is about to happen acting was alright but was also sometimes cringe through out the film there where countless cheap jumpscares which became annoying after the first 10 overall pretty mid film would suggest watching somthing with creativity
Feb 14 2024,negative,omg who gave this movie a green light  what a waste of money and actors this is going to be yet another megaflop
Feb 14 2024,positive,i enjoyed it not an overly exaggerated girl power action movie
Feb 14 2024,negative,the movie was awful it was some how worse than the marvels story was awful dialog horrible and zero chemistry between any of the characters wish i could have watched a morbius 2 at least that some what resembled the comics more than this trash
Feb 14 2024,positive,good movie wish it was more action
Feb 14 2024,negative,if i could give this movie zero stars i would and if anyone is giving it more than 2 they were paid to do it i have seen every marvel movie on opening day since iron man 3 and never have i been more disappointed not only was the script unrealisticly bad but there were so many moment of completely illegible adr that i completely missed plot points because i was so distracted by the mouths moving at completely different times and rhythms than the words being produced by the speakers im not a movie critic ill never claim to be one but the fact that sony released this movie is insulting to the people whose jobs it is to rate movie i paid 11 to watch that movie and spent 1hr and 54mins watching it and ive never wanted to or felt the need to ask for a refund before but today was almost that day to anyone reading these to reactions and reviews to decide whether or not to see the movie stop run dont waste your time  thank you for coming to my ted talk on my account that i literally created today to make this review to help other people from seeing this movie
Feb 14 2024,negative,the movie itself felt very slow the end i enjoyed very much overall not a bad movie i dont think it needed to be 2 hours long
Feb 14 2024,positive,i absolutely loved dakota she was so so good in madame web
Feb 14 2024,positive,decent movie not as bad as they say it is if youre looking for a true marvel type of movie thats going to rock you this isnt it but it will satisfy you for a bit for a couple of hours this is probably one for streaming or video
Feb 14 2024,negative,great effects and somewhat interesting characters onedimensional and predictable story doe  wouldnt recommend
Feb 14 2024,positive,very entertaining movie from beginning to end liked dakota with adam scott all the three girls were cute too
Feb 14 2024,positive,love it love it so worth watching again 
Feb 14 2024,positive,so good critics per usual are way too brutal with movies if we depended on the critics reviews for a good movie wed be searching countlessly   this was a dang good movie extremely underrated wildly entertaining and great plot considering most of the recent marvel movies have been subpar this was a refreshing one to give us in the midst of the marvel cinema drought   we need to stop comparing everything to early marvel no its not endgame yes its a dang good movie enjoy
Feb 14 2024,negative,i really wanted to like this movie that absolutely zero people were begging for  i thought the trailer looked better than i was expecting  but i was quickly beaten into submission with one exposition dump after exposition dump for both the titular character and the larger spiderverse at large  the story is needlessly laughable at times spider lore crammed in every nook and cranny  im not sure who this movie is for given that no one was asking for it
Feb 14 2024,positive,a film that if there was no connection with the sonyverse would have done very well
Feb 14 2024,positive,must see for spiderman fans its an entertaining movie
Feb 14 2024,negative,how do you make a spiderman spinoff movie with any mention of spiderman worst of all the pacing is rushed and story was very mid
Feb 14 2024,negative,seriously were there people out there who thought this was actually gonna be any good two of the worst writers currently working in hollywood a director at the helm of her first feature film and the movies lead firing her agent after the first and only trailer dropped and then going on an apology tour up until the movies release were all the tell tale signs of an absolute mess hitting the theatres an unmitigated disaster in every department especially in its editing my word how many cuts do really need in a single scene i did get a chuckle when they setup the potential for future sequels at the end you dont need to be clairvoyant to know that that aint happening
Feb 14 2024,positive,it was a pleasant surprise i was expecting something really bad but this movie was decent and at worst at the level of recent marvel productions
Feb 14 2024,positive,tbh this movie wasnt so bad sure it wasnt the best but i actually enjoyed dakota johnson sydney sweeney celestie and isabela performances its a 9510 for me
Feb 14 2024,positive,brilliant movie  for the first time in a while i actually cared about the characters on screen and felt the desire to route for them  they were all developed very well especially the lead cassie who went through very strong character development    madams webs ability was handled very very well and i actually felt dread and fear when i thought the characters lives were in danger    the villain was probably the weakest in terms of character development however a semi 2d villain still worked with all the other characters development as it felt like a recurring foe they had to overcome    music was also strong thought i wish the spider man theme might have been used more though thats just personal preference    no post credit scene unfortunately but the movie still manages to hint at more to come which i absolutely love and allows us the viewer to come up with what happens next
Feb 14 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie i know a lot of people are hating on it but i think its a good easy watch the actresses did a great job and would love to see more of their characters
Feb 14 2024,negative,horrid waste of time and painful to watch wouldnt even want it on in the background on a phone to fill the never ending void
Feb 14 2024,negative,the only good thing was how it was leading into the amazing spidermans story they started but never finished other than that i struggled to stay awake
Feb 14 2024,negative,ive seen every marvel movie in the last two decades in theaters on opening night and ive stood up for everything up to morbius  i was hoping after discussion of the reshoot that this was going to be at least decent  i went in with low expectations but  well this movie just fails to even try to rise to any occasion  the actors mostly did a good job with what they had but the dialog and script were just atrocious   id be hard pressed to find anything comparable  if this is a sign of what sony considers a good production then im scared of what will happen to the spider man franchise without marvel holding their hand
Feb 14 2024,negative,the movie is just a jumbled mess and has little to no connection to the marvel universe
Feb 14 2024,positive,wasnt disappointed but not thrilled either  it was like a 2 hour origins movie with the actual movie to come next 
Feb 14 2024,negative,pure cancer nothing more nothing less
Feb 14 2024,negative,i dont believe ive ever truly genuinely felt bad for everyone associated with a film
Feb 14 2024,positive,madame web is an impeccable film with few flaws which are only due to the camera play in the final act of the film it brings the culture of the 2000s very well all the audiovisual texture is perfect and very well chosen the cast is a 10  dakota and her girls carry the film with professionalism and passion humor drama and action is very present really a very good film that should be watched by all fans especially as it diverts the repetitive look of the spiderman saga and brings a feminine tone which is not harmful to the universe it only adds
Feb 14 2024,negative,did ai write this movie its atrociously bad
Feb 14 2024,negative,for me that movie was not good
Feb 14 2024,negative,i was waiting for something that just was never gonna come i feel like ezekiel sims from the comic book was a little bit different than portrayed on the movie the movie just dragged on with nothing happening leave marvel to disney i guess
Feb 14 2024,positive,it was an interesting movie with a good and promising cast loved how they tried to stick close to the comic books and also built in some great easter eggs i as a spiderman fan was very entertained do not listen to the bad reviews please and give this movie a fair chance
Feb 14 2024,negative,did nothing for me far from entertainment time i cant get back dont waste your money
Feb 14 2024,positive,the origin of how madam web became an icon as well as what peter parker uncle benjamin was like before he was born
Feb 14 2024,positive,it started off very dramatic and with a touch of comedy then it really transformed into an action packed movie with a great cast i personally really enjoyed the movie
Feb 14 2024,negative,terrible movie waste of time for me
Feb 14 2024,positive,i am surprised it got such dreadful reviews from the critics but they appear to be panning everything at the moment i actually enjoyed the film ive definitely seen a lot worse and a lot better but its entertaining and thats what i expect when i go to see a marvelsuperhero movie
Feb 14 2024,negative,ive seen better acting in porn 
Feb 14 2024,positive,its not that bad 610
Feb 14 2024,negative,worst superhero movie in a long time maybe sony should just not unless it animated
Feb 14 2024,negative,ok wow wow did this movie suck madame web is a boring generic piece of slop that is somehow worse than the so called famous morbius
Feb 14 2024,negative,one of the worst things ive seen in such a long time i actually started to have such a great time
Feb 14 2024,positive,i think the movie definitely had potential it just lacked a better script and a better villain everything was good other than those two points as the casting cgi and overall plot was good but these two key parts dragged it down
Feb 14 2024,positive,marvel have done a great job here expanding the spiderverse nobody will remember this as a classic but one that built the story 45
Feb 14 2024,positive,i know loads of people hate on this movie but i dont see why i really enjoyed this film yes theres a couple or corny lines but doesnt every film have that i love the villain based on his story even tho it is petty killing teenagers i think his motives is fair as he is a bad guy so obviously he is going to do what he must to stay alive maybe the advertising couldve been better cuz they advertised as if we were going to see the girls in their suits which we sort of did but it wasnt a big part of the film therefore lacking things some people may have wanted overall i dont see the hate its a fun enjoyable film with some callbacks to spiderman which people say was forced but it really wasnt
Feb 14 2024,negative,trash movie plot sucks acting is poor and villain is weak
Feb 14 2024,negative,seemed like a fan film recorded on a potato
Feb 14 2024,negative,another girl boss movie at this point you think they would get it but in a stupid society where they push anything but skills and talents you cant expect more
Feb 14 2024,negative,bad acting bad special effects and boring plot line felt more like a comedydrama than a superhero movie watch greys anatomy instead
Feb 14 2024,negative,what in the world is this movie 2024 is off to a bad start
Feb 14 2024,positive,fantastic movie i have now learned that reviews are not reliable when there are sony comics absolutely recommended
Feb 14 2024,negative,hot mess with a weak script bad editing couple of laughs not alot of action felt like a 2000s comic book film but not in the good way
Feb 14 2024,positive,good movie good to see new actresss on screen kept me on edge throughout would recommend seeing it good action scenes and effects would watch again hope they make a second movie
Feb 14 2024,neutral,madame web is not a good or bad movie but as a whole for me it was decent everything was boring up until the diner sequence thats when i started to like this movie and surprisingly it kept being decent even till the end so to conclude i belive the movie isnt as bad as the critics were saying
Feb 14 2024,negative,cant believe marvel are making movies about people without powers tv movie at best
Feb 14 2024,negative,every time i wonder how marvel manages to make more worse here unsurprisingly its extremely bad
Feb 14 2024,negative,morbius perhaps i treated you too harshly and here have a pepsi on me
Feb 14 2024,negative,this movie is horrible weird and boring
Feb 14 2024,positive,this is the best nonavengers movie ive seen from marvel it had some cheesy parts but overall it was enjoyable and id see it again
Feb 14 2024,negative,not worth the time to watch
Feb 14 2024,positive,i loved it  the whole web thing is kind of great 
Feb 14 2024,negative,this is what happens when hollywood accountants are making the decision about which films get produced and which ones dont basically if youre a struggling screenwriter looking to break into the business put the name spiderman somewhere in the title and some 22 year old hollywood exec will green light it
Feb 14 2024,positive,best movie ever the movie has such good writing
Feb 14 2024,negative,this movie brought be 2 hours closer to death
Feb 14 2024,negative,madame web is astoundingly awful the acting is all around questionable the dialogue is painful to listen to  and it feels as if it was edited with imovie on a 7 year olds ipad i cant for the life of me figure out how this movie was approved for theaters
Feb 14 2024,positive,not good  not bad   road to spiderwoman
Feb 14 2024,negative,honestly i dont know who approves this movies this is the worst comic book movie i have ever seen everything in it was executed poorly right now i hope this will finally show sony that this universe will never work without a spider man in it and that they have to give the spider man right back to marvel the mcu tom holland and andrew garfield and just admit defeat with the ssu
Feb 14 2024,neutral,was kind of disappointed with this as the suits were wasted plot felt rushed and no end credits dakota johnson  sydney sweeney do their best but overall it was a giant let down
Feb 14 2024,positive,it has gotten a bad rap  i enjoyed it  the portrayal of madame webs powers was incredible  the acting in general was meh  i actually did like dakotas performance  like captain marvel the character is very mellowmatter of fact  overall 610  the possibilities for the future were left ambiguously open  fits perfectly in the marvel multiverse
Feb 14 2024,negative,to be honest is a bad movie  is a nul film do not watch this mauvais movie
Feb 14 2024,positive,in spite of the critics who destroyed the film before they saw it a nice movie that i had a lot of fun with dakota and everyone were great
Feb 14 2024,negative,madame web had the potential to surpass marvel studios the marvels and sonys mobius but the film ended up leaving a bitter taste for spiderman universe fans the movie is very disconnected from the world of spiderman
Feb 14 2024,negative,if you liked the marvels you will likely think this is meh if you did not like the marvels you will think this is a hotter pile of garbage  if you hated morbius know theres worse movies out there and this may be one of them
Feb 14 2024,positive,this movie is peak cinema peak peak peak masterpiece form beginning to end the next morbius mamamewebsweep
Feb 14 2024,positive,in the end the movie is pretty decent sure there are some issues with the acting and some awkward scenes but thats okay ive seen much worse and the main characters were very nice to follow
Feb 14 2024,positive,in sonys continued quest to expand the spiderman universe without the titular hero theyve stumbled upon madame web a character beloved by many but perhaps not ready for her cinematic closeup despite the intriguing premise and the allure of multiple webheads promised in the trailers the film falls short of expectations leaving both spiderman fans and general moviegoers feeling a bit underwhelmed    dakota johnson leads the cast as cassandra webb a paramedic in manhattan who discovers she has the power to see the future johnson delivers a decent performance but unfortunately shes let down by a disjointed storyline that struggles to find its footing while the supporting cast including sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor do their best with what theyre given the lack of depth in some characters and the offkilter pacing makes it difficult to fully invest in their arcs one of the films biggest missteps is the portrayal of the villain played by tahar rahim rahims portrayal of ezekial feels out of place with his odd accent and attempt at a bruce waynebatmanesque persona falling flat his character lacks the menace and depth needed to truly challenge madame web leaving the climactic showdown feeling somewhat lackluster    despite its flaws it does have its moments particularly in the final act  the resolution of the film offers a glimmer of promise hinting at what could have been if the rest of the movie had lived up to its potential however its hard to shake the feeling that something essential is missing leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment rather than satisfaction directed by sj clarkson and featuring a talented ensemble cast including dakota johnson sydney sweeney and isabela merced madame web had the potential to be a thrilling addition to the spiderman universe unfortunately it falls short of expectations leaving viewers longing for the magic that made the webslingers adventures so memorable    i give madame web 3 out of 5 stars while the film boasts an impressive cast and an intriguing premise it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive and engaging story its a missed opportunity for sony to expand their spiderverse further in a meaningful way leaving audiences hoping for better luck with future installments
Feb 14 2024,positive,it was enjoyable  had some funny moments  i could relate to the characters awkwardness the ending was a bit odd but overall not a bad movie
Feb 14 2024,positive,this movie felt like if ai was told to write a script for a superhero movie in 2010 terrible dialogue and villain motivation false advertising and lackluster 3rd act yet i still had a perfectly fine time with it nothing that made me absolutely switch off or hate it
Feb 14 2024,negative,worst movie to be released sony isnt even trying anymore dont recommend it
Feb 14 2024,negative,the worst thing ive ever seen attached to comic book ip you know a movie is bad when the only good parts the only good parts are in flashes during dream sequences this wasnt a movie it was a con job they tricked the world into buying tickets to a two hour long trailer its bad like really bad it makes morbius look like winter soldier its really bad like it really is really really bad horrible a crime against geekdom a crime against pop culture wow i really cant get over had horrible it was words cant do it justice its that bad
Feb 14 2024,negative,bad character development cringey acting and terrible storyline with abundance of plot holes and questionable decisions
Feb 14 2024,positive,honestly at this point i think many people review films just forgetting that some movies are just a good story with no intentions of being a masterpiece just a movie to enjoy an alternate world   i enjoyed it it was a litte bit akward at the end but at the end i liked it
Feb 14 2024,positive,too common but enjoyable super fan service for spidy fan club different way of making superhero movie
Feb 14 2024,negative,the worst marvel movie ever sydney sweeney completely ruined it its not even 1 star its hardly half or it thank god i didnt buy a ticket
Feb 14 2024,negative,sucks so bad 
Feb 14 2024,positive,its a film that feels familiar but has differences that add a real freshness its difficult not to compare it to the spiderman movies and it just does not meet there greatness but worth a watch
Feb 14 2024,positive,while its not as good as any mcu title this movie is at the very least worth watching the movie is a fun slasher and some of the fight scenes felt really well done
Feb 14 2024,positive,i found that the story and the script were poorly written i really wanted to love this movie this is coming from a marvel fan boy but i couldnt i wasnt emotionally connected to any of the characters unfortunately
Feb 14 2024,positive,its not bad at all at least i did not go to the rest room for the whole movie i dont get it why there are some many negative comments and johnsons performance is worth praising
Feb 14 2024,positive,madameweb is an awesome prequel and origin story only not just for the characters we thought it would be it did well in telling a spiderman story wout explicitly using him ezekiel sims being the evil spiderman worked well i just dont dig the obvious dubs 45scales
Feb 14 2024,negative,is someone able to explain to me how hard it is to take that is the pictures and did not use them to make a movie out of these pictures seriously how can you change the characters so much from what they were in the comics if you dont like the character then dont make it why change it i was disappointed because i could have spent my money on another movie
Feb 14 2024,positive,i actually really liked this movie two of the scenes the scene with the mum in the middle and the ending were really bad and contrived but the rest was really well done i loved how they depicted her abilities with seeing the future and the past and changing it
Feb 14 2024,positive,i enjoyed watching this movie a fresh story i like the storyline the acting of the cast is also pretty good
Feb 14 2024,negative,its worse than shehulk
Feb 14 2024,positive,there is no enough fantasy like a regular spiderman movie instead is much more realistic and that was good i enjoyed it
Feb 14 2024,negative,instead madame web is a soulless cash grab that feels like it was made by someone who has never actually seen a superhero movie and decided to wing it based on a vague description they overheard at a bus stop    in conclusion madame web is a colossal failure on every level from its lackluster performances to its cringeworthy dialogue and abysmal special effects its a prime example of everything that can go wrong when hollywood tries to cash in on the superhero craze without putting in any effort or creativity save yourself the agony and skip this one  your brain cells will thank you
Feb 14 2024,positive,is not that bad like the reviews say i found it fun to watch
Feb 14 2024,negative,morbius was really better lol
Feb 14 2024,negative,not only one of the worst superhero movies of all time but one of the baddest movies ever made
Feb 14 2024,negative,this is the best fan made film i ever watch
Feb 14 2024,negative,it was definitely a movie seemed low budget so many random plot points very incohesive wouldnt watch again except maybe in like a trashy movie marathon
Feb 14 2024,negative,sony man you need to knock it off
Feb 14 2024,negative,seriouslywho asks for madame web a laughable zero effort non entertaining comic book film thatll go down as 1 of the worst movies ever made even worst i have to put up with morbius 20fake memes a hard pass
Feb 14 2024,negative,hard to follow and didnt flow the scenes seemed rushed and the character building fell flat when the villain spoke it looked like a badly dubbed kung fu movie the mouth and words didnt match too much reliance on action which was short and didnt fit b grade at best
Feb 14 2024,negative,please make it stop
Feb 14 2024,negative,it looks weird and story is a mess
Feb 14 2024,positive,the best super hero movie of all time    off all time
Feb 14 2024,negative,when it comes to marvel movies im the first person to give them the benefit of the doubt but wow this movie was just awful the dialogue is so cringey and the sound mixing is hard to sit through the acting is so over the top yet so monotone and one note the main villains acting performance is one of the worst things ive ever seen and i shudder to think how much he would have gotten paid for that poor excuse for a performance
Feb 14 2024,negative,it sucked so bad i would rather watch morbius then this
Feb 14 2024,negative,why do i keep watching these movies
Feb 14 2024,positive,just fantastic the story the characters the costume design and the cast all of it is fantastic madame web strays away from the average mcu slop and is one of the best movies marvelsony has ever made i cant wait for later this year when venom 3 and kraven the hunter releases to see how this universe expands
Feb 14 2024,negative,the only reason i see for giving this film such a high rating is the two great talents of sydney sweeney
Feb 14 2024,negative,oh geesh was such cheesy and cringey dialogue and such bad acting i have never thought dakotaj was a good actress and every movie i have seen her in i dont know what it is but her voice mannerisms intonations just all around bad acting which could not be saved with such a bad script so add that to it just a corny movie overall to have waited all this time anticipating to see it at a premiere what a let down morbius was better by a long shot cheesy movie and cringey acting all the way around save your money to see this superhero movie gone bad and wait for the 299 price when it comes to streaming waist of time
Feb 14 2024,negative,just overall extremely poor very forgettable good actors making the best of a bad script just bad
Feb 14 2024,negative,worst comic book movie ever made rather watch fantastic 4 from 2015
Feb 14 2024,negative,this movie is trash it has no amazing   story and no message and there is no character
