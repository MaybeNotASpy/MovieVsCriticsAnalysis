Apr 6 2024,positive,second greatest movie of all time behind its sequel adding more characters and continuing the story seems like it could still be hard but the story continues to get better
Apr 6 2024,positive,the greatest sequel ever made simply perfect any criticisms ive heard is simply not legit its just some people need stuff to say
Mar 4 2024,positive,the best of the 3 film incredible beautifull cool interesting everything is good except the umbar showed like ugly savage
Mar 4 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies ever made
Mar 3 2024,positive,spoiler warning  this movie is incredible and my personal favorite movie of all time tied with the other two in the trilogy there is so much to love in this movie so i summed it all up with this one scene     remember the great stories mr frodo  this scene fills me with motivation even in the darkest of times after frodo is corrupted by the ring and is mentally forced to kill samwise on the dark outskirts of mordor frodo has lost all hope and doubts whether he should keep going or not however samwise reminds him of the great stories when heroes kept going even when times were tough and all looked lost as samwises speech echoes onto the renowned battle of helms deep and the flooding of isengard frodo starts to realize that even if it is but a tiny sliver there is hope    what makes this scene so emotional is that this happens to almost everyone there will be a point in your life when you feel like nothing is left and this scene is a beautiful reminder of why there is always a future no matter the circumstances you are capable of so much and any human can push through anything it just takes true will to do so    this scene concludes the movie in spectacular fashion as things look bright for the battle of helms deep and our heroes go on to continue their journey my eyes fill with tears every time i hear samwise the brave talking over howard shores beautiful score this scene also portrays true brotherhood and that you can lift anyone including yourself up just with some positive thinking    in conclusion this film is a breathtaking masterpiece that serves as an amazing build up to the grand finale i feel like every individual scene had heart and soul put into it and has a valid reason for why its there this movie also has deeper themes of brotherhood perseverance and addiction i highly recommend viewing this incredible trilogy as it represents what makes us human and what we are capable of
Feb 27 2024,positive,my favorite of all 3 installments of the trilogy the two towers will take you into a roller coaster of emotions it is exciting funny and emotional the battle scenes are out of this world the epic entrances of heroes are the best i have ever seen in any movie ever it has everything from funny moments to screams of excitement and boohoo crying your eyes out     the two towers mostly concentrates on rohan and saruman while frodo and sam embark on their own journey it is fascinating to see the film develop and how the stories like the fellowship are supporting one another even unknowingly    there is just a level of perfection to this movie that it is impossible to surpass peter jackson set a standard that is just unfair to measure other directors
Feb 25 2024,positive,while not surpassing the previous film it does manage to surpass 99 of other movies it continues with the high level of quality of the first film all around a great film and sequel
Feb 15 2024,positive,this is my favorite movie of all time and as close to perfection as i think there is
Feb 12 2024,positive,although it cant help but feel like the prelude it is the two towers nevertheless offers fun action great story arcs and cgi as fantastic as its told to be
Jan 22 2024,positive,entertaining from start to finish with epic battlefight scenes
Jan 19 2024,positive,this movie is even more exciting than the first once again peter jackson delivers an exciting interpretation of tolkiens world this is a film that i would certainly recommend
Jan 15 2024,positive,could you imagine acting in a lengthy fantasy movie where all your character did was hang out with a group of animated trees for the entire time or would your role in the whole film be known most for literally kicking the bucket anyway the two towers is a fun movie for fans of the fantasy genre almost halfway through watching the extended edition of the film i started running the math to conclude the trilogy could have been a twelve or thirteenepisode season for some random streaming service if it was produced now instead of over twenty years ago also i completely forgot brad dourif is in this movie
Jan 12 2024,positive,perfect all three are my favourite films of all time
Jan 10 2024,positive,they made a second one
Dec 31 2023,positive,no tom bombadil no valar none of that is a problem for me    as fantastical as middleearth is at times it still seems like a real place facing very real problems one of the biggest issues with mapping out your world and its deities so much is that it can make everything else seem inconsequential or impossible to understand without saying well i guess the gods work in mysterious ways    if you need an example of this just see the recent mcu everything is on such a massive scaletipping level that it makes what happens with the streetlevel characters seem pretty unimportant    that is one flaw of the lord of the rings books not shared by the movies not knowing that melkors defeat was the real threat to the planet while his fractionallyaspowerful minion saurons was just a kid trying to recreate his parents business and failing does wonders for the gravity of the consequences    movies  books
Dec 27 2023,positive,my favorite movie in the series and a 1010 film i was very excited to see this for the first time and when i finally did it surpasses my expectations
Dec 22 2023,negative,it was no terror of tiny town thats for sure
Dec 22 2023,positive,a great middle chapter the two towers features the introduction of gollum and builds upon the world of the first film
Dec 9 2023,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is one of my favorite films  the cgi on gollum is great and all the characters are great  the best part in the movie is the battle of helms deep  its a masterpiece and i highly recommend this movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,speechless after this film after the fellowship brought us in hard this movie delivers a powerful punch this is the climax of the trilogy and it flows so well just brilliant you will be wanting more and more
Nov 19 2023,positive,this movie was truly spectacular it has awesome action and suspense it is one of the best action and adventure films of all time
Nov 10 2023,positive,just finished watching this masterpiece again such an awesome bunch of films
Nov 7 2023,positive,what a great sequel thats all i can say that this is definitely a sequel this is definitely a movie that you have to watch the first one to know whats going on in the second one and i think the book was like that too so throughout the movie the first act started out with a clear mission from the first movie to get to modor also theres another plot line with aragorn and the rest of his friends that might play out in the third movie as well but the main thing that i really like about this movie is the third act usually third acts begin with a little slow burn and then build up to a final battle this third act in my opinion starts with the battle and finishes with the battle and this movie is called the two towers which i cant really see the other tower but thats fine because i was fully entertained this definitely works as a sequel usually i like movies to  work as their own movie and a sequel but this definitely works as a sequel that you have to watch the first one to get this the best character in this movie is a aragorn and gollum and gollum steals to sing for me because hes so twisted and crazy that is very entertaining overall battles are straight up entertaining the characters were the same as the first one and overall i cant wait for the finale not better than the first one in my opinion but really damn good 910
Nov 5 2023,positive,my favorite of the series
Nov 4 2023,positive,this one its a tiny bitty more hard to watch but its magnificent nevertheless its just that the frodosamgollum part is more slow than the rohan part
Oct 31 2023,positive,this movie is great there is so much thrill and action and such an amazing story masterpiece and a must watch
Oct 11 2023,positive,the two towers is incredible for all of the same reasons as the other films in peter jacksons trilogy the siege of helms deep is for my money still one of the great battle scenes in cinema    still upon rewatching the extended edition some of the more intimate scenes really shined through the looks like meats back on the menu boys parley had me cracking up also aragorns dreamvision of arwen before he is awoken by brego as a dude in my late 30s there is honestly nothing sexier than the love of your life gently encouraging you to go back to sleep
Oct 11 2023,positive,without a doubt the trilogys best given that this movie has the atmosphere of an action thriller peter jacksons style of filmmaking truly stands out in this one
Oct 5 2023,positive,watched the extended cut in theaters and seeing that cinematography in the big screens was out of this world

Apr 17 2023,positive,good film once again not as much happened compared to the other films but was better than the first film and getting ready for the last film
Apr 13 2023,positive,lord of the rings the two towers expands on the world of tolkien whilst still capturing everything that was loved about the first film

Mar 16 2023,positive,its sooooo brilliant this trilogy is the best there is still i need more  xx
Mar 12 2023,positive,its a lord of the rings movie so i think it was great but it is my least favorite of the three
Mar 7 2023,positive,this is my least favorite of the trilogy but thats like having the dullest gold medal it just seems like the first 23 of this movie is where the story starts to get bogged down with extraneous dialogue scenes it still has all of the good elements of the other 2 as well as the introduction of some of the best cgi ever done in the gollum character the battle of helms deep is also an epic conclusion to the middle chapter that cant be forgotten 910
Feb 27 2023,positive,i give this film a 9000000 right just like fellowship and return
Feb 24 2023,positive,the second best of the trilogy which is saying a lot since watching this alone one would say its perfect the film arguably has the best battle in the franchise and perhaps the greatest supporting actor performance in history andy serkis gollumsmeagol it fits in seamlessly with the other 2 films likely due to the movies all being filmed at the same time and the flawless direction from peter jackson
Feb 24 2023,positive,anything less than a 5 star is just not acceptable this movie is amazing the whole franchise is amazing i wish it was the first time for me to see these movies again 1010
Feb 17 2023,positive,even better than the first one love these movies

Jan 28 2023,positive,the ultimate and definitive epic
Jan 16 2023,positive,amazing adaptation id give it 100 stars if i could
Jan 16 2023,positive,a perfect followup to fellowship the two towers stands the test of time with brilliant characters gorgeous visuals and unforgettable action
Jan 14 2023,positive,this has the advantage of hitting the ground running but like most middle episodes if seen in isolation would be without a start or a finish jacksons staggering achievement is to bring tolkeins material to life in an epic way whilst retaining a clear understanding of the dense narrative and dynamic settings and cultures the cast is excellent and approach their roles with genuine authority the visuals are amongst the finest ever seen in cinema whilst the action setpieces continue to dazzle the finale battle for helms deep is jawdropping in its delivery at three hours the film still manages to grip the viewer throughout and skillfully sets up its audience for the final segment
Jan 13 2023,positive,whats to say that hasnt already been said great movie maybe better to watch in chunks
Jan 11 2023,positive,this is simply the best fantasy trilogy of all time so much care and passion went into this fantastic yes its a bit different than the books but it never  ever  changes what the story is about and what tolkien intened it to be you have a fantastic script spot on actors who give everything they have great visuals props and camerawork superp directing and one of the best scores ever written   i highly recommend the extended cut because it is even better than the theatrical cut
Jan 9 2023,positive,great follow up to fellowship love battle at helms deep a
Jan 7 2023,positive,i grew up with tolkien from reading him in grade school i am an old man now throughout the years i have seen all the cartoons listened to the books on tape played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen etc back in early and mid 1970s there wasnt a ton of lor imagery and art it was mostly in your head this was before the dungeons and dragons explosion peter jackson did an excellent version of these books the characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books the introduction of the female elf character in my opinion even enhanced the stories and was well acted i wished jackson had carried all this quality into the hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts but that said these 3 lor movies are excellent and anyone would be hard pressed to out do them for many many years to come
Jan 7 2023,positive,absolutely amazing helms deep is an awesome battle
Jan 3 2023,positive,writing  1010  acting  1010  cinematography  1010  costume design  1010  set design  1010  cgi effects 910  artistic vision 1010  adaptation ranking  1010

Dec 20 2022,positive,an all time classic one of the best sequels ever made the acting along with the character development is top notch across the board the special effects are phenomenal with a perfect balance of practical and digital effects the pacing is perfect along with masterful editing that effortlessly weaves between all the characters and new ones the anticipation built up for the end fight is excellent as well and delivers everyone should give this a watch
Dec 19 2022,positive,masterpiece no more words required

Nov 11 2022,positive,timeless movie  words cant even begin to describe how in love i am with this next chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer the characters the locations the story line the musical scores the intensity in almost every scene the magic the battles both big and small everything about this next big step in frodos journey is so compelling and fantastically made peter jackson is a complete genius even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to gandalf after his fall in the mines of moria and is he ever coming back is there still hope left for middle earth as the one ring is taken closer to mordor and mount doom can frodo and sam really trust gollum when they cross paths with him what will happen next now that the fellowship of the ring is divided and split into separate groups where is the next battle going to take place or even will the kingdom of rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling captivating intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more if you havent seen this sequel to the first film yet whether youve seen the first film already or not than youre missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing my sister and i will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together legolas still for me and aragorn still for my sister even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever from elijah wood to sean aston to billy boyd to ian mchellen to orlando bloom to viggo mortenson to miranda otto to bernard hill to christopher lee to liv tyler to john rhysdavis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with peter jackson behind the whole wheel after seeing the fellowship of the ring theres no doubt in my mind that youre going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3 can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old i get no not one and that is the truth for both me my sister and our family

Oct 14 2022,positive,even better than the fellowship and the fellowship is almost perfect why couldnt they have a decent writer to work on the rings of power like they did for this
Oct 13 2022,positive,the technically flawless second edition of the lord of the rings trilogy is the best representation of the middle earth world available in this grand conflict between good and evil the characters offer the audience a lot to cling onto as well in this episode frodo and sam continue their search for moldor in order to destroy the ring and they are using technology to follow gollum who is portrayed by andy serkis we follow a few hobbits and their tree companions a few other fellowship members as they attempt to aid gondor in fending off its foes and the ascent of the wizard of gondorf in a few of the side stories the stories all flow together and have the same good against evil theme

Oct 9 2022,positive,pretty dark movie which left me feeling depressed but still well done biggest complaint is how it ended bc thats not what happened in the book it makes faramirs character different from the books
Oct 8 2022,positive,weakest out of the first 3 movies i just think like half of this movie was build up but it still had the really good action sequences that the first movie has

Oct 4 2022,positive,really awesome movie the fight scenes are awesome and really well done
Oct 2 2022,positive,too many changes from the book important characteristics of important characters are either changed or forgotten and gimli one of the most formidable warriors of middle earth is constantly made to be the butt of jokes

Sep 10 2022,positive,a movie series that ended at the peak of film before going completely 100 cgi for literally everything and a movie you cannot make today under the current political climate that is obsessed with identity politics and diversity instead of delivering a superior product
Sep 9 2022,positive,my childhood was spent watching this and the other two movies over and over again and opened my eyes to the great writer and professor jrr tolkien a mustsee if you love fantasy this is the father of said genera
Sep 9 2022,positive,near perfect writing dialogue acting and action     despite not respecting tolkeins writings to the letter the movies stays faithful to the spirit of tolkain    the spirit of tolkeins world is unmatch and we will probably never see it portrayed better than in this original movie trilogy    god bless the people who made this  god forgive us for allowing tolkeins legacy to be violated the way it is in 2022

Sep 5 2022,positive,i had my doubts peter jackson could maintain the cinematic excellence and storytelling brilliance in this second installment of the lord of the rings trilogy but he does introducing more characters weaving in the lore and keeping up the pace after this film i knew without a doubt this trilogy was the greatest in movie history

Sep 2 2022,positive,beautiful adaptation   faithful to the books   loaded with action and incredible special effects  sure they made the compromises but overall it sticks to the originals and provide a very good view of the i imagined while reading the stories
Sep 2 2022,positive,as much as love this adaptation im sad that no one will ever be able to present the lore in raw form as many tolkien fans i had much to say about this back when it came out but after 20 years i still watch it as if im seeing it for the first time unbothered by the changes peter jackson made to the story and things he didnt consider important like the singing it will be forever remembered as the one and only master piece
Sep 2 2022,positive,phenomenal movie from a must see trilogy absolutely captures the heart and soul of tolkiens beautiful world
Sep 2 2022,positive,improving on its errors in every way possible the lord of the rings the two towers is a perfectly paced film with its spectacular performance especially gollum and his cgi capture

Aug 31 2022,positive,this movie is the second within an classic masterpiece the trilogy is my absolute happy place i can just put the movie on and get transported to middle earth and forget all my troubles for a couple of hours no matter how many years go by this movie and the trilogy is timeless and a beauty to behold not only because of the outstanding actors and actresses but also due to the love pj has put into the movies it doesnt feel like youre watching a movie its like a portal opens up and you can directly peek into middle earth yourself

Aug 25 2022,positive,the sequel is about just as perfect as the first the battle of helms deep is spectacular in this movie and the whole movie ending with this battle just feels so complete we see gollum for the first time in a lord of the rings movie so he is interesting and crazy this movie is another perfect installment

Aug 5 2022,positive,i love this trilogy so much some of the best characters ever
Jul 25 2022,positive,a must see to anyone who respect themselves
Jul 5 2022,positive,my personal favourite of the trilogy  i do love all three films of the lord of the rings trilogy all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives the two towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons for one thing it is less talky than fellowship of the ring and the pace is a little more secure here also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action direction and in its scope and very compelling and epic and some of the characters are developed more here than they were in fellowship of the ring primarily frodo and aragorn who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here    when it comes to the scope the two towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy the cinematography is one of the strongest assets while the scenery costumes lighting and make upthe orcs look amazing are all gorgeous you can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed the music is also darker and perhaps more complex the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking people may disagree but i think the two towers is the best directed of the trilogy too    the acting is very good elijah wood is likable enough with a strongerwritten character while sean astins bumbling persona suits sam really well viggo mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever ian mckellen christopher lee and bernard hill are also perfectly cast but the real revelation in my view with this movie is gollum here gollum is designed superbly and andy serkiss performance is absolutely phenomenal and oscarnod worthy    in conclusion a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy 1010
Jul 5 2022,positive,i took five days to watch this movie because its so long but it was worth it i am now starting to read the books well see how faithfull this movie actually is but for now it is great
Jul 2 2022,positive,revolutionary film and the best 2nd movie in any trilogy
Jun 28 2022,positive,this broadens the scope of the world created by tolkien allowing for the full breadth of the emotions and underlying gravitas of everything that revolves it
Jun 27 2022,positive,yeah this is better than cats
Jun 19 2022,negative,peter jackson takes the original narrative strips it down to its bare bones and fills in the rest of the story with his own ideas that do not reflect the original story in any way im glad tolkien isnt alive to witness such a massacre
Jun 19 2022,positive,the best movies and series of all time
Jun 15 2022,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is an incredible movie realised by peter jackson its a fantasy film he was written by peter jackson and fran walsh the soundtrack was composed by howard shore the film was realised in 2002 the main actors are elijah wood viggo mortensen and ian mckellen    the two towers follows the continuing quest of frodo and the fellowship to destroy the one ring frodo and sam discover they are being followed by the mysterious gollum aragorn the elf archer legolas and gimli the dwarf encounter the besieged rohan kingdom whose once great king theoden has fallen under sarumans deadly spell  the two towers received 75 nominations 65 wins with 6 academy awards    the acting is realistic and outstanding the screenplay is very enigmatic and entertaining i find the soundtrack beautiful and gripping the atmosphere is epic and manipulative     for me this film is a truly great piece of filmmaking also i give this film a 5 
Jun 2 2022,positive,completely outstanding movie the writing is excellently done and the stakes have gone up drastically from the first installment
May 28 2022,positive,this is my favorite of the trilogy i love how they divided the characters up so that they can grow stronger relationships with one another and also making them the focus and we focus on how they grow change and become more likeable its a little harder to grow your characters when they are all together some movies succeed at that and some fail but peter jackson played a genius move by having them split up in order to focus on some more there is more action in this one and i loved that the battle for helms deep wasnt just a minute and i liked that because its a big thing that happened and i was intrigued through and through gollum i think was properly introduced in this movie the adventure advanced really well compared to the others the other movies have great adventure but i like this one a little more if i had to critique one thing i think they spent a little to much time with rohan some of it was engaging but after a while i think they shouldve moved on in the first movie it made sense because they had to help the king but after a while i felt like they shouldve moved on the acting was great and i think if you loved the first youll love this one
May 28 2022,positive,always going to be the best in my book
May 28 2022,positive,i cant believe i am just now finding out about this series it is so amazing
May 28 2022,positive,this is my favorite in the trilogy
May 25 2022,positive,just as good as the first one     yet again i highly recomend watching the extended edition so damm good
May 21 2022,positive,the stakes upped a lot from the 1st onegreat story and the battle of helms deep is a great cinematic achievement
May 9 2022,positive,two towers did a fantastic job following up fellowship this movie separates our ring bearing group and allows them to have their own journeys simultaneously and juggles it well near perfect movie and great 2nd part of the greatest trilogy of all time
May 8 2022,positive,the two towers is still an absolutely fantastic movie and is nearly perfect but i think that fellowship of the ring is just a little bit better  gollum is obviously an absolute scene stealer every single time that he is on screen  the final battle in helms deep is grand and fantastical as well as emotional and sometimes comedic  just an overall amazing film and a great followup to the first
May 7 2022,positive,although all three of the movies are really good two towers is still my third favorite one its still a very good film in many aspects it improves upon the first film there are obvious new characters and locations there is much more cgi and the battle scenes get much bigger the battle of helms deep is just truly epic and well choreographed    i must say gollum is exceptional he was a huge technical achievement in 2002 his character is meant to be a villain yet he is very sympathetic and yes my precious is one of the best lines of this century the two towers also has all the qualities that make up most good second films in a trilogy it ends in a point where the heroes are at danger or have lost this will make their victory in the final movie much stronger frodo and sam are in danger by the end as they have teamed up with an untrustworthy ally gollum    honestly it is very hard to compare all the three movies and everyone might have their favorite because all three of them are amazing even though this is the weaker one it is still one of the best films of the 2000s it really shows what a great trilogy this is everything great about the first film is still there here which is part of what makes it such a good sequel
May 6 2022,positive,best trilogy of all time
Apr 29 2022,positive,always a great watch
Apr 28 2022,positive,gollum narnia lords of north family are coming back in the raven and i think they are in the dark area of north family but its a nightmare and i have never seen a man and
Apr 28 2022,positive,picking up after its predecessor the two towers offers a grander scope and lore in middle earth while still remaining committed to its pitch perfect cast filled with stunning effects and even more fantasy action the second instalment arguably improves over its predecessor in more ways than one
Apr 26 2022,positive,the scope gets bigger the stakes are higher in other words the spectacular second part grants a thrilling viewing experience it just flows perfectly and it never stops it benefits so much from the long runtime the epic battle of helms deep tops the movie exquisitely setting the bar high for the final
Apr 20 2022,positive,i think this holds the 3 spot of the trilogy only because it is the bridge bw the beginning and the end obviously still an amazing movie highly recommend
Apr 19 2022,positive,best of the trilogy but not by a long shot mostly because of andy serkis we saw a darn lot of him in this movie and it was completely necessary for this films success i highly recommend  watching the two part extended version trust me once you watch it you will never want to watch the original again
Apr 11 2022,positive,extremely good a classic
Apr 10 2022,positive,the most underrated film in the trilogy simply because the others are so good it is a testament to the series quality that the movie containing the battle of helms deep is the least beloved
Apr 8 2022,positive,great spectacular of a film great battle scenes my favourite of the trilogy   great cast
Apr 7 2022,positive,the second installment in the lord of the rings franchise proves just as if not more incredible than fellowship  andy serkis elijah wood and sean astin are enthralling as the three hobbits one heroic one corrupted and one working in the direction of the latter and ian mckellan and viggo mortensen outshine nearly every other performance in the history of cinema  epic battles and heartfelt dialogue capture the exact reason that i go to watch movies
Apr 1 2022,positive,probably my favourite of the trilogy the battle scenes and storyline with all the characters outstanding and watched 20 times cant go wrong
Mar 22 2022,positive,perhaps of the best movie of all time this movie has so much character development so much good scenery and so much good in general the battle scene is the best battle scene you shall ever see there is absolutely nothing to complain about no flaws this movie should be 100 rating another point this movie changes barely anything from the beloved books great movie
Mar 20 2022,positive,this is exactly what the second movie in a fantasy trilogy should be a split ensemble cast as we jump from destination to destination exploring the world of middle earth tied together with huge tentpole centerpiece spectacles eg the battle at helms deep and the ents attack on salumans fortress
Mar 15 2022,positive,peak filmmaking  just an unbelievable experience that cant be contained in the screen and bursts out into the room
Mar 14 2022,positive,amazing film again slight just slight drop off compared to the other two films but fantastic battle scenes and battle of helms deep was amazing great character development of frodo sam gollum etc slower paced at the beginning to get the story set up properly but still amazing
Mar 2 2022,positive,although this is my least favorite of the trilogy it remains my 3 favourite movie of all time it features one of the best battles of this century
Feb 27 2022,positive,though darker in tone than the first movie it builds on the epic foundation its predecessor laid  taking the audience to greater heights of exhilaration
Feb 27 2022,positive,the battle of helms deep is still intense after 20 years
Feb 26 2022,positive,this movie perfectly brings the atmosphere from the book to the watchers its at the same time touching has perfectly planned action and an encouraging message for all who feel hopeless
Feb 24 2022,positive,i do love all three films of the lord of the rings trilogy all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives the two towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons for one thing it is less talky than fellowship of the ring and the pace is a little more secure here also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action direction and in its scope and very compelling and epic and some of the characters are developed more here than they were in fellowship of the ring primarily frodo and aragorn who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here    when it comes to the scope the two towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy the cinematography is one of the strongest assets while the scenery costumes lighting and make upthe orcs look amazing are all gorgeous you can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed the music is also darker and perhaps more complex the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking people may disagree but i think the two towers is the best directed of the trilogy too    the acting is very good elijah wood is likable enough with a strongerwritten character while sean astins bumbling persona suits sam really well viggo mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever ian mckellen christopher lee and bernard hill are also perfectly cast but the real revelation in my view with this movie is gollum here gollum is designed superbly and andy serkiss performance is absolutely phenomenal and oscarnod worthy    in conclusion a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy 1010 bethany cox
Feb 23 2022,positive,number two lets get it    wow this cinematography i mean wow it is so simple yet so gorgeous and the colors always match so perfectly in every scene a marvelous film to look at and very admirable camera work across the board the transitions inbetween scenes the shift in colors my word its gorgeous i cant stop saying that this cinematography is absolutely gorgeous    the vfx are stunning gollem is horrifying and the moving trees look so real something hard to come by when youre making an inanimate object a living being    and can we talk about this acting not really from legolas but everyone else is soooo good i love the characters of aragorn and gimli phenomenal actors viggo in specific and great characters that theyre portraying    the goosebumps that this score gives me is unmatched by any other ost like it is just so beautiful and intense and i love it i could listen to it forever    there are quite a few times where i found myself sitting there during a conversation wondering what in the world did this add to the story and most of them the answer is nothing no wonder the film is 3 hours long    short review on this one loved all the action loved the music and the dramatic camera work far surpasses the first insanely excited for the return of the king    is it really a fight scene if theres not a wilhelm scream so unnecessary yet so crucial
Feb 19 2022,positive,rather fabulous one of the very greatest movies of all time i suspect this will be one of the most watched movies again as fans cleanse their soul from amazon
Feb 19 2022,positive,characters 9510  cinematography 1010  plot 1010  acting 810  pacing 9510  94
Feb 18 2022,positive,the battleheavy middle chapter doesnt quite live up to its superlative predecessor but is still a great adaptation  immersive and epic in all the right ways
Feb 18 2022,positive,one of the greatest movies of all time
Feb 17 2022,positive,the lotr trilogy are the best movies of all times i loved the books and love the movies

Feb 1 2022,positive,the best movie of the trilogy
Jan 18 2022,positive,as all three lord of the rings movies theres nothing wrong at all with them the same thing with this one here the action starts for real and the effects is really stunning compared to the first movie lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring i think this one is more intense 5 star movie for sure
Jan 8 2022,positive,the two towers progresses the epic with the same charm feel beauty and grandeur a satisfying watch that intertwines each arc with ease
Dec 22 2021,positive,the weakest instalment in the lotr trilogy but when you look at its competition that still leaves a lot of room to be great
Dec 14 2021,positive,a perfect continuation of the story characters develop and sets up a final chapter you are begging to see
Dec 7 2021,positive,best sequel of all times wow
Dec 6 2021,positive,being a purist whos read the book at least 15 times i might not be able to give anything related to it five stars but this film comes as close as anything probably ever will there are some scenes that are so astounding as to boggle the mind the acting is mostly perfect and the story is rousing and emotionally resonant i give is 95 just like the other two installments its a great achievement
Dec 2 2021,positive,simple perfect solid show
Nov 27 2021,negative,bit of a nonsense really suits under 12s poor plot points horrible acting and unnecessary scenes dropped in
Nov 16 2021,positive,simply the best movie 
Nov 15 2021,positive,though not as good as the original the two towers is still a masterpiece that continues the journey of frodo sam aragorn etc with much more at stake introducing new and memorable characters that are played perfectly due to the outstanding casting choices the ending is very emotional and ends off on yet another cliffhanger that keeps viewers excited to see the conclusion
Nov 11 2021,positive,not often does a trilogy hold up so well
Nov 8 2021,positive,the story continues as frodo and sam reluctantly ally with villian gollum andy serkis in a cgified but brilliant performance aragorn and the others get unexpected new allies a beloved character returns from the dead and an epic battle at the helms deep stronghold complete with rain takes place plus a skateboarding elf and a cocky dwarf have an orc killing contest its a really great second film though it gets overlooked sometimes compared to the first and the third films 
Nov 7 2021,positive,wonderful journey it brings a new world to people
Nov 4 2021,positive,ive run out of good things to say about lotr so im just going to do my due diligence and leave a 5star review  helms deep the final scenesegue into the climax  its just perfect
Oct 26 2021,positive,continues on from the first movie extremely well sets the scenes for the amazing third instalment  battle for helms deep is theatrically portrayed absolutely brilliantly
Oct 14 2021,positive,in comparison to the other two lotr movies it lacks a bit of momentthe adaptation from the books is less good than in the first movie the epicness and emotional impact less than in the thirs movie still one of the greatest movies ever due to the impossibly good scenessets the great storywriting and acting and the effects
Oct 2 2021,positive,one of the best movies of all time
Sep 26 2021,positive,second greatest film of all time just behind fellowship of the ring 
Sep 26 2021,positive,the strengths of the first movie didnt necessarily carry over to this one but it was still fantastic in its own right with its own set of attributes that made it so most notable by far were the film score arguably the most memorable of the three movies followed by the introduction of gollum and the revolutionary cgi quality that came with him the flaws in this one have the benefit of being made much worse by their expansion in the third movie that being the deus ex machina and frodos transformation into a burdensome wuss and even those could be considered more a gripe with the source material than the actual filmmakers the final battle is truly something to behold here both for its obvious high quality and for the endless series of lotr videogames with levels based on it
Sep 25 2021,positive,89    the second movie in the lord of the rings franchise the two towers 2002 maintains the same quality as its predecessor as well as expanding upon it in other places such as the world and creatures    as the fellowship is broken the remaining former members are separated into smaller groups which actually allows for some development for characters whether they are important like aragorn or more of a side character like pippin    the two towers 2002 actually offers a lot more greater things than the fellowship of the ring 2001 with diving deeper into themes about the hypnosis the ring provides as well as some huge scale battles however the pace is a lot slower and more dialogue heavy than its predecessor which at points can be really long to sit through    other than its slower pace the lord of the rings the two towers 2002 provides yet another fantastic addition to the trilogy
Sep 23 2021,positive,its the side quest movie of the trilogy with loads of new characters and a flawlessly interwoven plot with three separate points of view this movie keeps you interested with its pace and action the music is perfection in this trilogy rohans theme for example
Sep 17 2021,negative,half a star cause of sméagol
Sep 15 2021,positive,now this is how you make a sequel the two towers not only gets us more invested with our characters but adds more that are also likeable it cranks up the action the special effects and story to make us want to know how it ends
Sep 13 2021,positive,honestly this isnt that bad its actually really good but the other two are much better
Sep 13 2021,positive,i love the extended edition of lord of the rings all of them we unfortunately had to leave early due to the comfiness of the theatre chairs didnt want to snore and disturb the other viewers
Sep 13 2021,positive,the two towers will always be worth a watch the star cast of knighted sirs ian mckellen chris lee elijah wood are all so emotive and brilliant the picturesque imagery and raw evocative emotions of the human race are so beautifully portrayed and it deserved every single last oscar it won
Sep 8 2021,positive,you can get better then the lord of the rings the two towers the battle scenes are intense entertaining and incredibly done and the story is shown beautifully and extremely entertaining i promise you you wont regret watching this movie a must see 100
Aug 20 2021,positive,the two towers is probably my favourite of the books and the film is also fantastic certain aspects are done perfectly fangorn forest and the ents could not be better and nor could the character of gollum scenes involving gollum are certainly the best in the movie other performances are also about as excellent as they could possibly be main negative is that some of the battle scenes particularly the one at helms deep go on longer than they need to the aragorn and arwen scenes are really cringe but i suppose they have to be there
Aug 19 2021,positive,more compelling actionpacked and gloriously epic than the first plus more captivating and treacherous characters in the mix
Aug 18 2021,positive,split between frodo and sam on one hand and aragorn legolas and gimli on the other there can be a bit of a pacing issue here frodo and sams side can be a little more boring but theres certainly enough to keep you interested sure it can be dark like its predecessor but theres also triumph in it
Aug 13 2021,positive,its good but has fewer interesting things happening than the other lotr
Aug 12 2021,positive,unlike the 3 installments of the hobbit which should never have been broken up into 3 movies  lord of the rings each installment is worthy of 4 to 5 stars
Aug 10 2021,positive,suffers from sophomore slump just a tad but its still brilliance
Aug 9 2021,positive,another brilliant performance this one strays a little further from the books but not in a horrible way p
Aug 2 2021,positive,great movie love the book and this movie
Aug 1 2021,positive,the two towers like the rest of the lotr films delivers great action a perfect soundtrack relatable characters and an entertaining plot it also brings the much needed relief for the tension set up in the fellowship of the ring its a fantastic movie in a fantastic franchise however i like the other features in the trilogy better
Jul 25 2021,positive,its hard make another one of the lord of the rings saga with the same spirit of the first one but the two towers really did it 910
Jul 24 2021,positive,still the holder of best battle scene of all time  best of the trilogy
Jul 9 2021,positive,continues where the fellowship started beautiful movie
Jul 9 2021,positive,best movies of all time
Jun 27 2021,positive,this is in my opinion the best lor of the rings movie gollum is such a good character
Jun 21 2021,positive,the lord of the rings is one long story divided among three movies which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself i have already written a review for the fellowship of the ring in which i talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became that is why i wont talk about those things in this review rather i will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation    percy jackson has done a really great job the story picks up from the part where gandalf was attacked except this time it happens from the other point of view this not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again while previously we believed gandalf to be just a weak old man over here he turned out to be a strong wizard this is the reason why it paid off to see him return as gandalf the white    the thing i really like aobut gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character in one moment he is being spun around by saruman where he is crying like a frail old man and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon in the first movie he scared bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring but immediately after he joined the hobbits in the party this is the trait which adds character depth to him preventing him from being a two dimensional person this way we get to see him from multiple perspectives    the second character id talk about here would be gollum the first time i saw him i thought hes just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have jar jar from star wars prequels dobby from harry potter etc but hes very different earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us however it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him not just emotionally but physically too now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from this is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt frodo he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong this message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself    speaking of the scene where gollum talks to himself that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express this is something that can be done only by a good cinematography which is something peter jackson was able to handle even though that scene is ridiculed the point behind the scene was to show how gollum was feeling while planning to kill frodo and not how he was actually looking like there have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations but i dont want to spoil the movie for you    and that scene was interrupted by sam who is the next character id speak about sam is frodos best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure frodo is safe he is absolutely pure of mind which was shown in the first movie when he stopped frodo from wearing the ring sam had heard that gollum wanted to kill frodo and even though gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the mountain of doom sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost frodo didnt trust him or rather should i say didnt want to trust him and in spite of being abandoned by his best friend sam never wasted any time to get back to saving frodo    the movie also has many battle scenes cool cgi shows the fellowship of the ring fight alongside other kingdoms while gandalf is not there to protect them the action the comic timings the cgi the acting everything about this movie is absolutely great the only mistake i made watching this was that i watched the theatrical cut of this movie because of this i missed a very important and cool scene from the story which i was thinking would be answered in return of the king it has something to do with saruman so dont make that mistake id say you should watch the long one no matter how much more you have to watch    the two towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and i really wish it was talked about more only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy that doesnt mean its bad that just means this trilogy should be watched more since the fellowship of the ring is the beginning of the adventures and the return of the king is the conclusion the two towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two but in reality it is the movie which bridges the two it is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place
Jun 20 2021,positive,the two towers somehow improves on its predecessor gigantic action deep character moments and a heaping of shakespearean dialogue this is a movie no a film for the ages
Jun 9 2021,positive,lord of the rings the two towers is a masterpiece the two towers continues the story of the fellowship as they travel through the lands of rohan and the country of gondor to get to mordor to destroy the ring of power gollum is an amazing character and getting to see both sides of him added so much more depth to his character the urukhai are menacing in this movie along with saruman he actually feels like a real threat along with his foot soldiers and you get the sense that anyone can die in all 3 of these movies with the stakes being set at the end of fellowship but the bar is raised as king theoden and the people of rohan retreat to helms deep where they fight what is undeniably one of the greatest battles in cinematic history i could go about this movie for days but you get the point i love it and i always will
Jun 7 2021,positive,mainly based on extended edition 710 78100
Jun 6 2021,positive,extended edition    this one is always better than i remember it being definitely the black sheep of the trilogy    the extended cut isnt as good as fellowships in my opinion as there are too many extraneous scenes in this cut that only serve to stifle the pacing the worst offenders are the additional scenes of merry  pippin which were already the slowest parts of the theatrical cut in this cut we get entire scenes that are utterly pointless and barely add anything as well as some more comedically focussed scenes that seem awkward and out of place in the overall film    there are other scenes that help flesh out and develop characters which i feel should have been included in the theatrical version for example we get a much better explanation of aragorns lineage and history in this cut which is very important given the key role he plays in the plot of the return of the king    overall i feel the theatrical cut of this film is the superior especially for a more casual viewer it may gloss over some aspects but the pacing is much better i think ill continue watching the extended cut though purely because it has more content
Jun 3 2021,positive,amazing a must see clasic
May 31 2021,positive,masterpiece can never be replicated
May 30 2021,positive,the epic second installment to the greatest trilogy ever created the masterpiece of helms deep should serve as the ultimate model for any cinematic battle for the future
May 25 2021,positive,in a sense my score for this is an average between what i consider to be a 3355 theatrical cut and a 455 extended cut as these two versions of the movie are very very different in terms of quality considerably moreso than either of the other two lotr films  the biggest problems inherent are in regards to pacing and establishing the new characters in a way that works as well as in fellowship which had considerably more to introduce but somehow did a far better job  the extended cut of the two towers still doesnt do as good as fellowship or return for that matter in terms of its character dynamics or its extension of worldbuilding but it is a vast improvement and certainly does an overall good job with both of these  simply put this is one of those movies like troy  chronicles of riddick where the extended cuts additions are so good at adding muchneeded context that despite their increased runtimes actually feel like much shorter films than their shorter versions  like the other two the cinematography music production design sound design acting and actionsequences are all topnotch still effective to this day and serious props to everyone for managing to successfully make a 45minute action sequence that managed to keep the stakes high  its needed viewing to experience the whole story and while its the weakest of the three its still usually very good quality only sometimes dipping into good not great territory from time to time
May 24 2021,negative,the worst of the trilogy
May 14 2021,positive,the battle of helms deep took three months to film and is quite possibly the most fantastic onscreen clash of armies ever filmed
May 11 2021,negative,golim looks like a cartoon character but serkis plays him well
May 6 2021,positive,not quite as remarkable as fellowship or return but its still a phenomenal second chapter the visual effects are still top notch as well as the sets cinematography score and costumesmakeup the action is also a major improvement over the first with the battle of helms deep obviously being one of the best battles in history andy serkis gives a fantastic performance as gollum and provides us with a conflicting character that we dont know how to feel about i also loved seeing how saurons take over of middle earth is actually affecting middle earth as shown with the situation of rohan the biggest issue is the pacing of the movie it drags on in the middle for quite a lot and being the middle chapter it lacks the setting up of the first movie or the pay off of the third movie and we dont get as many locations and we spend a bit too much time with the rohan subplot but its still an emotional suspenseful satisfying and exciting second chapter with great characters and moments
May 4 2021,positive,the two towers is grand in spectacle and eventually extremely thrilling as much as i love this installment and the entire series this middle entry of the series gets a bit bogged down in picking up the pieces of the first and setting up the finale to be independently spectacular in comparison with the fellowship of the ring the adventure is far less expansive and the protagonists being consistently split makes for a less cohesive story telling what this movie is most famous for  the battle at helms deep  earns its reputation and is the pinnacle of high fantasy action to date
Apr 27 2021,positive,theyaretakingthehobbitstoisengardepic
Apr 17 2021,positive,the battle scenes are epic saw the trilogy when it first came out almost 20 years ago the attention to the costumes the makeup and prosthetics is still astonishing highly recommend
Apr 17 2021,positive,plenty of action  plus it had a plot
Apr 10 2021,positive,my favorite trilogy of all time
Apr 6 2021,positive,this is spectacular with emotional themes and the right amount of action i love this
Mar 30 2021,positive,one of the best moviesgreat to see it in the theater
Mar 29 2021,positive,the greatest cinematography greatest acting greatest story and the greatest series
Mar 24 2021,positive,i read these books in high school during the 60s twice and thought what a great movie this would be if there was anyway to make it and low and behold peter jackson figures out how to do it with help from a perfect cast and effectssaw it in the theaters many times when it came out and now its backyou cant beat this in a theater no matter how big a tv you havego experience it in the biggest screen and sound system they haveyou wont regret it
Mar 24 2021,positive,the whole trilogy has so much depth when you rewatch them after binge reading through all of tolkiens middle earth lore every line a character utters every frame in every movie has so much depth behind it im not able to properly describe it in a concise manner no remake can top peter jacksons trilogy there is so much love and attention to detail no matter how dated the cgi may look in the future there is no way theyll be able to ever capture the same magic in film i just cant imagine it
Mar 23 2021,positive,awesome just awesome the battle of helms deep was just amazing the scenes with frodo sam and gollum were also magnificent
Mar 22 2021,positive,the trilogy continues in the best way possible
Mar 21 2021,positive,the final battle is best move battle ever the trio friendship is so amazing
Mar 18 2021,positive,this is the middle film so it has 3 hours or so of straight awesome plot lines and action the only thing it starts or ends is the battle of morannon this battle starts the next movie perfectly
Mar 17 2021,positive,the two towers is the most perfect sequel and is true art to cinema
Mar 1 2021,positive,by far the best film of the trilogy with gollum and his internal conflict a mesmerising watch and creative how they do it the development of characters and return of gandalf is well done and treebeard merry and pippin as some light relief to the film sams speech about hope is relevant to whatever situation you are it
Feb 26 2021,positive,this is my fav out of this amazing trilogy because i love the battle of helms deep and contains amazing moments throughout
Feb 25 2021,positive,while the weakest movie in the trilogy the two towers does a lot of heavy lifting its largely the most uneventful but its still a strong middle chapter the battle for helms deep has a relatively slow buildup but it also effectively kicks the trilogy into a higher gear  its so epic
Feb 22 2021,positive,never has a trilogy been this good and never has there been since
Feb 22 2021,positive,i liked everything lotr is my favorite movies of all time
Feb 21 2021,positive,there is nothing negative that can be said about this movie 5 stars 100 1010 etc
Feb 17 2021,positive,i might not have enjoyed it as much as the first film but the lord of the rings the two towers is still a terrific film no doubt    visually it still looks superb i really do love the look of these films so far the main plot is engaging and very interesting while things like the costumes et al remain at a high level there is also top action including some noteworthy battle sequences    there are though a few bits i found less great  still very good in the grand overall scheme but just comparably with the 2001 release i found the pacing to be slightly off in moments while a few of the new cast members didnt connect to me  eg bernard hill the side story meanwhile with billy boyd and dominic monaghan didnt interest me at all they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest    elijah wood remains good though i did enjoy seeing the journey of frodo and sam sean astin andy serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as gollum which is most definitely only a major positive  a fun character any scene with those three  outstanding    overall as noted it is still an excellent film one very much worthy of following the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring despite a few issues i have with it
Feb 16 2021,positive,a step down in quality but still good this movie has sever pacing issues with two of the hobbits  the funny ones on probably the most boring storyline ever and the main crew following their steps in a lame detective chase for a while once they stop that the movie really hits its mark and has alot of cool stuff 1 star for aragorn being sexy
Feb 15 2021,positive,just as good as the first one this movie is just as faithful to the books as the original movie and the story gets much more dark and exciting
Feb 13 2021,positive,this movie will always be awesome even more seeing it imax
Feb 11 2021,positive,this trilogy is the first novel to movie adaptation of a fantasy novel or series that has ever worked in my opinion    gold standard
Feb 3 2021,positive,the first films sprawling epic world is still in good hands while it certainly is a step down from the fellowship of the ring it still brings you a sense of awe andy serkis is masterful as gollum and the added in humor is a wise decision making this a worthy road to the final installment frodo and sam do not appear as much though and the fight scenes are too plentiful to really feel excited towards the next one because you really know who is going to win and you wonder why the editing isnt here enough still i feel optimistic that the return of the king learn from its predecessors mistakes and reach a stunning victory
Feb 2 2021,positive,the characters story and world are incredibly put together and peter jackson has done a fantastic job adapting the books  i didnt know anything about tolkien prior to the first in the trilogy being released so i read the hobbit in preparation what followed over the next three years watching these films was the most memorable movie experiences ive ever had these films brought me to tears in certain parts something which is exceptionally rare with me as im not an emotional person whatsoever i read the trilogy after and still to this day hold tolkiens world in high regard
Jan 28 2021,positive,a little weaker than the first and third instalments however it is still magnificent and one of the best films of all time of course its weaker state is due to the fact that it got the middle portion of the story which usually conveys more storytelling and building up rather than memorable and epic sequences
Jan 22 2021,positive,best of the lotr movies
Jan 19 2021,positive,an improvement over its predecessor for sure two towers substitutes long sequences getting to know characters for sharper action and battle sequences while adding some nice new characters to the mix a good middle chapter
Jan 17 2021,positive,not bad as compare it to harry potter series
Jan 17 2021,positive,the rating so fresh absolute must see summarizes what must be done
Jan 16 2021,positive,6 bags the gold standard of high fantasy returns its an action packed explosion of stars chucky from childs play joins in the fun as does judge dredd it was cool to see the two towers and the part with the trees is slow but its ok cause theyre trees is supposed to be boring thats just good film making dont think we have forgotten about the precious rt gives us super reviewer
Jan 10 2021,positive,this movie is being so fantastic and awesome
Jan 4 2021,positive,epic emotional and beautiful
Jan 1 2021,positive,the second part of the lord of the rings trilogy introduces new characters more epic battles and the best visual effect presented in these films with gollum the story has also become more enticing as it starts to feel grittier and bigger in scale
Dec 25 2020,positive,a very good movie probably the weakest in the lord of the rings franchise but still really awesome
Dec 19 2020,positive,as i said on my fellowship review the lord of the rings trilogy is perfection and this is my second favourite
Dec 17 2020,positive,one of the best movies ever made everything was done well a movie without sin
Dec 12 2020,positive,its great but not as great as the first one its enjoyable but it feels like a bridge between the the first one and the third one it does have an amazing final battle
Dec 8 2020,positive,the best out of all lotr and hobbit films including the animated two towers is the dark knight of the lotr trilogy boasting the best storytelling action character development emotions and cinematography it is also the lowest rated which is idiotic
Nov 11 2020,positive,my favorite what an epic trilogy
Nov 5 2020,positive,these movies are at their fullest when you watch the extended editions and just like fellowship of the ring two towers is one of the best fantasy movies ever filmed
Oct 28 2020,positive,the two towers continues the best trilogy ever by showing what are characters must do to continue the journey without failing
Oct 12 2020,positive,my favorite movie series i love everything about this movie
Oct 12 2020,positive,a perfect sequel a perfect movie and nearperfect adaptation
Oct 7 2020,positive,though it is quite a tonal shift from the first movie and not as fast paced it is more accurate and faithful to the source material than the fellowship of the rings film adaptation and the two towers definitely introduces deeper and more important chemistry between characters so while peter jacksons first two lord of the rings movies are different in some ways i believe that the two towers matches and maybe even exceeds the already nearflawless fellowship of the ring
Oct 4 2020,positive,the first film sets up the world of middle earth but the second film in the trilogy sets up higher stakes somehow you think its near impossible to top yourself on a visual spectacle but peter jackson director clearly got comfortable and ready to escalate this film has one of the best battle sequences of all time in cinema the scope is even bigger and the story just expands to new dimensions through new and old characters gollum is a cgi masterpiece and has more depth than a normal human character would possess once again middle earth surpasses expectations
Oct 1 2020,positive,im not sure why but this one has never been my favorite i still really really love it though unlike the first movie this one gets right into the action from the start of the movie and never stops the action is great especially the final battle at helms deep the score once again is incredible what i love most about this movie and all the lotr movies is that it ends with a feeling of hope despite obstacles that are going to face the characters awesome movie
Sep 30 2020,positive,thats not a just a movie thats a timeless piece of art
Sep 8 2020,positive,i liked the first one a bit better but this one was good too the scenery and worldbuilding is outstanding these movies are too long though they should have cut each in half and done 6 movies instead of 3
Aug 29 2020,positive,94 22423 amazing film different from the first one where the group is split up into smaller groups for basically the whole film gollum is leading frodo and sam to mordor some more people come together for the last battle this one is really about saruman trying to take over a fortress of men
Aug 27 2020,positive,this is one of the greatest sequels ive ever seen i thought the fighting scenes in this movie were epic great film
Aug 27 2020,positive,amazing and very nice movie
Aug 26 2020,positive,the sequel show us how powerful the tentation of the benefits of the evil can be with the best way ever to show how important the question is and bringing a perspective of the inocents who can be so much more than we ever expected the soundtrack is awesome like the first movie the story has no fails and the actors are awesome point to sir ian mckellen whta a great man
Aug 24 2020,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is honestly a brilliant sequel and its even a masterpiece and a half the movies got a brilliant story which follows on straight after the first movie and its about frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin arriving to mordor with the help of gollum andy serkis    a number of new allies join their companions team to defend the well known isengard while saruman christopher lee deploys an assault from his territory    the cast are all honestly brilliant with their performances throughout this movie and the same goes with their dialogue all of the characters dialogue which is given throughout this movie is all honestly great and non of their dialogue feels weak at all    the cinematography which was shot by andrew lesnie who did the first ones cinematography does another brilliant job at capturing the scenes so smooth and so beautifully he does it so well and he makes the scenes look so amazing    also theres a lot more of the action sequences throughout this movie and they are very clever very graphic and very unique just like the first ones were and they are all very well choreographed    the movies even got such a beautiful soundtrack the score which was beautifully composed by howard leslie shore oc he does such a great job with the soundtrack and it goes so well with the scenes theyve been placed within this movie    the movies even got some brilliant humour which always hits and it never misses thats mainly from gimli john rhysdavies his character adds some really funny humour throughout this movie which adds to his character quite a bit    the movies even got more dark themes in my opinion they add a lot more to the different locations which we end up discovering throughout this movie and its done so well which i really liked    finally the love interest in this movie is very well built up and it doesnt feel rushed at all its a very interesting one and i think it works quite a bit    the pacing which this movies got is all honestly brilliant and all of the moments are all built up very well and non of those scenes fail in any sort of way because they are all built up brilliantly    the orcs throughout this movie have got more of a darker and more of a graphic look to them which i think added a bit more of a disturbing look to them which i really liked    overall lord of the rings the two towers is honestly a brilliant sequel the movies got a brilliant story brilliant performances great dialogue beautiful cinematography clever action sequences brilliant pacing a beautiful soundtrack brilliant humour dark themes more disturbing looking orcs and an interesting love interest    id honestly recommend this movie if you enjoyed the first one and if youre into fantasyaction movies i think this movie is honestly worth the watch and youll probably enjoy it as much as the first one
Aug 17 2020,positive,a masterpiece on how to engage audience in fantasy storytelling
Aug 2 2020,positive,a brilliant middle chapter of an incredible trilogy combined with jacksons direction the script he cowrote with walsh boyens and sinclair the performances of the cast shores score lesnies cinematography hortons editing majors production design hennah and lees set decoration dickson and taylors costume design action sequences sound design and visual effects the two towers interlopes through three storylines incredibly effective and makes a beautiful and entertaining film
Jul 30 2020,positive,an amazing movie one of the best of all time
Jul 27 2020,positive,this is a wonderful film the entire helms deep sequence is incredibly impressive visually on the level of mad max fury road the special effects are really well done for a 2002 movie and the score is absolutely flawless my favorite part of this film is the anticipation that builds for the battle at helms deep it really feels like the whole story is leading to that scene my only complaints are that things feel a little rushed and as a disclaimer i watched the theatrical version not the extended edition character motivations are often lacking so a lot choices dont always make sense and characters seem to do this just for the sake of advancing the plot similarly the character development all felt a bit rushed especially compared to the wonderfully rich development found in the novel version but overall these are minor criticisms this movie is still incredible
Jul 13 2020,positive,just as good as the original
Jul 11 2020,positive,an epic middle chapter to an epic trilogy
Jul 8 2020,positive,just as good as fellowship unparalleled in the fantasy genre
Jul 8 2020,positive,the start of a great journey
Jul 8 2020,negative,so freaking rubbish the movie is so horrible and it  has bad action
Jul 5 2020,positive,fillef with action this middle segment of tbe original trilogy is one the best movies ever made
Jul 4 2020,positive,i absolutely loved this film and i love lord of the rings so much i love that they put gollum on the front row and some of my alltime favorite scenes are the scenes with gollum i love that this takes place right after fellowship it really feels more like a journey i cant get enough of the amazing score its just so good some say this is the most perfect trilogy and i see why it is literally perfect i love the makeup and prosthetics it is so good and the orcs look disgusting because of that and i love every single second of it im glad they didnt use motion capture suits for the orcs as the hobbit did these films are an achievement in storytelling in keeping a whole journey and feeling like your really there and connected with them over three years i cant get enough of the absolutely amazing worldbuilding it is literally amazing and nothing else can top it at all peter jackson really did something amazing with this film that i dont think can be done again and if anyone else would have made this it would be so different and it would probably be worse im so excited to see andy serkis as alfred in the batman he is such a good actor and needs an oscar nomination by now im glad that they only do one thing that really is cgi throughout the entire movie and that is gollum which i love and i love the practical effects and not the cgi and green screen this film has so many iconic things like the lines and everything about it is iconic from the characters to the score its all amazing they try to humanize which gollum which i didnt think they would have but i love that they showed him in human form and andy serkis did an amazing job outside the motion capture suit which gets me more excited for the batman this film has some of my alltime favorite lines as does the whole trilogy smeagol is one of my alltime favorite film characters and he is so iconic there are so many amazing grandscale shots that show off the grandscale of new zealand and they all look beautiful mixed with the film they shot on makes it look amazing and adding the score to that makes it some of the best shots of all time i love the buildup for the battle of helms deep and it is one of my alltime favorite battles this film again has one of the biggest cliffhangers of all time and i wish one of the companies would come out with the 9 hour and 30minute version of it i would watch that so much    like the last one they dont use sfx only but one time and that is for gollum which the sfx really holds up for all of the sfx now with endgame and lion king i really cannot get enough of the amazing score i could listen to it for hours and not get bored it thats how much i love it like before the sound mixing and editing are on point with the battle at the end sounding amazing and the elephant looking things too i love the locations they used it this getting more into mordor and the color grading making it look like more of mordor it looks fabulous the cinematography looks amazing the script like the last film is amazing and it baffles me that one trilogy can earn 30 nominationswins it just is outstanding that a film trilogy can do that and if you dont think this trilogy is perfect look at the oscar love that this got like the previous film they develop their characters out so well i just love it and when characters have those heart to heart moments i just love those scenes and those are some of my favorites the acting is on point and everyone is giving it their all especially elijah wood if just like the previous film if there was anything snubbed it was elijah woods acting he actually is a really good actor and i wish he got more major roles after lord of the rings but he didnt he could have been a major hollywood star the editing mixed with the suspenseful score creates these tense full scenes that i just love the action scenes really hold up after all these years overall i absolutely loved this film and would recommend it to anyone  
Jul 1 2020,positive,pure artincredibly epic and remarkably amazing moviethe journey of fellowships the 34 different situations storylines with the goosebumps and epic end it was the great experiencethe return of gandalf was satisfying as hellthe rohans war buildup and the rings quest with gollum and the trees thing with two hobbits it was awesomethe army of sauron and saruman and there fights with two kingdoms and the story connecting major things it was brilliantthe ending war is literally a piece of art the losing hope of mens and the incredible turn with the satisfying scenery and music and the actions scenes with awesome cgi it was literally the greatest experiencethe whole movie is a treat its a greatest sequela pure arta masterpiece
Jul 1 2020,positive,the best of the 3 thanks to an exciting final battle and cliffhanger ending
Jun 30 2020,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is an epic sequel that gives us great and interesting characters effects that still hold up a beautiful score a beautiful look and epic action but it can suffer from some mood killers and jarring editing rating a
Jun 26 2020,positive,the second film does a better job at telling the story but is a bit less impressive in terms of cgi and visuals still an epic masterpiece overall
Jun 20 2020,positive,great sequel the fighting scenes in this movie were epic
Jun 19 2020,positive,a nearly flawless fantasy epic that is capped by the iconic genre defining battle of helms deep

Jun 13 2020,positive,incredible phenomenal in every way i cannot say enough good things about these films
Jun 7 2020,positive,my son thinks in the lord of the rings trilogy that this is his favorite mine is the return of the king its a great middle to a long journey by gandalf frodo sam and aragon it has many instances were old alliances come to bear old alliances jump in at last second to help the situation no spoiler alerts here whether youre a fan of the first second or third installment its a long exciting adventure this successfully next the fellowship to return of the king nicely
Jun 6 2020,positive,one of the best movies ive seen this movie really depicted lord of the rings story very well this movie was amazing and i really enjoyed watching it theres a lot of battle violenceaction but thats the most excitment in the movie the helms deep battle was epic and awesome to watch this may be one of the best fantasy movies ive seen i give this 92 rotten tomatoes
May 30 2020,positive,as with the fellowship of the ring this is truly a beautiful and faithful adaptation of the book by tolkien the cast is absolutely perfect and the shots are stellar the battle of helms deep is captivating and you will find yourself holding your breath as you vicariously feel the dismay of the people being besieged another masterpiece by jackson
May 25 2020,positive,the two towers follows up fellowship of the ring and somehow manages to excel it all the characters are wellrounded and extremely likeable and the plot keeps the audience intrigued all the time it also introduces many new characters but never feels like anybody is being sidelined golem is extremely interesting and there is a lot of really nice tension with the threat of sauron  the massive battle at the end of the film is expertly shot and keeps you on the edge of your seat  this film is a must see
May 24 2020,positive,a classic of our times you must watch and rewatch it 23
May 20 2020,positive,the second film in this great cinema trilogy takes everything it did from its predecessor and multiplies it bringing twists and turns and a more satisfying direction to the plot
May 14 2020,positive,in my opinion the worst out of the lord of the rings franchise but still a masterpiece no real flaws only that a few scenes maybe will feel boring to some viewers but not really that big of a deal a brilliant movie with one of the best battle sequences of all time
May 12 2020,positive,despite not being the best adaptation the two towers work as an amazing second act to the saga that changed fiction forever in terms of loyalty to source material this may not be the perfect movie but it does a fantastic job at fulfilling its purpose continuing the epic journey started in its predecessor and preparing its audience for the grand finale without feeling as an empty filler
May 10 2020,positive,this film set new highs for big battles in blockbuster films
May 6 2020,positive,perfect middle movie to the best trilogy of all time if you havent seen the extended version i highly recommend it for all three movies
May 4 2020,positive,spectacular film that leaves you breathless for the third chapter
Apr 29 2020,positive,its awesome  absolute must see
Apr 29 2020,positive,i remember watching this film at 11 years old during the first night of its theatrical release my father took me and my older brother to the cinemark in atlanta ga to check it out after being turned away from several sold out shows as a child i remember the vivid images the stunning photography and the unforgettable cinematography that easily jumped off of the screen and burned itself into my memory it was one of the most unforgettable film going experiences ive ever had     as an adult my viewpoint has not changed from its breathtaking score to its incredible plotline to peter jacksons incredibly detailed approach to complex character development this is by far one of the greatest action epics of our time     though return of the king is fantastic this insertion is easily the best of the trilogy
Apr 28 2020,positive,the best movie of all time an absolute masterpiece of cinema my favorite movie of all time
Apr 26 2020,positive,critics were right this was better than the first thought it would be too geeky but i loved it 
Apr 24 2020,positive,this is my least favorite of the three mostly because the middle is slow but its still a good movie overall
Apr 23 2020,positive,it ups the ante by balancing an emotional story with exciting action sequences impressive special effects and compelling characters that leaves you with a lot of hype for the next film
Apr 22 2020,positive,it builds up to one of the most emotional battles of all time but despite some rightful changes from the book intended to create a conflict between the protagonists it doesnt completely manage to achieve the emotional value of his predecessor and leaves the true conflict to his successor
Apr 19 2020,positive,how can you not like this
Apr 19 2020,positive,the sequel in this masterful trilogy is an emotionally driven action film that has some of the finest pacing for its lengthy runtime the stunning look along with the final act grows even more tension for the long awaited conclusion
Apr 9 2020,positive,great movie at times can be slow overall great
Apr 2 2020,positive,this is a masterpiece of a fantasy world
Mar 29 2020,positive,excellent movie of all time in fantasy movie genre i also do recommend expanded version as it obviously contains pretty cool scenes among which is a scene where saruman falls from the top of isengard
Mar 29 2020,positive,love it with all of my heart even though i think its my least favorite of the trilogy although that doesnt change a single thing
Mar 18 2020,positive,the two towers continues the lord of the rings franchise with well created characters and amazing battle scenes
Mar 16 2020,positive,loved the battle scenes
Mar 4 2020,positive,sometimes overlooked between the wellpaced introduction and the exciting finale the two towers has just as much of jacksons expertly crafted adaptation as any of the other entries in the series 455
Mar 3 2020,positive,too long and has too many plotlines bot it was good
Feb 25 2020,positive,absolutely enchanting a must watch classic
Feb 22 2020,positive,absolute masterpiece this is my favorite of the trilogy an awesome battle at the end it perfectly sets up the return of the king
Feb 18 2020,positive,this movie is perfect
Feb 16 2020,positive,now dont get me wrong i do like the two towers it has some of the darkest tone in the saga however the movie itself can drag on for too long in certain scenes and is always faking out death scenes i would be lying though if i didnt say this middle installment in the lord of the rings did not have possibly the best fight scenes in the franchise especially the battle of helms deep
Feb 12 2020,positive,my favourite one of the series
Feb 7 2020,positive,best out of all of them
Feb 6 2020,positive,fate would have it that the two towers is the quintessential post 911 allegory faceless world altering evil being stood up to my the united grieving good of the little person when gandalf or sam or merry or faramir speaks theyre speaking using tolkiens words through time and talking directly to us undoubtedly the success of this and the other rings movies are that they are lovingly and reverently adapted by teams of indie creatives at the height of their passion and the tops of their game however its enduring legacy and legendary status owes itself to the fact that the two towers had and still has a reason to exist in the world it speaks to what fantasy was made for and it bolsters the human spirit and champions hope and understanding forgiveness and love      theres a sensitivity here not usually applied to middle films in a trilogy but making the groundbreaking meld of cgi and characterisation of sméagolgollum the central arc of the story is very smart it gives the film thrust and purposeful connective tissue to return of the king his arc from gollum to sméagol and to gollum again is sad important and due to andy serkis also hilarious it does everything a middle film should introduces new characters fleshes out old and builds tension to the third film the battles are bigger but no less well crafted and every side story is a worthwhile one     the extended version is a difficult bag all the scenes removed are extraneous certainly but are all brilliant moments and in any other film indispensable boromir and faramir scenes manage to actually give more relatability to a character thats already dead and the funeral of théodens son is incredibly sad poignant and pertinent
Feb 6 2020,positive,better than the first
Feb 4 2020,positive,the two towers is worth watching just to see the battle of helms deep it is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen but then theres so much more than thatthis movie also features amazing special effects with gollum dramatic political tension in rohan and fantastic moments with the ents this is probably my favorite chapter of the lord of the rings film trilogy
Feb 3 2020,positive,when a film improves and magnifies his astonishing predecessor it is meant to be not only a good sequel but a remarkable and historical trilogy that is what the two towers has made
Feb 2 2020,positive,the middle chapter in the adaptation of the greatest fantasy series of the 20th century perhaps ever this contains everything from intimate moments of friendship to battles of terrifying scale it may be slightly less great than the first or third but its still a masterpiece every moviegoer should give this film a chance
Feb 1 2020,positive,the first hour awesome the second hour decent the third hour perfection  better than the first  9510
Jan 23 2020,positive,perfection way too much time taken away from the big battle scenes for frodos story but still 5 stars because i understand hes a big part of the story just get bored during his scenes and its a long movie 
Jan 23 2020,positive,its great because its even better than the fellowship of the ring
Jan 21 2020,positive,spectacularly directed by peter jackson written fantastically by fran walsh philippa boyens stephen sinclair and jackson with amazing special effects innovative makeup electrifying action scenes memorable soundtrack by howard shore beautiful cinematography by andrew lesnie detailed costumes and captivating performances by elijah wood ian mckellen viggo mortensen liv tyler sean astin cate blanchett john rhysdavies bernard hill christopher lee billy boyd dominic monaghan orlando bloom hugo weaving miranda otto david wenham brad dourif karl urban sean bean and andy serkis the lord of the rings the two towers achieves the difficult feat of overcoming its predecessor and being like it one of the best fantasy films of all time

Dec 28 2019,positive,lacks the adventurous spirit of the first but compensates with amazing battlescenes and dark atmosphere
Dec 26 2019,positive,the best trilogy in the history of cinematography
Dec 25 2019,positive,perfection simply perfection
Dec 25 2019,positive,while although the two towers pursues the many divergent quests of our disunited fellowship rarely does one pathway transcend another as our minor characters realize the gravity of the grander picture at hand our heroes begin to recognize the burdens that follow their endeavors to destroy the ring the highs of this movie are as prominent as they get andy serkiss embodiment of a certain creepy conflicted creature and the monumental battle of helms deep aside from the vague introduction to rohan and the relevant but sleepy pacing of several treebeardinvolved scenes this film is just as enthralling as both its counterparts
Dec 22 2019,positive,the two towers is largely the fellowship of the ring in terms of quality and due to the trilogy being created all at once its very consistent in every facet imaginable my issues come from the separation of the fellowship which creates multiple plot lines it was executed well but you cant help but pick which characters you prefer to follow as some drag on more than others still there isnt much to add this is one of the three essential films for any fantasy fan and it still keeps the high level of overall quality that was established in the previous film
Dec 20 2019,positive,the second in the trilogy and the one i like the least even though i like it a lot the extended cut is far better than the original cut helms deep is still one of the best battle scenes ive seen in a movie
Dec 19 2019,positive,everyone knows that the second movie is always the most difficult to tell this one breaks that rule the battle in helms deep continuous to be excelent nowadays
Dec 14 2019,neutral,the idea behind the plot is great   theres just not that much happening plus the movie is nearly four hours long which doesnt help to the lengthiness at all
Nov 10 2019,positive,when you make a movie so awesome that both critics and normal humans love it the same just watch it its brilliant
Nov 5 2019,positive,the best movie of the franchise making you fall in love with middle earth and the characters even more
Nov 3 2019,positive,most see simply one of the greatest movies of all time
Oct 30 2019,positive,perfect just absolutely perfect
Oct 28 2019,negative,i dont like this movie at all it seems boring and i dont like it i do not like science fiction movies very much and this is no exception i do not see the interesting side or something that really catches me and is too true for me does not have many actors that i really like so it is not my taste therefore i would not recommend it
Oct 26 2019,positive,lord of the rings will stand the test of time as one of the most fantastic film series ever made 
Oct 12 2019,positive,the best movie ever made enough said
Oct 11 2019,positive,the quest to destroy the one ring continues this part of the trilogy fully introduces us to smeagolgollum in the form of the brilliant andy serkis we also get to see the battle of helms deep play out not to mention an army of ents laying siege to sarumans fortress orthanc to howard shores wonderful musical score like the previous film this is a masterpiece
Oct 7 2019,positive,a great continuation that delivers more backstory and new characters that stall the film a bit but still on the same level as the first
Oct 6 2019,positive,the pinnacle of the movie industry
Oct 5 2019,positive,movie the lord of the rings the two towers2002 a great movie that i just saw again on one of my tv channels that started to watch at 500pmct saturday october 05 2019 i did my comments here at 541pmct saturday october 05 2019
Sep 27 2019,positive,these movies are the best ive ever seen
Sep 25 2019,positive,though it drags us through some scenes and dialogue this film brings us an appropriate second to this master trilogy
Sep 16 2019,positive,i dont readed the book but the movies is briliant
Sep 15 2019,positive,the two towers isnt paced as well as the fellowship of the ring but there are some excellent action scenes that make up for that ive never found the frodo and sam portions of this film to be that enjoyable especially since their trip to the black gate is a waste of time and the merry and pippin discussion with the ents feels off in places a lot was cut from the extended edition however the theatrical edition is significantly better than the extended edition which really drags on with unnecessary scenes the acting characters dialogue combat visual effects cinematography and soundtrack are all excellent just like in the first film the battle for helms deep is easily one of the best action sequences in cinema i dont think they could have done it any better
Sep 14 2019,positive,loved the fact that we got to see the extended version
Sep 13 2019,positive,love these movies  has been awesome to see them on theaters again
Sep 13 2019,positive,incredible graphics action kept me engaged even though it was almost four hours long
Sep 13 2019,positive,it was awesome very long but i loved every minute of the added footage
Sep 12 2019,positive,better than the first time a never aging award winning classic
Sep 10 2019,positive,great movie  the extended version was interesting and long but having seen both versions i found the original released movie perfect the scenes which were cut added more details to characters thinkingbehavior but in my opinion were not necessary to grasp the storyline any better given the movie length the extended scenes added another ca 20 min i thoroughly enjoyed seeing this film once more on the big screen  no regrets getting to see the cut scenes i highly recommend going to see all of the trilogy on the big screen again or first time if you havent
Sep 10 2019,positive,so well done it never gets old  loved it when it first came out and still love it
Sep 9 2019,positive,extended edition provides wonderful details missing from original release  enriched the story and experience  wonderful
Sep 9 2019,positive,an incredible second installment in one of the greatest film trilogies ever  this movie perfectly captures middleearth especially in showing the realm of rohan    whereas the first movie is my person pick for the best one this one does an excellent job at transitioning the films from adventure films to more politically savvy war films  the ending of this film culminates in the sheer incredible battle of helms deep which is still one of the best action sequences ever filmed
Sep 8 2019,positive,the new scenes made it make much more sense
Sep 8 2019,positive,even better in the extended versions
Sep 4 2019,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is  a perfect sequel to a perfect movie it shows probably the greatest battle ever put into a movie the best things besides the battle of helms deep is the introduction to rohan which has the best music of all time
Sep 3 2019,positive,fantastic just as soon as you thought it couldnt get any better from the first one amazing battle scenes and fantastic acting 
Aug 26 2019,positive,i really loved this movie the metach the characters especially aragorn
Aug 17 2019,positive,the best of the lord of the rings movies

Aug 3 2019,positive,been there done that 
Jul 25 2019,positive,a sequel that might be better than the original 
Jul 20 2019,positive,the second installment takes everything the first movie had done and only does it better
Jul 10 2019,positive,a transition to the conclusion of a proclaimed best film adaptation series
Jul 9 2019,positive,this movie continues the greatness of the first film maintaining the grandeur and colossal scope of the novels as skillfully as its predecessor
Jul 9 2019,positive,the greatest sequel to a movie of all time end of story
Jun 17 2019,positive,it is rare for a sequel to be better than the original yet this one surpasses the first with great action and effects  especially with andy serkiss gollum while also maintaining the grand sense of adventure and strengthening relationships 
May 19 2019,positive,sets a bar thats for sure
May 16 2019,negative,i was even more befuddled by this film than i was by its predecessor so so many characters exist in this film and yet none of them are particularly interesting and the obstacles they face are poorly made up monsters with silly names like nazguls and uruks unlike the first film very little time is given to character development here and i felt as though i was watching a montage more than an actual story if i were into the books i probably would geek out when they eat elfish bread but because im not i found the most interesting parts of the film to be those that involved eowyn and arwen who each only appear on screen for a few minutes i have really enjoyed films with all male characters in the past 12 angry men 1957 secret honor 1984 but there they are interesting flawed men who dont speak in riddle i needed something to latch onto and if it was aragorn awkwardly swallowing eowyns terrible cooking so be it    gollum andy serkis finally appears and he attempts to steal the one ring from frodo and sam before he decides to guide them to mordor after they manage to tie him up merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd are captured by an anthropomorphic tree and are the comic relief throughout the film until they get tied up in a battle aragorn viggo mortensen and other men with long white hair end up in rohan when karl urbans dad has become controlled by saruman they free him and we prove that aragorn is perfect because every woman loves him in the end we find out that gollum is betraying the two friends frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin and is going to try to get the ring back duh    the visual effects are incredible again and we get to see more of the beautiful new zealand landscape and scenery good for our tourism industry i appreciated how great the treeman looked and the nazgul i think thats what they are called were equally scary clearly peter jackson is a great director when it comes to capturing landscapes and creating a beautiful fantasy world but he failed to make me engaged with a story that i was not already invested in without reading the books had he taken a cue from victor fleming and made the film more accessible i would have been more interested but no this is for the fanboys only    another criticism i have is the awful screenplay the fact that four different people including jackson and his wife worked on it didnt make it better every line seems to be exposition as we get characters who already know one another explaining to each other who they are and what their backstory is it was so unnatural and left me so uninvolved in their stories or their plights as characters that it ruined the film the plot just sort of ambles along as we get an awkward blend of bad slapstick comedy from merry and pippin and deathly serious scenes of aragorn giving speeches about the evil of the one ring maybe this is just the way that all fantasy films are written and i understand that they significantly simplified the plot from the book this film is based on but still i expect the film to seem coherent    the only fun parts of the film to me occurred when miranda otto was on screen as she was such a luminous female presence amongst all of the seriousness and masculinity her character is underwritten and she falls for aragorn immediately because of course however otto makes the film worth watching for just a few minutes tyler does less with her character but the base instinct in me enjoyed seeing two attractive people kissing something i wouldnt be so into in a better film    i gave the first film a pass but i really dont think its worth continuing with this trilogy even though i will because i hate myself apparently this was a mess of a film that wastes its best elements and caused a person who was really trying to get into the film to completely turn against it
Mar 31 2019,positive,class absolute class extended cuts of all three films just add so much to the films this one is amazing 
Mar 20 2019,positive,superb the best of the trilogy a must watch must see l must have
Mar 19 2019,positive,a sequel that manages to stand up on its own and pick up expertly on where it left off this was another fantastic movie the action is amazing and much more intense than before the characters are beautifully developed along their journey then creating more wonderful worlds and journeys we wish to continue and see as we all feel the excitement and ambition of the final chapter pitch perfect all the way through
Mar 16 2019,positive,im in love with this franchise 3
Mar 14 2019,positive,my personal favorite in the movie trilogy two towers is darker more intense has a great and more prominent villain in saruman and gets us ready for the satisfying conclusion
Mar 9 2019,positive,one of the best ever
Feb 26 2019,positive,this movie continues the story as well as the first one began it this is the movie that shows just how epic and massive middle earth is as we see when they arrive in rohan the speech by sam at the end of the movie is also the most inspiring movie speech maybe ever and makes it another incredible ending to a movie in the trilogy once again a near perfect translation from book to movie
Feb 26 2019,positive,best movie trilogy ever
Feb 23 2019,positive,the second part of the best movie ever made
Jan 12 2019,positive,the second best trilogy of all time just a fantastic movie 
Jan 4 2019,positive,possibly the best movie ever made
Dec 29 2018,positive,andy serkis portrayal of gollum will forever be remembered as the highlight of the second entry of lotr a nearly flawless movie that somewhat slight drags at some point
Dec 27 2018,positive,love love love love love this movie the best sequel ever made and my favorite fantasy movie of all time although i love fellowship and return almost as much two towers is still my favorite chapter in this trilogy everything from the score the effects the characters it all still holds up remarkably well not to mention the introduction of possibly my favorite character in the trilogy andy serkis as gollum what a great character what an amazing movie 
Dec 26 2018,positive,the attack on helms deep is one of the best war scenes ever  a great sequel to the first and transition to the final chapter of frodos journey
Dec 16 2018,positive,this may be the best actionadventure film in existence no doubt the best of its trilogy and that alone is a big compliment this movie is so beautiful and just is a blast to watch
Dec 11 2018,positive,the middle chapter of the thrilogy its surely the darkest and may be hard to follow for some watchers but the production continue its quality offering engaging storylines meaningful dialogue and some great new additions to the supporting cast being andy serkis the standout and one of the best battle scenes of all time
Dec 2 2018,positive,it feels a little bit like the setup for the finale of the trilogy but its still awesome and flawless but not the best in the series
Dec 2 2018,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is once again directed by peter jackson taken from jrr tolkiens novel screenplay by fran walsh philippa boyens stephen sinclair and peter jackson all of them are the same from the first one except for stephen sinclair starring elijah wood ian mckellen viggo mortensen and sean astin    the story continues with frodo and sam trying to destroy the ring during the journey they met gollum meanwhile aragorn drawing closer to his kingly destiny rallies forces of good for the battles that must come    if you read my first review of the lord of the rings trilogy so you already know that i loved how they set the characters and how they made the special effects etc and you also know that i didnt like the performance and the direction sometimes wasnt good for me so i watched this one and i was hoping to see these flaws got fixed so did they fix it not that much to be noticed but as a middle chapter of a trilogy setting all paces for the final one the lord of the rings the two towers is completely amazing also for the fans of the book and the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring    the lord of the rings the two towers has lots of amazing special effects just like the first one i was still amazed of how talented and unique the creators of this movie were i mean some movies were released in the same year but the special effects werent that good not even close    the performances on the other hand are the same the only one that was brilliant is andy serkis as gollum all the others are the very same and i didnt like them before so its the same problem but andy serkis improved it    i liked the direction a little tiny pit more than the first one    so technically as its obvious i liked the lord of the rings the two towers more than the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring especially the story which was fastpaced and better than the first one so as its improved its definitely getting a higher grade so im gonna give the lord of the rings the two towers an a    i really had lots of fun while talking with you about the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring and the lord of the rings the two towers and im so excited to talk to you about the lord of the rings the return of the king and its gonna be very soon    alright guys thank you for reading my review hope you like and if you do please support my work to encourage me to carry one
Nov 30 2018,positive,the movie of my childhood still loving it at 19 years old
Nov 17 2018,positive,two towers is a near perfect continuation to its predecessor the acting is on point and no new addition feels out of place in such an already perfect cast the mo cap and production design is an outstanding achievement howard shores soundtrack is again fantastic this 3 hour epic leaves you full but wanting more and to see how our heroes meet the end
Nov 15 2018,positive,its simply one of the best movies and in one of the best series of all time its iconic and set the standard of big battle sequences
Nov 10 2018,positive,this is on its own  as an adaptation its about a 2
Nov 8 2018,positive,continues exactly where the first one left off and keeps the standards stunning visuals and storytelling
Nov 5 2018,positive,the best movie of the the lord of the rings
Oct 28 2018,positive,a slight improvement over the first because of the story which was a little more interesting to me
Oct 16 2018,positive,super movies the special effects first of all are excellent the most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale i did watch them using boxxy software and it was awesome
Oct 15 2018,positive,one of my favourite films of all time however sam and frodos story along with pippin and merrys slows it down and is quite awful
Oct 14 2018,positive,much like my review of the first lotr this film is takes it up a notch by adding gollumsmegol  and many interesting battles
Oct 13 2018,positive,another classic chapter to the epic lotr trilogy
Oct 11 2018,positive,another incredible into middle earth loved the battle of helms deep
Oct 7 2018,positive,the epitome of oh my goodness in film
Sep 21 2018,positive,as with fellowship of the ring you can only hate this screen adaptation if youre an unyielding book fanatic  groundbreaking visuals great acting great action great music
Sep 10 2018,positive,the perfect sequel that builds on everything that made the first film amazing
Sep 2 2018,positive,through shadow to the edge of night until the stars are all alight
Aug 28 2018,positive,that was hilarious how they goofed on the hobbits in that opening scene with the climbing down ive never seen someone with such split personality and bi polar disorder as i have with gollum hes so fucked in the head that to kill him would be doing him a favor hes just suffering being alive theres really good make up and special effects in this one     they really scouted for some gorgeous locations in these movies and they really know how to show them off these movies do  a great job at showing how evil power and greed is that marsh of death was pretty scary was not expecting gollum to save who he did nice to see a familiar face who is now reborn and whiter than ever    its awesome how the plot unfolds and how it gets more and more interesting as the story goes on this movie goes a little bit too much into the lore like the part with the hobbits and the tree that walks i love how the story of the different characters intertwine and how they jump back and forth     really good action sequences in this one especially the fight at the end what did really annoy me though were all the scenes with the walking tree guy he was just so fucking useless and it felt like it didnt add to the story
Aug 17 2018,positive,great movie slow to start but big awesome finish
Aug 6 2018,negative,some parts are just nonsensical the spirit of middleearth is lost out there tolkien is quite disturbed at his tomb
Aug 3 2018,positive,one of the best movies of all time
Jul 30 2018,positive,this film elevated the series to a higher plane with more emphasis on each characters story and more suspense for the films end the introduction of gollum also helps
Jul 18 2018,positive,soundtrack is top tier casting costumes all top tier plot keeps you entertained just a taddddd boring at times
Jul 14 2018,positive,balancing out great performances with andy serkis stealing the show as gollum andy serkis is awesome epic action sequences amazing visuals and cgi for 2002 and more breathtaking new zealand cinematography the two towers balances out three separate storylines whilst still managing to leave you hyped up for return of the king near the end
Jul 12 2018,positive,the introduction of gollum helms deep and the return of gandalf what is there not to love not quite as impactful as the other 2 films but still a fantastic film
Jul 5 2018,positive,i grade my movies on a scale of 1 to lotr these are the greatest movies of all time and they were done with a third of the budget that movies are given today funny how movies keep getting worse despite the massive influx of cash while these stand the test of time
Jun 21 2018,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is another phenomenal movie in the lotr trilogy that gives audiences an amazing sequel when comparing it to its predecessor only barely is its predecessor better the first film is the coming together of all the characters and how the story became to be but its still hard to say because the two towers still offers great and emotional storytelling along with incredible performances from its whole cast i would say just barely because its really hard to say that the first is better by any more than an extremely tiny amount the visual effects are again outstanding and peter jackson does another great job with directing and cowriting the screenplay with three other people he does the film so well just like the first one and hes able to get everything thats needed to make the film as food as it is and satisfy audiences again we get to see more epic fight scenes that will keep you wondering if the good guys will win or loose which is definitely something that adds to the greatness of the film overall its definitely another movie that audiences can enjoy that will keep them eager for the final chapter
Jun 15 2018,positive,awesome movie  awesome characters awesome job on putting a great book series on the big screen  special effects awesome  my second favorite character king theodin and the riders of rohan were perfectly acted and portrayed
Jun 1 2018,positive,the sequel picks up right after the first film the complex script follows three groups each embarking on their own quest first theres frodo and sam joined by gollum who are traveling to mordor to destroy the ring i enjoyed the dynamic among frodo sam and gollum in its predecessor we only see a glimpse of what the ring can do but here we witness the effects of the ring through frodo and becomes a means of character development second merry and pippin regain their freedom after being in the hands of sarumans army third aragorn legolas and gimli try to rescue merry and pippin on their quest aragorns group learns from the rohirrim that saruman has influenced their king theoden along the way they meet a resurrected gandalf and together they set out to break theoden free of sarumans influence the group encounters many obstacles with one nearly killing aragorn the reoccurring theme of resurrection is fascinating but i am not convinced by the way aragorn was brought back i am still confused about what happened with what seems to be a dream sequence moving forward the battle with sarumans army begins and this may be one of the best battle scenes ever shot in movie history it is also clever that the villain is only uttered by name but still largely impacts the story the overall film progresses fast enough to include many details and aspects to their story however it can become overwhelming their dialogue is very poetic and the imagery is very detailed again the franchise leaves the audience with a lot of hope despite the obstacles they have yet to face the lord of the rings the two towers lives up to its predecessor in many ways and brings forth twice as much energy with captivating visuals and an actionpacked story just when you think the franchise cannot get any better it just does       follow 
May 29 2018,positive,im not much of a lord of the rings fan but this one was very interesting and creepy

May 9 2018,positive,the second part of the trilogy continues the journey through helms deep
May 4 2018,positive,this movie contains one of the greatest fantasy battle sequences in any movie
Apr 2 2018,positive,a true epic that captures great cinematography screenwriting and acting all in one piece of film an epic climax that will challenge other movies to bring together story as well as the towers did
Mar 20 2018,positive,peter jackson brings tolkien to life in a film thats even more spectacular than the fellowship of the ring treebeard and the battle of helms deep both aspects mostly computer animated are majestic the movies faults are occasionally in the tonelooking for laughs when none are neededor condescending to the audiences intelligence when were introduced to gandalf the white christopher lees voice and image are superimposed over ian mckellens rather than delay the big reveal and add suspense it came off as patronizing same with the music dramaticsuspenseful notes are played when we are uncertain of whats lurking only to be a fakeout when something harmless is revealed this is cheap and manipulative in jaws we only hear daduh daduh daduh when the shark is actually approaching but not when theres a false alarm the two towers transcends its faults and is still an impressive crowd pleaser
Mar 19 2018,positive,talking tree befriends midgets crackhead attempts to steal ring so they can go pawn it for crack money
Mar 19 2018,positive,oh my precious sequel for a blockbuster this sequel reigns supreme atop the mountain of 2nd chapters yes its better than empire aliens spiderman 2 etc its just that great
Mar 5 2018,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is an epic sequel to an epic predecessor and takes our favorite characters into a new adventure riddled with incredible action and memorable moments
Feb 20 2018,positive,a huge step up from the original great story writing visuals and edge of your seat action what else do you need in a movie probably the best bridge movie since empire strikes back 
Feb 16 2018,positive,the 2nd installment to the lord of the rings manages to blend beautiful storytelling with revolutionary visual effects this movie is indeed a masterpiece   ill give it             95
Feb 8 2018,positive,iconic battle scene of helms deep makes this one quite memorable gandalf the white showing up with an army at dawn was epic
Feb 6 2018,positive,97100  i watched the extended cut amazing just amazing best one out of the trilogy
Jan 28 2018,positive,probably the best movie ever
Jan 27 2018,negative,so i was not a fan of the first one but this one was a little better i had more action and i like the plot but still it was a long movie i do wish they did not make these movies so long
Jan 25 2018,positive,i watch it almost every day
Jan 22 2018,positive, can it get any better incredible battle scene very charismatic characters and amazing acting very impressed with the cgi on gollums character beautiful mise en scene this movie is a great trip to middle earth 
Jan 20 2018,positive,an incredible example of how the middle film should be in a trilogy excellently executed
Jan 17 2018,positive,following the huge success of the first film comes the two towers a film that takes a few more risks but mostly works again clocking in at over 3 hrs long and with twice as many stories to tellat times this film seems crammed and is bursting the book was split into 2 parts whereas the film attempts to tell both stories simultaneously often working but often slowing the overall story down   i would have preferred to follow the story of the ring more closely and have less of the over the top cgi battle scenes that seem inserted to give the film a cinematic climax  a bum numbing film at times but mostly enjoyable and not much wrong with it other than the time it takes to watch it
Jan 7 2018,positive,it shows how good this trilogy is when for me  this is the weakest of the three films and yet it is still an amazing film its a bridge between the fellowship of the ring and the return of the king and i guess its job is to basically explain a lot of the myths and story of the lord of the rings and it does that and more its a wonderful and beautiful film with one of the greatest battles ever put on film tremendous
Jan 6 2018,positive,continues the trilogy with perhaps its most impressive spectacle in the battle for helms deep the storytelling and character development sometimes take a backseat to action but its still a lot of fun to watch
Jan 4 2018,positive,a great continuation for a great trilogy but it deserves only 4 and a half stars because it still aint the same as the book i dont want to spend pages about the differences between lord of the rings movies and book but im here actually to celebrate this motion picture we left frodo and samvise sailing from the mountains just after the mines of moria to mordor and we left aragorn gimli and legolas looking for meriadoc and peregrin who had been kidnapped by urukhai so this movie follows separately this three different plots the two hobbits meet smeagolgollum ill call him gollum who helps them finding the way to mordor but gollum is not a valid ally in fact hes kind of crazy because of frodos one ring he wants it he cannot live without it after that he is a really good orator who convinces frodo to forsake sam sam does not abandon his master anyway in the meanwhile we see the man the dwarf and the elf looking for the other two hobbits they reach the land of the horse masters called rohan there there is a corrupted king not politically but spiritually speaking whose name is théoden he is being controlled by grìma one of sarumans slaves but with the help of gandalf he didnt die the group finds out grìma is defeated in the meanwhile its always a meanwhile story peregrin and meriadoc found treebeard in the fangorn wood what kind of creature is he hes an ent ie a huge anthropomorphic tree who claims to be the oldest creature in middle earth at the end frodo and sam succeed in arriving to mordor but now they have to front the dark lord sauron what can i say about this movie nothing that ive already said this is obviously a masterpiece and the question is how did peter jackson pass from splatters to this pieces of art i honestly dont know so i just suggest you to throw yourselves in your couch and enjoy this technical art
Dec 26 2017,positive,excellent sequel to a great movie very well done only makes you want to see return of the king even more
Dec 23 2017,positive,not as good as the third movie but still a timeless classic nonetheless  see the extended editions
Dec 21 2017,positive,good follow up to fellowship of the ring telling the story from three different herogroup perspectives was well done battle of helms deep was pretty epic
Dec 19 2017,positive,a beautiful film overall that balances its own subplots with the greater story  it connects to revolutionary use of motion capture create a convincingly ugly character who will never be forgotten each main character in this fantastic ensemble is given plenty to work with and even side characters are given satisfying arcs this film delivers the same excellence as its predecessor while raising the stakes and the visual spectacle without losing focus on its core story points
Dec 2 2017,positive,again the director has outdone himself
Nov 24 2017,positive,theyve done it again
Nov 24 2017,positive,this is my favorite film of all time everything is just great about even if they come of battles without a scratch
Nov 21 2017,negative,i love the first film but i found this one boring
Nov 19 2017,positive,the opening scene of the two towers provides an outstanding yet very brief taste of action cinematography and special effects only to be matched and far surpassed in the final hour of the film the stunning events of the third hour of the two towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film and while the first two hours serve finely as story development they primarily build anticipation for the final hour which mostly depicts the battle of helms deep more than anything else the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience its a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour but i take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while    as stated the road to the battle of helms deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film perhaps the two towers biggest fault is in its own accomplishments the first two thirds of the film are well shot well paced and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline but when compared to the spectacular final hour the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant however to be fair i feel that its simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of helms deep its difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time peter jackson has had to create six hours so far of finished film the battle of helms deep is simply unreal its unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained and regained popularity    as assumed the two towers begins where the fellowship of the ring ended the majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines frodo and sam aragorn and legolas merry and pippin and saruman and his army the performances live well up to the standards of the first film with a particularly notable performance from viggo mortensen as aragorn whose role is significantly larger in the two towers aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for a thirst that was left partly unquenched in fellowship its much easier to root for aragorn than it is for frodo aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man a soldier and a hero more than once did the audience filled mostly with academy voters applaud the heroics of aragorn gollum also shines in a muchwelcomed large role due to extremely realistic computer animation and a fine performance from andy serkis upon which the animation was modeled in fellowship it was appropriate to consider gollum one of the many great features of the film however here he is more of a leading character and a star and his convincing dualpersonality stabbing voice and wellchoreographed body movements make him consistently eyegrabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears    as was the fellowship of the ring the two towers is a visual delight those who have seen fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of new zealand the cinematography is again one of the best aspects of the film the swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this postmatrix era the shots of the ascending enemyladen ladders in the battle of helms deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once the visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film while the visual effects in fellowship were outstanding the battle of helms deep provides for the best application of cgi since the rippling waves of the matrixs bullet time the battle of helms deep features absolutely aweinspiring and seamless integration of acting stunts and computer animation each orc seems to have its own personality demonstrated in its movements and visual features the masses of armies fight with strategy and true character which i imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers the only problem i have with the visual department is the look of gimli the treebeard gimlis visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film but again there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of helms deep george lucas and the wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of the two towers final hour and i doubt they will do so anytime soon    in the fellowship of the ring i had a few minor problems with howard shores score while i thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes i dont think it handled the sentimental scenes opening in the shire gandalfs passing properly i thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much resembling the emotions from james horners titanic however i believe that the two towers requires the type of score which howard shore accomplishes best dark continuous and unrelenting as demonstrated in se7en and silence of the lambs the theme used in many of the action scenes in fellowship low brass six notes repeated with a rest in between is much more present in the two towers appropriately a brand new theme is also unveiled the theme for rohan a prominent kingdom in middle earth rohans theme is played more often than any other melody in the film underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect howard shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an alist composer and with a possible double oscar nomination this year for the two towers and gangs of new york he could get propelled to the very top of the alist right beside john williams and hans zimmer in terms of demand    if not the picture itself there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of helms deep the battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form the choreography of the battle the visual effects the pacing acting cinematography and music all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be for this very reason no one whether a fan of fellowship or not should miss the two towersthe two towers can only be explained in one word beautiful this film left me breathless i was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the fellowship of the ring and i must say that it has surpassed the film completely i will have a hard time watching the fellowship and seeing the ending knowing there is so much more waiting    lets start with gollum gollum gave an astonishing performance the poor misunderstood beast or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the one ring the performance given in cgi is at times very human the facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor gollums voice is still haunting even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of mordor for these reasons and more gollum has become my favorite character in the film replacing legolas in the fellowship    on the other side of middle earth we see aragorn legolas and gimli i have to say that the dark times of this movie are at times overbearing and saddening there is a perfect mix of humor in the film given by the characters gimli and legolas while still keeping the viewer in understanding that these are very darkened times aragorns performance is outstanding he has proven that he can be put on an alist of actors and deserves appraise for his performance    gandalf the white in this film was a twist we remember the friendly gandalf the grey in the fellowship being a kind elderly wizard shouting off fireworks for the children of the shire and smoking leaf as explained in the novel there are no cute scenes with the new white wizard no fireworks or pipes just a wizard that knows the daunting task ahead and the quest seems to have taken hold of the great wizard    very dark are the times for frodo and samwise gollum seams to give frodo hope as the two ring bearers can associate the pains of the one ring frodo gives an amazing performance this time around as well it seams that the ring of power has taken hold of frodo and our hero is slipping but the surprise was aimed at samwise proving that sam is the definition of a true best friend even at times when it seems there is no hope for the troubled trio it seams that sam brings hope to the moment this is what keeps the frodos story this time around even more extraordinary is the hope that is there even when all odds point to despair    merry and pippins story is very odd initially the ents in the story are very wise and newly troubled creatures from the amazing mind of tolkien this story goes back to cut scenes during the worries of the rest of middle earth and gives us a feeling of hope in the troubled times of aragorn and the others the ents were very well done cgi wise but it was there personality that moved the audience they are curiously wise and well spoken and give the impression of an elderly college professor their story is eventually given a wonderful opportunity and for those of us who know the story know that greatness is upon them    this movie honestly moved me further than i thought any film could i could see my face and the emotion i felt as i was watching this mammoth film peter jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent this story has captivated my heart and the film has taken my breath away there is no words that can express the greatness of this film 1010
Nov 17 2017,positive,best trilogy of all time
Nov 10 2017,positive,greatest trilogy ever
Nov 4 2017,positive,burdened somewhat by a lack of giddy awe that characterized the first lotr outing the two towers is both grand and spectacular but almost unrelentingly grim cascading with battles and dark forces galore all is done in service of deepening the mythology and narrative of the series but it isnt necessarily much fun it proves nearly a drag albeit a gorgeous and epic one in the over an hour climactic battle that has no reason being as long as it is while the conclusion is powerful and beckons the audience to join them for the final outing the two towers is long and ponderous but so wellfilmed and engaging for fans of the series it is hard to fault it completely rating 67
Nov 1 2017,positive,the sequel to tlotr is one of the best ever made in this whole theater
Oct 14 2017,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen it is rewatchable and makes you understand every moment the acting is a solid 1010 and the story is awesome
Oct 10 2017,positive,epic beautifully made fantasy film
Sep 25 2017,positive,gandalfs third act arrival when all hope seems lost is one of the greatest moments in film history an unbelievable sequel that i enjoyed more than the excellent first movie special effects that still for the most part hold up an unbelievable climax and gollumsmeagle stealing the show combine to make this my favorite of the trilogy almost if not as good as the dark knight
Sep 10 2017,positive,the middle of a trilogy is always a difficult balance to achieve you have to build and develop existing characters from the first film and also create enough intrigue and excitement for the final film whilst being an enjoyable and action packed entity of its own and the two towers completely pulls it off we follow the fellowship that has now broken off into 3 distinct groups frodo and sam head towards mordor merry and pippin have been taken by the uruk hai and aragorn legolas and gimli have set off on foot to rescue their hobbit friends were also introduced to quite a few new characters the most interesting of which are theoden played by bernard hill and gollumsméagol played by andy serkis gollum is one of the most astounding achievements of this film the mixture of motion capture cgi and andy serkis performance creates a character that is so engaging pitiful and complicated that he steals every scene that hes in and shows the audience what could happen to frodo if his mission fails the two towers also ratchets up the fight scenes from the previous film with the attack on isengard and the battle for helms deep the latter or which has an excellent balance of tension humour action and real heart to it as our heroes are heavily outnumbered by the enemy just as good as the the fellowship of the ring if not better peter jackson continues to push the boundaries of filmmaking in scale and excellence
Sep 2 2017,negative,my only favorite part was the beginning and then it got boring for me and complicated so its not one for me
Aug 14 2017,positive,best movie and best triology ever period
Aug 9 2017,positive,excellent excellent excellent film the dam scence and the battle with the orcs make the movie
Aug 2 2017,positive,amazing just like its predecessor this sequel is darker more actionpacked and even with some humor thrown in there also andy serkis as gollums performance is legendary
Jul 25 2017,positive,a super rare sequel with fantastic battles and sieges a terrific cast and steadily paced storyline
Jul 16 2017,positive,an epic sequel that doesnt get bogged down in the middle chapter narrative problems largely in part to the fantastic source material the humanization and excellent realization of who these characters are along with retelling the story in an emotionally powerful and visually spectacular way the two towers is a perfect adaptation and is a spectacle in filmmaking in every single way
Jul 8 2017,positive,awesome film enjoyed it very much its a great 2 with lots of action epic moments and believable cgi excellent cinematography
Jul 1 2017,positive,one of the best films ever
Jun 11 2017,positive,an all time fantasy classic masterfully done on film  this will be a legendary film trilogy for ages to come
Jun 4 2017,positive,did enjoy it but it was too slow
Jun 1 2017,positive,the weakest of the lord of the rings trilogy is still one of the best movies ever made this chapter definitely feels the middleslump without the punch of the beginning or ending but also contains one of the coolest moments of cinema in the last march of the ents
Jun 1 2017,positive,not as fun as the first one but it defenatly was done beter with an even amount of everything which made it a great sequel to the lotr
May 14 2017,positive,i think i did a good job on watching this its about me not about the actors okay i mean thank me for this movie
May 10 2017,positive,visually stunning powerful and fantastic battle sequences
May 6 2017,positive,lightning strikes twice jacksons follow up is a stunning picture of war and hope
May 6 2017,positive,read the books as a kid and this trilogy encapsulated them beautifully together my all time favourite films
May 3 2017,positive,the battle of helms deep what else can i say
Apr 25 2017,positive,in my top 5 movies of all time lord of the rings is one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time and this movie brings all the emotions and action that both average movie goers and die hard lord of the rings fans can both enjoy equally
Apr 25 2017,positive,the continuation of frodos journey is a great outing for peter jackson and elijah woods while its isnt as good as the first film to me it may be because the first one captured my mind and imagination unlike any film before it i love this series of films and cant believe that no director before has created this live action master piece before now the return of sir ian mckellens gandolf is a surprise to those who have not read the books before watching the film the introduction of the creepy gollum is off putting but the perfect way to portray the character keep bringing great films mr jackson
Apr 22 2017,positive,this is probably my favorite lord of the rings movie gotta love aragorn legolas and gimli
Apr 21 2017,positive,an improvement over the first film purely because we get see middleearth be expanded upon with new characters and additional world building while also improving upon the action with an epic battle at helms deep the production the score the script the direction and the cinematography are all kept to a high standard and quite frankly it only suffers from what the first film did in terms of being open ended coupled with a lackluster ending
Apr 14 2017,positive,by far my favorite of the trilogy the battle of helms deep is by far the greatest movie battle put to screen in my opinion a must see
Apr 10 2017,positive,the two towers is a spectacular movie with amazing action sequences and very emotional moments that leaves you amazed with its own epicness
Apr 3 2017,negative,terrible  boring  ridiculous long  the only thing good about it was cut direction  who wants to watch 3 12 hrs of a hero whos most heroic action is running away
Apr 1 2017,negative,billions of budgets for a film full of racist allusions blonde elves with blue eyes like nazis are presented as a superior race to the the hai urucs resulting from the crossbreeding all the races with quality are genetically programmed without faults  did hitler himself write this scenario this film is a nazi propaganda work see the book of isabelle smadja which proved it in black and white
Mar 30 2017,positive,an excellent adaptation that tells the story in a masterful way and improves both the tempo and the already spectacular visual and special effects
Mar 22 2017,positive,very good  go watch it if your were on the fence like me  an epic battle that cannot be beat
Mar 6 2017,positive,overall very enjoyable but i got to say there is a whole lot of downtime and its pretty dang boring  but it is less boring than the first
Mar 4 2017,positive,one of the most epic and greatest movies in history
Feb 26 2017,positive,maybe the best of the three the world of lord of the rings gets bigger and more dangerous the expanded presence of golem adds uniqueness that separates lord of the rings from other fantasy movies
Feb 26 2017,positive,this ridiculously long and epic fim boasts even more grand action revolutionary special effects and great acting as well as more developed characters and emotion that you feel more easily
Feb 12 2017,positive,two towers was a huge improvement
Feb 10 2017,positive,got to be one of the best films ever made enjoy the character development from the first film as we follow frodo baggins further on his journey into mordor to destroy the ring great depth and new challenges for the protagonist to face including the reveal of a new powerful army in the uruk hai    the introduction to new characters to the franchise is amazing one of the main being the introduction to gollum as a main character great performance from andy serkis along with king theoden a man poisoned by sauruman to puppeteer the kingdom of rohan this introduction raises the stakes of the battle for the ring and the fate of the character     not to mention the amazing battle at helms deep which not only offers some of the greatest fights but offers a light amount of comedy to go along with it coming from legolas and gimli enjoyable from start to finish
Feb 9 2017,positive,this movie is just like the first one but better
Feb 9 2017,positive,in spite of jackson dumbing down the plot of tolkiens original to make it a more simplistic good vs evil fight eg removing the dunlendings so that all the enemies would have no soul making sauruman an agent of sauron rather than a man lusting after the one ring like everyone else making theoden possessed by sauruman rather than just duped adding elves in the final battle so that the men wouldnt have been abandoned by all the good groups to be killed by the orcs as they were in the book making smeagol and gollum literally 2 different people in one body and so on and so forth this is an exceptionally exciting movie and it contains some of the only long battle scenes that i can actually say i thoroughly enjoyed sitting through including both helms deep and isenguard frodos darkening personality as a result of the one ring is masterfully done the one plot changed i liked was the ents initially refusing to join the fight as it allowed for a very powerful scene and made up for some of the loss in moral complexity
Feb 2 2017,positive,fantastic these are spectacular
Jan 27 2017,positive,this was a very exciting fun  joyful experience for me which i found to be a very outoftheordinary type of film  its a thrilling movie that flies at a gallop boasts the most impressive computer graphics yet created and succeeds smashingly as a grownup drama and kidcaptivating fantasy making way for this trilogy to be one of my most favourite fantasy franchises yet
Jan 23 2017,positive,near perfect movie end with thrilling battle scene
Jan 20 2017,positive,amazing 2nd chapter and the battle of helms deep is really mind blowing
Jan 14 2017,positive,the lord of the rings two towers is hoisted into prosperity and glory by the tailored hands of peter jackson who oh soo diligently emends his errors and inaccuracies regrettably made in the fellowship of the ring the preeminent science fiction film made its debut on december 18th 2002 and continued to be a close contender with minority report along with men in black the ensemble reunites once more with viggo mortensen orlando bloom john rhysdavies mckemckellen elijah wood sean astin mordorbilly boyd and dominic monaghan who are left in the fate of frodo baggins vigilance throumordor  two towers progresses the already established narrative of frodo and sam venturing on their perilous expedition to mtdoom to destroy and forsaken the ring along with their journey their are two other expeditions that are explored fangornaragorn gimli and legolas scouring through the forfangorn in search for the orcs who have captured pippin and mary as well as mary and pippin acquainting themselves with treebeard a fellow ent for all that enchanting is not only seen throughout the main characters but also visited within the supporting characters gollum the race of the ents and the kingdom of rohan are testaments of jacksons solicitude for tolkiens masterful folklore  where fellowship summons emotional storytelling two towers summons war violence and action to entice its audience battling is a predominant aspect of science fiction its a facet where directors can really demonstrate their prowess through the staggering size and scopes of miseensceneswhich is the arrangement of everything that appears in the framing actors lighting decor props scenery and costumes jackson is no neophyte furthermore he makes no mistake of having incontestable fidelity for tolkiens most paramount chapters from helms deep to the road to isengard these are the sequences that undoubtedly pass the brink of being visually sensual  in conclusion two towers is an exemplary film with few rough edges from absent chapters but this sequel still triumphs in a demonstration of jacksons plenary indulgence within tolkiens mythology
Dec 7 2016,negative,better that the first but only went to see cos my mate was a fan of the book i was not the least bit won over by these films
Dec 4 2016,positive,best series of movies ive ever seen
Nov 30 2016,positive,one of the biggest cons is that it feels really long i think i can say why i dont like this one as much it felt like a detour the fellowship wasnt together either which helped that feeling everyone but frodo and sams storyline were annoying because they had nothing to do with the fellowship or the ring and there were even new characters introduced for it that were fine but i didnt like that they were just there for the plot there were several fight scenes which were cool and had great action but not what i wanted i also didnt love how they used a certain character this time around it also feels very different in tone and in other ways i dont know how to describe overall this isnt really bad its just something that should have come out after the ring story was told like a sequel not something that should have happened while were in the middle of telling a story im not thinking this rating will change and unless return of the king is worse this is my least favorite ive never seen game of thrones but i feel like its probably something like this royal is a description id use for this i think thats one of the different feelings i couldnt describe from above
Nov 26 2016,positive,the two towers is by no stretch of the imagination an underwhelming middle chapter this is just as good as the fellowship of the ring taking are characters in more complex situations and increasing the stakes for a film that keeps you engaged even in its quiet moments and the payoff in helms deep is a one of a kind another lord of the rings masterpiece
Nov 22 2016,positive,one of my favorites
Nov 17 2016,positive,do not waste your time just to see a movie with low quality i found the site to watch with high quality  i realize that some of you want to see as well         to watch full movie   to watch full movie  
Nov 11 2016,positive,best film of the trilogyoverall i really liked the ents and everyones performance is at their peak
Nov 10 2016,positive,probably my least favorite of the movies despite it being my favorite of the books however it was still much better than the book
Nov 8 2016,positive,two words helms deep  greatest film battle ever    this trilogy is just too good for me to review it transcends my ranking there are no words for me to describe how much i love these films
Oct 30 2016,positive,the two towers manages to up the ante in every possible way its once again talented and welldeveloped cast of character its remarkable visual effects and an excellent score are just the tip of the iceberg peter jackson has succesfully crafted a sequel that can wholly stand on its own but at the same time leave its viewers excited for whats still to come kudos to andy serkis for his excellent performance
Oct 10 2016,positive,fun adventure movie with the addition of a great character in gollum the final battle scene was epic about 4 viewings
Sep 12 2016,positive,best battle secne in a movie i think
Sep 12 2016,positive,4 12 out of 5 stars this is probably my favorite of all the middle earth films gollums inclusion and the conflict make it much more colorful and exciting than fellowship this is another great example of how part 2s in trilogies are always the best back to the future 2 terminator 2 empire strikes back the dark knight godfather 2 spiderman 2 indiana jones and the temple of doom etc
Sep 6 2016,positive,this one boasts a bit more action and even more character development than the first installment though its still continuing a story that doesnt reach a satisfying conclusion here with great performances and fantasy world building two towers is a memorable chapter in the saga
Aug 21 2016,positive,following such a successful film as its predecessor was never going to be an easy task for this film only it didnt just meet the expectation of that fans it went further than them what can only be described as a compelling exciting and overall phenomenal second instalment must be seen by film fans this film is even more action packed than the first with big battle scenes such as helms deep yet it still maintains lighthearted moments between the characters even in the darkest of times it will leave you wanting more
Aug 18 2016,positive,seriously try to find a better epic with better storytelling youll be searching all day fam 
Aug 11 2016,positive,the middle part is no less epic than the one before or after it
Aug 9 2016,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers continues what made the fellowship of the ring so great and does not disappoint just like the first film a masterpiece
Aug 8 2016,positive,my fav of the trilogy great action and emotion
Aug 7 2016,positive,the worst of the 3 but still great and worth a watch
Aug 2 2016,positive,i was surprised how a 4 hour long movie could keep me thoroughly entertained aragorn legolas and gimli showed great bonding and friendship and the humor between the latter two was also great it was good to see the past romance between aragorn and arwen but not too memorable arwen did make a stunningly beautiful elf princess frodo and sam were both much braver and even merry and pippin stopped being losers and that was quite refreshing to see treebeard was a great addition and i am surprised to know the voiceovers of both gimli and treebeard was done by the same actor i would have loved to lie in treebeards branches and fall asleep listening to one of his stories theoden was impressive and the shifts in his personality interesting this was a far more enjoyable movie than the first one
Jul 19 2016,positive,i came for the battle of helms deep  and i got the battle of helms deep
Jul 18 2016,positive,one of the best movies of all time and possibly the best battle ever put to the big screen
Jul 17 2016,positive,oh my god this movie is so good the movies has the same elements that make the dark knight great awesome characters breathtaking battles and aragorn is a badass the best of all of the middle earth movies just awesome in the best way
Jul 16 2016,positive,an astonishing movie with some of the best action scenes put to film along with plenty of heart
Jul 9 2016,positive,definitely recommend watching the extended edition since it adds a lot of interesting scenes this movie is a masterpiece and leaves audiences wanting to see the final movie in this trilogy
Jul 9 2016,positive,had the best funny linesscenes of the whole trilogy very expected meat of the story middle movie
Jul 6 2016,positive,featuring a breathtaking battle sequence at helms deep the two towers is a fantastic second chapter to frodos journey in middle earth
Jun 28 2016,positive,just as good as the first more epic adventures and battles the movie continues to retain the spirit of the book
Jun 28 2016,positive,due to its length i watched this film in the two parts provided on the bluray disc  watching the trilogy in this manner the extended version feels like an epic tv series with the highest level of production
Jun 28 2016,positive, amazing cgi and motion capture performance for the character of gollum   as with the book the story splits in to two plot lines and each is given ample time for you to invest  truly care about the outcome of each   the final battle scene at helms deep is epic
Jun 28 2016,positive,peter jackson accomplished the unthinkable whenever he filmed the lotr i believe even tolkien himself would be happy with peter jacksons work incredible
Jun 28 2016,positive,there are a lot of movies that claim to be epic this ones got the heft to back it up  well over 3 and a half hours the second film in the lord of the rings trilogy definitely meanders more than the first film in the series but there is still so much here to recommend starting with the amazing cgi creation gollum  motion captured by andy serkis gollum is a pathetic frightening and desperate creature  his desire for the one right completely consumed him driving his personality to split into two  the animation for his character still holds up pretty well these twelve years later  when he is on screen you just cant take your glance off of his large expressive eyes    another excellent cg character is treebeard a treeherder who protects merry and pippin and eventually gets pulled into the fray himself  he sings tells stories and questions the hobbits in a slow voice that sounds like a record player slowed down    the slowest parts of the film involve aragorns relationship with arwen the elf from the last film  she has to contemplate leaving him or facing a future where he eventually grows old and dies but she never does  these scenes add little to the narrative and are a bit boring    the film does take off for the last 40 minutes when the battle of helms deep begins  it is really rousing with a great sense of geography that a lot of large scale battle scenes like this dont have  score 9
Jun 28 2016,positive,part 2 of peter jacksons masterpiece 
Jun 28 2016,positive,iv seen all the extended editions there much better great film great actors
Jun 28 2016,positive,it was an action packed movie i loved it
Jun 28 2016,positive,absolutely epic the extended version helps make the movie feel a little less rushed and is definitely my favourite version some of the characters are explained much better too such as faramir
Jun 28 2016,positive,part of the best series ever produced
Jun 28 2016,positive,terrific movie for the time
Jun 28 2016,positive,there are times when the second movie is junk and its not this time
Jun 28 2016,positive,the two towers is one of the best films ive ever seen it has actiondrama character development and the extended edition just makes it better
Jun 28 2016,positive,the ambition continues
Jun 28 2016,negative,the plot to this film is inexistent really almost nothing changes between the end of the first film and the end of the second gandalf dies and comes back to life viggo mortensens character dies but comes back to life we are introduced to the king who is under an evil spell but the spell is broken frodo and samwise are captured but then released in between all of that long battle sequences are shown that really dont seem to contribute much to the plot and in reality the only part of the plot i was actually interested in was the story of frodo samwise and gollum but it only took about a quarter or less of the films runtime i would be much happier if the entire trilogy were shortened to one twoandahalfhourlong film that didnt feature any of the sean bean viggo mortensen orlando bloom subplot i mean seriously other than the story of gollum the only thing that advances in the story of frodo taking the ring to mordor is that they were briefly captured and that plot point really only merits 20 minutes not a whole 3hourlong film in addition the screenplay really isnt very good the dialogue features extremely basic singleclause sentences that are used only to explain the plot nothing is said that makes me think wow that was a good line or made me think twice about any belief i ever had the dialogue is not complex and any attempts at humour went over my head credit to the amazing set design visual effects costume design and makeup teams but this film was contentless put it next to any actual great film in history and it should be clear other than to fantasy fanboys that these lord of the rings movies are empty and unimportant even the cinematography is a result of good cgi work and expensive camera equipment yes peter jackson did a great job to create this world and clearly the films pay tribute to the novels which is why the films have such a huge fanbase but for someone who isnt easily impressed with fantasy elements such as the many creatures the complex names or the fictional locations there is little to be gained by watching this film
Jun 28 2016,positive,best movie in the trilogy
Jun 28 2016,positive,brilliantly cast and wonderfully acted not as good as the first but action packed medieval action helps drive this movie to a wonderful finish
Jun 28 2016,positive,midpart of peter jacksons epic lord of the rings trilogy this is epic somewhat in both scope and running time  nearly 4 hours i think    this is the one that includes the battle of helms deep while andy serkiss mocapped gollum has a much larger role to play than in the previous film but its also easy to see why the scenes that were cut for the theatrical release were so done    like all midparts of a trilogy theres also an argument to be made that it is all setup but no payoff with the war of the ring only just beginning here 
Jun 28 2016,positive,the first half has a bit of slow points a lot of story and unfortunately some plot that is not from the source material but still epic and fantastic helms deep battle rules
Jun 28 2016,positive,one of my favorites
Jun 28 2016,positive,i remembered this part more than the first part what obviously means i liked this one more then and now there is really no point to add more comments just to mention funny bits of gimli
Jun 28 2016,positive,i always believed that the fellowship was my favorite  and now revisiting the extended cuts i am just solidifying that belief  the two towers is a welcome return back into the world of middle earth  but it suffers from the fellowship being scattered across different stories    you have mary and pippen with the ents frodo and sam with gollum and aragorn and company journeying across rohan  its all balanced well but it just doesnt have that same punch that of the fellowship all being together what it really comes down to is the fellowship was a more intimate character driven journey  while two towers is a larger battle driven plot    dont get me wrong its still all fantastic thrilling and nerdtastic its just not as good but to be honest a notch down from the fellowship is still miles above most other fantasy films out there
Jun 28 2016,positive,enjoyable especially the extended parts that gave more character information
Jun 28 2016,positive,like fellowship of the ring this one moved nicely and i actually enjoyed having the additional footage it didnt lag at any point for me  this one has a bit more action and a good story another must watch
Jun 21 2016,positive,peter jackson has done it again in this must see sequal
Jun 15 2016,positive,if not more aweinspiring than the superb original lotr the two towers unashamedly uses its classic source material to excellent effect combining jawdropping large action set pieces with depth to characters jrr tolkiens novel is literally brought to life onscreen and producing one one of the best middle chapters in movie history  verdict a
Jun 11 2016,positive,while not better than the first one this one did not feel lengthy or boring at any point
Jun 9 2016,positive,fantastic movie this doesnt feel like a setup to the final chapter at all and thats great it feels like its own movie that happens to be a middle chapter
Jun 1 2016,positive,the two towers is a sequel to the amazing fellowship of the ring and while not being as good as the first it is still a spectacular film the cast is great as usual and the movie had a really great plot with some amazing battle sequences that no other movie will ever be able to top in terms of epicness 55
May 31 2016,positive,great movie with a great story and a great battle sequence this movie is great but not the best in the series
May 21 2016,positive,an amazing middle chapter that balances action emotion and story also having amazing acting and effects
May 19 2016,positive,in my opinion two towers is the best of the three peter jackson shows us once again that he created a trilogy of masterpieces
May 14 2016,positive,in chronological order   the hobbit an unexpected journey   the hobbit the desolation of smaug   the hobbit battle of five armies   the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring   the lord of the rings the two towers   the lord of the rings the return of the king
Apr 29 2016,positive,i never feel the magic of film as strong as everytime i watch lord of the rings it is truly the best trilogy ever made and by far one of my top 10 picks of all time
Apr 24 2016,positive,the high point of the trilogy was here for me  it just has everything and perfectly i might add perfect fantasy action humor drama effects story and welleverything  this is now i think the 8th film i have given 5 stars to
Mar 27 2016,positive,one of the greatest stories of all time
Mar 26 2016,positive,the continuation does not disappoint a fun ride and extremely entertaining
Mar 24 2016,positive,two towers is probably by far the best sequel there is leaving you hungry for more
Mar 23 2016,positive,gets a bit boring but the battle for helms deep more than makes up for it
Mar 15 2016,positive,about the entire trilogy of epic proportions beautifully made combining breathtaking landscapes and stateoftheart cgi with amazing battle sequences and some utterly thrilling moments mckellen and lee are delightfully imposing and serkis is exquisite yet a lot of the others including lead actor wood are far from noteworthy the script is not flawless either loaded with exposition and needless scenes and each film needs the others to feel successful grandiose but far from perfect
Mar 10 2016,positive,a fantastic second installment to the incredible lord of the rings trilogy this movie improves on nearly everything from its fantastic predecessor the character depth is improved the cinematography is wonderful and the action is some of the best in the series two towers is a fantasy epic that continues the near perfect trilogy
Mar 4 2016,positive,always was my favorite of the trilogy but it wasnt until the last few years that i was able to finally grasp the true wonder of this film of course im not sure ill be able to really grasp 100 of the piece of beauty that it is
Feb 21 2016,positive,fellowship of the ring is the best part of the trilogy    all 3 are epic tales of high caliber refreshing and revolutionary in every aspect of the word  extraordinary from start to finish it doesnt leave you bored for a single second throughout the whole 12 hour run time yes you have to watch all 3 in a row with all 3 being the extended cut yes thats how i did it and it was the greatest movie experience ive ever had its mindblowing which is a difficult task but it succeeds big time      the lord of the rings trilogy is a revolutionary masterwork
Feb 19 2016,positive,it was good but felt something missing
Feb 13 2016,positive,unbelievable second act that raises the stakes and sets up the third film just as well as the empire strikes back
Feb 1 2016,positive,look at my review for fellowship of the ring as my thoughts on it are the exactly like my thoughts on the two towers    overall grade a 1010
Feb 1 2016,positive,while this wasnt the peak of the series this definitely was a very good entry the action in this movie is truly astounding the acting and story are captivating and the lore is so broad that it would take a very long time to read every wiki article on these booksmovies better by far than any of the hobbits the two towers sets us up for a long but satisfying end to an amazing trilogy
Feb 1 2016,positive,watching this made me feel courageous the video game just as much when i got out of the theater i wanted to grab a sword and kill some urukhai
Jan 31 2016,positive,the two towers has a complex story arc to cover in relation to the 2nd novel in the trilogy of one of the greatest works of fiction of all time the lord of the rings novels by jrr tolkein is considered a popular classic with a tremendously loyal and well read fan base  tolkeins attention to detail and genius in creating an entire new world middle earth complete with its own languages has such a high standard that it has plagued earlier attempts to retell the story     this film delivers and not only respects most of the source material but is successful at unfolding a complex story arc in a believable and digestible manner for mass consumption audiences  kudos to peter jackson for pulling this off given the herculean task of tackling this high fantasy epic of literature    as a devoted reader of the tolkein books i was completely satisfied with this portrayal on film
Jan 28 2016,positive,this was a ok movie this was a complicated movie and some parts where scary and some parts where nasty i thought like with golem he was nasty but the fighting was good in this movie but i dont like how this movie is so long but i like this one more then the 1 st one see what you think of this movie
Jan 27 2016,positive,everything from that made the first movie so great is here but like x2 the introduction of gollum was great the motion capture was some of the best of its time for sure this was one of the biggest mile stones in visual effects history the visuals are not the only thing spectacular the make up effects on the orcs are great too the characters are great once again the battle of helms deep was truly amazing everything about this movie points to it being a master piece
Jan 15 2016,positive,stunning as always  full of pluck
Jan 15 2016,positive,the two towers in a big epic film that beats the first film in every way possible featuring better developed characters more amazing visual effects and epic epic battle sequences this has changed the way i look at the entire fantasy genre
Jan 3 2016,positive,they say that the second film of a trilogy is typically the best and the two towers is no exception     slowly taking on a darker tone as the enemy advances this sequel raises the stakes and then pays off with the message of hope and coming together to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds     and thats nothing to say about andy serkiss groundbreaking portrayal of the complicated and troubled gollum the journey with frodo sam and the creepy beast could have easily been the lowest and most boring point of the film but jackson instead gives us a muchneeded yet equallycaptivating conflict     with all the promise of the fellowship of the ring hopes were high for part 2 of the lord of the rings epoch but just like helms deep the two towers overcame all odds and exceeded expectations
Jan 2 2016,positive,hello 2016 while im still trying to wash the shit that is the force awakens out of my system what better way to do so than to continue watching one of my favorite trilogies the two towers manages to find the perfect balance between action storytelling and character development so much so that even the films three hour run time doesnt drag on like youd think it would the final act of the film is so incredible that it has caused me to invent a new word climaxgasm a climaxgasm is when the climax of a movie is so great and aweinspiring that it is akin to that of a mindblowing orgasm im talking about a toe curling ballsemptying rocketblastofcum orgasm its also incredible how well the special effects have aged from a movie thats over 12 years old the perfect risingaction to the eventual end of the story oh and an additional thumbsup for the wilhelm scream i fucking love that scream
Dec 31 2015,positive,i love this movie    originally written december 12 2002  the sequel to the golden globenominated and afi awardwinning the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring the two towers follows the continuing quest of frodo elijah wood and the fellowship to destroy the one ring frodo and sam sean astin discover they are being followed by the mysterious gollum andy serkis aragorn viggo mortensen the elf archer legolas orlando bloom and gimli the dwarf john rhysdavies encounter the besieged rohan kingdom whose once great king theoden bernard hill has fallen under sarumans christopher lee deadly spell meanwhile a mysterious new wizard makes an unexpected appearance    oh wow how i love this movie all of the characters i loved reading about in tolkiens classic novels are brought to life on the big screen in this incredible new chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy from the cinematography to the costumes to the spot on performances of the actors this movie rocks i have been waiting for more than twenty years for someone to make a faithful adaptation of this story peter jackson you have made the little boy still inside of me thrill with these movies walking and talking ents holy cow five stars
Dec 29 2015,negative,this one is long and drawn out it feels like a lot of nothing happened while the battle of helms deep was impressive and the production values are outstanding throughout it went on too long the progression of the one ring wasnt significant enough and took a back seat to the actions of ancillary characters cut it down to an hour and give a 12 to the beginning and end of fellowship and return
Dec 27 2015,positive,lord of the rings improves on the first instalment o the trilogy with deeper character development action and story
Dec 24 2015,positive,excellent action and scenery as the story continues
Dec 22 2015,positive,it has great action scenes intense moments and tiny bits of comedy the best fantasy movie yet
Dec 13 2015,positive,the movie does a great job on building up everything for the last chapter
Nov 30 2015,positive,the best in the lord of the rings trilogy the screenplay and pacing is fantastic the acting is phenomenal and the movie leaves you craving the next installment
Nov 13 2015,positive,to me by far the strongest movie of the trilogy it had a lot of story the awesome battle at the hornburg saw the introduction of gollum and gave us a satisfying ending and made us want to see what was to come
Oct 22 2015,positive,thisalong with the rest of the trilogyare my favorite movies ever made
Oct 10 2015,positive,peter jackson continues the trilogy with an amazing sequel
Oct 6 2015,positive,it was always to be a challenge for peter jackson to maintain the exquisite tempo set in the first film but he manages it with ease the two towers combines thrilling action set pieces such as the battle for helms deep with brilliant storytelling maintaining pace though uncountable yet memorable subplots this film about a journey across middle earth is truly a three and a half hour long journey in its own right
Sep 26 2015,positive,an interesting adaptation of a classic fantasy story has excellent use of action and uses practical and organic special effects along with excellent location settings these films also has one of the best casts where each actoractress are perfect for their role
Sep 21 2015,positive,the middle installment of a trilogy is often the darkest and the two towers is no exception unlike other modern drivel the film has a happy ending without devolving into the cheesy depths of feel good or descending into postmodern despair and hopelessness the characters are rich and their suffering is real  especially to america a country that had recently lost the twin towers to demonic terrorists wholly unintentional the timing of this movie its title content sorrow and hope resonated with a country reeling from tragedy
Sep 14 2015,positive,long movie but worth it
Sep 5 2015,positive,the second film of peter jacksons epic trilogy shines as great as its predecessor more scale is added by the incredible sequence of the battle of helms deep between men and elves and the ruthless urukhai while the entire cast is astounding two cast members stand out above the rest first sean astin shines again as frodos loyal companion sam his great monologue by the end of the film is amazingly shown and spoken to the audience in a way that you normally dont see in films nowadays the second cast member is the incredibly astounding motion capture performance of andy serkis as the fallen hobbit turned monster gollum aka sméagol through andys acting we see his inner struggle between lusting and resisting his precious the one ring along with helping or killing frodo and sam all in all this sequel is as incredibly beautiful as the first film
Aug 24 2015,positive,theyre taking the hobbits to isengard
Aug 22 2015,positive,a great film but couldve explained a bit more people say harry potter is a ripoff and crap but harry potter is much better in my opinion
Aug 21 2015,positive,best movie of the trilogy
Aug 15 2015,positive,the lord of the awesome the too awesome
Aug 13 2015,positive,the second part of the trilogy with intense battle scenes great continuing story and introduction to new characters
Aug 13 2015,positive,i try not to view the two towers as a sequel but rather as one third of a much grander movie in that this is a film that stands just as tall as its predecessor
Aug 12 2015,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers may have epic battle sequences but it doesnt neglect the emotional side that is needed making this an brilliant film that should be viewed by all
Aug 8 2015,negative,if youre a fan of roller coaster action cgi and over the top storytelling youll love this movie if you dont care about plot story or character development youll like it even more even you are in any way a fan of the original tolkein novels this movie is unwatchable
Jul 30 2015,neutral,sort of like the extended edition of the fellowship of the rings the two towers feels unnecessarily long by having useless merry  pippen scenes but the battle for helms deep makes up for that
Jul 28 2015,negative,how is this story not fucking over yet
Jul 26 2015,positive,quite significantly better than the first film with the fellowship separated war has begun but frodo and sam are still alive and are that much closer to mount doom to destroy the one ring there are many good reasons one why this film was considered bigger and better the battles were larger it was practically one the main climaxes of the series and the story is more in depth once again the overall film was well crafted and well directed much like its previous the humor was also exceptionally better as well let us not forget the ents also they were also a good addition to this one as they attacked one of the most main areas in the film one of the two towers known as isengard the story continues
Jul 24 2015,positive,all three films really get the same review as acting goes but the two towers eh i didnt like it as much as fellowship or return of the king
Jul 24 2015,positive,this movie was really good gollum was funny in it and i liked how they introduced rohan
Jul 22 2015,positive,this movie was great middle part in trilogy it had amazing action amazing visuals amazing cinematography it was just awesome but there was a lot of draggy parts in the movie but  those draggy parts where necessary to build characters and events that happen later in a film so thats ok  andy serkis deserved an oscar for his iconic performance as gollum he was best part of the movie he stole scene after scene the battle in the end was one of the greatest battles in cinema history
Jul 21 2015,positive,some may find the story boring but this is the middle story that still gives off intrigue just like the first
Jul 19 2015,positive,perhaps the finest middle chapter in all of cinema excellent storytelling and remarkable set pieces with emotional weight and thunderous action its hard to deny the pure craftsmanship of the whole affair
Jul 15 2015,positive,the sequel of this trilogy is lives up to more thrills than the first one
Jul 11 2015,positive,always tough to be the one in the middle and this movie suffers a little from knowing that it is indeed the middle of the trilogy however arguably this is the most gripping of the trilogy still  like the other movies  a little long winded at times
Jul 2 2015,positive,my favorite of the lord of the rings trilogy this movie has an amazing story with characters you care about the battle scenes and visuals are also stellar
Jun 29 2015,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers 2002 c179m  12 d peter jackson elijah wood sean astin ian mckellen orlando bloom viggo mortensen ian holm cate blanchett christopher lee andy serkis as the battle for middle earth wages on frodo wood and sam astin continue their perilous trek to mordor to destroy the ring but encounter one crafty little problemgollum riveting second filming of jrr tolkiens novel series leaves viewer dying to see the finale installment and once more jacksons treatment and emotional ambition for the material is just incredible and the visual effects are a collective knockout sound editing and visual effects won oscars extended 223m version also exists followed by the lord of the rings the return of the king
Jun 21 2015,positive,the two towers continues the threepart the lord of the rings with excellentasexpected scope and writing even if it still contains some deviations from the original book amazing performances with viggo mortensen sean astin christopher lee and andy serkis as gollum standing out and helped by the new additions to the cast and big amounts of entertainment in the form of outstanding character development emotional moments breathtaking special effects and epicscale battles
Jun 20 2015,positive,even better with the extended footage
Jun 16 2015,positive,the storys not as good but still above average and the fight scene goes on far to longis there anything in filming harder than filming a war fight scenehere they do it ok
Jun 14 2015,positive,not as good as the fellowship but a great flick none the less
Jun 14 2015,positive,this is one of the best lord of the rings
Jun 12 2015,positive,slightly better than the original but still its very boring
Jun 11 2015,positive,awesome sequel that does not disappoint my least favorite of the three but still an awesome movie the special effects were great and everything about it was great i thought the action was awesome and the story was phenomenal the movie literally picks up right where the fellowship of the ring left off with amazing performances and awesome action sequences this is a very fun and exciting lord of the rings adventure
Jun 11 2015,positive,you couldnt find a better blockbuster film than this not really an oscar threat imo and it wasnt when it happened but this has everything you need to stay enthralled
Jun 3 2015,positive,from frodo baggins and samwise gamgee continue their journey to mordor as thier journey ends they end up being held by faramir of gondor in rohan aragorn legolas and gimli pursue the urukhai who have taken merry and pippin prisoner ended up in the land of helms deep together with king theoden and his people merry and pippin flee into fangorn forest and meet treebeard the oldest of the ents im not a wtf nerd in these kind of fantasy books but after i watched the whole film it looks like i need to take a note as from what i saw it is the most epic fantasy film ive seen for a very long long time the gothic art of a visually embodied film is just breathtaking to watch every single scene has its own color the gorgeous locations are stunning camera shooting of every angles is just brilliant why i wouldnt care about the pacing because it is that good the execution is very well made that you dont mind whats going to happen your so into story and hungry for its plot the extended edition is a must watch for fans thus this serve as the whole cover up of the book the musical score is outstanding and give me that chilling feeling especially the elvish scene andi serkis portrayal of smeagol is priceless elijah wood viggo john rhysdavies ian mckellen and orlando bloom these people right there give the most of their performance to think this is a well budgeted film and became one of the most top grossing films of all time an epic proportions that you would never forget with the most unforgettable battle scenes that you have seen for your whole life perfect 5 stars
May 31 2015,positive,epic episode 2  legolas finds out where the hobbits are being taken and sam and frodo continue their journey with andy serkis

May 19 2015,positive,excellent i love how peter jackson was able to smoothly transition perspective from aragorn legolas and gimli to frodo and sam the ents were perfect just like id always imagined then and the battle of helms deep is my favorite fictional battle of all time including the battle of hogwarts
May 14 2015,positive,while the two towers is a bit dull at points it still brings a great adventure with good acting and good plot development           the film has a good plot but the film just felt a bit boring at a lot of times i did enjoy the battle of helmsdeep and i also did enjoy the frodo and sam journey gollum also brought great entertainment to the film           i wish that the film was a bit shorter than it was but the film still is good at putting all things that need to be put in their in their           the lord of the rings the two towers is still a great film to watch it is well directed well acted and well put together it is still a fun film for you to watch when you are bored    grade 8410
May 9 2015,positive,i think enough can be said about lord of the rings the two towers that anyone else in the world has not said though some of the parts in the film are changed from the book material and some of the action does get a bit dull or boring two towers is action packed amazing filled with even more interesting characters like gollum emotional filled with more interesting lore and knows when to balance out its action and storytelling in away that sets the hype for the final film
Apr 27 2015,positive,loved it its the story development part of the trilogy but its a classic
Apr 26 2015,positive,gollum and slow scenes with ents  a certified fresh rating of 96     a sequel that improves upon the original by special effects and action but it slows down in some parts
Apr 26 2015,positive,very long really cool battle scene
Apr 22 2015,positive,one of my best movies
Apr 22 2015,negative,because its part two nothing is resolved and nothing happens that couldnt have been tacked on to the first and last films it has its moments i guess
Apr 20 2015,positive,not as good as the first one but still pretty good they did a good job on rohan but overall not as beautiful as the the first film the battle scene was fantastic both at helms deep and the last march of the ents golum was annoying
Apr 13 2015,positive,loved every second of this movie
Apr 7 2015,positive,extended edition  my preciousssss
Apr 3 2015,positive,the books are way better they changed too much for creating these movies   but for the actors the scenery shots the sound quality at least that was all amazing
Mar 28 2015,positive,the second chapter of the trilogy features two incredible achievements that have to be mentioned  the character of gollumsmeagol is so convincingly played by andy serkins that you forget youre watching a cgi character the other is the battle of helms deep one of the greatest high epic battles ever put to screen this movie features fantastic interplay between gimli and legolas and makes for a very good comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie in this movie sam and frodo are separated from the fellowship and are joined in their quest to destroy the ring in the fires of mount doom by gollum
Mar 11 2015,positive,the best of the trilogy everything hitsthe story the action the suspense
Feb 19 2015,positive,just as rotten tomatoes says spectacular action and emotional storytelling the two towers is so good its fake my third favorite of all time just below the other two rings movies
Feb 12 2015,positive,offers greater insight to the characters and world introduced previously but manages to pull off an extended battle sequence that in any other film would be timewasting
Feb 8 2015,positive,two towers comfortably welcomes new characters and easily manages to keep viewers intertwined with both action and emotion the result is a fun thrill ride full of action eye candy and emotional appeal
Feb 6 2015,positive,the best of the trilogy in my opinion the battle of helms deep is probably my favorite large scale battle sequence ever
Feb 3 2015,positive,starts of where the first movie ended obviously but is also at the same level it features my favorite scene from the whole trilogy gandalfs charge on helms deep is so epic it hurts and will probably give you an orgasm probably
Feb 2 2015,positive,rating 86 out of 10
Jan 31 2015,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is the ultimate adventure of our time
Jan 30 2015,positive,the two towers is a better sequel with more fleshed out and memorable characters and amazing story
Jan 30 2015,positive,peter jackson left the entire world on a cliffhanger when he finished the fellowship of the ring after having done such an impressive job with the first film and then having the balls to stay true to the source by finishing as he did he was almost setting himself up to fail giving himself a task even greater than the original undertaking a sequel not just any sequel a sequel to film being touted as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made and himself being declared a genius this sort of hype is almost impossible to live up to almost     taking up where its predecessor left off the two towers follows aragorn gimli and legolas as they chase down a troop of urukhai frodo and sam as they journey further towards mordor and merry and pippin as they well get into lots of trouble     the story is much more divided in comparison to the first of the series with a fellowship of nine journeying together rather than three different groups and their various shenanigans this is the first challenge to overcome for filmmaker peter jackson how to tell all these stories in under four hours not only that but how to allot time to the different storylines without 1 making it boring and 2 losing focus on the main story which just happens to be the more boring aspect of the source material frodo and sams trek towards mordor after all how inventive can one director be with half the story taking up by two diminutive figures walking towards a place which they dont actually reach by the time the films finishes     its almost as if jackson hasnt noticed these issues as the second film is just as fulfilling and storydriven as the first without sacrificing any major plot points or basically getting rid of anything that would cause a fan outcry yes technically the ents do show up to help at the battle of helms deep and no we dont get to see merry and pippin in treebeards house or talking to quickbeam but in the end peter jackson has conquered these seemingly mammoth tasks with ease this is a reflection on jacksons instinct for pace as the extended edition shows that these timeconsuming though unnecessary scenes were in fact filmed but were left on the editting floor jacksons fearlessness with the source material yet mindfullness of it as well means that the story is left completely intact enough to appease any fan jackson has also made room for the lighter moments as well revelling in the joy of discovery when merry and pippin first encounter treebeard and having time for jokes between the doubleact which just keeps getting better of legolas and gimli jackson doesnt forget about his characters either keeping the film from feeling hollow by introducing the beautiful miranda otto as nevertobe love interest eowyn and the abandonedbyhiscountry eomer as well as extending his existing characters in merry and pippin who only get more endearing frodo and sam whose seemingly unflappable relationship is beginning to show some strain and even though gandalfs character goes under a major revamp hes still the same enigmatic mentor as before albeit slightly more badass its this attention to detail which makes peter jacksons work so watchable all the way through the crazy runtime     shores score is as strong as ever this time bringing the beautiful theme of the world of men to the fore shores understanding of motif and mood is pivotal here even more so than fellowship as the story isnt as driving as its predecessor because of this shores score is able to ferry us through the slower moments and throughout the entire film     the performances here are just as textured as they were in the first film not only that but the sequel factor means that actors are able to loosen up a little more in particular in the case of orlando blooms legolas and john rhysdavies gimli the two of them have more fun than it should be possible to have in an epic of this size and they pull it off without ever feeling camp or not taking it seriously enough ian mckellens gandalf is still the standout of the series but its great to see the rest of the cast becoming more and more involved in their characters viggo mortensens aragorn is one of the performances which shows a lot of progression his presence has more gravitas in this one and his character is more layered than the original more difficult to read elijah wood has much less to do in this film leaving him to keep mostly the same expression on his face for most of the film while this may be true to story it does occassionally make you wish that he had something else to do than walk around some rocks for a while sean astins sam is similarly beleagured and while their parts of the film are integral to the story you sometimes wish that wed move back to the interesting parts a little sooner bernard hill makes a great addition to the cast as theoden as well as his onscreen daughter eowyn played with fragile strength by miranda otto brad dourifs grima wormtongue is fantastic a slimy manipulative groveller who snivells perfectly through every scene hes in     another of towers achievements lies in another of its new characters gollum gollum is a completely cg creation performed by andy serkis with groundbreaking technology enabling serkis to interact with the actual actors and thus makes the performances all the more real this innovation makes for incredible viewing as one of the more unfilmmable sections of tolkiens work is brought to life onscreen serkis performance is largely discounted in terms of acting accolades but its incredible to see his work here set the benchmark for motion capture     but all these technical factors fade into the background at the battle of helms deep a battle scene so epic that it drowns out everything that comes before it ten thousand urukhai facing off against rohans much depleted forces is so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to spot any kind of flaws in the rest of the film jackson seamlessly blend cg with fantastic costume and makeup to create an entirely believeable all out war which lives up to the scenes detailed in the book and revells in the little moments like legolas riding a shield down some stairs or a rousing speech from king to king jacksons sense of pace throughout the battle is fantastic moving from the entmoot to sam and frodo without ever losing momentum and the coupdegrace of gandalfs arrival is as breathtaking a moment as the series brings in any of its three films     while this may be the weaker cinematically of the three films the fact that im still giving it five stars shows you just how high the bar is set for this series the fact is that despite lacking the grandeur of the third and the sense of wonder and scariness of the first its still a better film than 90 of the blockbusters hollywood vomits up on regular basis truly incredible filmmaking     defining scene   the battle at helms deep of course
Jan 25 2015,positive,the movie was amazing gimli added some comic relief to the movie in which i thought was awesome
Jan 25 2015,positive,more epicness from peter jackson
Jan 23 2015,positive,a thrilling meaty second chapter it sets the bar to what fantasy can be

Jan 19 2015,positive,the second instalment of peter jackson epic middle trilogy even better than the first which i thought was impossible with a musical score to match the first and great performances from all the incredible cast members the lord of the rings the two towers will have you craving the final instalment yes the movie is 4 hours long but its not boring that shows the talent of pj and the extent of the brilliance of this film you have to go and see this film of you loved the first one or are looking for an amazing 4 hour long journey of orcs and hobbit and all things magical
Jan 18 2015,positive,four words battle of helms deep
Jan 18 2015,positive,just as good as fellowship with increased scale and spectacular battle sequences
Jan 11 2015,positive,my full opinion 9010
Jan 6 2015,positive,review in a nutshell    the lord of the rings the two towers is the middle chapter of the epic trilogy by peter jackson based off the novel by jrr tolkien after being impressed and swooped away by the beginning chapter i had high expectations of this film i had seen the film before but i have forgotten my feelings towards it ergo i was practically coming into the film blind    the film started off strong continuing on the story that was left by the end of the first film where mary and pippin have been taken by the raiding orcs frodo and sam have divided from the fellowship and attempt to enter mordor on their own and the remaining of the fellowship have embarked on a quest to retrieve back the abducted hobbits fuelled by the hype left by the previous film i was optimistic and content with the first 3040 minutes of the film continuing their intended journey but then new story elements begin to appear sidetracking these characters and piling up new and sudden threats it was like a long distraction or bypass that would ultimately land on the same goal as intended    the film also changes its pacing from the previous film where now it is displayed in a crosscutting method in narrating the three stories it severely slowed down the film with one story beginning to take flight only to be diverted to another that is still lingering on the ground due to the film becoming more and more larger in scope character development have become less and less present the first film was such a terrific film because there was emotional connection with the characters and supported with internal friction and threats that are layered with depth elevating the films overall story jackson dwells so much with the key members that reside in rohan and gondor largely speaking about the threat of extinction for men and the greed for power it wouldnt have been too much of a chore to go through if they were established better and were forced to show empathy for their cause    thankfully the visual aspects of the film are still stronger than ever blending practical and special effects to create middleearth and its inhabitants supported with glorious battles that are large in scope demonstrating the pure epicness of its story the battle scene in rohan during the last 40 minutes was fantastic showcasing the characters fighting abilities at their most peak also displaying a sense of balance of seriousness and comedy between legolas and gimli counting the orc bodies they have slain that is what i think was purely missing during the bulk of this film humour it is understandable that this chapter is much darker obviously pointed out by its grey and steely blues in its photographic imagery this lack of humour does make a large impact on the films pacing and it does make it more difficult to keep ones attention during the quieter moments of the film which is plentiful in this film    the score in this film is great hearing the classic tunes crafted by howard shore at times evoking a sense of chill and excitement within me it elevates the films tension and scope through the loud brass instruments and hard hitting strings and during moments that are much tender and emotional which is severely few here the music hits with full effect without feeling a drastic sense of shift between the two opposing tones    the acting performance in this film is as great as it was found in the first film showing full commitment to their roles but never to the point where it becomes overwhelming and stripped of that sense of fun they completely understand that they are playing makebelieve and jackson completely understands this when directs his cast    the lord of the rings the two towers has fallen short of my expectations telling multiple stories that are paced together in such a way that it comes off as emotionally convoluted i am sure everything jackson had to do here plays an important role to the final instalment but as a standalone film it isnt a glorious one i hope the next film would capture the excitement and wonder that i had during the first film
Jan 3 2015,positive,pretty much a perfect film
Jan 2 2015,positive,this in my opinion is the best of the three grimmer yet constantly reminding us of the glimmer of hope that remains
Jan 2 2015,positive,the second of the epic trilogy ups the emotional aspect through a wider storytelling scope that doesnt only further explore the expansive world of middleearth but fleshing out the constructive details surrounding character developments simpy said the two towers is a beautiful tale of courage that builds up the anticipation towards the last chapter of tolkiens legendary literary legacy in both emotional yet epic manner
Dec 31 2014,positive,this is a great sequel to the epic fantasy dont get me wrong but this is certainly the weakest of the three though it had heart and all the first lord of the rings did it dragged on at a few parts and was not as well passed in my eyes  the movie non of the less is a great installment into this franchise 
Dec 29 2014,positive,i like the 2nd one the most out of three because of different elements in the films and how they fight each other great action scenes
Dec 27 2014,positive,the best in the series
Dec 24 2014,positive,better than the first but not the third great story and unique in its own ways very good acting etc
Dec 24 2014,positive,absolutely amazing  breathtaking and triumphant
Dec 21 2014,positive,just as great as the first  as any good sequel does this movie ups the stakes with more thrilling action sequences even better special effects and suspense throughout the film
Dec 21 2014,positive,jackson delivers again with this astounding sequel that brings the great work from the first and times it higher fantastic acting emotional story and great visuals
Dec 20 2014,positive,my second most favorite movie of all time
Dec 20 2014,positive,excellent sequel with an organized script interesting and enthusiastic plot and with an excellent story that can attract a lot of fans
Dec 20 2014,positive,excellent sequel with an organized script interesting and enthusiastic plot and with an excellent story that can attract a lot of fans
Dec 15 2014,positive,oh gollum you are one crazy crackhead to be around the two towers is based off of the second lord of the rings novel which entails our main protagonists being separated and striving to complete their goals in saving middle earth while the dark forces begin to close in on them at all corners out of all of the films this is by far one of my top 5 for various reasons one of which being the plot of this story and that it brings everyone to a turning point in their lives to where they would have to make big changes for themselves in order to save the world that they live in     once again everything from the special effects to the score and even the characters are deadon perfect throughout this film one of the best characters in here is gollum who becomes absolutely obsessed with the one ring and will do anything he can to get it back all the while arguing with his other personality i also loved the cg work that andy serkis did to make him so lifelike that it would make you believe that gollum is a real person aragon had the second best plot in the story where he has to do whatever he can to make sure the whole country of his people do not get annihilated by ten thousand orcs that are barreling through the countryside the battle at helms deep was another great war scene in this movie as the humans and orcs fight the hell out of each other and made it look very brutal especially for pg13 standards which  almost felt like they were kind of pushing it but in a good way there are some moments in here that i felt where kind of pointless like liv tylers appearance in here which felt really wasted overall this movie is a nice little stepping stone which builds everything up to the finale of this trilogy which goes all out and that is why i give this four and a half out of five stars
Dec 14 2014,positive,a great film peter jackson has created another masterpiece loved everything about this film
Dec 13 2014,positive,it starts of slow but then picks up and it ends up fantasticat the same time previewing what the final movie is going to be overall great film
Dec 11 2014,positive,dealing with a fate defining war the second movie deals into darkness and gives us details of what occurred before sauron got defeatedand introduces us with major characters of the epic sagaa fantasy film that will entertain you to the marrow of your souland ofcourse a masterpiece in film making
Dec 10 2014,positive,the journey to destroy the one ring continues and it does it in tremendous fashion the two towers builds on the previous installment in every way the fellowship is broken and jackson has to tell the stories of multiple characters going back and forth on their journeys the visuals are even better this time and the story continues to pack a punch the two towers is a superior sequel and sets up the final entry marvelously
Dec 7 2014,positive,as the forces of sauron and saruman christopher lee plot to wipe out all humans in middleearth aragorn viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom gimli john rhysdavis and the newly revived gandalf the white ian mckellen must save the kingdom of rohan from the forces of isengard while at the same time frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin are forced to rely on the one rings previous bearer a small tormented creature named gollum andy serkis who hides dark secrets    despite having a less linear narrative than the first film with three plot lines revolving around frodo and sams journey  aragorns quest and the comic relief hobbits merry dominic moughaun and pippin billy boyd encountering treebeard also john rhysdavis and the treelike ents all of these plots although the latter one tends to drag a bit all succeed in futher developing the characters as frodo starts to grow closer to the ring merry starts taking responsibility and aragorn embracing his role as the future saviour of humankind  the population of the home of the horse lords rohan such as the reluctant king theoden bernard hill the slimy   grima wormtongue brad dourif and the shieldmaiden ewoyn miranda ottoman help to establish both the frail yet hopeful role that humanity can have while also giving the audience the chance to fully explore a human culture in a world populated by fantastical creatures    although the score is amazing and the setpieces such as the infamous battle of helms deep are stunning to look at the biggest achievement in terms of visual effects comes in the form of gollum being the first character in a liveaction film to filmed in the revolutionary preformance capture system andy serkiss physical and emotional performance captures both the good and evil sides of the tormented creature with the conversation sequence being one of the most intense psychological sequences put to film ever    overall despite the treebeard scenes sometimes dragging the film down the lord of the rings the two towers is still masterful filmmaking in terms of worldbuilding and character development and helped audiences get excited enough for the epic conclusion
Dec 6 2014,positive,a great sequel even better than the last with more action and background on characters i love the new characters all brought cool things to the table and the story continues
Dec 5 2014,positive,a great movie which suffers from some bad pacing
Nov 22 2014,positive,an dark action filled sequel that is slightly better than the first film 90100
Nov 21 2014,positive,a really unbelievable movie
Nov 12 2014,positive,gollum stole the show and the film shouldve won best picture but i kinda understand why it didnt one gripe i have however is having the character faramir nearly giving into the rings power after that making him take frodo sam and gollum to osgiliath which was not in the book as far as im concerned the writers should have kept them in ithilien as was written in the original story but still this is a timeless sequel
Nov 11 2014,positive,although not the longest lotr film it certainly feels like it but its flawed pacing doesnt detract from its epic battle sequences brilliant writing or its outstanding performances
Nov 6 2014,positive,for some odd reason i watched this incessantly as a small child i was endlessly fascinated with the battle of helms deep which to this day satisfies my soul at a profound level i think i just like watching all those arrows fly into the orcs
Oct 25 2014,positive,from frodo baggins and samwise gamgee continue their journey to mordor as thier journey ends they end up being held by faramir of gondor in rohan aragorn legolas and gimli pursue the urukhai who have taken merry and pippin prisoner ended up in the land of helms deep together with king theoden and his people merry and pippin flee into fangorn forest and meet treebeard the oldest of the ents im not a wtf nerd in these  kind of fantasy books but after i watched the whole film it looks like i need to take a note as from what i saw it is the most epic fantasy film ive seen for a very long long time the gothic art of a visually embodied film is just breathtaking to watch every single scene has its own color the gorgeous locations are stunning camera shooting of every angles is just brilliant why i wouldnt care about the pacing because it is that good the execution is very well made that you dont mind whats going to happen your so into story and hungry for its plot the extended edition is a must watch for fans thus this serve as the whole cover up of the book the musical score is outstanding and give me that chilling feeling especially the elvish scene andi serkis portrayal of smeagol is priceless elijah wood viggo john rhysdavies ian mckellen and orlando bloom these people right there give the most of their performance to think this is a well budgeted film and became one of the most top grossing films of all time an epic proportions that you would never forget with the most unforgettable battle scenes that you have seen for your whole life perfect 5 stars
Oct 2 2014,positive,the two towers is a minor stepdown from the franchise but is still a worthy and visual treat for all fans
Sep 30 2014,positive,this was also the best ive seen of the lord of the rings but the boring part was the talking trees
Sep 22 2014,positive,is my favorite and i liked it a lot
Sep 19 2014,positive,the second film in the trilogy brings the depth of the story as frodo and sam continue the journey to mount doom alone with only gollum as the guide love andy serkis performance as gollum as it adds to the epic climatic battle at helms deep and a wolves fight along the way still has every ounce of epic to build up for the finale return of the king
Sep 19 2014,positive,the second film in the trilogy brings the depth of the story as frodo and sam continue the journey to mount doom alone with only gollum as the guide love andy serkis performance as gollum as it adds to the epic climatic battle at helms deep and a wolves fight along the way still has every ounce of epic to build up for the finale return of the king
Sep 17 2014,positive,the middle chapter of a trilogy can sometimes be the one that drags  its not the fresh beginning and its not the epic end  but as with star wars the middle chapter of this trilogy is a masterpiece of cinema  the performances are both astounding and heart wrenching with bernard hill as the noble king theoden and ian mckellan as the ever wonderful gandalf as stand outs  the set pieces are wonderful and the special effects still stand up 13 years later  and the movie is all finished up with one of the greatest cinema battles ever put to film  watch it now and enjoy
Sep 14 2014,positive,part two of the lord of the rings trilogy the two towers continues the epic scope and immersive adventures from the first movie which happens rarely considering that its a continuation to a perfect film switching stories from 3 plot lines keeps it fresh and well paced which is something needed for a long movie like this 1010
Sep 10 2014,positive,dealing with a fate defining war the second movie deals into darkness and gives us details of what occurred before sauron got defeatedand introduces us with major characters of the epic sagaa fantasy film that will entertain you to the marrow of your souland ofcourse a masterpiece in film making

Sep 7 2014,positive,more engaging than the fellowship
Sep 7 2014,positive,the second act of this fantasy epic has some incredible moments but ultimately misses in regards to future character development and world explanation during its near three hour run time
Sep 4 2014,positive,continuing the classic the movie never lets up brilliant acting effects and story
Sep 3 2014,positive,much was lost in the transition from book to movie but the ee fills some of those holes in including the handling of faramir
Sep 2 2014,positive,as the story gets deeper and deeper you fall in love even more
Sep 2 2014,positive,94  the two towers introduces a new load of engaging characters to its already packed cast  and balances them flawlessly with a wellconstructed script that stands out on its own apart from the other films

Aug 11 2014,positive,bringing a darker tone and deeper meaning to the lotr trilogy the two towers brings forth a whole new set of characters that will become a part of the the lotr and will ultimately shape this trilogy into becoming the best of its kind the monsters now talk and the battle for middle earth has escalated into a massive obsession for those craving the imagination and special effects the lord of the rings has to offer this is the turn point in the trilogy and is arguably the best installment of the three blockbuster fantasies 5 stars

Jun 30 2014,positive,yet another amazing film thought theyd never be able to top the first one but i was so wrong
Jun 29 2014,positive,tolkien fought in wwi when he set out he was with a large number of writing friends when he returned only one of his friends was alive tolkien hated war but felt it a necessity to the book and i think peter jackson should have done some research and realized that tolkien would have extemely ashamed that a third of the film was of war besides that it was a good film

Jun 23 2014,positive,a little weaker than the first and third instalments however it is still magnificent and one of the best films of all time of course its weaker state is due to the fact that it got the middle portion of the story which usually conveys more storytelling and building up rather than memorable and epic sequences
Jun 21 2014,positive,manages to be better than the first one and has great casting
Jun 20 2014,positive,the two towers is overrated undoubtedly but it still maintains some good qualities as weve come to expect the movie has impressive visuals and the strong performances that we saw in the first one however thats the moies biggest problem weve seen it all before

May 12 2014,negative,after staying up late for over 3 hours to watch this mediocre movie i could only remember three things from the movie 1 it was slow boring and not entertaining except for the brief scenes of war between the characters 2 it was extremely loud confusing and was so annoying that i kept looking at the clock 3 it was vaguely visually impressive
May 12 2014,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
May 12 2014,positive,of the lotr trilogy this is probably the slowest but that doesnt compromise the movie at all and is still an awesome movie with a darker tone growing characters and the amazing battle of helms deep sequence
May 11 2014,positive,oh but you are alone who knows what you have spoken to the darkness alone in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink the walls of your bower closing in about you a hutch to trammel some wild thing in so fair yet so cold like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winters chill
May 10 2014,positive,absolutely fantastic
May 7 2014,positive,the lord of the rings is the best trilogy of alltime  the second one is my favoritelove the entstrees
May 5 2014,positive,ill just give the trilogy all fives you know why we have em on dvd and have watched them i dont know hos many times the phrase best ever is way over used today on social media but applies here accurately
May 3 2014,positive,awesomethe book is also very good
May 2 2014,positive,a great chapter perfect middle film that sets up the climax and of course gollum
Apr 29 2014,positive,even better than the first one the battle of helms deep is one of the best war action scenes ive ever seen the way that they went about filming the whole battle was just so so good it goes from feeling of defeat even before the battle begins because the too few number of men available to fight to i think we may have a chance its just astonishing to see the 10000 strong orc army marching toward helms deep and having the feeling of despair like how are they ever going to win this it keeps in suspense the whole time and keeps your attention like crazy we also have the ents going to avenge their fallen brother trees at the hand of saruman and not to forget about frodo and company going through the marshes of dead people and sams neverending suspicion of gollumsmeagols plans of leading them to their doom and steal the ring and i love how in fellowship it ended on a bad note with the fellowship being separated and all hope being lost and two towers ending on a good note with being victorious at the battle of helms deep and the destruction of isengard thanks to the ents and basically there was hope by the end of the movie overall this entry to the series is just so amazing epic and far surpasses the fellowship of the ring this and return of the king are tied for best in the lord of the ring trilogy
Apr 27 2014,positive,i remember when i was 3 sneaking downstairs into my living room one evening when my parents sat down to watch this and seeing the majority of the movie  undiscovered by my parents  until the battles at the end when i got scared began crying and was discovered damn    oh yeah the review uh it was cool duh
Apr 24 2014,positive,a knock out of the park entry into the trilogy at a long running time the movie has enough going on to keep the viewer interested golum is introduced here and the battle at helms deep represents one of the best battle scenes taken place on screen  themes of survival and determination are looked at here and the cast of characters are fun and interesting  the score is also epicits one that holds high in movie score history excellent set pieces  awesome film locations  and just an interesting story and cast of characters make this such an epic film
Apr 23 2014,positive,its a literate grand and spectacularly action packed fantasy epic full of sumptuous and awe inspiring visual effects but peter jackson knowing that special effects alone cannot make a good movie fills the picture with performers who lend humanity to their characters no matter whether they be an elf or a hobbit the end result is the godfather part ii of blockbuster cinema
Apr 22 2014,positive,one of the greatest movies of all time and my favorite of the entire trilogy because of the sickest battle of all time in this dvd
Apr 18 2014,positive,even better than the first excellent shooting ateam actors couldnt ask for more
Apr 18 2014,positive,frodo and the guidance of gollum       based on the second volume of jrr tolkiens novel trilogy is this 2002 epic fantasy adventure lord of the rings  the two towers from director peter jackson king kong brain dead the story goes on where the first part had ended as frodo and sam continue their quest to destroy the ring in the land of mordor visually stunning and with greatscale epic battles this film brings the work of tolkien to life and although the length is impressive there isnt a dull moment in it starring elijah wood the faculty ian mckellen xmen trilogy viggo mortensen a history of violece sean astin the goonies orlando bloom pirates of the caribbean  johnrhys davies indiana jones films christopher lee star wars prequels and andy serkins king kong as gollum beware of the precious     the fellowship of the ring has fallen wizard gandalf the grey mckellen has given his life in the battle against the balrog and human boromir was killed when the forces of darkness attacked  while strider aragorn mortensen dwarf gimli davies and elf legolas bloom are pursuing the urukhai orcs who have taken merry and pippin  halflings frodo baggins wood and his loyal friend sam astin continue their quest to destroy the one ring in the fires of mount doom on their journey they encounter the rings former owner the creature called gollum serkins after capturing him the two persuade the schizophrenic gollum to guide them to mordor     in the mean time wizard saruman the white lee who is in service of the dark lord sauron has send an army of urukhai and orcs to conquer the land of rohan where king théoden has been enchanted by an evil spell
Apr 16 2014,positive,fantastic movie lord of the rings series and toy story series are my favourite
Apr 14 2014,positive,the lord of the rings trilogy is quite possibly the greatest movie series ever created epic plot epic battle scenes just plain epic
Apr 14 2014,positive,another great installment to lotr
Apr 11 2014,positive,peter jackson once again over delivered on all fronts the storyline was enriched characters explored and yet the cinematography was just as stunning the battles were glorious intense spectacles to witness i was enthralled with the legendary tale unfolding onscreen
Apr 4 2014,positive,the empire strikes back of the series
Apr 2 2014,positive,although this is still excitingly brilliant i have to say that this is my least favorite part of the trilogy maybe because it shows too much orcs however the battle scenes at helms deep are wonderfully made
Mar 15 2014,positive,good movie and a good addition to a great trilogy
Mar 13 2014,positive,13 of my favourite series of all time 
Mar 11 2014,positive,great beautiful well acted and amazingly performed
Mar 10 2014,positive,the journey continues
Mar 8 2014,positive,it may be not my favourite in the trilogy but the thrill that i had when watching the second movie of the series is much more compelling than the excitement i had while watching the other two movies because of the final battle that can be witnessed on the third act of this film and that made the movie for me
Mar 8 2014,positive,i love this movie so much
Mar 8 2014,positive,still fresh the lord of the rings series second installment is almost as good as the first with slight imperfections that are easily overlooked overall the movie is still a great epic
Mar 4 2014,positive,one of the greatest movies of all time    grade a
Mar 3 2014,positive,the best and most tolkienlike of the three
Feb 28 2014,positive,an absolutely masterpiece
Feb 24 2014,positive,the two towers already brilliant cast benefits heavily from the additions of bernard hill and andy serkis visually stunning and emotionally powerful the two towers includes just the right amount of action to keep you begging for more
Feb 22 2014,positive,the two towers is just as good as the original if not better the reason i may consider it better is the inclusion of two great new characters first is treebeard an ent and protector of the forrest who befriends merry and pippin the other is gollum a character complex  frightening and yet hillarious at the same time i have no more to say that i havent said in my first review except youll really want to check this out
Feb 22 2014,positive,oh yey this is what im talking about 
Feb 22 2014,positive,more of the same still good
Feb 20 2014,positive,the lord of the rings movies are among the finest movies ever made period the two towers is no exception it is just as epic if not more than its predecessor the fellowship of the ring and has more complicated characters like gollum and faramir both of whom get introduced in this chapter of the saga    gollum is by far the show stealer andy serkis did a perfect job showing two sides of the same coin with gollum and smeagol the same character but totally different personalities gollum is the ring obsessed creature while smeagol cares for master the name he calls frodo baggins by the story could be interpreted as a reflection on how the one ring managed to change smeagol entirely from a normal breathing person to a deformed monster who only keeps on being preserved by the rings powers    i highly recommend the two towers for anyone who loves great fantasy movies or epic movies the film never falters with its pure sense of scale and awe these movies are wonderful slices of cinema that no fantasy filmgoer should miss
Feb 16 2014,positive,the two towers is slightly less wellrounded than the first one but i still give a lot of credit to jackson for putting forward a great piece of cinema for the middle chapter of a trilogy which is not an easy task the helms deep battle sequence is as expected truly epic and it is well supplemented by another set piece involving the ents when there are so many faces and people and races it is hard to appreciate the human cost and cost to other races of the entire tragedy the ring has wrought fortunately jackson didnt forget to humanize the characters involved up to the heroes driving the action and down to the petrified infants clumsily wielding swords  to survive the terrors of the night this is what kept me interested in the outcome and vested in the movie as a whole
Feb 15 2014,positive,93  it diverges from the source material a little more than the other films but this serves as more of a strength on the films part
Feb 10 2014,positive,my least favourite of the trilogy but still amazing one cant live without the other
Feb 5 2014,positive,i loved all three movies and consider these as the best movies of all times but this one is the most appealing because there was no start the movie carried on from the fellowship of the ring and it ended with one of the greatest film battles there is a true masterpiece
Feb 5 2014,positive,borderline pointless nothing significant happens but as with the other films it is well made etc
Jan 31 2014,positive,it is exciting watching the characters on their different journeys and it has strong action
Jan 26 2014,positive,the two towers shows improvements in storytelling effects character development and this makes for an overall better movie than its predecessor this makes people who watch it begging for the last chapter with extremely high hopes
Jan 25 2014,positive,just an awesome movie with good actionfighting scenes and excellent acting and amazing directing
Jan 25 2014,positive,great second movie love the battle of helms deep
Jan 23 2014,positive,has amazing visual effects follows the storyline however has had parts of the book changed and has made the film that much more enjoyable the book series is an amazing read however the film series is an amazing watch and i can not wait to watch the rest of the film series
Jan 21 2014,positive,awesome middle chapter of the trilogy
Jan 19 2014,positive,a great movie but worse than its predecessor
Jan 10 2014,positive,it may not be as grand as its predecessor but it still makes for an incredible sequel in the lotr series
Jan 9 2014,positive,the 25th highestgrossing film of all time the film also won numerous accolades and was nominated for six academy awards winning two for best sound editing and best visual effect like the former this movie still very excited and fun to watch still one of the best adventure movie all time all the meaning in this movie including on samwise gamgee sean astin lines all aspects and moral contained in those ending lines he said very beautiful and inspirational lines brought by this fantasy movie to our reality life two thumbs up
Jan 7 2014,positive,winy frodo is back but thankfully he is not the star of the show this time round the two towers is a masterpiece a cinema triumph the key to the epic trilogy the war has begun and the battle of helms deep is astounding the action sequences are unlike any other they are powerful this is what we have been building up for fellowship only set the tone and built the armies the two towers has an eiry tone of pure atmospheric genius you can feel the devastation created by saruman and sauron on a global scale men women and families at there mercy hope is all they have and its waring thin the trilogy picked up where it left up at a much quicker pace continuing to take the audience down the broken fellowships paths it comes together wonderfully and there is little to fault peter jackson has nailed it its a exciting and emotional journey as it takes centre stage you will never see a better final third of a movie ever
Jan 5 2014,positive,the middle chapter is perfect the right emotional depth exquisite pacing and a tremendous climactic battle scene leaving you eager for the next and final chapter of the trilogy
Jan 4 2014,positive,my favorite movie out of the trilogy
Jan 4 2014,positive,my least favorite of the trilogy but its still amazing
Jan 4 2014,positive,its a movie by peter jackson of course it was going to be awesome loved all 3 of them must see for anyone who hasnt seen it
Jan 3 2014,positive,generally speaking i dont like the lotr series  i acknowledge they look great but for me i hate them because i was continually let down throughout them  far too often in the lotr series i think the story builds up these great ideas or characters and them lets me down whenever something big is supposed to happen  for example the ring wraiths  great namegreat designgreat backstory and they do a good job of showing how afraid of them everyone was    ohlet me put it out there that i never read the books and i think any discussion of the books is irrelevant since im watching a movie and thats what ill judge it by back to the wraiths    i loved these guys and couldnt wait to seem them flex their muscle or bone  in the first movie a big wave in the river washed them away  in retrospect it wasnt even all that impressive  ill call that a flawed execution of the idea water will get rid of them  there was a scene where they came upon the hobbit in a derelict tower and i dont remember anything cool about i need to rewatch these films i agreeits just ive never been interested enough to spend that much time again  and finally at the end of the film during the big battle scene it looks like were going to get to see them do something really cool and what happens he gets killed before he ever does anything cool     gandalf  hah  i love the idea of the most powerful wizard and he certainly looks the part but aside from one scene where he was swinging his stick what giant magical things did he do  he made his staff into a giant flashlight  thats it i waited hours upon hours to see him make a big flahslight  huge let down   yes the balrog was cool and he has a great line in the scene but we dont get to really see what makes him so magical      ive got more but im sure no one will read this    i want to add that i am shocked by how much i absolutely love the 2 new hobbit movies hobbit and desolation of smaug  helli give those films 5 stars  love them and i can easily say that i think desolation of smaug is the best of all these films
Jan 3 2014,positive,with andy serkis stealing the show as gollum and consisting of relentless battle sequences the two towers absolutely lives up to its predecessor and it is a splendid addition in the trilogy
Jan 1 2014,positive,the outstanding visuals and character development make this series so special viewing all three films consecutively as an epic completes the experience it remains as one of the greatest stories brought to film
Dec 30 2013,positive,the only word that could be used to describe jacksons second installment in the lotr trilogy is perfection
Dec 30 2013,positive,this middle chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy offers emotional powerful storytelling great characters and spectacle its a sequel thats done with perfect execution
Dec 27 2013,positive,the two towers takes everything good from fellowship and expands the epic story in a fantastic way and is one of the best if not the best second chapter of any trilogy
Dec 27 2013,positive,most movie trilogies often bear the burden of midstory syndrome but not this one it is kind enough to conclude major story arcs opened up at the beginning while advancing the main plot of the protagonists with the characters established in fellowship the battle scenes become the high point in two towers painfully detailed and unforgiving the action in this movie does not go for flashiness except for the occasional kill count by legolas and gimli but instead goes for an allout bloodbath there are big additions to the cast and each one deliver highly recommended
Dec 27 2013,positive,awesome battle scenes
Dec 26 2013,positive,i liked the show but two things really turned me off  cgi rubberlike unrealistic animation  score pure boredom one of the worst scores i heard for a long time if youll hear it played in the radio you wouldt recognize the scene its been applied to you wouldnt event recognize the movie it belongs to perhaps you wouldnt even recognize it to be some kind of score at all just some few chord pads played
Dec 25 2013,positive,best of the series one of the few sequels that can stand alone as its own story with deeper character studies than the other two chapters
Dec 24 2013,positive,if you already saw how audience and critics praise this movie for being so perfect yeahhhhhh this opinion is not going to be too diferent i freaking love this movie and i think that this is the best movie of 2002 but surpisingly not the best of the trilogy for me i didnt investigated that much about which movie do general audience think is the best but most  of my fiends think that this is the best one is this the best one for me no but is this film fantastic and an instan classic hell yeah
Dec 23 2013,positive,the battle for helms deep is one of the most iconic scenes in the lord of the rings trilogy  the two towers delivers a tremendously epic sequel and really highlights the human element of fear desperation and hope through the characters of theoden and company
Dec 23 2013,positive,wow unbelievable movie the best of the best of the best it is better than transformers and better than the terminator movies which is totally crazy and tough to do crazy year 2002 i was surprised that such a good movie came out of such a fools year tough to do and if you watch this movie today its probably one of the best movies in the world and it has everything you could want and more even in 2013 its the best movie period maybe the best movie ever if this movie cant get a 1010 then a 1010 doesnt exist
Dec 21 2013,positive,exceptional score and beautiful visuals stunning
Dec 21 2013,positive,with deeper focus on the emotions the drama the action and the world of the franchise the two towers is the perfect fantasy film that none other could match
Dec 21 2013,positive,the best of the three films the two towers not only captures the beauty of middle earth but also the beauty of the world we live in the massiveness of the movie is felt by the large rolling frames of snowcapped mountains and wide open field the ending battle at helms deep is by far the best battle scene of the trilogy not to mention the introduction of the most offbeat and funny character in the movies gollem    a
Dec 19 2013,positive,this is a spectacular film    just as the fellowship of the ring the opening scene is just as cool and deep as it is stunning its also an exiting and very well made film and combined with awesome music from howard shore couldnt the film be better the action in this movie is incredible to watch and the story is spectacular there are nothing negative with this movie except the vague cgi but the reason why i didnt give this film a 10 is that i want more especially action    this is both a stunning massive and deep movie    the lord of the rings the two towers gets a 910
Dec 18 2013,positive,my favorite in the trilogy one of the 20 of sequels in the world that surpasses the original
Dec 16 2013,positive,i am currently rewatching all lotr movies in order to see the hobbits i forgot how beautifully crafted these movies are they are so amazing and all three of them put together is the best movie ever made all 3 combined have won 17 academy awards damn deserved
Dec 15 2013,positive,just as great as the first one you might be moved
Dec 15 2013,positive,a great sequel that was unfortunately bogged down by an interminable midsection with aragorn and arwen  add half a star for the extended cut
Dec 15 2013,positive,the second installment in the legendary lord of the rings series is amazing the story is powerful once again with great performances from elijah wood and sean astin andy serkis really shines as the creature gollum his mannerisms and movements make him one of the creepiest characters i have ever seen the action sequences are intense and fierce and the movie features emotion this movie is thrilling and i highly recommend it to anyone
Dec 14 2013,positive,although slow at points the second chapter in the rings trilogy is compelling and spectacular fantasy filmmaking at its best
Dec 14 2013,positive,a fantastic sequel to one of greatest trilogies of all time perhaps a bit better than fellowship of the ring
Dec 14 2013,positive,it doesnt quite reach the cinematic heights of its predecessor but it gets close and its definitely an improvement in the epic category the war scenes are entertaining expansive and are of great production value i love how jackson didnt just cgi the whole war on the screen once again the visuals arent just a gimmick they are used in a way the aids the story and adds to the experience the story feels very much like a continuation of the last movies story without feeling like a rehash frodo and sam are still on their journey but their companions have split off and out going on their own quests trying to find ways to aid frodo even when theyre not by his side its well paced well directed and has an interesting story that ties in to the first and third movies very well the one flaw in the movie is gollum i dont care how integral he is to the plot or dear he is to the fans hes just annoying   9 out of 10
Dec 14 2013,positive,i have returned to you now at the turn of the tide    the fellowship of the ring the first film in peter jacksons lord of the rings was an impressive and revolutionary fantasy epic still regarded as one of the best fantasy epics ever its sequel the two towers takes what made the first epic adds more depth and creates a stellar sequel that outdoes fellowship in every aspect    when fellowship left off one member is killed by urukai and the fellowship has split frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin continue their mission to mordor to destroy the one ring before its master sauron regains full power they come across gollum andy serkis who previously was corrupted by the ring and knows the way to mordor frodo gains his trust but sam is suspicious that gollum might betray them elsewhere merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd escape from the urukai that captured them and end up with the treeent treebeard who leads the ultimate council deciding if the ents will go to war and last aragorn viggo mortenson legolas orlando bloom  gimli john rhysdavies and the resurrected gandalf the white ian mckellen prepares the land of rohan for battle against sarumans christopher lee forces who intends to wipe out the world of men in saurons fight for domination    the two towers also features liv tyler as arwen hugo weaving as elrond cate blanchett as galadriel benny hill as king théoden of rohan karl urban as the kins nephew eomer miranda otto as lady eowyn brad dourif as sarumans servant wormtongue and david wenham as boromirs brother faramir    if fellowship was the beginning of the fight for freedom in middleearth the two towers is the development of the ultimate battle theres quite a bit of subplots in the preparations for war such as the ents and rohan while some might be annoyed at these subplots i believed these subplots helped add a sense of development in preparing against sarumans army i also applaud jackson for how he handled the transitions between stories from frodos journey to aragorns for those whove read this book you know the first part is aragorncentered and the second is frodocentered which causes the book to not tell it in chronological order jackson fixed this and told these characters journeys in a better order that doesnt feel clunky    as with fellowship the cinematography remains stunning with new zealand still looking beautiful as always and behold weta workshops visuals are simply outstanding and are a stepup from the alreadyimpressive marks left in fellowship we get to see more gollum in this one and the motioncapture created here is stellar you actually believe that gollum is a real creature cause hes done so well and no one can pull off the personality of this complex character as great as motion capture king andy serkis whos extremely unforgettable in this role plus jackson continues to combine cgi with practical effects in the best way possible creating an unforgettable experience that well never forget it also features likely the most incredible battle sequence ever put in modern film the battle of helms deep there will never be as epic a battle sequence today as this scene jackson clearly had influences from the star wars trilogy when creating this scene cause its filled with epic action and moments that lucas could have filmed    the casting is once again excellent elijah wood is once again brilliant as frodo and sean astin is great again as sam serkis is as i said earlier stellar as the creature gollum and brilliantly creates gollums complex splitpersonality dominic monaghan and billy boyd are fun again as merry and pippin other noteworthy performances include orlando bloom as legolas who gets to slide down stairs with a shield during the helms deep battle really awesome ian mckellen as gandalf christopher lee as saruman and viggo mortenson giving his all as aragorn john rhysdavies is funny again as gimli he also voices the tree treebeard and is fun in that role as well the animatrolic designs for the trees are welldone i also enjoyed benny hill as king théoden and karl urban before his scenestealing role as dr bones in the abrams star trek films as eomer     howard shore returns to provide the score and its fantastic great themes from fellowship return plus new themes are introduced the most stunning being from rohan an emotional violinheavy theme thats really strong shore knows what hes doing here and the score does not disappoint    people might disagree here but i found the two towers to be an improvement over fellowship peter jackson brilliantly took what made fellowship great added more depth in emotional storytelling and more character development and creates a worthy middle chapter thats incredibly awesome leaving us all excited for what happens next in the final chapter as gandalf says the battle of helm deep is over the battle for middleearth is about to begin
Dec 12 2013,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is a 2002 epic high fantasy adventure film directed by peter jackson   this second in the trilogy doesnt quite match the first with a weaker plot and some slower scenes but it builds the drama nicely for the final chapter the highest grossing film of 2002 my favourite film of 2002   aan ggnd  afi 1001
Dec 10 2013,positive,my favourite of the three
Dec 10 2013,neutral,darker and more complex than its predecessor it rarely outdoes the first
Dec 9 2013,positive,just like the first one it is brilliant thrilling with less humor with a great storytelling fantastic action sequences and amazing dramatic scenes and great special effects this movie sets up perfectly to the final chapter
Dec 7 2013,positive,the two towers raises the bar even higher and exceeds expectations
Dec 6 2013,positive,great what a wonderful movie its plot could have been faster but with all these thrilling action movies its easily overlooked it keeps you excited and intrestes the whole time new zeland was the perfect spot for the filming this with its stunning landscapes and beauty the second installment in the lord of the rings trilogy will leave you yearning for more
Nov 29 2013,positive,incredibly entertaining
Nov 27 2013,positive,the epic continuation to the lord of the rings the two towers is full of action an adventure though a bit slower paced than its predecessor two towers is still an incredible journey and fantastic to watch
Nov 25 2013,positive,the two towers is my favorite of the series featuring so many new and important characters epic battle sequences and the return of a familiar face jackson has cemented this film in my favorites list
Nov 24 2013,positive,fantastic 9310 a ill probably buy this      thoughtful performances beautiful cinematography excellent production design marvelous editing incredible direction extroadinary writing and fantastic editing make this nonstop interesting and entertaining sequal that is exciting and intriguing  not only worthy to the original but even slightly better
Nov 24 2013,positive,even better than the first
Nov 19 2013,positive,peter jacksons second installment into the lord of the rings trilogy the two towers is overall the best of the three films once the fellowship of the ring disbands the different groups head out separate from one another none of them realizing the immense gravity there action will have and the importance of there journeys if possible the acting direction and design all improved upon the first film with howard shores magnificent score elevating the grandeur and scope of middle earth to even greater levels aside from the dark knight rarely does the middle film in a trilogy carry such profound meaning and overarching plot though the two towers beginning and ending are inherently flawed because of the epic nature of the trilogy jackson does an incredible job of choosing when and how to begin and end this film making for a potent storyline bottom line everyone needs to see this trilogy and i dont just mean the films everyone needs to see the extended blueray versions with multipledisc special features watch all of them you wont regret it oh and make sure you watch them in order
Nov 16 2013,positive,quite a sequelloved itnow this is how you continue a saga
Nov 15 2013,positive,its slower than the first which i couldnt help but compare it to
Nov 15 2013,positive,the two towers succeeds at raising the stakes of the first film and remaining a strong sequel the characters have gone their separate ways all with interesting stories the acting is top notch yet again the music once again is stunning as are the visual effects this sequel is darker and extremely entertaining the battle scenes such as the battle of helms deep are jaw dropping theyre frightening and expertly staged we are introduced to some memorable new characters and locations to the series the film is emotionally satisfying and combines it with an engaging story and even a few laughs its also beautifully shot overall i think the fellowship is slightly better but this movie is brilliant in every sense of the word it is a fantastic sequel that matches the quality of the first film and succeeds on its own as phenomenal story telling
Nov 14 2013,positive,much in the style of empire strikes back this film rivals and quite often exceeds its predecessor which is astounding to say the least
Nov 14 2013,positive,though its not as good as the other 2 movies and sometimes pulls the brakes the rest of the two towers is awesome in almost all levels
Nov 14 2013,positive,loved the special effects
Nov 13 2013,positive,this movie is truly the best movie of all time
Nov 8 2013,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers takes the storytelling visuals and characters from the first movie and adds more what more can i say that hasnt been said before
Nov 8 2013,positive,the two towers is awesome i could end it here but let me school you through why its awesome well to begin with it has gollum in it i swear to god one of the reasons why i watched the series was because i wanted to see gollum and he didnt disapoint gollum might seriously be on the run for best character ever put to film right up there with hannibal lecter or jules winfield the story that gollum has is just so sad and mindblowing every time he does something evil in return of the king im like fuck you frodo but ill get there in a sec secondly i think this is the darkest film of the trilogy return of the king had its dark moments but i think this one is on a whole different level i love dark stuff and in this movie it works then we have the technical stuff eg the visuals directing and here i think lord of the rings as a trilogy it just changed the way this stuff was handled its that good and in the two towers its more visible than in any other film they toned down those horrible closeup shots thank god for that and with those swooping shots that get more time to shine cuz of helms deep the camera work is out of this world i will not go gush over about elms deep cuz everyone already has so ill keep it short and sweet its the best battle ever put to film and on top of that im one of the 2 people who actually really likes the tree beard story or at least the character i still think merry and pippin are way to annoying in this one i think that treebeard can provide some cool comic relief damn john rhysdavis cant get enough of it in these movies and finally i especially like the whole gollum frodo and sam story gollums take was especially interesting since i think andy serkis and im calling it right now the biggest oscar snub of all time really captured the tragedy of the all thing frodo is getting weaker and weaker and elijah wood really captures this well specially when out of nowhere he has those rage attacks it really shows how the ring affects him this also gives sam more time to be awesome as by the third movie frodo is so weak that sam is probably the coolest character of that one so with me gushing over this film you would think this is one of my all time favs and are probably scratching your heads as to why is this getting 45 well there are some problems and one of them is probably my biggest complaint with this series the storytelling dont get me wrong the story is awesome its the way they tell it i hate in the first movie it was very focused you followed the fellowship in this movie since the fellowship broke they splitted the story into 3 first you have frodo gollum and sam you follow them for like 10 minutes then you cut to the rest of the fellowship and this takes up the most time cuz it has the most stuff going on then you still have to cut to merry and pippin being annoyng with treebeard the fellowship angle i especially dislike i just get sooo bored when they get to that stuff i almost fell asleep at one point i guess the main reason is that while the pay off is awesome at the end with elms deep the build up just goes on and on and on i saw the extended cut and i think that out of the 345 hours maybe 130 to 2 are spend with this part of the story it doesnt help when the frodosamgollum part is probably the coolest part of the entire series the rest are just minor problems with the exeption of one particular moment when frodo betrays gollum ill tell you why i hate this i hate this cuz througouth the movie you get the feeling that gollum was on his way to being a good guy again you can tell that gollum has found a beacon in frodo like a dog attahes itself to its owner fuck at one point gollums second personallity disapears and he becomes smeagol again but then when frodo betrays him its all over cuz smeagol realizes that gollum was right that his master could not be trusted and at that point i feel that smeagol fully becomes gollum cuz you know that througout the movie smeagol and gollum are in the same body but after that gollum is all thats left    overall this movie is awesome i think they got a notepad in which they wrote down all the complaints they got from the first movie but the way they told the story which probably was the only way they could tell this story and that fucking moment just weights it down a noch for me still easily top 20 of my favs
Nov 7 2013,positive,while the action and story are not quite as balanced as in the other installments of the trilogy you cant argue with the two towers scope and feeling of an epic
Nov 6 2013,positive,continuing right where the first left off the two towers brings the second chapter of jrr tolkiens trilogy to life in stunning fashion using more of what made the first great and adding more to deliver a one of a kind experience
Nov 5 2013,positive,plotsummary  set in a time of uncertainty in the land of middleearth a tale which charts a heroic quest which centers around an intrepid hobbit the future of civilization rests in the fate of the one ring which has been lost for centuries powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it but fate has placed it in the hands of a young hobbit named frodo baggins who inherits the ring and steps into legend a daunting task lies ahead for frodo when he becomes the ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the one ring in the fires of mount doom where it was forged but he cant accomplish this task alone a fellowship bands together to lend frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission the wisdom of gandalf the loyalty of his friends sam merry and pippin the courage of aragorn and boromir the precision of legolas and the strength of gimli they are aided in their quest by arwen galadriel and elrond whose knowledge of the ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey  my review  fans of director peter jacksons big screen adaptation of jrr tolkiens the fellowship of the ring have been eagerly anticipating the two towers  its actionintensive followup  for a year but even viewers in love with the first installment in this theatrical trilogy found it difficult not to ask a few very fair very basic questions chief among them can jackson do it again or will the whole shebang ultimately collapse under its own weight and excess like so many other films of this nature have in the past    they need worry no longer the two towers is an accomplishment equal to its predecessor but it succeeds in very different arenas where fellowship shocked viewers with its unrelenting focus on character development and dramatic truth such qualities are sidelined here in favor of propulsion and sheer grandeur with a twohour and fiftysomething minute running time ttt is remarkably well paced and is so texturally dense that several viewings may required just to take it all in those who felt the first film meandered a bit will find the two towers much more tightly focused and harddriving those who felt fellowships greatest triumph lay in its depth and characterization may find ttt a bit remote  more distancing and not as uninvolving    but such deficits are counterbalanced by the sheer audacity of the spectacle before us rarely if ever in the history of cinema have sequences of such magnitude been brought to the screen tensofthousands of soldiercreatures storm an imposing fortress called helms deep where human refugees are holding out in fight for survival and freedom  a fanciful riff on the legendary alamo armies of talking tree creatures tear into villain sarumans lair exacting primal revenge against those who have abused their brethren orcs ride herds of horsysized helldogs into battle against our heroes the list goes on  this thing is big    visual effects by weta are generally topnotch although observant viewers may catch a few pesky weaknesses suggesting the films vfx team may have simply just run out of time haloing around characters hairlines a little bit of green screen spill that makes for a sloppy composite runs rampant here animated objects such as the ents  the walking talking tree creatures mentioned above sometimes look inorganic with their surroundings and backgrounds the different layers of the effect are obvious and even basic compositing sometimes makes characters seem cut out or flat against a background of different texture or depth but for every shortcoming there is a triumph and despite the giddy vastness of the sequences mentioned above the greatest accomplishment of all is a guy named gollum          lr saruman christopher lee and wormtongue brad dourif mobilizing their army towards helms deep in the lord of the rings the two towers  interestingly enough gollum himself is imperfect his digital nature is often betrayed by his choppy squirrelly movements in long shots but when we see his face upclose his is instantly believable and thoroughly sympathetic and compelling taunted by a seemingly unceasing internalconflict he is constantly revealing his duality via a verbalized  and decidedly psychotic  inner monologue gollum gets more character development than anyone else in the two towers and quickly puts star wars writerdirector george lucas jar jar binks to shame looking like an ethiopian steve buscemi gollum may well be the first digital creature put onscreen who completely sells himself itself as a character and personality worthy of inclusion in a real world  theres not much to say about the returning cast  they are all prettymuch what they were established to be in the fellowship of the ring and rarely move beyond that newcomers include bernard hill captain of james camerons titanic as theoden ruler of a kingdom besieged by the forces of darkness genre freakazoid brad dourif as the duplicitous grima wormtongue miranda otto as eowyn who spends much of her time acting tough and pining for viggo mortensens aragorn david wenham as faramir brother of sean beans boromir who checkedout in the first film although wenham looks likeand pretty much acts likesean bean so im at a bit of a loss here and andy serkis as the liveaction motion template and voice of gollum both appeared briefly in fellowship but gollum is a fullfledged character here    viewers who find the the two towers spiritually unengaging can take heart in a recent interview with ign filmforce peter jackson reveals that the return of the king  the trilogys final installment  is his favorite film describing it as incredibly emotional despite the more cursory nature of ttt its beginning to look like oddball jackson may have accomplished the unimaginable and knocked one of historys most challenging literaturetofilm adaptations clean out of the park    no matter what one ultimate feels about the two towers one consideration shines brightly above the rest it will show you things youve never seen before and in this day and age thats not an accomplishment to be taken lightly
Nov 5 2013,positive,its a good movie not as good as the first but still good
Nov 2 2013,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers builds upon what made the first part great but this time making it a masterpiece of a film it is visually spectacular masterfully directed and ultimately a strong and solid middle chapter which is very very hard to accomplish
Nov 2 2013,positive,my least favorite of the lord of the rings films but this film is still one of my very favorites of all time the acting is superb the action sequences are really intense and the story is really great even if its at a bit of a slower pace than the other two films my only real problem is a couple of different ways they deterred from the book still an amazing film though
Oct 30 2013,positive,decent interpretation of tolkiens masterpiece jackson should have split the two towers into separate movies as jrr split it within the book
Oct 30 2013,positive,this chapter feels like the weaker piece of the whole trilogy but is still a classic  i think some of the pacing issues are normal since the movie serves as a bridge between the first introductory chapter to the epic finale
Oct 28 2013,positive,its exceptional continuing where the first left off and not looking back the lord of the rings set the benchmark for the modern fiction to film adaptation
Oct 9 2013,positive,awesome amazing fight scenes and interesting characters the story sucks you in and makes you want more
Oct 5 2013,positive,has all kinds of epic action that leaves viewers eager for the next movie
Oct 2 2013,positive,a good movie yet a little to long
Sep 30 2013,positive,being the unfortunate case of a middlechapter the two towers is arguably the weakest of the trilogy but the introduction of gollum the politics of the nations of middleearth and an incredibly regal expansion of the series scope make it undoubtedly another masterpiece of fantasy film
Sep 29 2013,positive,filled with intense performances terrific action sequences and spectacular special effects the two towers succeeds on every level
Sep 27 2013,positive,full of action intense and very good acting and very good directing
Sep 20 2013,positive,despite having the hardest job of being the middle chapter in the trilogy the two towers never drops the ball once and never feels like padding amazing stuff
Sep 19 2013,positive,the best of the greatest trilogy of all time
Sep 16 2013,positive,my favourite out of the trilogy
Sep 12 2013,positive,as epic as films get the lord of the rings the two towers is that rare sequel that trumps its predecessor in dazzling fashion
Sep 11 2013,positive,a great visual journey and full of adventure
Sep 10 2013,positive,my favorite of the trilogy loved it
Sep 8 2013,positive,cant go wrong with this true fantasy epic
Sep 6 2013,positive,the best film out of the lord of the rings trilogy and i assume it was the hardest one to make  so well done peter jackson
Sep 3 2013,positive,peter jacksons followup to the dazzling first movie begins on a very strong note plummeting straight into gandalfs fate after he falls to the depths of moria  all the other characters are revisited right from where we left them  reluctantly  in the last film  the epic adventure continues spanning off into many different storylines  some of which are better than others  and numerous more characters such as the showstealing smeagol rekindle and carry the flame with admirable strength  it isnt right to call this a sequel as it merely continues where its predecessor left off and very little inherent in the last film is lost here  i do however have some minor issues with the two towers  i think the sense of adventure somewhat diminishes this time because most of the movie takes place in rohan which i personally think looks pretty bleak and boring  while i loved smeagol when i was younger i now find the my preeecioussss routine a little overbearing  legolas starts to get a little too prancy gimli is stripped of all former honour turned instead into a joke and aragon suddenly seems all about invincible  im not too bothered by the infamous gayness between our two main hobbits though their little exchange at the end of the movie always makes me cringe  but overall this was  and always will be  a fantastic movie  and for every feature that doesnt quite work there are always ten more that are nothing less than perfect
Aug 31 2013,positive,smeagol is probably one of the greatest cinematic characters of all time
Aug 31 2013,positive,full review of the third greatest film ever made coming soon
Aug 31 2013,positive,this movie has the best battle ever  the battle for helms deep was beautifully crafted the effects were gory and gorgeous and the emotion was perfect while the fighting was happening  the battle and the way they transition from aragorn to pippin to sam etc makes this the best one of the three in my opinion
Aug 31 2013,positive,probably the worst movie of the three since the story here has neither beginning nor end still undoubtedly the greatest film without beginning or end ever to be created
Aug 30 2013,positive,  its easily the slowest moving of the trilogy and coincidentally the weakest but the two towers has many redeeming factors as well such as the amazing craft of peter jackson constantly on display
Aug 29 2013,positive,the two towers continues the story of lord of the rings in epic fashion the pacing isnt quite as tight as its predecessor likely in part to being the middle chapter of a larger story but this is a minor and my only criticism of the two towers the quality of the filmmaking is at the same level of near perfection in fellowship the battle of helms deep is one of the most epic and ridiculously long action sequences ever put to film
Aug 29 2013,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers does what every sequel should do have our already beloved characters continue on the story we are already familiar with from the first and throw them in new unexpected situations the two towers does just that the cast continue to shine in their roles however it is the inclusion of gollum played by andy serkis that really steals the show
Aug 28 2013,positive,just when you thought it could not get better
Aug 26 2013,positive,theyre taking the hobbits to isengard
Aug 19 2013,positive,now if youve seen my past reviews you should know that i am not a big lotr fan and i have never seen the original animated franchise but after seeing the first liveaction movie from 2001 i was kinda fascinated by it the sequel was better the story begins with the famous scene of gandalf played by ian mckellen dying now frodo and samwise played by elijah wood and sean astin must protect the one ring in order to be destroyed along with the dark lord sauron but along the way they meet the corrupted gollum played by andy serkis who will guide them both other characters played by actors are liv tyler as arwen viggo mortensen as aragorn cate blanchett as galadriel christopher lee as saruman and orlando bloom as legolas the cgi and practical effects were flawless once again so were the filming in new zealand overall this movie like i said is better than the first film for its introduction and then theres the three hours that no one like me gives a shit about the lord of the rings the two towers 2002 gets a 910
Aug 18 2013,positive,epic  the war actually gave me goosebumps 
Aug 16 2013,positive,the two towers is 2nd fantastic installment into the lord of the rings trilogy although it might not be as good as the 1st its one of the best sequels ever made featuring large action set pieces emotional dramatic storytelling and leaving you wanting only the best of the best from the final installment in the epic trilogy
Aug 16 2013,positive,the best in the lotr trilogy
Aug 15 2013,positive,one of my favorite films ever made the two towers proves to be an action packed adventure  that knows how to show three journeys to the walls of mordor
Aug 12 2013,positive,how do u watch it though
Aug 10 2013,positive,the weaker in my opinion of the 3 still outsta ding and still one of the best movies ive seen ever
Jul 31 2013,positive,in my opinion the lesser of the three movies but that is just me it is also the lesser of the three books as well to me but that is just me     it is by far the only movie that is nothing but darkness and a sinker of depression but thats the catcher you feel in this film the possibility that frodo sam and the rest of middle earth is doomed and you feel that way all the way to the very end of the film the subtleties and camera angles are magnificant as always and you get a little taste of jacksons abillity to captivate the viewers eye with the battle sequence at helms deep the dialogue is well but lacks the intensity except for in few parts    it is the undeniable magnifyer of darkness in the film that can only get darker from here
Jul 30 2013,positive,really good movie it has more action then the first but the plot wast as good
Jul 28 2013,positive,it has some pretty noticeable pacing issues and its many subplots stretch out a bit too much but the two towers remains an epic and sweeping fantasy adventure with no shortage of emotional resonance and epic battle sequences
Jul 28 2013,positive,add a review optional
Jul 25 2013,positive,very strong 2nd movie in the trilogy
Jul 24 2013,positive,my 2 movie of all time
Jul 23 2013,positive,best of the trilogy the music the cinematography everything excellent flick
Jul 23 2013,positive,even better than the last and was one of the first films to utilize special effects in quite the same way sorrow hope and grandeur suffuse the second installment in the trilogy and the battles are more epic than the last film and the scale all that much greater
Jul 20 2013,positive,by maintaining the expert pacing and aweinspiring visuals we came to expect with the first chapter jackson and his excellent cast are able to keep us fully invested in a story with essentially no beginning or end
Jul 20 2013,neutral,the krigglespats from blangerdunn fought valiantly against the gumblints from findlepore using their vissor swords to disarm their magical fistel sheilds  someone pay me a million dollars
Jul 18 2013,positive,second installment of one of film makings greatest adventures as usual the acting is great and i just love this trilogy
Jul 17 2013,positive,even better than fellowship
Jul 17 2013,positive,one of the greatest films ever conceived
Jul 16 2013,positive,lord of the rings the two towers is a welcome addition to peter jacksons franchise this movie is the very defend toon of epic the stakes are higher the battles are bigger and the effects are better gollum is one of the best looking cgi character ive ever seen in a movie lord of the rings is spectacular in every possible way
Jul 15 2013,positive,the second installment has all the action you ever wanted a bit slow in the ents part but still a good film best supporting role goes to gollum
Jul 14 2013,positive,i really liked all of jacksons trilogy films yes i read the jrrks books as a teenager  i never thought that any film rendering of the lord of the ring would ever approach the scope and artistry of the books  this does and then some  still gimli and logolas having a contest on who could kill the most orcs fell flat
Jul 14 2013,positive,im a huge tolkien fan  and i loved this movie people can complain all they want but peter can bring middle earth to the big screen like no other
Jul 14 2013,positive,the second film of the lord of the rings trilogy makes it very i dont know how amazing this movie was but very good
Jul 13 2013,positive,its not a bad movie just a movie that i felt that had lack of excitement  could not get into it as much as the original my least favorite of the trilogy but still great performances  great directing to peter jackson
Jul 13 2013,positive,a great adventurefantasy film one of the best to be clear the story manages to take like a hundred characters and develop all of them pretty well the action scenes and war scenes are some of the best done in motion picture history the score is epic and awesome the acting is strong the dialogue is allmiddle age stuff and the sense of magic and fantasy is at 100 in satisfaction while it can be overlong at times it worths the nearly 3 hour trip thanks to that final battle in helms deep which i qualify as one of the best war scenes ever in history of cinema its minimum failures are overcome by its greatness a great sequel thats bigger and better thah the first which was also a lot fantastic
Jul 12 2013,positive,basically a flawless satisfying continuation of the trilogy
Jul 11 2013,positive,i think all of the lotrs have just beat star wars as my all time favorite movies
Jul 10 2013,positive,epic and hilarious action scenes were marvellous this time around but especially in comparison with the fellowship the ending was lacklustre and frankly disappointing great content also real depth
Jul 9 2013,positive,the second installment in the trilogy such a great movie thats its hard to know where to start this movie continues where the last movie left off frodo and sam are on their way to mordor and meet gollum who still is attracted to the precious but leads the two closer to mordor the multirace trio aragorn gimli and legolas tries to find merry and pippin but meet someone else on the way  meanwhile sauruman is planning the ultimate destruction of rohan one of the few good kingdoms that stand in the way of sauron it sounds complex but he story is told in a way that all these plots are cohesive and equal   again lets start with the cast in my fotr review i commended all the actors and all i have to say for all of them is that the character arcs for this movie are well performed legolas and gimili expand from minor characters to more front line characters showing some friendly competition and bonding together showing how different races can get along i do have to go over the newreformed characters lets start with gandalf gandalf in this movie resurrected and is now gandalf the white hes a more stern and authoritative figure gone is the wit and charm of gandalf the grey a lot of people didnt criticize the acting of ian mckellen who i believed was superb but the direction of the character im not complaining he needs to be different in times of war moving on to bernard hills theoden he gives a fine performance for a character that shows so much pain and guilt of his actions that hurt his people karl urbans eomer is fine but his character doesnt do much which is a minor nuance he also only shows up in the beginning and the end but it works miranda ottos performance of eowyn is just fantastic otto brings a certain charm and innocence to the character but at the same time could kill you which is shown in the next movie david wenhams faramir is also well done the brother of boromir he strives to be better than his brother his character isnt as interesting if you dont watch the extended edition which explain his backstory still he gives a decent performance showing the same qualities as boromir who can be kind but also can be quite evil and menacing i dont blame the writers for the liberties they took with the character who wasnt seduced by the ring they needed obstacles for frodo and sam and that was fine moving on to the performance that inspired me andy serkiss gollum its not just the voice nor the cgi but his commitment to the character that was great and inspired me he gives gollum the childish side but also the corrupted evil side all in all you just feel a lot of pity for gollum   the battle of helms deep is the climax and is just breathtaking tens of thousands of urks on the big screen is just jaw dropping the ending of the battle also choked me up as did sams window speech the music just made the movie ever so grand as it did before my only problem low survivors the original helms deep army had about 600 there were only about 10 left which sucks but thats fine  lets talk about the themes first of all that good can survive sams quote that theres still some good in this world mr frodo and its worth fighting for really resonates with the audience whatever bad happens around us in this case 10000 urks about to wipe out rohan good will prevail as long as theres still one good person alive another theme is the conclusion of the environmental theme the first movie shows the vulnerability and the sadness of cutting down the trees theyre cut down to fuel industrialism and raise an army for sauraman this movie establishes how the forest now fights back and totally wrecks isengard mother nature always wins these themes again might not be apparent but come up after watching the movie   all in all go watch it its one of the best movies out there
Jul 7 2013,positive,thrilling middle part the part of the invasion by saurogs minions thrills me
Jul 7 2013,positive,this is the second movie the the trilogy and the second best the new character of gollum is arguably one of the best characters in movie history with cgi that some movies cant pull off over a decade later the only problem is that the scenes with treebeard bring the pacing to a screeching halt best scene is the battle of helms deep
Jul 6 2013,positive,epic review coming soon
Jul 5 2013,positive,the two towers continue the greatness there was in the fellowship of the ring and has one of the best climaxes ive ever seen
Jul 2 2013,positive,the least best i cant bear to say worst of the lord of the rings trilogy and still an incredibly good movie
Jul 1 2013,positive,the two towers gives you action and adventure at its best
Jul 1 2013,positive,really loved this one the extended cut was 35 hours which i thought was a little much but just a really enjoyable movie
Jun 29 2013,positive,the midsection of this brilliant adventure is no plateau and in almost every sense is right on par or above what the first chapter set out to do every aspect of what the first film did is continued and built on leading to a tremendous finale that will surely not be forgotten
Jun 27 2013,positive,not the best in the trilogy but excellent as a movie the twin towers makes us stick to the world of middle earth as much as its predecessor did
Jun 27 2013,positive,best sequel to a great adventure    an engaging story with one of the best battle sequences ever put on film peter jackson takes us back to middle earth where the stakes are higher than ever and shows how vast this world can be very well acted amazing battle sequences and manages to take us into two different tales without losing track or interest    also presented the best cgi character ever made after a while i really thought gollum was as real as the rest of the cast
Jun 27 2013,positive,a great sequel to the 1st film filled with spectacular action
Jun 26 2013,positive,the two towers is a great film a technical and visual masterpiece but in my opinion it is the weakest of the trilogy it is may be the most ambitious of the three though it tries to take on too much of the story and leaves some important plot points very brief and without as much detail as other parts for example frodo is hardly in the film at all yet he is the most essential part of the story the scenes with frodo only exist when something is going on with gollum or if the ring is toying with his mind the film starts out as if it was going to be the best of the trilogy the first hour and half is very intelligent dealing with themes of faith hope courage bravery and the nature of evil however by the end the film slips into a conventional blockbuster the last hour of the film trades all its wits for chaotic action sequence after chaotic action sequence and drops pretty much every theme except faith and perseverance although the action sequences are very well directed and at times are very exhilarating but so much action was not necessary the first half also features stunning photography by lesnie again it is   much more visually dazzling than the first mainly because the natural landscape becomes more important in this film but towards the end that beautiful photography has been replaced by very well photographed action scenes that depict the sheer magnitude of this massive war the acting is the same as the first one mckellen wood and astin give great performances and everyone else are just kind of trying their best jackson again succeeds at creating an atmosphere and a world that we have never seen before a world that is about as detailed as you can hope for the editing by michael horton is very good considering he had so much plot to try and condense into an enthralling 3 hour film which he succeeds at overall id say that the two towers is a very good film that relies too heavily upon its action sequences to pace it and it is a confirmation that jacksons trilogy is more about men than it is about the innocence and overwhelming goodness of the hobbits
Jun 25 2013,positive,the best movies ever
Jun 25 2013,positive,peter jackson and friends apply their epic vision to lotrs second chapter although this material doesnt sparkle in quite as many ways while the sweeping vistas and jawdropping landscapes are again fantastic and memorable a noticeably slowing plot means were seeing more of them for longer periods of time than in the previous installment rather than the perfect balance of action adventure and fantasy seen in fellowship of the ring much more time is devoted to romance pontification and elaboration in the two towers with the wealth of talking heads lending the picture a very longwinded literary feel theres still room for a bit of warfare of course with the lengthy battle for helms deep gobbling up nearly an hour by itself but the road to get there often feels terribly long and dry perhaps thats just a case of too much material in the extended edition though andy serkis is a revelation as gollum while elijah woods performance as frodo is an improvement over his onedimensional turn in the first film its also worth mentioning that the cgi creature effects which looked so convincing on the screen back in 02 dont benefit from the crystal clarity of a bluray translation
Jun 23 2013,positive,the whole trilogy
Jun 22 2013,positive,love this movie my fav people r pippin frodo merry legolas and if u love aragon i would stop hes literally gay
Jun 21 2013,positive,not as good as the first but i still liked it a lot
Jun 21 2013,positive,although the film can slow at times the action scenes and new greatly casted members fully compensate for all those parts the battle of helms deep had me on the edge of my seat the whole time and the debut of gollum was brilliant peter jackson nails it once again with the lord of the rings the two towers
Jun 20 2013,positive,91  lotr part 2 drags a lot especially during the scene where the two hobbits try to talk the leader of the trees into the human war but peter jackson manages to pull it off well in the end with yet another stylish climax
Jun 17 2013,positive,perhaps the funniest of the bunch but the storyline continues to be gripping the landscapes continue to be breathtaking and the action continues to rise jacksons perfection continues if not grows
Jun 15 2013,positive,the epic journey continues in this fantastic sequel with excellent directing acting writing cinematography score and special effects especially with gollum who is brilliantly played and voiced by andy serkis the lord of the rings the two towers is a near perfect film a
Jun 13 2013,positive,my fave of the series controversial opinion
Jun 10 2013,positive,this was my fav book in the trilogy but the movie fell a little short
Jun 10 2013,positive,out of all three movies the best one would have to be the two towers not only was this the starting point for the battle of middle earth at the black gate in movie three but the battle for helms deep would have to be my favorite battle of all time this is a movie that u wanna watch over and over again
Jun 6 2013,positive,89  slightly better in terms of acting of visual effects but is insubstantial when it comes to whats in the book being in the movie and whats not in the book being in the movie
Jun 4 2013,positive,epic can watch over and overand i do
Jun 4 2013,positive,with outstanding performances by elijah wood sean astin andy serkis ian mckellen and viggo mortensen spectacular visual effects a outstanding plot and another well done job by peter jackson make the two towers the best film of 2002 and the best film in the series and a great adaptation of the second jrr tolkien novel
Jun 4 2013,positive,the sequel that lived up to the first interesting character development for most of the characters a
Jun 4 2013,positive,production triumphs
Jun 2 2013,positive,the shorter of the trilogy with great battle scenes and effects
May 31 2013,positive,personally my favorite of the trilogy two towers has the perfect balance of action adventure and comedy the tone is serious but there is so much comic relief such as gollum perfect film
May 30 2013,positive,all of them are great
May 28 2013,positive,truly an amazing movie
May 28 2013,positive,peter jackson really did well on the trilogy and they just get better and better as they progress regardless the second is amazing to watch
May 28 2013,positive,the second movie of the lord of the ring trilogy is also the fastest paced and most adventurous one surpassing the predecessor in storytelling qualities and having fun with its characters as they and the story had been established with the fellowship of the ring episode peter jackson once again uses the groundbreaking special effects to make everything look magical and fantastic but does not shy away from adding darker undertones that find a personification in the paranoid character of gollum
May 25 2013,positive,not the best of the three the battle at the climax is still one of the greatest ever filmed
May 24 2013,positive,great movie kept true to the intrigue in the book and the twists and turns of the plot
May 24 2013,positive,absolute perfection
May 21 2013,positive,maybe the best one of the trilogy lostsa orc violence though  was there any backlash from the orc community
May 20 2013,positive,this film is my favourite in the series one of the great things about middle acts is that all the setup has been done for you and none of the cleanup is going to drag on at the end its like coming to a dinner party right as the main course is being served and leaving before the dishes have to be done     the movie does have some exposition of its own we are introduced to many rohan characters as well as some from gondor the films primary villain saruman gets a lot to do here as well     it is a little jarring to constantly cut back and forth between frodosam merrypippin and aragornlegolasgimli it does keep the novelty high but if youre not paying attention you can forget what each wing of the cast is up to be prepared     the new additions to the story bring some excellent actors into the film andy serkis in his breakout role shows us that physical and voice acting can really sell a character bernard hill is a very human king mirando otto tries really hard and sometimes succeeds at showing ãowyns heartache and karl urban is resolute as ãomer     the movie is quite a thinker of you notice it raises questions about leadership integrity character and trust these themes are buried but fun to discover on your own or with friends rather than by having some hack of a film review writer tell you about them     the two towers has action plot and a splendid cast of interesting characters this makes for an extremely enjoyable and suspensefilled film     extended version this extended cut has more meat to it with several new scenes and more elongated scenes in particular it accentuates the relationship boromir and faramir have with their father which is very interesting as well as a bit more about aragorn and his destiny it also cleans up a few scenes which helps with continuity for me
May 18 2013,positive,my favourite film of all time a masterpiece

Apr 8 2013,positive,there is a reason why its a hundred percent fresh when its rated by the top critics
Apr 7 2013,positive,another amazing film
Apr 3 2013,neutral,this doesnt really engage on the same level as the first film probably because of far too much screen time being devoted to pippin and merry who almost bear comparison to jarjar binks in levels of annoyance  proceedings are just about redeemed by the epic battle conclusionbut only just
Apr 3 2013,positive,another epic entry in the greatest fantasy film series of all time again as like all of these films they are flawlessly acted and directed
Apr 3 2013,positive,couldnt have been more perfect
Apr 2 2013,positive,after interned in emyn muil frodo baggins and sam gamgee meet the creature gollum who tries to remove the ring by force but by being beaten promises to guide the hobbits to mordor after removing them from emyn muil and traverse the dead marshes morannon arrive at the black gate of mordor however the great protection that is impossible for them to get out there and gollum proposes to take the secret path of cirith ungol during the journey they encounter an advance troop of gondor led by faramir son of the steward of gondor and boromirs brother who take them as prisoners and discover that carry the one ring faramir decides to bring them to his father but on its way through the ruined city of osgiliath gondorian soldiers are fighting saurons forces led by some of nazgul realizing the evil power of the ring to frodo who almost captures one of the nazgul faramir decides to free them to complete their mission  meanwhile the urukhai carrying prisoners to merry brandybuck and pippin took are killed by the riders of rohan and the hobbits exiles manage to escape from the battle into the forest of fangorn aragorn legolas and gimli who had gone after them they find the remains of the battle and follow in the footsteps of their friends to the forest interior in it are reunited with gandalf who believed dead after falling through the bridge of moria and once they have left reports that merry and pippin in good hands they go together to edoras capital of rohan to talk to king theoden however it is haunted by saruman with the help of the kings counselor grima who works in secret to the magician under his influence banished his nephew éomer théodred after the death of his son and heir to the throne gandalf and théoden decides achieved liberate his people take refuge in the fortress of helms deep in order not to risk open conflict with edoras isengard  saruman sends a huge army of urukhai to destroy helms deep while gandalf goes in search of the exiled rohirrim for battle the elf haldir the forest of lothlorien comes with a small army of galadhrim rohans aid and together they manage to hold out until the arrival of gandalf éomer and numerous rohirrim defeating the uruks  meanwhile pippin and merry who had been entrusted by the ent treebeard gandalf come along with him to a council of several members of their race in which these decide to do about war after a long time talking decide it is not your business however when treebeard carried the hobbits out of the forest discovers that saruman has felled many trees and their cry again attracts all ents who march to isengard and destroy
Apr 1 2013,positive,a little boring but it ends up with you asking for more
Apr 1 2013,positive,ditto to what i said about lotr fotr
Mar 31 2013,positive,hate that the elves were killed but the whole fight is great
Mar 31 2013,positive,the trilogy is a masterpiece utter perfection
Mar 31 2013,positive,the curse of the middle chapter  still pretty damned good
Mar 30 2013,positive,the fellowship is broken what are they to do now but make a better sequel    the two towers for me was even better than the fellowship of the ring in every way the cast extended into something even greater adding andy serkis as the horrible gollum brilliant and one of the best parts the battle sequences the battle of helms deep blew me away    the two towers is one of those rare sequels that improves over the original i give it 10 out of 10
Mar 30 2013,positive,a brilliant 2nd part to the trilogy scenes show brilliantly the growing relationships between sam and frodo and legolas gimli and aragorn not only with emotion but with comedy at timesthe special effects used through out  and especially in the battle of helms deep are cutting edge and well crafted jacksons direction provides an insiteful look into the character of gollum showing his almost schitzophenic nature gandalf is reborn and the clear diferences and sililarity between him and his evil counterpart are shown brilliantly to the audience amazing
Mar 29 2013,positive,continuing the epic journey this movie has tons of action in it and of course great story adaption if you love these movies see the extended editions they are even better
Mar 29 2013,positive,perfect in every way
Mar 28 2013,positive,a step up from the previous instalment but also a few steps away from tolkiens work and closer to the typical action movie framework at the expense of the characters and of the movie itself    it benefits greatly from not having to introduce itself the first one did that and it suffered from it this time the length doesnt feel like an issue because theres more going on but the action gets old after a while and isnt what the spirit of tolkiens work was about the hobbits are also annoyingly outcast as nothing more than bystanders who spend most of the time crawling rather than standing    it improves on the first in the important areas but then replaces those improvements with some new issues in both cases it just feels like jackson is overplaying his hand the upsides to that though are the thrills the epicness yes its not a word boohoo and the stunning visuals that jackson creates so well     i prefer it to the first but im left with the same feeling in the end it couldve been better and with less effort too
Mar 26 2013,positive,my fave out of the three  felt more epic
Mar 25 2013,positive,the while trilogy was awesome
Mar 25 2013,positive,trilogies take the greatest risk with the second chapteryou have neither a definite beginning nor end so there is a lot more free reign to get really  right or really wrong  if done right the payoff is huge case and point the dark knight empire strikes back and the two towers  the movie has action aplenty but the magic is found in the quieter moments in gollumsmegols oscar worthy and snubbed schizophrenic discussions to sams stories speech  the characters struggles and development are given front stage as the storm clouds gather for the war to decide the fate of middle earth  add in an oscar winning soundtrack introducing the french horn led rohan theme gorgeous cinematography in the most beautiful place on earth and a fantastic cast and this is a fitting middle chapter to the greatest cinematic fantasy adventure
Mar 24 2013,positive,im starting to become a fan of lords of the rings i love this movie also the stories are amazing awesome job
Mar 23 2013,positive,favorite out of the lord of the rings trilogy great battles in this one
Mar 22 2013,positive,tiny doesnt understand the plot ignore him kindly
Mar 21 2013,positive,suitably epic and beautifully designed even if a lot of the plotting gets clunky particularly the ent storyline andy serkis performance is really pretty amazing and the rest of the cast is solid too although i really dislike gimli being relegated to useless and goofy comicrelief status wellmade but certainly the weakest of the trilogy
Mar 19 2013,positive,i watched this movie in 3 segments and enjoyed it i recently read the hobbit and hope that will match up with the lotr series
Mar 19 2013,positive,this is a great sequel to fellowship almost nothing was taken out and nz looks amazing as usual in this film the fellowship is divided so its good to see them try to work without everyone else
Mar 19 2013,positive,amazing not as amazing as the other 2 but amazing nonetheless
Mar 19 2013,positive,incredible film great acting great effects and suspense  a must see
Mar 18 2013,positive,a second chapter of fantastic happenings and a natural progression in one of the worlds most epic trilogies ever created peter jackson has proven that he is the perfect director to pull off such a magnificent feat
Mar 18 2013,positive,myyyyy  preaciiioouusss  in this film we meet the author of this unforgettable phrase and much much entertainment on this another masterpice made by peter jackson  the two towers is the second chapter in the best trilogy ever made the lord of the rings remaining faithful to the predecessor to the finest detail possible improved in several aspects but keeping almost the same but that is not mean thai is bad the film continues to give us those beautiful landscapes an excellent soundtrack and unforgettable characters  the cast as predecessor continues doing an excellent job with new characters like the unforgettable gollum  smeagol played by andy serkis fantastic and we see the relationship of all the characters to grow and while we connect more with them in an impressive way  a film that remain fainthful to its predecessor making m role in thrilling trilogy with messages with unforgettable characters and scenarios full of emotion humor action and epic scenes and unforgettable for anyone to watch
Mar 18 2013,positive,the two towers carries on where the fellowship of the ring left off and in some ways its even better
Mar 17 2013,positive,the weakest of the three lotrs still epic as it gets
Mar 15 2013,positive,just as good as its predecessor and creatively built to play on the books strengths wisely holding some material over until the third film for added impetus staggeringly brilliant
Mar 14 2013,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is more entertaining than the fellowship of the ring peter jackson has done it again the story takes place after the events of the first movie the fellowship has been broken but the journey to destroy the one ring continues frodo and sam must entrust their lives to gollum voiced by andy serkis a creepy and weird creature who keeps saying my precious to find their way to mordor as sarumans army approaches the surviving members of the fellowship along with other creatures and people from middleearth prepare for battle thhe war of the ring has begun the two towers is paced with amazing visual effects like the first movie and still has a great screenplay and great directing by peter jackson
Mar 13 2013,positive,great films hurts your ass to watch tho
Mar 12 2013,positive,some really damn good battle scenes in this film its like watching a history movie only its obviously more fictional
Mar 11 2013,positive,what an amazing movie
Mar 11 2013,positive,while maintaining the same sense of wonder as the first this installment tends to drag quite a bit for a whole two hours until reaching its outstanding third act dem two towers
Mar 10 2013,positive,great set of movies with little to do with the books
Mar 7 2013,positive,incredibleabseloutly breathtaking and beautiful the best of its kind
Mar 7 2013,positive,effects are great acting is great but the pace is sooo damn slow i felt like it was a lot longer than the first one
Mar 5 2013,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is a notch below its predecessor in terms of storytelling adventure and sheer filmmaking but not in terms of spectacle there are numerous battle sequences in the two towers that are astonishingly wellmade and its hard not to find yourself totally enthralled in the action its a great film that effectively acts as a connector between the first and third films and the three hour long running time never lags for a single second
Mar 2 2013,positive,the two towers is a wonderful movie
Mar 2 2013,positive,i think the lord of the rings the two towers is a great movie
Feb 26 2013,positive,best lotr in my opinion
Feb 26 2013,positive,another awe inspiring lord of the rings movie this movie can be shared by all tastes and likes i would highly recommend this movie for the entire family
Feb 24 2013,positive,great but not as focused on character development as the first and left me with a sense of yearning but i guess this is the middle child of the series that could lead into or out of what ever was learned in the beginning maybe more action and less character is justified but i still feel relatively less satisfied overall its awe inspiring especially when considering    that opening sequence 
Feb 24 2013,positive,full of emotional highs and lows as well as stunning visuals this masterpiece leaves you ready for the climax of this epic trilogy
Feb 24 2013,positive,i think this one was my favourite
Feb 24 2013,positive,some nice fight scenes more happening than the first
Feb 23 2013,negative,not a lord of the rings fan at all
Feb 22 2013,positive,good but way too long weakest of the 3
Feb 22 2013,positive,the two towers balances spectacular action with emotional storytelling leaving audiences both wholly satisfied and eager for the final chapter
Feb 19 2013,positive,the battle scenes are awesome gandalf is baaackk 
Feb 19 2013,positive,a perfectly balanced film full of action and great storytelling serves as a perfect middlepiece for this epic trilogy
Feb 18 2013,positive,we wants it we needs it must have the precious they stole it from us sneaky little hobbitses wicked tricksy false
Feb 17 2013,neutral,i thought that this was a good film and i thought gollum was a pretty cool character
Feb 17 2013,negative,i found this one boring  first one was very good though
Feb 17 2013,positive,my third favorite movie of all time after the other two lotr it is a great continuation of the series and a gorgeous imagining of a beautiful world created by the brilliant jrr tolkien
Feb 16 2013,positive,i found fellowship to be a more enjoyable film as a whole however i must say that the addition of the character of gollum was excellent and the climax was enjoyable in the end though the pacing issues are still present and some storylines seem slightly distracting this film succeeds more on a technical level as it provides a grander scale than the first film
Feb 16 2013,positive,can sam keep it together when a homewreckergollum tries to wiggle his slimy little fingers into his and frodos relationship
Feb 13 2013,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers was significantly better than the first installment which isnt   saying much my low opinion of it is partly influenced by my distaste for these kinds of films ill admit that i am not too fond of a film that is purposely drawnout has banal storytelling and characters except for maybe one or two computer generated ones gollum is as fascinating a creature as dobby was in the harry potter series its well written contrary to the fellowship also better acted orlando bloom and hugo weaving just look awkward in their respective roles two characters who do not feel natural in an artificial world its only great attributes are everything related to visuals the computer generated effects are aweinspiring especially when the film is coming to an end i wonder how peter jackson and his staff imagined and choreographed all of the detail shown in the battle scenes even if it was done with a computer to me the actual fighting is not interesting at all its where these creatures are running to where they are falling the several objects used by them and so on some of the shots of locations castles and what not done by cgi are gorgeous to look at too as i said earlier most of the characters were unappealing to me only rarely did i care for a few ive seen them countless times before and did not like the way they were presented still i did not expect anything different the three storylines and what happens in them were mostly predictable somewhat boring and not really entertaining its style over substance difficult to catch its pulse
Feb 12 2013,positive,middleearth gets even bigger and bloodier in the second volume of peter jacksons mesmerizing fantasy epic
Feb 12 2013,positive,helms deep was coolalong with some good twists
Feb 10 2013,positive,very boring watching a random hobbit travel for miles other than that the action was ok in the battles
Feb 10 2013,positive,the one time legolas doesnt hit the guy in between the eyes and what happens half the castle is blown up
Feb 10 2013,positive,another phenominal film in the series
Feb 8 2013,positive,featuring dazzling action sequences and heartfelt emotional storytelling the two towers is a spectacular installment in the lord of the rings trilogy
Feb 8 2013,positive,underrated the second part was always going to be the diffcult one being a proper ie nonconstructed trilogy but i prefer it to its brethren pacing effects acting and mostimportantly monsters all better in this film
Feb 6 2013,positive,some films will live on forever as masterpieces the legacy of the lord of the rings films will be the bench mark for fantasy films for years to come
Feb 6 2013,positive,more crafted than the previous one darker with a more complex structure more complicated from the environmental an technical point of view the two towers continues the premise of the first part of the saga and enlarges its dimension to reach a betterly warlike atmosphere and a gloomy aura that never cuts the emotional and masterful style of peter jacksons lucid and wonderful  perfectionism this film doesnt stay at just keeping the tension and the cinematic brilliantness from the previous film but it simply denses and polishes it this one was the hardest to adapt indeed because it has too many plots it has a complex situation a chaotic and complicated structure and too many details to be exposed it was also so hard to express what this story should mean and to make it both dazzling and thougtfull again jacksons team made it concerning dramatic but also evocative and inspiring this film focuses more on the purely pictorial aspect on cinematography and score edition and careness of the environmental atmosphere pure art in the classical sense but probably the greatest things of this film are two the power of its narrative pulse and also the introduction of one of the best supporting characters ever gollum both in the psychological and interpretative way as well as in the digital and creative sense every single instant of this classic film than can be hardly when not just impossibly criticized because of its practical absence of mistakes is full of the most highly inspired and exquisite artistic taste and sense of heartfulness and beauty the greatest story ever told part ii
Feb 3 2013,positive,two towers is the perfect setup for the final chapter of the trilogy it is both emotionally packed and actionorientated as well simply spectacular
Feb 2 2013,positive,def my fave out of all of them
Feb 2 2013,positive,it picks up right where the other left off the story is amazing because of all the layers of events taking place there is also subtle humor sprinkled throughout   again another amazing film
Feb 1 2013,positive,the middle movie in the trilogy it was very action packed and very good
Jan 31 2013,positive,after grabbing critical and commercial acclaim to his first installment of his trilogy director peter jackson moves on to the second film the two towers is excellent a delight to watch andy serkiss performance added with the cgi make gollum a convincing critter one of the highlights of the film the battle scenes look amazing on camera and the film amps up the climatic scope to make the movie better than the first and it works the story follows frodo and sam still on their way to mordor as they face trials and tribulations of their journey meanwhile aragorn and their former companions wage war on the forces of evil arresting epic entertainment that nicely sets up the grand finale
Jan 28 2013,positive,great action and epic storytelling continue the saga of lotr
Jan 28 2013,positive,definitely the best epic series of all time jrr tolkien is unparalleled to this kind of literature i wish he is still alive to continue the story the way the movie was created was amazing i admire those who became part in the making of this film
Jan 28 2013,positive,what used to be my least favorite of the fantastic lord of the rings series has gotten better with every rewatch two towers is a fantastic movie in every sense of the word and i can finally say it beats fellowship this movie continues the great story and develops the characters even more the acting becomes increasingly better with not only the returning standouts wood mckellen and mortensen but now with new standouts astin tyler and most certainly andy serkis serkiss portrayal of gollum is one of the best motioncapture performances ever and deserves the oscar it never got nominated for the movie is amazingly paced and is surprisingly more entertaining than fellowship it is funnier more emotional has even better music and features one of the best battles in any movie i have ever seen helms deep two towers improves on its predecessor in every way and sets up a finale that no one could be prepared for 9510
Jan 28 2013,positive,a great tie in movie
Jan 26 2013,positive,what else can i say about this film other than that it it is visually stunning engaging and astounding everything there is to be said about this flick has probably been stated or though so thats really all i have to say about this one
Jan 26 2013,positive,my least favorite of the three pretty good
Jan 25 2013,positive,special effects are awesome  story is not my interest
Jan 24 2013,positive,the second chapter lotr is deeper and darker than the previous while the first film started off on a lighter note the world of the two towers is entirely immersed in the war of the ring the fellowship has broken up and saurons power is growing across middle earth the film is more complicated than the first with more subplots relating to the war shown frodo and sams journey with gollum is a highlight and their unique relationship is captured masterfully the mood of the film is great the emotion present and the victories at helms deep and isengard set up the final push against sauron and mordor in rotk
Jan 24 2013,positive,peter jacksons second venture into middle earth musters up an air of escalating dread and impending destiny before closing on a battle of colossal scale tolkiens beloved characters are explored in greater depth and jackson treads very carefully alongside the source material offering fans another franchise instalment thats as faithful as it is entertaining megabudget epic with groundbreaking cgi that made andy serkis schizophrenic smeagol a cinematic landmark
Jan 23 2013,positive,more imagination and action than the first film it also has deeper emotion and does great on preparing for the final chapter 7910
Jan 22 2013,positive,weakashell middle section to the whole story poor pacing lackluster fights and not enough gollum  two towers obviously you have to see this movie to get the whole story but it could have been way better
Jan 22 2013,positive,a fitting gobetween in what turned out to be an epic trilogy
Jan 22 2013,positive,weakest of the trilogy the extended version is why it gets 3 stars instead of 2 avoid the theatrical cut at all costs
Jan 21 2013,positive,the 2nd chapter in the lotr trilogy great sequel not much to be critical over
Jan 21 2013,positive,a darker chapter of the trilogy very creative and nice effects
Jan 21 2013,positive,best of the bunch for me  lots of fun action
Jan 20 2013,negative,trilogy bored me to death
Jan 20 2013,positive,the fellowship is scattered frodo and sam are being lead to mount doom by a crazy skinned hobbit named gollum what else would happen now nothing the second novel to tolkiens great fantasy is yet to be revealed but what now wait till you see more
Jan 20 2013,positive,greatest series to date
Jan 19 2013,negative,long drawn out mostly boring heres the story  a lot of death a lot of waiting for death and a lot of dying the only enjoyment was making fun of the names froyo dumbledor doppy i should have just turned it off
Jan 18 2013,positive,good rep of the book
Jan 17 2013,positive,again too good to be true
Jan 16 2013,positive,kind of long and dull if you are not a huge lord of the rings fan but its still pretty good
Jan 16 2013,positive,the second part to the trilogy i really loved this film great special effects it kept to the storyline in the book quite well and the cast acting was really good its not for everybody but if you are a fan of the book i would recommend it to you if you havent seen it
Jan 15 2013,positive,excellent by far the best in the trilogy and very captivating
Jan 14 2013,positive,ian mcellan was great as gandalf great cast and solid director
Jan 14 2013,positive,helms deep battle is awsome
Jan 13 2013,positive,theres no doubt about it that this film is a bridge between fellowship of the ring and return of the king im not usually not the biggest fan of bridge stories since all they do is just set up the finale without adding anything new for example harry potter and the order of the phoenixs only purpose is to prove that voldemort is back and to set up the final battle making this the worst of the harry potter series however the two towers is completely different from most bridge stories the film continues where fellowship of the ring left off with the fellowship broken up and sauron beginning his attack on middleearth frodo and sam are lost on their way to mordor and ask gollumsmeagol to guide them merry and pippin have escaped their captors and are kept safe by treegard a talking tree that is the eldest of his kind aragorn legolas and gimli are assisting a town under attack by orcs at their fortress in helms pass while all of this is occurring sauron is growing stronger with the ring approaching closer i thought that two towers was an improvement over fellowship unlike fellowship while it does have a long length i was able to keep my interest the entire time with clever dialogue and a smartly written script theres not many action scenes in this film so the story relies on the dialogue to establish characters and setup what will occur in the return of the king the character that shines the most in this film is gollum this is the first time in the series that hes seen entirely every scene that he was in i was clinging to his every world andy serkis does a great job portraying the character and the ending shows that there will be a lot more of him that could be just as exciting as in this film im glad that i was able to finally see this film because it just leaves me as well as newcomers and fans of the series in anticipation for return of the king and the epic conclusion
Jan 13 2013,positive,i actually slept though the middle of this one
Jan 13 2013,positive,what more can i say excellent cast again etc etc
Jan 13 2013,positive,once again the fight scene at the end steals the show liked the comedy too with the little dwarf guy having some funny lines
Jan 11 2013,positive,second of the trilogy this film is an example of how interesting a film can be made in between a predecessor and a successor
Jan 11 2013,positive,this is a brilliant addition to lotr it kept me watching i cant wait til i see the hobbit
Jan 10 2013,positive,i freakin love this film
Jan 10 2013,positive,ok the first time i saw the lord of the rings first one i was likedoesnt this movie ever end so i never really watched the whole of the feelowship of the ring but the two towers ive seen and watched the whole of it probably cos it was the ending of the storyi always like to know how stories end
Jan 9 2013,positive,amazing visually stunning and extremely welldone overall no complaints
Jan 9 2013,positive,favorite one of the trilogy battle of helms deep combined with the music just gives you chills  the depth  emotion that went into a scene like that
Jan 9 2013,positive,i think this is the weakest movie in the trilogy though i dont really love the lotr movies anyway
Jan 8 2013,positive,peter jackson knows what he is doing behind the camera
Jan 8 2013,positive,this movie is a great sequel and it has alot of action but gollum can confuse me
Jan 8 2013,positive,no major introductions just brutal battles and visually satisfying wonders await the audience
Jan 6 2013,positive,the captivating thing about two towers is the fight choreography and the battle at helmâtms deep which was kind of the movieâtms climax it is one that you will not forget that easily and the movie is just another powerful extension of what peter jackson could do the movie is filled with a lot more cgi from my view than the first and it may not be the best of the three but two towers delivered some powerful performances especially from aragon viggo mortensen the dwarf gimli john rhysdavies and the elf legolas orlando bloom    after you have watched the fellowship of the rings you are ever so eager to see what the fellowship which is now broken into three groups frodo with sam pippin with merry and aragon with legolas and gimli will be able to achieve on their own as part of the master plan to destroy the ring at mount doom the interesting thing about watching this flick is that some managed victory in their own areas giving you the viewer a delightful hope while frodo elijah woods and sam sean astin were moving closer to their target    the movieâtms plot is focused mostly on the battle at helmâtms deep the other fellowship members except frodo and sam and after the fall of gandalf when he battled the balrog chased after the urukhai who took merry and pippin so as to rescue them while they chased merry and pippin found an adventure of their own in the forest the rescuers aragon gimli and legolas found themselves in rohan and had to save the king and defend the city from an attack from sarumanâtms forces this defense and intense battle happened at helmâtms deep    the three most notable changes in the movie compared to the book that i picked up instantly are although many other differences can be found 1 in the book theoden is just depressed and deluded by wormtongue but in the movie he is possessed by saruman the second is about theeoden who didnâtmt just run to helmâtms deep as the movie made it see he actually fought at first the last was the exclusion of shelob who was later included in the final movie of the trilogy    not winning as much as the first two towers won two academy awards for best visual effects and best sound editing it was a commercial success making close to 10 times its 94 million dollars production cost  not as much of a powerful score like the fellowship of the ring the movie is a nice follow up to the first and it served like a bridge from an excellent beginning in the trilogy in the fellowship of the ring to a magnificent ending in the return of the king you canâtmt watch the first only without seeing this also so get the dvd box set and enjoy    
Jan 6 2013,positive,loved it but way to long
Jan 6 2013,positive,my fave of the 3 lotr movies
Jan 5 2013,positive,one word magnificent my favorite of the lotr movies
Jan 5 2013,positive,peter jackson set the bar high with the fellowship of the ring and with the two towers he more than matched it of the trilogy i think that this is my favourite movie as i love the segments set in the kingdom of rohan with its troubled ruler theoden magnificently portrayed by bernard hill this is a sweeping epic of a film with every dollar on the screen creating a truly immersive experience the climax of this movie is the battle of helms deep the fortress that the people of rohan take refuge within it is a staggering action sequence that just builds and builds this movie also features the first proper appearance of golem after the fleeting glimpses in the first film this is still a magnificent cgi creation and andy serkis imbues the character with a malevolence and slyness that is amazing to watch the rest of the cast from the first film return and are put through the mill sean astin really comes to the fore as sam in this proving himself to be a very capable actor as the second in the trilogy this film bridges the other two perfectly and pushes the story onwards giving the characters plenty of depth and development this is one of those movies that is both long and complex but is just a joy to watch and bears repeated viewings
Jan 5 2013,positive,i just watched the extended version with like 2 more hours of worried faces and unconvincing cgi
Jan 5 2013,positive,the battles heroism and character development drive the second lotr installment it has some of the best battle themed camera work i have ever seen battle of helms deep ect and the fact that it jumps into the fray mid way through  gives it a distinctly different feel than the fellowship of the ring
Jan 5 2013,positive,the story goes on opens the imagination and guarantees satisfaction
Jan 4 2013,positive,the battle of helms deep is very impressive
Jan 4 2013,positive,excellent follow up and middlepoint again spectacular effects with one of the best battle scenes ive ever seen
Jan 4 2013,positive,brill long film but so easy to watch my precious
Jan 4 2013,positive,a great installment in the franchise setting things up well could do with less frodo
Jan 3 2013,positive,a masterpiece beyond imagination  continues the trilogy without one false move
Jan 3 2013,positive,i have trouble recalling which movie is which in this trilogy  but they were all quite good if lengthy
Jan 3 2013,positive,another great movie  although not following the storyline as closely as the first still well done
Jan 3 2013,positive,a great adaptation of the book
Jan 3 2013,positive,thickening upon everything that made its predecessor great peter jacksons second installment of his lord of the rings trilogy makes for a wholly immersive and breathtaking narrative piece with continuously developing characters and an alwayssensational bundle of set pieces
Jan 3 2013,positive,not as good as the fellowship but still its a damn good movie
Jan 2 2013,positive,not bad but seemed to drag on a bit  perhaps a good filler between the other two films
Jan 2 2013,positive,most tedious of the three but still good
Jan 2 2013,positive,loved this movie helped me find my favourite army the urukhai
Jan 1 2013,positive,it is often said that this book is the unimportant boring and unnecessary middle ground which i have always disagreed with  peter jackson saw the beauty of this book like i did and made it even more  and the helms deep battle has changed battle scenes for the entire future of movie history
Dec 31 2012,positive,enjoyable and on par with the first movie
Dec 31 2012,positive,i thought they were all great
Dec 31 2012,neutral,this again was ok but not the best
Dec 30 2012,positive,wow what a well done series with fabulous special effects
Dec 30 2012,positive,its cool to see three stories at once which makes it that epic
Dec 30 2012,negative,sorry but this is too much for me
Dec 30 2012,positive,not quite as good as fellowship but its still incredible
Dec 30 2012,positive,more of the same like i say read the books first if possible otherwise stay away
Dec 29 2012,positive,i think that this is possibly the best movie of the best movie series so this is basically saying that this movie it fantastic
Dec 29 2012,positive,i think that this is possibly the best movie of the best movie series so this is basically saying that this movie it fantastic
Dec 29 2012,positive,the least of the three moviesi cant in good conscience call it the worst but its still a freakin great movie  helms deep is awesome  the march of the ents is cool  and gollum is amazing
Dec 29 2012,positive,another three hours that went by in a whiff again im astonished as to how well this fits in with the way i had envisioned this tale visually now for the third instalment and then maybe the extended versions just for hood measure
Dec 29 2012,positive,the two towers is my favorite in the lotr series a lot of humor epic battle scenes and fantastic performances especially from andy serkis as gollum
Dec 28 2012,positive,it would have been excellent but for the meandering storyline and the dragging and repetitive battle scenes
Dec 28 2012,positive,throw medont tell the elf    it couldve been the worst of the 3  being the middle it has no start and no end so theres no conclusion but no its easily my favourite of the trilogy progressing the story nicely and introducing more characters and creating more of a character of gollum     theres a greater sense of size and epicness of the world in the two towers its done on a grander scale  probably due to the success of the first film theres more of the world to see and a larger emphasis on the task frodo and the gang are up against it also contains what i consider to be the greatest battle scene of all time  the battle for helms deep that last hour is a magnificent feat in film making    whereas the fellowship of the ring was relatively dark and miserable throughout the two towers as a happier ending and is the part that shows that there is hope and they finally believe they can accomplish the task theres a greater feeling of togetherness throughout then film legolass and gimli start to become friends the king of rohan is returned to the crown and gandalf returns despite the appearance of what some perceive to be a darker film it is not its quite the opposite    unlike then previous film the 3 running time for the two towers works perfectly it doesnt drag everything is necessary the cgi is clearly improved and considering its only 1 year later its quite remarkable     an improvement in every way on the previous film a greater emphasis on the world and an all together brighter and happier outlook on what theyre facing  and containing the greatest battle scene ive ever seen this really is the empire strikes back of the lord of the rings trilogy
Dec 27 2012,positive,i feel that this one is the best out of the 3 lord of the rings films great fight scene and the graphicsspecial effects were outstanding
Dec 26 2012,positive,peter jackson is a genius working with some of the best fantasy literature of all time
Dec 26 2012,positive,should have won the oscar
Dec 26 2012,positive,it may not be the best in the trilogy but the two towers is one powerhouse of a film
Dec 26 2012,positive,watching the extended versioni love the whole series
Dec 25 2012,positive,tolkien is the king of fantasy and peter jackson did right by him
Dec 24 2012,positive,as the journey towards mordor continues the heroes encounter more battles and adventures    the second part of the epic lord of the rings trilogy and here we have another movie that redefines the fantasy genre  the story keeps going from strength to strength and with its much darker feel this movie is a joy to watch  again all facets of this production have been taken to their limits and you can the time and effort that was taken to bring this classic portion of the story to the big screen  my only quibble was the overly cgid ents which do seem incredibly jerky and cartoony in places  in the end this is another amazing piece of work and will always be my favourite chapter in the trilogy
Dec 24 2012,positive,lotr doesnt need any introduction i bet you have already seen this if not please die
Dec 24 2012,positive,talk to me in person and youll find i have a lot of criticisms of the trilogy both in how it was adapted to film and in stylistic presentation  fortunately for peter jackson when working with material as great as lotr even screwing it up results in one heck of a movie
Dec 23 2012,positive,once again peter jackson delivers with this on screen adaptation of what is probably the greatest fantasy series of all time
Dec 23 2012,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is a great movie i like the movie
Dec 23 2012,positive,not as good as the first one but still it scratches perfection
Dec 23 2012,positive,what a great fairy tale
Dec 23 2012,positive,the attack on helms deep is worth the 55 alone
Dec 23 2012,positive,while frodo and sam edge closer to mordor with the help of the shifty gollum the divided fellowship makes a stand against saurons new ally saruman and his hordes of isengard
Dec 22 2012,positive,character development and mild humour yet online editing and colour correction needed work
Dec 22 2012,positive,effectively continues from the fellowship of the ring and builds anticipation for the return of the king
Dec 22 2012,positive,my favorite teacher ms sindelar did fall asleep when she watched all three lord of the rings films on dvd
Dec 22 2012,positive,great movie best in the trilogy
Dec 21 2012,positive,the two towers is an epic continuation of everything good from fellowship of the ring peter jackson seems to ratchet it all up a bit with this movie but also the story gets a lot bigger and while this helps in some areas it also detracts from others the fellowship of the ring was a rather focused movie that followed our heros in this movie our heros are scattered all across middle earth then jackson introduces a whole slew of new plotlines and characters this makes the scope of the movie unbelievably massive and in my opinion jackson isnt fully able to balance the entire story until the third movie    the story picks up right where the first left off frodo and sam are on their own heading towards mordor merry and pippin are captives of the urukhai with legolas aragorn and gimli in pursuit to save them gandalf has returned from his battle with the balrog as gandalf the white while traveling sam and frodo are confronted by gollum a deranged creature who may be their only hope of getting into mordor gandalf aragorn legolas and gimli journey with the people of rohan to helms deep here is the only place where they might be safe from saruman and his army of urukhai    elijah wood really comes into his own in this movie a lot of emotional weight is being thrown on frodo but wood is able to handle every facet of the character sean astin also gets an opportunity to improve his character and he does i especially love sams speech at the end about the stories that really matter it nearly brought me to tears    ian mckellen is the same great character that we met in the first movie but now he is gandalf the white while he is a more powerful character now he is still the same great fatherly wizard mckellen is always tremendous    viggo mortensen orlando bloom and john rhysdavis return as aragorn legolas and gimli mortensens aragorn is struggling with the decision to take responsibility the character is written and played so well legolas and gimli arent round characters but they are great sidekicks legolas probably gets his second best moment of the trilogy when he rides a shield down a flight of stairs while firing arrows    and there is one huge addition to the movie that makes this movie even better andy serkis is the absolutely astounding as gollum he easily became my favorite character of the series whats there not to love about the bipolar bedraggled little monster this is the film that ushered motioncapture into movies of course that feat is amazing but serkiss performance is really the highlight  the movies always a bit more interesting when he is on screen    peter jackson comes back strong in every area the special effects are as stunning as ever calling the script well written is an understatement howard shore returns to the highcaliber score writing that he did for the first introduced in their full glory are the themes for rohan an epic theme heard often on the violin and smeagols haunting theme often mixed with the themes for the one ring shore also stays true to his themes from the first movie developing them accordingly with the story and though the movie does not have as many action scenes as the first the action is still very well done here what really blows the doors off the movie is the battle for helms deep this may be the finest action scene of the entire trilogy its a colossal scene that makes up for the slower parts in the beginning    but the movie does have flaws this is why i cannot grant it my highest rating first and foremost the movie does lag at times and while i certainly wasnt bored at any part of the movie the pacing isnt as crisp as the first movie there also isnt as much action this time around the quieter moments are used for character interaction and while i love that it does make the movie slow in parts another thing i didnt like was the way the final action scene was fragmented they have this huge epic showdown at helms deep but the repeatedly cut to merry and pippin talking to the ents this somewhat ruins the pacing of the action still these are only minor complaints    this movie is exceptionally enjoyable from start to finish the characters are well written and the emotional parts of the movie are handled terrifically the whole experience is dripping with epicness and watching this movie and the entire trilogy is really an experience and while the two towers may be the weakest of the three it still strongly holds up the story peter jackson hits almost all the marks of a great movie with this one    even darkness must pass a new day will come and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer those were the stories that stayed with youthat meant something 9510
Dec 21 2012,positive,i wasnt as fond of this one as i was the first movie but thats just because i didnt like the locations in rohan gorgeous though they were i prefered lothlorien this movie was awesome though
Dec 21 2012,positive,with the fellowship all split up frodo and sam continue their quest to mount doom while the others begin forming an army  the lord of the rings the two towers is a superb fantasy adventure sequel  the film is based off the second book of tolkiens classic series  it picks up right where fellowship left off and keeps the audiences attention from beginning to end  there are a few more battles this time around including a gigantic one in the final act  the two towers is a bit more violent and has somewhat of a darker tone as well  there are some new characters including walking talking trees more warriors and of course gollum the former owner of the ring turned into a creature  gollum is one of the most interesting characters in entertainment history played awesomely by andy serkis  the story sees the group split up and getting into different adventures which is fun  the great cast return to reprise their roles including elijah wood ian mckellen viggo mortensen liv tyler sean astin and orlando bloom  also getting more screen time are the hobbit duo of pippin and merry played by billy boyd and dominic monaghan  this film got nice praise as well including six oscar nominations including best picture  the lord of the rings the two towers is a hell of an entertaining ride and sets us up for the grand finale    gets alist rating of alist approved      youtube youtubecomwesida515  facebook facebookcomwestroopalist  twitter wesalist
Dec 21 2012,positive,andy serkis gollum deserves an acting award for his splendid performance totally entertained with the second installment
Dec 20 2012,positive,the two towers carries on the epic beauty thrilling adventure and astonishing excitement of the first film and adds even more action with one of the greatest battles ever captured on celluloid the story is a bit hard to follow but its worth it to be enraptured by the films unique amazing universe
Dec 20 2012,positive,for 2002    the 2nd installment in jrr tolkiens successful book series raises the bar   its a better movie than the original putting in more sympathetic characters and honest emotion  the fellowship is broken sam and frodo are on their own with the unlikely help of gollum leading them into mordor to destroy the ring aragorn legolas and gimli search for merry and pippin whom were captured by sarumans urukai gandalf who was lost in the mines of moria has returned to help the cause to end saurons dark reign we are also introduced to the men of the west the armies of rohan who linger on the brink of despair and failure  thankfully our heroes save the country frodo and sam are getting closer while battling the inner struggle to fall victim to the ring merry and pippin make friends with tree creatures called the ents and saruman rounds up his army to take over helms deep and wipe out all of mankind  theres definitely some great emotional storytellin to go with this continuing story  you feel more immersed in this mythology  the movie also makes an attempt to look at the dual personality of gollum having his two personalities go at war with one another can he live without the ring or hopelessly be attached to it  theres also a possible love triangle bewteen aragorn eyowen and arwen which increases the drama aspect of the picture  my favorite part is the climax when the armies of rohan fight for protection of their people against the forces of saruman and the ents also get a damn cool part in the fight  the movie leaves nothing unturned and really gears people up to see the next final installment of the trilogy its an amazing buildup for a grand epic finale to end the war to save middle earth from the forces of evil
Dec 20 2012,positive,the second film installment for the critically acclaimed lord of the rings and all i can say is it delivers more action drama and suspense than the first
Dec 19 2012,positive,just rewatched this post hobbit and boy would i like to see these films remastered and back on the big screen
Dec 19 2012,positive,like the first one it offers great visuals acting and entertainment action packed it never gets dull all though a lot happens and its hard to keep up love the introduction of gollum such a devine character possibly the most well written such a psycotic and likeable while at the same time hatable character
Dec 19 2012,positive,me and my family love everything about this trilogy never have i seen a movie as amazing as this even better then the first one in the trilogy
Dec 18 2012,positive,after the fellowship of the ring actually met my high expectations i became very excited to see the two towers even though it is wellknown by fans as the worst in the beloved trilogy i can say for certain that the two towers isnt quite as good as the fellowship of the ring though im not sure yet if it is the worst in the trilogy since i havent yet seen the final installment the return of the king    the two towers has a somewhat rocky start due to a surplus of exposition this plagues most of the first act and some of the second but ultimately doesnt sink the ship the first acts do start to drag at points especially during the time spent with the treebeard and the hobbits i was extremely interested in what was happening with aragorn legolas and gimli but my interest with the hobbits and the ents was waning as i heard more and more dull dialogue i understand that the audience was supposed to understand the frustration of having to hear treebeard speak so slowly but the time spent with treebeard was too frustrating and overlong to be appreciated for what it was meant to do the third act really picks up and it is clear during the action sequences that peter jackson has improved as a director they are more comprehensible and therefore more enjoyable it is still obvious that most of the action sequences are simply meant to move the plot along but the filmmakers still put in effort to make them exciting i was a bit underwhelmed by the action sequence with the ents but the battle of helms deep was wellchoreographed welldirected exciting and fun it overshadowed the forgettable fight sequence the cinematography costume design set pieces and makeup effects are excellent more impressive than that of the previous film the cast is still outstanding but the script doesnt match the quality of the acting the acting is still impressive but the surplus of exposition and bad dialogue holds the actors down the special effects range from impeccable to mediocre while the motion capture is extremely impressive    the two towers isnt quite as satisfying wellwritten or interesting as the fellowship of the ring but the cinematography direction effects and action sequences are definitely better than that of the first installment in the acclaimed trilogy im excited to see the return of the king and if the final installment is good then the lord of the rings trilogy can rank as one of the best of all time    rating 87510
Dec 17 2012,positive,the continueation of a near perfect filmseries though less better than fellowship in my opinion it still is a masterpiece on its own
Dec 16 2012,positive,though it features a harder to follow story line due to its many subplots the two towers continues the epic lord of the rings trilogy with darkness and complexity peter jackson continues to amaze me along with his equally stunning cast of stupendous actors
Dec 15 2012,positive,good moviegreat effects
Dec 15 2012,positive,second film in the series and its the one with the most itty gritty bits the battle scenes were incredible and so satisfying the editing was great so that everything seemed to be in the same time frame there are more actions in the film than the previous film which provided more selling points to everyone
Dec 15 2012,positive,mind was blown for a second time
Dec 15 2012,positive,the greatest masterpiece of all time
Dec 14 2012,positive,the perfect movie trilogy continues with the two towers which splits the rather single minded narrative of fellowship of the ring into 3 separate arcs  frodo and the ring aragorn gandalf and the battle at helms deep and merry and pippin and the ents of the forest    returning cast members elijah wood ian mckellen sean astin viggo mortensen liv tyler hugo weaving orlando bloom cate blanchette john rhysdavies billy boyd dominic monaghan and christopher lee are joined by some new perfectly cast members to the trilogy andy serkis while he appears briefly in fellowship comes to his own as the creature gollum in this film while bernard lee karl urban miranda otto and david wenham all fit their roles really well especially in my opinion wenham who is believable as the brother of sean beans boromir    some classic scenes appear in this film my two personal favourites are the scene where gollum and smeagol have the discussion with one another about whether or not to trust frodo is inspired filmmaking portraying a complex plot point regarding gollums psyche on screen very effectively also the scene towards the end of the battle for helms deep when gandalf eomer and the horsemen arrive to turn the tide of battle closely followed by the ents storming isengard evokes the spirit of old epics very effectively    another classic trip to middle earth
Dec 14 2012,positive,one of the best films of all time nuff said
Dec 13 2012,positive,epic movie with a good continuing story we meet some new allies and enemies and the same amazing cast and music
Dec 13 2012,positive,the 2 towers was a beautiful transition from the fellowship of the ring to the return of the king
Dec 13 2012,positive,even better than fellowship the two towers incorporates amazing action and spectacular storytelling the battle of helms deep for example is an epic battle scene and one of the best ive ever seen viggo mortensen plays a believable aragorn while orlando bloom plays a cool legolas we also meet gollum who brings interest and spectacular acting by andy serkis
Dec 13 2012,positive,the best of the series the team of aragorn legolas and gimli is probably one of the most badass group of characters ever hunting some mother fuckin orc
Dec 12 2012,positive,even though this is my least favorite part of the trilogy the two towers is by no means weak at all  amazing battle scenes and the various subplots rohan being my favorite add to the intensity
Dec 12 2012,positive,this movie was fricking amazing  and the battle of helms deep was awesome
Dec 12 2012,positive,awesome movie one of the best trilogies of all time
Dec 12 2012,positive,further into middle earth and closer to mordor peter jacksons second installment continues right where the first chapter left off it is essential to keep up with this movie as the members of the fellowship are split up across the lands leading to many storylines and the introduction of many new characters elijah wood once again plays frodo as he and sam attempt to complete their journey viggo mortensen excellently plays aragorn heir to the throne of gondor but it is the character of gollum that steals the show as well as trying to steal the ring glimpses of the creature were seen in the opening movie but here the audience really get to know the character through a brilliant performance from andy serkis and the help of incredible cgi the movie climaxes at the battle of helms deep with every attention to detail present as thousands of sarumens minions descend upon the fortress but the story is not over yet as gollum leads the hobbits towards mordor
Dec 11 2012,positive,another masterpiece by peter jackson onceagain the harmony of the photographic and audiorelated elements completely surprised me quite simply nothing imperfect about this film or the one before it    most justified critique i love the lord of the rings
Dec 11 2012,positive,cant get enough of this
Dec 10 2012,positive,not brilliant but acceptable
Dec 10 2012,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
Dec 9 2012,positive,a brilliantly crafted film and perfectly executed installment in the franchise classic
Dec 9 2012,neutral,its hard to write a review when youve only seen the unedited incredibly too long version of the movie so i wont even try  however its effects and action is well done
Dec 8 2012,positive,fantastic film finally saw the entire lotr trilogy  really enjoyed this film
Dec 8 2012,positive,excellent the mother of all fantasy adventures and the inspiration of a million wannabees
Dec 8 2012,positive,it may be the calm before the storm but the lord of the rings the two towers brings all that you love from middleearth in terms of acting story scope ambitious action and imaginative characters while adding new plot lines and adding more to the scene    verdict epically awesome
Dec 8 2012,positive,the pacing isnt as good as the first one but that cannot overshadow everything else in the movie
Dec 8 2012,positive,sets up for the epic conclusion of the trilogy
Dec 7 2012,positive,usually a second film in a trilogy has a tough time being better than the original especially if the first film is as epic as fellowship of the ring wasthe two towers however does just that by continuing exactly where the story of fellowship ended this story is faster paced the acting and script are still excellent and the action set pieces are much grander and monumental the two towers also has one distinct difference than fellowship and that difference is the character of gollum andy serkis was brilliant in this film as the deceiving frightening yet loveable character as we get to see one of the more complex characters in film you do not know what to expect in every scene that gollum is present in and that is why this movie has a definitive edge over its predecessor this film just like fellowship clocks in at about 3 hours long which can make it tedious at times but the loveable characters have returned the epic battle scenes are more epic and this film is by far one of the greatest sequels ever made peter jackson once again shows his attention to detail in every scene of this film and to the source material of jrr tolkiens novels as he brings the lotr trilogy to life on the big screen
Dec 7 2012,positive,a remarkable spectacle to behold
Dec 7 2012,positive,for someone who is not really into fantasy these movies are impressive they are thought through and you can see the commitment from the cast and crew
Dec 7 2012,positive,personally this is my favorite chapter of the trilogy purely on the setting up and execution of helms deep this film will rock your world with one of the most epic climaxes of all time
Dec 7 2012,positive,where is the horse and the rider where is the horn that was blowing they have passed like rain on the mountain like wind in the meadow the days have gone down in the west behind the hills into shadow how did it come to thisfrodo and sam continue on to mordor in their mission to destroy the one ring whilst their former companions make new allies and launch an assault on isengardchristopher lee  saruman the whitebrad dourif  grima wormtonguethe lord of the rings the two towers is like fellowship a triumph that any tolkien fan adventurefantasy or war enthusiast should see  jrr tolkiens novel the two towers with the help of fran walsh philippa boyens stephen sinclair and peter jacksons screenplay he brings the story to life upon the screen   director peter jackson admitted the two towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve at least in terms of narrative structure since unlike the fellowship of the ring it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax  what does it have  it has the psychotic split personality smeagolgollum brought to life with stunning visual effects it has epic battles at helms deep and three plot threads all happening simultaneouslythe two towers picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended the fellowship is broken into three separate groups all with their own problems  frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin continue their journey to mordor in order to destroy the one ring and find an unexpected guide in that items previous owner vicious creature gollum andy serkis aragorn viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom and gimli john rhysdavies reunite with the reborn gandalf ian mckellen to save the dying kingdom of rohan from sarumans christopher lee evil clutch merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd have a close encounter with the ents ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard  new cast members also join the fray and middle earth saga  the talented brad dourif bernard hill miranda otto karl urban and david wenhama new power is rising its victory is at hand this night the land will be stained with the blood of rohan march to helms deep leave none alive to warthe two towers does not follow the middle book in tolkiens epic trilogy as closely as some would imagine and does indeed take a few liberties here and there but overall this is an epic fantastical adaptation and lets face it probably among the greatest sequels in film history jackson once again successfully creates a believable yet fanciful vision of middle earth his special effects while not quite as seamless and earthy as in fellowship are nonetheless impressive and theres great magic in the cinematography set design and music the acting is also a level of magnitude above that seen in any oscar contending picture this decade each actor and actress is able to make his or her character unique and believable within the terms of the story this film probably comes the closest of any to resembling a perfect marriage between art award winning drama and blockbuster entertainmentoverall the two towers brings new favourite characters from the books to life  grima wormtongue played by brad dourif equals a parody of slimy villainy along with saruman  treebeard leader of the ents of the forest voiced by john rhysdavies also makes another lovable memorable character  i would say the most impressive newly studied and realized character would be gollum  andy serkis lends his voice his body to the creation of this layered creature  in fact the effects and artful poise owe alot to the man serkis whom effortlessly helps bring the creature gollum whom was once smeagol to life  the two towers is the middle part of one of the greatest trilogies ever realized in film  it was the hardest film to adapt to screen but peter jackson takes his best shot and effortlessly succeeds in again making an emotional and turbulent story packed with vibrant characters he succeeds in bringing life to jrr tolkiens story upon film   won 2 oscars for sound editing and visual effectsa masterpiecethe battle of helms deep is over the battle for middle earth is about to begin
Dec 7 2012,positive,while most sequels either fail to deliver be as good as the first or be better than the first the two towers is better than fellowship and ends with a stomach punch ending
Dec 7 2012,positive,unlike in fellowship two towers has to deal with the individual paths of two or three characters and does so in such a way that the viewer is not left confused or wanting more
Dec 6 2012,positive,the best of the trilogy
Dec 6 2012,positive,like empire strikes back the two towers marks a second act that is also the best
Dec 6 2012,positive,an excellent trilogy  i think this movie is a keeper especially since i own all three lol
Dec 5 2012,positive,hobbits are just short gay peoplenot that wheres anything wrong with that
Dec 5 2012,positive,hated the talking trees always hated the middle film of a trilogy always makes you wanting more
Dec 5 2012,positive,fuck frodo go aragorn legolas and gimli
Dec 5 2012,positive,my favourite in the trilogyawh takes me back to the marquee
Dec 5 2012,positive,the best of the bunch
Dec 5 2012,positive,one of my favorites
Dec 4 2012,positive,the weakest of the 3 movies
Dec 3 2012,positive,not quite as good as the first movie but very good
Dec 2 2012,positive,better than the first adventure the story is now in full flow as is the action great middle part to one of cinemas greatest trilogies 1010
Dec 2 2012,positive,another good family movie
Dec 2 2012,positive,this is my favourite of the lotr trilogy the soundtrack was amazing for this movie especially golems song classic center story of the lotr trilogy
Dec 1 2012,positive,the middle chapter of the epic historical fantasy series lord of the rings pushes the envelope of the franchise even more and creates more of the cinema history that the first chapter had started after an year of the success of the fellowship of the ring comes the two towers and well this not only surpasses the above but extends it deeper character levels more characters that we start to care about immediately  a battle which will probably hold as the best battle shown on screen of all time  the suspense  the buildup and the performances by liv tyler  viggo mortensen  ian mckellen and sean astin are breathtaking with brilliant score underlying this time with even more epic lines from howard shore and new themes the movie sounds brilliant now we come to the highlight of the movie  gollum  certainly this has got to be the most significant digital achievement till date  thanks to weta  gollum is not only one of the intricately crafted character in terms of visuals but also layers an extraordinary performance by andy serkis seriously stands out as it brings a digital creature to life and we care about this character more than anybody and the pity which plays so essential in the movie is now on the surface we literally feel sorry for him and we can see the effect the ring had on him and how everything could have been different had not the ring found him  i can go on and on about this beautiful character created by tolkien and further expressed by fran walsh and phillipa boyens but that would take pages and it still wont be enough  the costumes as usual are perfect and astonishing  in all you got to love middle earth  as how it is shown  peter jackson with his award winning cinematographer andrew lesnie continues to show middle earth with their full might the towers stands as one of the all time greats in the history of cinema and one can only expect what comes next
Dec 1 2012,positive,good movie some cool stuff the ending was really good and made up for the long movie
Nov 30 2012,positive,epic undoubtedly the best series of film ever my anticipation was always served throughout the series of these film i still remember this dialogue between frodo and sam frodo  why do we figth sam  there is some good in this world and its worth fighting for i rate this dialogue as one of the best dialogue between two ppl
Nov 30 2012,positive,gollum is the best part of this movie
Nov 27 2012,positive,love the lord of the rings movies
Nov 27 2012,positive,the two towers was way better that the fellowship of the ring in my opinion the battle of helms deep was absolutely incredible unfortunately it has the same lack of pacing as fellowship although it isnt as bad it seems as if the filmmakers well technically it was the author of the novels but not enough important characters died besides the elf that we barely knew good movie maybe great but not fantastic
Nov 27 2012,positive,just ad good if not better than the first film
Nov 27 2012,positive,the best of the trilogy
Nov 26 2012,negative,all they did was walk 
Nov 26 2012,positive,my favorite of the 3
Nov 25 2012,positive,before movies like the dark knight the avengers  the follow up return of the king this for me was the definitive form of an epic movie  just from the start i am already breathless from such an intro the story is more war  less fantasic than fellowship which works great for this part of the story  new zealand looks so amazing as middle earth that it drives you crazy to go there  the visuals effects make up are just a great  the actors bring their a game but its andy serkis as gollum who steals everybodys thunderseriously no best supporting actor nod   but the biggest  best thing about the movie is the build up  pay off for the battle at helms deep its amazing  its just a tip of the iceberg of what comes next
Nov 25 2012,positive,an imaginative sequel and possibly the best film in the series
Nov 25 2012,positive,liked a lot in the past
Nov 24 2012,positive,more action than fellowship and gollum was an amazing character in terms of performance and technical creation
Nov 23 2012,positive,i like this one a lot almost my favorite one yet rotk was my fave
Nov 23 2012,positive,the second movie introduced in the lord of the rings trilogy is nothing short of marvelous everything about this movie was fantastic in every aspect     it really added fuel to help you want to watch the next movie frodo and company continues their difficult journey making their way to save middle earth from the disaster of the very ring that possesses mens hearts into the crevices of the one mountain that can perhaps destroy the ringbut not before the ring and the dark cruel and deceitful creatures that hunt for the ring do not destroy frodo and his companions the fellowship will do everything they can to hold their own and do what they can on their destined paths to save middle earth once and for all
Nov 23 2012,positive,the best in the lotr trilogy
Nov 22 2012,positive,this one is slow and it is my least favorite i lost interest after one too many shot of the hobbits complaining there is a lot of humor here also the battle scenes are fun to watch but they are not as fun as return
Nov 21 2012,positive,although it is without some of the colorful lightness of the 1st installment this impressively holds as a solid middle chapter that finds humor in its grimness and is still eyepopping wellwritten and confidently actionbased
Nov 21 2012,positive,the second installment in peter jacksons lord of the rings is perhaps the lesser of the three but only by a slow segment involving pippin and merry and treebeard but that aside it provides more excitement more action and more fantastic landscapes than ever before the two towers is another unforgettable piece of cinema that just gets better and better
Nov 21 2012,positive,a fantastic fantasy masterpiece truly one of the greatest films ever made
Nov 19 2012,positive,arguably the weakest of the trilogy but thats not saying much still thrilling beautiful and stunning but thats lord of the rings for ya
Nov 17 2012,positive,the moral message the fantasy on a grand and epic scale the fine artwork and large scale battles the shivers that go down your spine when you see what the ring does to those who desire it such as gollum and the impact it begins to have on frodo this film is nothing short of a spectacle and the perfect adaption of one of the greatest stories ever told
Nov 16 2012,positive,again 13 of the greatest trilogy ever made gotta love peter jackson
Nov 16 2012,positive,just as magnificent as the first installment peter jackson ticks all the right boxes in the two towers given the scope of the story that they had to encapsulate in a limited amount of screen time all parties involved have done a superb job of bringing tolkiens books to life very well worth a watch or a hundred
Nov 15 2012,positive,having a phenomenal film as its predecessor peter jackson had the difficult tasks to keep andor improve the quality of the trilogy adapting the most difficult book of the trilogy and to make the variety of creatures look believable all of these needed to be done in the short span of a year so the question is did peter jackson succeed in this almost impossible challenge  after the events of the fellowship of the ring the fellowship is divided in three groups sam and frodo continue their journey to destroy the ring along the way the encounter gollum the former owner of the ring who leads them to mordor meanwhile legolas and company travel to rohan pursuing the urukhai that took merry and pippin at the end of the last film  with immensely high expectations thanks to its predecessor the two towers continues to bring greatness to the saga while all the greatness that i mention in my review of fellowship are present in the two towers the biggest addition to the story is the new characters that made this second installment more geeky than its predecessor while some are welcome additions other should had been left in the cuttingroom floor because they pretty much dont do anything and make the already slow pacing even more slow but the one character that even manages to steal the show is gollum it was the first time where the potential of cgi characters was shown and not only he looks credible but he is also an amazing character thanks to andy serkis performance the storylines of each fellowship groups have individual elements that add to the middle earth mythology which was already enormous and giving us memorableepic moments merry and pippin offer the bizarre but beautiful ents aragon and company gives the phenomenal battle of helms deep and frodo and sam give an amazing and intriguing character and a well done relationship with him making it the greatest of the three storylines but even with these fantastic additions my big problem with the pacing remains and even is more intense because this film has even more unnecessary long scenes and even though the runtime is slightly longer than the last installment it hurt my experience   the two towers may not be as exciting as fellowship of the ring but it has a more mature and essential story and still is a jawdropping fantasy adventure that leaves you wanting to see how it ends a more than worthy successor for that phenomenal first installment that leaves the door open for a epic ending
Nov 15 2012,positive,only slightly less good than the two movies its sandwiched between but still extremely strong itself
Nov 14 2012,positive,helms deepstill one of the greatest battle scenes ever shot
Nov 13 2012,positive,the second chapter of the trilogy improves upon the first with humongous battle scenes more characters and cgi gollum
Nov 11 2012,positive,how can you not love this movie
Nov 11 2012,positive,lacks the visual variety of the first chapter but i find my memory of two towers always belies the actual truth of things for this is an amazing film the is the first one with gollum properly in it helms deep and the ents i find it easy to forget all that for some reason every bit as good as the other two where it counts but its more earthy and more concerned with humans horses and dried grass  therein i think lies its biggest problem
Nov 11 2012,positive,another smash hit nothing lost on this one
Nov 11 2012,positive,loved the end battle
Nov 11 2012,positive,ok xcept i got bored during the fighting parts cuz it dragged on so long
Nov 11 2012,positive,sequel makes you want more so glad i have the third one i dont know how anyone waited a year between films action scenes acting and screenplay were amazing once again
Nov 10 2012,positive,excellent movie by peter jackson  gollum character is amazing in dis movie  excellent production designing
Nov 10 2012,positive,the action is spectacular the cg work incredible and the storytelling fabulous
Nov 9 2012,positive,like the other films in the franchise the two towers is a staggeringly ambitious accomplishment with the introductory material out of the way jackson makes room for massive action sequence after massive action sequence fitting moments for character development in the spaces between them here characters are resurrected tree people drown goblins and elves slide down stairs on shields while firing arrows at enemies but theres also quite a bit of to be said about the universal truths that come through the various storylines the importance of perseverance the small making a difference etc its impressive just how much jackson gets across about these characters and environments with small details a ripped flag pointing to the devolution of a oncegreat city etc it more than works as the middlechapter of the trilogy delivering spectacle and heart in equal measure keeping the momentum going as the story continues on into the last and best entry in the series
Nov 9 2012,positive,lord of the rings is awesome and this one is the best of the 3
Nov 9 2012,positive,the best lord of the rings film by quite a way deep emotion is blended with superb action sequences and brilliant acting it would be an understatement to call this film spectacular if anything the battle at helms deep towards the climax deserves an oscar on its own
Nov 7 2012,positive,expanding on the mounting tension of the first film two towers hits home with an absolutely rousing build and climax
Nov 6 2012,positive,this one to me was quite pointless hear me out nothing particularly happens other than gollum joining the gang but really you could skip this movie and go to the third and not miss a thing the only reason to watch this is the battle of helms deep
Nov 6 2012,positive,even more action packed middle installment to this epic quest
Nov 5 2012,positive,again i loved it but i have to say my favorite part of the movie is the credits just for the song i dont know why but its creepy and amazing
Nov 4 2012,positive,the greatest in a group of fantastic films
Nov 4 2012,positive,they are all one movie anon
Nov 3 2012,positive,equally as good as the first
Nov 3 2012,positive,do i even need to say why
Nov 3 2012,positive,a masterful continuation of the epic tale of the fellowship of the ring and the continuation of the best movie trilogy ever  all of the returning characters still amaze and bring out new depth in the story and the new characters are superbly crafted
Nov 1 2012,positive,part 2 and wonderful as well the saga continues
Nov 1 2012,positive,a film with all my favorites within the realms of a typical dungeon and dragons role playing game throw in some lovely battle scenes and frodos quest of tossing that oh so valuable ring cant go wrong
Oct 31 2012,positive,as i said i love lord of the rings
Oct 31 2012,positive,my favorite movie of all time easily the best of the three
Oct 31 2012,positive,epic in size scale quality and entertainment
Oct 30 2012,neutral,it did not develop the story or characters just merely added a chapter to what is already a repetitive story
Oct 30 2012,negative,because treebeard and faramir also arwen elves at helms deep skateboarding legolas and 43
Oct 29 2012,positive,putt me in stiches because i loved it sooooooooo much
Oct 28 2012,positive,even better than the first yet another outstanding piece of film making by peter jackson the great thing about the second installment is the way you are constantly thrown from story to story if you get bored of one fight asif that where possible there is something else going on in middle earth that will tickle you fancy if you havnt seen this you need to watch it infact stop everything and watch them all same as before 10 out of 10 these movies are historical gems    1010
Oct 28 2012,positive,the story is the best ever the movie is good
Oct 27 2012,positive,if you seen one you see them all how could you not
Oct 26 2012,positive,there are only few films that manage to adapt so well from the books like lord of the rings have done
Oct 25 2012,positive,watching this brings back movie nights with the tonic gang
Oct 23 2012,positive,this second entry into the franchise goes to the next level with plenty to talk about  the story is just as good as the first and a little more action took it to the next level
Oct 23 2012,positive,another movie about walking great story tho
Oct 22 2012,positive,ive watched it long time ago when i was just a kid at the time it was just another movie with orcs humans elves and some other creatures fighting but some months ago i watched it again it just changed when you are grown up enough you see it as one of the best trilogy ever made
Oct 22 2012,positive,nice adaptation i would have liked to have seen a little more of the rest of the story maybe a hobbit
Oct 20 2012,positive,the worst lord of the rings but that doesnt mean its bad
Oct 19 2012,positive,very good middle movie bridging the gap from the epic first movie and the great last movie of this tremendous trilogy it kind of drags in the middle but it does what its supposed to do as an in between movie the extended cut adds a lot that was left off but if you never watch that version you will be okay
Oct 19 2012,positive,bladder burtingly epic
Oct 19 2012,positive,completely avoids the difficult second album syndromemarvellous beautiful film
Oct 17 2012,positive,helms deep scene is amazing but dont remember much else think the series is extremely overrated
Oct 17 2012,positive,with the characters and plot already set the story manages to get underway faster but ultimately its ending is snubbed to make way for the final chapter
Oct 17 2012,positive,the only film that competes with the return of the king brilliant sequel and plot the longer the movie the better the extended version is 4 hours 30 min
Oct 17 2012,positive,a little off but otherwise great
Oct 15 2012,positive,very good storyline  love how this kept you going was trying my hardest to follow along
Oct 15 2012,positive,looooooong good movie but too long
Oct 13 2012,positive,the second chapter of the lord of the rings is a sight to behold it really is something that is both emotionally and critically satisfying the story continues and its awesome the pacing is pitch perfect never getting boring for a three hour film it fells like it needs more than to be cut down even the near 4 hour version feels short the film has a very good message which i wont spoil for you the acting is perfect and the helms deep battle scene is so amazing it can leave your jaw literally dropping although all the technical wizdary is amazing it is the heart of the story that truly matters its a story that will make you laugh and cry its something that will leave an impression on you for a long while this is really aragorns film and shows what he has to struggle with in following his path to kingship instead of following frodo the struggle he goes through is felt along with frodo and everyone else each one has a struggle frodo and sam having to deal with whether or not they should trust a creature gollum to lead them to mordor who by the way is played wonderfully by andy serkis merry and pippin who want to help in a war that us way too big for them but not for a certain creature they befriend aragorn and company also struggle with the coming battle the tension is amazingly raised if there is one negative aspect is that it ends and have to wait to see the finale to see hoe everything ties up then again thats the beauty of a series like this to leave you anticipating the next chapter innate great story  its all powerful stuff the strong message that i can give away is the one of hope over evil its a strong one and leaves me anxiously waiting to watch the return of the king
Oct 13 2012,positive,a slight stepup from the already pretty good tfoftr two towers spends much of its time in the world of the humanselves within middle earththis however is its main problem getting bogged down in boring characters we dont even know however its strengths are quite strong the editing between the storylines gollumsamfrodo treebeardmerrypippin aragorngimlelegolas flows smoothly the emotions are more palpable and the battle at helms deep is one for the ages a visually impressive sweeping epic that carries the middle act of the trilogy fairly nicely
Oct 12 2012,negative,dont like trilogy of lord of the ring
Oct 12 2012,positive,great movie this and the thrid one will be a tough battle to win my vote for the best lotr
Oct 12 2012,positive,like its predecessor this is a perfect fantasy film in every way this time there is more action and more suspense i was engaged from start to finish because i never found this film to be boring whatsoever this sequel is a classic in every way that it can be there are no weak points to say the least
Oct 12 2012,positive,god all lord of the rings are amazing although i think this is my most favorite
Oct 10 2012,positive,incredible movie
Oct 10 2012,positive,more development than fellowship less action than return of the king but effectively tethers the two together and leave you craving more a perfect middle to a trilogy
Oct 9 2012,positive,this was an awesome movie but i will admit perhaps not as good as the first now that i watch it from the lense i see now
Oct 8 2012,positive,perfect thats the word to use such a awe inspiring movie 55 for graphics 55 for acting 55 for length 55 overall this movie brought it and if you dont like it you probablly dont like medieval times and perfect imagination
Oct 6 2012,positive,my personal favorite out of the whole trilogy
Oct 6 2012,positive,thought the triligy was shite at the cinema however at home watching again they were great
Oct 6 2012,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers does not acheive the unique majesty of the fellowship of the ring but it might have a more memorable sequence than anything seen in the first movie the battle of helms deep sequels take two routes the empire strikes back route elevates the trilogy to new heights with a more complex story or the die hard route crafts a fun picture but ultimately acts as a retread of the first movie while overall lotr the two towers falls toward the latter it has enough character development and story progression to only slightly have it below the first movie plus the two towers builds to what will be one of the greatest war sequences in cinematic history the battle of helms deep by revolving the story around its battle masterpiece lotr the two towers avoids becoming the forgotten movie in the trilogy and successfully sets up the finale the return of the king    the two towers begins where the fellowship ends with the sundering of the fellowship the story splits into 3 parts gandalf ian mckellen did not perish from his fall in moria but has battled the balrog he fought in the fellowship and transformed into gandalf the white aragorn viggo mortensen gimli john rhysdavies and legolas orlando bloom chase the orcs that captured merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd and are returning them to saruman christopher lee who believes they have the ring their chase takes them through the maninhabited country of rohan run by king theoden bernard hill his righthand man grima wormtongue brad dourif and his niece eowyn miranda otto and nephew eomer karl urban meanwhile frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin are lost in the labyrinth of mountains they entered at the end of the fellowship to get out the receive the services of gollum andy serkis the previous ring owner who is cursed with multiple personalities and will stop at nothing to reunite with the ring however gollum has also been to mordor so frodo and sam need him to guide them to mordor so they can complete their quest    the special effects take a big jump in the two towers and not just helms deep which i will get to but on a more intimate level it is shocking to think that gollum does not exist apparently andy serkis was placed into a motion capture suit so much credit goes to serkis and the cgi for not only giving gollum realistic movements but for crafting a character with easily discernible personalities     but the piece de resistance of lotr the two towers is the 45 minute battle of helms deep where aragorn legolas gimli and theoden have to defend the people of rohan from the attacking orcs of saruman apparently the battle was mostly shot in cgi giving each of the thousands of participants a little memory to choose a fight at random making the battle sequences believeable the battle encapsulates the many aspects of a war the tension filledpreparation the eerie calm before the start of the battle explosions and individual heroism by using a panover filming approach as well as gigantic walls for the orcs to climb over the battles grandeur is elevated to shakespearean levels all credit goes to the combined efforts of the special effects art sound makeup and acting departments     the cinematography department also deserves credit for using new zealand to distinguish the various lands  where these adventures are taking place is is easy to distinguish the locations from one another rohans rolling hills the bog sam and frodo have to go through rivendells waterfalls and many other locations edoras the rohan capital is described as a hill in front of mountains which took months for the cinematographers to find the right spot the detail and specificity is not lost on the viewer and provides a stunning backdrop for the characters traversing    the acting is solid across the board serkis shines because of the parallel between his gollum and elijah woods frodo who becomes more weary and paranoid because of the rings effects with gandalf more in the background in this movie viggo mortensen gets to display more acting chops as his aragorn has to ascend to the importance of his birthright the newcomers also bring something to the table karl urban shows youthful loyalty and fire miranda otto provides a strong female character needed in the story bernard hill exudes royalty david wenham gives faramir boromirs brother selfassuredness and wisdom and brad dourif reeks of deception     as exhausted as the characters and myself were after the battle of helms deep the two towers acknowledges that even more is yet to come the two towers successfully elevates the setup from the fellowship of the ring by raising the stakes for the characters as they come closer to their fates who would think that hobbits elves dwarves and wizards could illicit such enthusiasm and emotional catharsis
Oct 6 2012,positive,awesome movie with awesome visual effects and sound it blew my mind its a must watch
Oct 5 2012,positive,without question the best middle part of a trilogy since empire strikes back this film not only continues and expands upon the promise of the first film but sets the stage masterfully for the final act the best film of the trilogy
Oct 4 2012,positive,stereotypically the middle child is the underachiever but in this instance it surpasses the expectations of a sequel
Oct 4 2012,positive,the two towers stand tall
Oct 4 2012,positive,good i liked all of them
Oct 4 2012,positive,the two towers is everything the first movie is and more it has good character development excellent visual effects and now add top notch action to the mix an epic tale that leaves all its viewers itching to watch the final chapter
Oct 4 2012,positive,slower paced but as a result more emotionally satisfying and dramatically rewarding
Oct 3 2012,positive,while not as amazing as the first one the lord of the rings the two towers has well balanced spectacular action with great emotional storytelling and the acting is as good as ever the story is getting more intense now and the battle was as fierce as ever i guess the only thing i disliked is that the story ends where it starts with samwise and frodo alone with gollum now but it doesent even really matter cause thats key to the story and itll be interesting to see what they do from here spectacular and full of great special effects costume and makeup to ensure that the sorcery atmosphere has been set up really well
Oct 3 2012,positive,though it is at the very most only similar to the book this movie dared to stray from the path written by jrr tolkien and benefited greatly from it  great movie
Oct 2 2012,positive,same as here been pretty good busy movie ppl has cool
Oct 1 2012,positive,the best of the trilogy imo
Sep 30 2012,positive,not better than the other two but it is really good
Sep 28 2012,positive,an epic on all proportions it doesnt get much better than this action romance and stroy combine a must see movie
Sep 27 2012,positive,divides its time between amazing special effects and heartfelt and emotional storytelling to incredible effect
Sep 27 2012,positive,too good for wordsexpect these ones 
Sep 26 2012,positive,great movie amazingly well done trilogy
Sep 25 2012,positive,we tread slightly less interesting ground once we enter rohan but the film overall is still as wildly ambitious and epic as the first installment
Sep 25 2012,positive,another of my favorites
Sep 24 2012,positive,absolutely fantastic one of the best movies ever and has one of the best battle sequences ever definitely my favourite of the lord of the rings trilogy
Sep 23 2012,positive,the second masterpiece of the best trilogy of all time
Sep 23 2012,positive,although i have seen all of the lord of the rings films before i had never read the books and so recently i decided to read them i then thought it might be fun to watch each film as i complete each part of the story and so having finished âthe two towersâtmâ and read the first eighty or so pages or so of âthe return of the kingâtm we come to the second of peter jacksonâtms films for the record i have to say that i watched the extended version available on dvd and blu ray    note there may be spoilers in here if you havenâtmt seen the âfellowship of the ringâtm please skip this paragraph    with the fellowship broken at the end of the first film we follow the fortunes of the remaining adventurers frodo and sam are to make their own way to mordor but not without a little help from an unexpected quarter gollum has been following them and now he finds himself aiding them on their quest but can he be trusted sam certainly thinks not meanwhile aragorn legolas and gimli are on the trail of merry and pippin who had been taken by a band of orcs towards isengard the stronghold of the wizard saruman a follower of sauron the orcs had been attacked by a band of horsemen from rohan but the hobbits escaped into the forest here they meet an ent called treebeard and he takes them to a gathering of all the ents in the wood following them the other three are surprised to be met by gandalf who they thought had perished in the mines of moria from here on it begins to get a little complicated but needless say there are battles to be won as the war for middle earth hots up    peter jackson and his team did not disappoint again another epic film with tremendous scope i also have to mention again the original music by howard shore another great score with some really great themes as far as performances go well everybody did a great job but those that stood out for me were elijah wood as frodo ian mckellen as gandalf sean astin as samwise âsamâtm gamgee viggo mortensen as aragorn and bernard hill as theodin king of rohan also worthy of note were billy boyd as pippin dominic monaghan as merry orlando bloom as legolas john rhysdavies as gimlivoice of treebeard liv tyler as arwen miranda otto as eowyn david wenham as faramir  christopher lee as saruman karl urban as eomer and not forgetting andy serkis as gollumsmeagol    having recently read the book i did find that this departed from jrrtolkienâtms original to a much larger extent than the first instalment âthe fellowship of the ringâtm much more is put into establishing background and motive than in the text and to a large extent it works pretty well it does however distract from the task at hand in places and i did find it a little heavy going here and there i canâtmt on the other hand fault the production it is all brilliantly brought together and it looks fantastic the battle scenes are immense and to be admired itâtms certainly one despite a couple of misgivings i still rate very highly    steelmonsterâtms verdict highly recommended    my score 9110
Sep 22 2012,positive,it was a good story and it picks up right where the last one ends its long but still very good
Sep 22 2012,positive,enjoyed it even more the second time watching it
Sep 22 2012,positive,i stil like the last movie best it is my all time favorite of the three but this is one i also really liked before the third came out it has alot of funny parts in it with gimili and legolas those are the best partswell and the march of the ents but i still really like it
Sep 21 2012,positive,following the beautiful beginning to the trilogy peter jackson delivers a darker and a more badass sequel
Sep 20 2012,positive,wellthe balrog sequence was cool
Sep 20 2012,positive,the two towers builds on the story of its predecessor and follows in its footsteps with the same elements that made the first one great with the addition of gollum and the masterfully constructed battle scenes it becomes even more enjoyable and compelling
Sep 19 2012,positive,the battle for helms deep remains one of the great fantasy battles ever seen on screen
Sep 19 2012,positive,i guess i was wrong the two towers is as great as the fist one
Sep 18 2012,positive,you need to watch the first and last film of this trilogy before and after watching this one if you know how to create a 3hour  plus taht starts and end at the middle of the entire story but doing it with poise which this film did then you are a good director kudos to peter jackson
Sep 17 2012,positive,excellent 2nd installment of the seriesnot as good as the 1st and 3rd but fantastic all the same amazing special effects def a must see but obviously watch the fellowship of the ring first
Sep 16 2012,positive,of course you have to see this the best battles of the trilogy and treebeard
Sep 16 2012,positive,watch this movie over and overlol
Sep 16 2012,positive,the middle chapter of any 3 part story is usually the hardest to execute you have no beginning and no end its done as well as you could imagine in this film
Sep 15 2012,positive,my favorite rings movie lots of action great story linejust epic
Sep 13 2012,positive,the second episode of which is arguably the best film trilogy ever made epica continues reigning over middle earth as the heroes go further on the journey the climax now approaches and we can just be thrilled and fascinated while we wait for a conclusion
Sep 13 2012,positive,just when i thought it was impossible to even play in the same standard as the prequel this movie became the best thing in my 2002
Sep 13 2012,positive,surprisingly this sequel is better than the first due to excellent new characters and superb battles and action along with an enjoyable story and a good script
Sep 13 2012,positive,as was hinted in the previous film jackson has taken his own direction with tolkiens fantasy he has made the fate of the character aragorn the primary focus of the movie rather than frodos quest and there is certainly no whimsy in this film as was still faintly present in the last the two towers has lost some of the darker depth of the last film on the other hand a bit more psychological depth has been introduced via the character gollum but has further embraced its epic feel also the two towers contained quite possibly the greatest mass battle scene ever filmed
Sep 12 2012,positive,the lord rules  still trying to have a lord of the rings day sit down watch them all in one day
Sep 12 2012,positive,it is a lesser sequel of course as most part 2s are out of trilogies but this movie still does not disappoint with some fantastic special effects and storylines this is a miraculous acheivement
Sep 12 2012,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen  on the weekends sometimes my husband and i will watch the whole trilogy straight through
Sep 11 2012,positive,great fun to watch with great story and atmospher
Sep 10 2012,positive,it was good but once again as is common did not beat the first
Sep 10 2012,positive,admirable direction and performances with the great use of cgi make it one of my favourites
Sep 9 2012,positive,undoubtedly the best of the three beautiful touching tragic and visually spectacular the lord of the rings the two towers is a masterpiece of the genre and cinema in general
Sep 8 2012,positive,anything that can make orlando bloom look good in a blonde wig is alright with me
Sep 7 2012,negative,even the trees walked in that movie
Sep 7 2012,positive,i want to give it five stars but i am going to reserve it for return of the king amazing movie first half starts slow but the battle of rohan is amazing and the march of treants isnt too shabby
Sep 7 2012,positive,after the slightly disappointing ending to the fellowship of the ring  it felt less like an ending and more like an arbitrary decision to cut the film off  the two towers continues the lord of the rings story and brings along with it the same sort of problem its the middle film in a threepart series and as a result it has no real beginning or ending part nor does it conclude the vast majority of the arcs that it begins to establish it leaves you feeling disappointed not because its bad but because it feels like its leading up to something that youll dont get to see not yet at least    there are three distinct plots this time around the most important is the one involving frodo and sam elijah wood and sean astin the hobbits tasked with carrying the one ring to mordor in order to destroy is they manage to convince gollum motion captured and voice work done by andy serkis the creature who was consumed by the ring for 500 years and who yearns for it every day to act as their guide to lead them into the depths and spend the entirety of the film walking by mountains and through bogs    the second story involves two other hobbits merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd who begin the film under orc control but manage to escape early on they head into a forest and spend pretty much the rest of the film hanging out with the ents a group of walking talking trees the hobbits were initially being traced by the three other members of the fellowship aragorn viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom and gimli john rhysdavies but they end up going on a far different path    they wind up heading to rohan a region ruled by men in order to aid them in their fight against the orc armies they meet up with théoden bernard hill rohans king and eventually team up with him which will eventually lead to a climactic seemingly hourlong battle involving men elves and orcs which concludes our film that battle is most certainly the films highlight as before that mots of it consists of dialogue and people riding on horseback from one gorgeous location to another    its all setup with only minimal payout most of the character and story arcs dont conclude in this film leaving us wanting more this is a problem with the book as well but its unfortunate that it happens here we bide our time for far too long as the ring has to progress a certain distance before we can actually do anything of importance most of what happens here is leading up to the next film or to the battle of helms deep that hourlong war scene i mentioned earlier    speaking of our climactic battle its very exciting and is definitely worth the long time it takes to get to it if you wanted to see a huge battle involving thousands of orcs and hundreds of humans this is the one you need to watch the death toll is large the action is fresh and exciting and theres enough humor injected into it to make it not as depraved as seeing hundreds of people die could be each of the characters involved gets a chance to shine and its the most exciting thing to happen in the series thus far    a few new characters are introduced this time around the first of which ive already mentioned théoden is here for about half the film beginning our story under sarumans christopher lee control éomer karl urban théodens nephew and éowyn miranda otto his niece play fairly large roles as well theres also faramir david wenham who shows up in the latter portion in frodos storyline only faramirs story reaches a point where i was happy with it    what we learn in the two towers is that the film is no longer about a hobbits quest to take the ring to mordor instead its about turning aragorn into an action star i know that its more about him finally accepting his destiny as isildurs heir and more or less becoming who he should have been in the first place but this film barely touches on that he becomes the star gets the most exciting setpieces and is basically there just to kick all kinds of tail the hobbits are all more secondary characters and their stories lack the energy of aragorns this time around at least    the film still looks great and despite all the meandering is constantly entertaining the worlds fate is at stake and while each action might not directly impact it you watch to see what will eventually matter these are all rich characters that are wellacted so if you get to see a lot of them there isnt much of a problem i would have preferred a bit more action but considering thats not what the book was like im not going to complain much    the lord of the rings the two towers is still a very enjoyable film although its not as good as its predecessor in large part because it feels like it doesnt go anywhere it begins in the middle and ends in the middle with a lot of talk that leads to nothing the helms deep battle is magnificent and ill watch these characters for hours on end but i would have liked for a bit more to happen it does make you want to see the third film right away though
Sep 5 2012,positive,this was my favorite movie of the three it was upbeat and past paced but also gave great depth to all the characters that allowed the third movie to have such a power impact on the viewers
Sep 5 2012,positive,the road goes ever on and on
Sep 4 2012,positive,plot 55  tripolar drawnout progresses smoothly and never becomes boring    characters 55  endearing developed    acting 45  very appropriate    visuals 55  spacial breathtaking    music 55  masterfully fitted
Sep 4 2012,positive,it worth a bag fresh shining field of tomatoes
Sep 3 2012,positive,my personal favourite of the three films i love the ents and rohan my recommendation however is to be sure to watch the film in the extended version i think it makes a difference on how good it is based on what they had cut out with the extended it adds a lot especially scenes with the ents
Sep 3 2012,positive,always played at dinner time when the kids were over for the weekends big battle scenes
Sep 2 2012,positive,the best movie ever
Sep 2 2012,positive,the two towers carries over much of what made the first film fantastica sense of grand epic scale however the plot can be muddling to the uninitiated and is far less accessible to those unacquainted with the source material than its predecessor
Sep 1 2012,positive,really awesome but the ending was weak
Aug 31 2012,positive,the lord of the rings is my favorite movie it shows how different racists can all come as one and how no matter how small you are you can change the chores of the future this is prob my favorite out of the 3 mostly because shadowfex oh my if had a horse like that id be soo happy
Aug 31 2012,positive,one of the best sequels ever made you dont see many good sequels in the movie business
Aug 31 2012,negative,tom watches this movie way too much im sick of it
Aug 30 2012,positive,greatest english folkloric tale with one of the greatest directors alive nuph said
Aug 30 2012,positive,the action was a lot better than the first the plot didnt fulfil the purpose of destroying the ring  perhaps i need to watch number 3
Aug 29 2012,positive,part two of the best trilogy ever
Aug 29 2012,positive,the best scenes of the trilogy with the best action as well as character development and story purely put together and perfected
Aug 28 2012,positive,the two towers then is the greatest blockbuster ever made without either a beginning or an end a feisty beast with a hollow ring in its bones
Aug 28 2012,positive,the better of the three extended editions featuring a fantastic origin scene including boromirs preone ring phase that explores many characters at once boromir from fotr faramir from tt and denethor featured in rotk there are very few moments in the film where you would question its intentions
Aug 28 2012,positive,peter jackson is a genius in all of the movies of this trilogy and im expecting big things from the hobbit this chapter of the trilogy is my favorite because it balanced story telling with orc killing and did both very very well
Aug 28 2012,positive,i used to think this one was the best of the trilogy but after watching all three together i find this movie quite different its still a great movie and i watched the 4 hour directors cut but it doesnt hold together as well as fellowship after several watches and i am nitpicking here but i feel sauron  saruman arent really taken advantage of and we lose the mind of the evil force that is coming up against the people of rohan instead we are just left with the masses of the enemy but no real emotional tie to the conflict just cool action scenes and amazing cinematography and of course i cant forget the costumes  make up seriously amazing work on these movies the lord of the rings is what epic is all about
Aug 28 2012,positive,fantasticthrilling great movie
Aug 27 2012,positive,another masterpiece great acting good action sequences makes this a contender for best picture
Aug 27 2012,positive,the amazing adventure continues and is enjoyable every minute
Aug 26 2012,positive,the journey continues in part 2 of jacksons masterpiece
Aug 26 2012,positive,quite different from the book in a number of scenes but jackson has turned it into a wonderful movie
Aug 26 2012,positive,probably the worst of the 3 but still amazing
Aug 26 2012,positive,best one out of the trilogy stunning in all of its aspects
Aug 26 2012,positive,usually the first movie is the best the second one is ok and the third or sucks nut i loved every single one i dont know if the second of third one is my favorite
Aug 26 2012,positive,it has a great story but its very complicated and any viewers that didnt read the book will get confused by the amount of characters and locations they need to remember for it to all make sense the effects and acting is great but there isnt much emotion and real attachment to any of the characters this one does have much better direction during the action but jackson still feels the need to get incredibly close to peoples faces when the action has stopped also none of the characters are particularly likable and make very frustratingly dumb decisions but it has some much needed action scenes also there are a few plot holes  many of the simplest questions arent answered
Aug 26 2012,positive,all of these are good
Aug 25 2012,positive,worse than the first film pretty boring but the ending was great
Aug 25 2012,positive,perfect middle chapter
Aug 25 2012,positive,awesome movie love it so much
Aug 25 2012,positive,better than the first film in the sense of violence and pace of the entire story
Aug 24 2012,positive,very solid film and defiantly better then the first one
Aug 24 2012,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is my favorite movie out of the trilogy
Aug 24 2012,positive,pretty much everything the first movie has to offer and more including andy serkis doing an excellent job as gollum  jackson really nailed the details in this movie
Aug 23 2012,positive,great movie loved it just as much as the previous
Aug 23 2012,positive,awesome the battle of helms deep is epic
Aug 23 2012,positive,it was going to be tough to create a sequel that was on par with the fellowship but peter jackson stepped up to the plate and hit a home run he created a sequel that many can agree is the best of the trilogy the two towers certainly has its moments and its adaptive story certainly lives up to expectations
Aug 23 2012,positive,my personal favorite of the series
Aug 22 2012,positive,long but worth the time
Aug 22 2012,positive,great special effects and a great battle sequence
Aug 22 2012,positive,excellent movierecommend watching the extended one
Aug 21 2012,positive,my favourite of the three  plus how awesome did they make legolas  what i love about this film is that so many things go on in the background you almost forget to watch the people in focus
Aug 21 2012,positive,more great story and more great action
Aug 21 2012,negative,after a strong if somewhat wobbly first film the lord of the rings trilogy goes significantly downhill with its inferior sequel  the two towers has all the strengths and flaws of the first though the strengths have diminished slightly and the flaws have an even bigger presence    the two towers is a continuation of the original film in which a young hobbit named frodo baggins as well as some friends attempt to destroy a mystical ring though dark forces oppose them    at the end of the first film the main characters are split up which unfortunately makes the film extremely complicated  various plot lines are juggled and if the audience doesnt keep track of them all things can get extremely confusing    one plot line involving frodo and sam attempting to destroy the ring on their own meet the gollum  the gollum is truly the most interesting character in the lord of the rings trilogy  his conflicted nature splits him into two personalities one who wants the ring and will kill to get it the other that truly cares about frodo and sam      the most uninteresting plot line involves pippin and merry being taken by walking trees and forced to donothing  we scarcely ever see the duo and when we do its often dull  the primary source of comic relief in the first film is gone making the two towers especially hard to watch    theres less action and more talking  the length has actually been increased by a quarter hour which makes the film even more tedious than the original  even the dramatic battle at the end of epic scale is little compensation as it doesnt feel very exciting    at times it feels like the two towers is repeating itself over and over again  you can count on the fact that every hour or so someone almost dies only to be saved an arrow to the offenders head  its the primary source of escape in this film    the acting at the minimum has not been hurt  elijah wood ian mckellen and the rest of the cast are as strong as ever  christopher lees role however is significantly smaller which is unfortunate    special effects also have not been affected in a negative way and they are just as grand and marvelous as ever    the score by howard shore feels a bit weaker than that of the original  the main theme is used less frequently and the usage of lighter pieces are almost completely gone due to the films darker nature  its still a good score but its weaker than its predecessors    dull to the point of hair pulling the two towers fails to entertain  even with the addition of gollum the two towers is boring beyond belief and the action scenes are minimal  with little to excite viewers its a marvel that this tedious sequel actually has a positive reputation

Aug 21 2012,positive,a stunning achievement powered by spectacular imagery and massive scale and only slightly short of its predecessor in terms of storytelling and emotional depth
Aug 21 2012,neutral,was a good middle movie just the only thing i didnt like was that it was just a middle movie so wasnt really a purpose but to get to the end
Aug 21 2012,positive,i have seen all lor moviesai absolutely love them all
Aug 21 2012,positive,it seems slow however it still amazes me great storytelling
Aug 20 2012,positive,its better than the first one for sure the action is much better still a lot of battles but it seems to amble around less i dont really care for them that much but i admire this one
Aug 20 2012,positive,just as good as the first    b
Aug 20 2012,positive,this was an awesome trilogy
Aug 20 2012,positive,the second chapter of the epic tale of lord of the rings is just as incredible as the first in this we see the story and the characters go into much darker places i didnt even think that was possible after all that happened in fellowship but i was sorely wrong the fellowship is broken there are characters scattered all over middleearth and everything just seems hopeless i loved the way that peter jackson conveyed the feeling of despair in each character at some point or another in the film grade a
Aug 20 2012,positive,i have the collectionsvery good movie
Aug 18 2012,positive,the role of the a second film in a trilogy is often overlooked but is probably the most important the first film must introduce the adventure to audiences and the third must conclude it the role of the second film therefore is to simaltaneously build on the first film and prepare viewers for the third but if this was all a second film did it would be a dreadful bore and thats exactly where the two towers is so successful its mesmerizing and if the third film didnt exist i would call the battle at the end of this film the greatest in cinema history the two towers is brilliant and perfect in every way tying the first and third together with grace power and epic thrills
Aug 17 2012,positive,it was unexpected but jackson has managed a better sequal perfectly capturing everything that makes a great movie
Aug 17 2012,positive,the next chapter in the lotr trilogy doesnt disappoint especially with its epic intense storytelling and directing
Aug 17 2012,negative,cant get into these
Aug 16 2012,positive,yes the best movie ever made
Aug 16 2012,positive,in my opinion the best movie of the trilogy too much to explainno words to describe maybe phenomenal or great or ad
Aug 15 2012,positive,sucks you in and wont let you go till the end great epic battle scenes and a great story
Aug 15 2012,positive,such a great movie the trilogy is such an epic trilogy that really should be watched back to back its just filled with so many emotional scenes deep character development and so much attention to detail  the extended edition adds a lot of depth to faramir showing flashbacks that emphasize his fathers favoratism towards boramir it really provides reason for faramirs actions and we understand what he wants but think of him as so much more of a hero when he doesnt take the ring and ultimately lets frodo sam and gollum go he really is my favorite character although overall this is not my favorite of the three the first one is but i can agree it is a great movie and a solid 10 out of 10 there is no reason at all for it to get any less is there
Aug 15 2012,positive,lord of the rings trilogy beats all other movies the amount of work and graphics used are incredible acting is okay storyline beyond awesome
Aug 15 2012,positive,i have found only one flaw with this film when the characters stab at each other u can blatantly see that it was under the armpit this happens in all 3 but apart from that very minor flaw it is a fantastic movie and did jrr tolkiens best seller proud
Aug 14 2012,positive,a fantastic second chapter in this epic trilogy just like the first film it succeeds at giving you emotional depth delivering memorable battle sequences and it gets you more than excited to watch the final chapter what i said about the fellowship of the ring applies here on the two towers
Aug 14 2012,positive,love this series jut puttin that out there
Aug 14 2012,positive,as visually stunning as the first installment and a great continuation of the trilogy
Aug 13 2012,negative,quite possibly the worst movie ive ever seen if judging a movie on standalone merit  those who liked the movie tended to have read the books taking pressure off the director to actually capture what was needed into the movie  this director completely failed to introduce character personalities leaving a viewer who has not read the books disengaged from the characters  and wishing they could get their money back for three full hours that they wont get back  no excuse for cut corners like that especially for a three hour movie
Aug 13 2012,positive,another good addition to the trilogy
Aug 13 2012,positive,yeah a classic now but long winded
Aug 11 2012,positive,my personal favorite of the trilogy
Aug 11 2012,positive,i did as advised by my friends watched the marathon run of the series all the 3 parts in one go least i forget who is watthere is like a plethora of characters  nothing much to say about the series but i reiterate this series is worth watching once cant do that again
Aug 11 2012,positive,the trilogy continues with the felling of bigger action based on an epic battle all taken at the next level
Aug 11 2012,positive,the two towers has a lot more action than the first and jackson and company do a superb job of weaving the three different character storylines together as a film it does what any great middle movie should do as it alone could stand as a great movie but it also connects the fellowship and the return seamlessly
Aug 9 2012,positive,really really long but i like the ghost guys
Aug 8 2012,positive,the perfect tlor movie or any magical movie of all time
Aug 8 2012,positive,the second in the trilogy and possibly the best great battle scenes at the end and really sets you up for the final chapter
Aug 6 2012,positive,helms deep is still my favorite battle scene ever
Aug 6 2012,positive,a little boring but at the same time very good
Aug 6 2012,positive,masterfully done especially the action scenes and the score the cast develops the story with precision
Aug 5 2012,positive,pour ma part je trouve que ces le meilleur des  the lord of the rings
Aug 5 2012,positive,the weakest entry in the lord of the rings trilogy is still epic in every sense of the word  while the first film focused more on the majestic fantasy of middle earth two towers shifts that focus toward long drawnout battle scenes  these are no ordinary battle scenes either  in fact i have never seen another film or film series that captures warfare on such a largescale  the result is thrilling and the endless waves of combat never really wears out its welcome  while the breaking of the fellowship at the end of the first picture was necessary it makes the plot somewhat disorienting as the story constantly shifts between the separated parties  i have also never been a big fan of gollum and his role in this film is a bit ambiguous  the true importance of the character isnt truly fleshed out until the final film  nonetheless two towers is everything one would hope for and serves as an excellent continuation of the trilogy
Aug 5 2012,positive,few can dispute the sheer magical epicness of the lord of the rings trilogy the two towers is a much darker and grim film in comparison to the others though evil is fully explored here peter jacksons genius is fully realised in this trilogy which has to be one of the best of all time
Aug 5 2012,positive,best trilogy of all time only batman could challenge it
Aug 5 2012,positive,this second outing proves that being smack in the middle of trilogy can be one of the best places to be with established characters and more surprises to come you finish this movie great with the knowledge that there is still more to come exciting spirited and moving the two towers is the prime peice amidst an already great trilogy extended edition has plenty to bite into and with a world so excetionally painted the huge running time needs no mercy from an audience who will only want to see more brilliant
Aug 4 2012,positive,the second film delivers the same beautiful cinematography as the first film and continues to build the amazing world of tolkein
Aug 4 2012,positive,my review 910  date 682010  slow in parts  syd loved it though    my review 910  date 12222003  i watched the extended edition dvd i thought the additional scenes were good and added to the movie i still didnt care for the parts that strayed from the book    my review 910  date 12312002  the two towers was a great movie gollum was absolutely incredible it was hard to believe he was cgi the gollum versus smeagol scene was very well done i didnt care for some of the deviations from the book but they werent too much of a distraction i cant wait for the extended edition dvd im sure it will add a lot to the story making it even better i cant wait to see more of the ents

Aug 3 2012,positive,the epic lord of the rings trilogy continues in the two towers
Aug 3 2012,positive,more political than the first yet essential to the story stick around for the battle of helms deep its incredible
Aug 2 2012,positive,while the changes are justified especially if you watch the special features explanation on the extended cut my first viewing was quite disheartening in seeing how much was changed from the book after realizing that many of the changes were rational if not even necessary in some places it grew on me
Aug 2 2012,positive,the best of the trilogy in my opinion
Jul 31 2012,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers  the second installment of the trilogy that is near perfection    plot  a continuation where fellowship left off the plot has just as much depth and just as good of screenplay as well as the real introduction of one of the most interesting characters in middle earth gollum the opening pulls you in quickly and gets you interested however you interest slightly dwindles as it drags on for the first half after the first half is over though things pick up at an accelerating pace until you reach the climatic end leaving you begging for more yes it is still a lengthy film but unless you have severe addor a child you will never catch yourself bored at the slightest the ending really does give you chills as well not even just the first time but nearly every time you watch it 9710    characters and performances  the cast is near the same despite the introduction of couple new characters and all of them do just as good of a job if not a better job than before the characters all have some great development and you can really see the impact the ring has on frodo for carrying it not just in the lines but the entire way elijah wood makes the character a near perfect cast as was before with no flaws in the performances as well as some great development 1010    soundtrack and visuals  the visuals are a good step above fellowship and the soundtrack continues to amaze and help set the mood the battle scenes are improved tremendously from already great battle scenes there really arent that many battle scenes that can match those in two towers that arent in return of the king or fellowship of the ring as was before near perfection here again 1010    overall  the second installment of the epic that matches the quality of fellowship and although has a section where it feels a bit draggy has a great story and great development the movie will pull you in at the start and keep you interested and on the edge of your seat to the very end despite the length another movie installment that does justice to the masterpiece of the lord of the rings 1010
Jul 31 2012,positive,treebeard that dude is awesome
Jul 31 2012,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers surpasses the magic of the first film that leaves the audiences keen for the concluding part
Jul 30 2012,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers
Jul 29 2012,positive,unreal jaw dropping visual effects and effort put in by peter jackson this is the gift of time and dedication
Jul 29 2012,negative,those fuckin hobbit movies were boring as hell all it was was a bunch of people walking three movies of people walking to a fucking volcano  i think this quote from clerks ii expresses my feelings about all three of these crappy movies
Jul 29 2012,positive,a grand continuation of the lord of the rings trilogy the two towers impressively manages to top the first in spectacle and thrills
Jul 28 2012,positive,i think of the trilogy as one big movie so it is really hard to rate each movie by itself this is an amazing movie one of the greatest stories ever told the two towers and the other lord of the rings movies hold a valuable place in my heart and always will
Jul 28 2012,positive,the second in a unforgettable trilogy
Jul 28 2012,positive,all though to some people this would seem a childrens movie it is beautifully played by every actor
Jul 27 2012,positive,the best movie ever
Jul 26 2012,positive,the sheer brilliance of two towers can be summarized in 5 words  the battle at helms deep
Jul 26 2012,positive,the continuation of a true epic
Jul 26 2012,positive,the film draws you in and never lets you down as it delivers more action and more complexity than the first one it is a brilliant lead into the finale the fantastic thing about the film is that though it is of the fantasy genre we feel close to these characters and actually care about their situation its surprising that despite the use of cgi work nothing seems fake everything is tangible and raw
Jul 25 2012,negative,i love the tale and the movie
Jul 25 2012,positive,the two towers is not only part of the greatest fantasy epic but it also manages to improve on the first movie the stakes are higher and things have just gotten more epic the acting music and cinematography is superb even by todays ever improving standards
Jul 25 2012,positive,i watch the movies times and times again it really never gets boring even though i know every little details of it this episode is probably the best in the trilogy peter jackson is the man of epic movies
Jul 25 2012,positive,a dense and amazing adventure through a whimsically imagined universe that will not only get your blood pumping and your adrenaline flowing but will also appeal to the more emotional side of you as well you cant help but just gasp in awe as good vs evil fights for middle earth if there was a word to describe this or any of the other lots it would be breathtaking
Jul 24 2012,positive,lotr one of my favorite series
Jul 24 2012,positive,another smashing hit coming from peter jackson not at all worse than its predecessor still a thing of beauty with a plot that gives this adventuredriven film a huge kick
Jul 24 2012,positive,i dream of having a battle all night for a fortress against invading hordes
Jul 23 2012,positive,the lord of the rings is the lord of the films
Jul 23 2012,positive,the second movie in the rings trilogy  a absolute epic
Jul 23 2012,positive,a sequel that extends the grand scale of the first without diluting its spirit
Jul 23 2012,positive,continuing frodos quest this is one of the few sequels that can rival its predecessor
Jul 23 2012,positive,and yet still not as good as the book
Jul 22 2012,positive,my favorite of this trilogy it has from the first and amplifies it its more action and less adventure but it makes up for it with more perfect casting and gollum it also has one of the best action scenes ever put to film battle of helms deep and just perfect storytelling
Jul 21 2012,positive,better than its predecessor but obviously not as good its successor the two towers had a good mix of every that the trilogy encompasses
Jul 21 2012,positive,my personal favorite of lord of the rings movies the two towers as expected delivers both visually and emotionally however what sets it apart is the pure entertainment value that exceeds its predecessor and successor
Jul 21 2012,positive,really good trilogy this isnt as good as the others but still top notch christopher lee is immense
Jul 20 2012,positive,if  youve not seen this film your a muppet
Jul 20 2012,positive,the two towers perfectly expands the emotional depth and scale of the series
Jul 20 2012,positive,theres a reason people love this mythology the wonderful story continues
Jul 19 2012,positive,part of the best trilogy ever
Jul 19 2012,positive,equally as good as the first installment and equally as underachieving it has two major action sequences and being a three hour movie that means there is loads of dialogue and exposition i have no problem with long periods of talking 12 angry men might just be my favorite movie of all time but the dialogue isnt anything super special and nothing much really happens in between the two battle sequences how can nothing really happen in a movie this long well the running time is divided between 4 different story lines so none of the story arcs really have time to advance very far the battle sequences are enjoyable as well as all the production values throughout the film and it does manage to set up the final movie very well
Jul 19 2012,positive,yep this was excellent too  the question asked back then was when it came to this film was how can the next and final one be better than this
Jul 19 2012,positive,it is just perfect theres no use explaining why it just is
Jul 17 2012,positive,theres a lot of action and its pretty easy to keep watching despite the fact that its 3 hours long
Jul 17 2012,positive,best movie ever classic for epic fantasy lovers
Jul 17 2012,positive,cant remmeber if i seen this one or not lol
Jul 17 2012,positive,its lotr it was extremely well done
Jul 17 2012,positive,the more this trilogy progresses the better these movies are the battle of helms deep is brillant
Jul 17 2012,positive,the perfect trilogy continues with this second part of peter jacksons amazing storyline the two towers is has the most drawn out talking but is made up by the spectacular battles that are taken place the two towers draws the fellowship of the ring to the return of the king in a way that is something not many other trilogys could do again if you havent seen this movie go see it a must see
Jul 17 2012,positive,personally its my favorite lord of the rings movie
Jul 17 2012,positive,favorite movies ever
Jul 16 2012,positive,not as good as the others but a necessary step in the trilogy the battle at helms deep is awesome again the extended is better
Jul 16 2012,positive,the two towers is said to be the best out of the trilogy personally i disagree but its still excellent in every way
Jul 16 2012,positive,even better than the first picks up and multiplies all the drama from the first
Jul 15 2012,positive,the two towers succeeds where the fellowship of the ring failed it is longer but this is less evident than in the first there are epic battle scenes beautiful set pieces humor and well lets just say that the battle of helms deep was probably one of the best action scenes ive ever seen just beautifully done and amazing you should watch it especially the extended editions the extended editions are longer but possess way more action a few deleted scenes and documentaries
Jul 15 2012,positive,the lord of the rings trilogy slows down a bit in the middle just like the books the two towers is more than necessary its vital  i enjoy it
Jul 15 2012,positive,slightly lacked in tension and drama i felt compared to the first of the trilogy but thats not forgetting that tolkiens intention with two towers is to portray his vision of how ww1 would look like if a invading force occupied a land within middle earth his vision of battlefields became what we know as the battle for helmgard
Jul 15 2012,positive,the least of the three but it is beyond crticism  it gets us from point a to point c and we want to go on the journey
Jul 15 2012,positive,this was pretty good alittle confusing if you dont watch all of them
Jul 14 2012,positive,peter jacksons best work
Jul 13 2012,positive,an emotional and action filmed 2nd part to the trilogy the film matches the power of the original and sets up the final movie perfectly
Jul 13 2012,positive,i love the whole trilogy but this one has to be my favorite while fellowship had to handle all that exposition and return had to differentiate long stretchedout of battle scenes towers is a perfect balance of plot and character and talking and acting   there are a million pieces of genius but the one thing that deserves mention the most and needs it least is andy serkis as gollum he is spectacular and the lovely thing about it is that you probably already know he isnt underrated and he could hardly be overrated  oh yeah and one regret and this is so trivial but ill say it anyway is that it stated so bluntly which the two towers in the title actually were a point i always liked about the book was that one could find quite a few fortress pairs to fit and it was all a matter of opinion in the end but to just say it outright like that not even suggest ah never mind its not significant
Jul 13 2012,positive,there are no words for how utterly perfect this movie is no words
Jul 13 2012,positive,3 stars only for special effects
Jul 12 2012,positive,a great continuation of one of the best film trilogies of all time
Jul 11 2012,positive,if u havent watched tlotr then you havent got a good movie taste its a must watch
Jul 11 2012,positive,lord of the rings continues in its full glory
Jul 10 2012,positive,better than the first this one starts out with a bang and never lets upthe two towers is my favorite of the 3the battles are epic in scope and brutal a must see
Jul 10 2012,positive,wonderfully awesome and amazing
Jul 10 2012,positive,the overlooked middle child still quite good but not as worthy of praise as its siblings
Jul 10 2012,positive,the epic middle chapter of the greatest trilogy ever filmed
Jul 9 2012,positive,this movie continues the lotr trilogy but manages to keep the suspense without suffering the inbetween plot hole that most number twos tend to have solid acting and a rare success for a 23 movie
Jul 7 2012,positive,this is my favorite of the three movies  the battle of helms deep is the best in the series
Jul 7 2012,positive,the last march of the ents scene is possibly the best scene of the entire trilogy
Jul 6 2012,positive,long but a great film
Jul 6 2012,positive,peter jackson continues to dazzle with the second part of the massive film that is the lord of the rings and delivers the slowest and most talky part of the film but still manages to dazzle with impressive visuals and an introduction to one of the greatest characters in cinema history gollum played by the magnificant andy serkis
Jul 6 2012,positive,the best movie ever made
Jul 5 2012,positive,love this movie and i love lord of the rings
Jul 5 2012,positive,perfectly balanced with battle scenes dialogue and emotions the two towers is a masterpiece that every resident of new zealand should be proud of
Jul 5 2012,positive,great movie with epic action and a good dose of humor from merry and pippin
Jul 5 2012,positive,other than that two character spend almost all of the movie in a tree its brilliant
Jul 4 2012,negative,this movie was so boring i got it but just didnt like it
Jul 4 2012,positive,effects and artistry used were simply stunning
Jul 4 2012,positive,two towers starts off brilliantly but becomes quite dark and far too emotionally draining by the end of the film i no longer cared its a great epic spectacle but the heaviest of the three
Jul 4 2012,positive,amazing story good characters
Jul 4 2012,positive,watched wed 17 aug 2011
Jul 4 2012,positive,few directors can capture the essence of a book and translate it well on film and fewer directors can actually succeed doing it three times in a row peter jackson showcases his vision of one of the most popular fantasy novels ever written and does with panache peter jackson had already envisioned how the entire trilogy will unfold on the first day of shooting and he never lost sight of it in all respects lord of the rings is the most successful trilogy ever made take the time to spend 10 hours for it it is worth watching plus this second installment has an awesome mmorpgstyle battle scene at helms deep
Jul 3 2012,positive,i was very entertained with this movie but this is where a lot gets confused and the movies go off plot with the tolkien story this film missed a big piece of the book and went too long to not mention the death of saruman and wormtongue and the invasion of hobbiton the movie was still entertaining but not true to the original story
Jul 3 2012,positive,the two towers is a faster paced more actionheavy continuation of the trilogy chock full of inspiring performances and incredible storytelling
Jul 3 2012,positive,a brilliant film an epic in every sense of the word  peter jackson gave us a faithful adaptation of tolkiens groundbreaking books  the casting was perfect and in some cases inspired loved the legolasgimli verbal sparring scenes   definitely a mustsee
Jul 2 2012,positive,you need to see all of them
Jul 2 2012,positive,his film is widely considered the worst for not being faithful to the books of jrr tolkien but we adapt a film is adapted not to translate in my opinion rather than a film is a work of art and i think what is one of the best of the trilogy after return of the king these almost 3 hours can be distressing may even be longer than the awardwinning titanic james cameron in the film can be found a failure of performance of elijah wood to be outdone by his teammate sean astin who plays dumb but loyal friend of frodo sam i think what the film can sometimes become excessive scenes of aragorn and arwen the battle of helms deep i think what is one of the best military battles in the history of cinema beautiful film
Jul 2 2012,positive,this film is widely considered the worst for not being faithful to the books of jrr tolkien but we adapt a film is adapted not to translate    in my opinion rather than a film is a work of art and i think what is one of the best of the trilogy after return of the king these almost 3 hours can be distressing may even be longer than the awardwinning titanic james cameron in the film can be found a failure of performance of elijah wood to be outdone by his teammate sean astin who plays dumb but loyal friend of frodo sam    i think what the film can sometimes become excessive scenes of aragorn and arwen the battle of helms deep i think what is one of the best military battles in the history of cinema beautiful film
Jul 2 2012,positive,although my least favoured out of the trilogy the two towers probably contains the more sophisticated part of the story than the others it shares the same pros and cons to the first chapter however because there is far more talking in this one the film can feel like its dragging too much espescially with its slightly longer story its recommended to watch the fellowship before to understand the situation easier
Jul 2 2012,positive,the best of the trilogy just finished watching it cant wait to rewatch it hahahah
Jul 2 2012,positive,a successful pick up from the fellowship and an open doorway to the return of the king
Jul 1 2012,negative,the series got slightly cooler when i discovered orlando bloom was in it
Jul 1 2012,positive,ttt is amazing just like the first

Jun 26 2012,positive,imho the greatest cinematic epic ever made this rating applies to all three movies together
Jun 26 2012,positive,peter jackson did an amazing job of layering complex details throughout the whole trilogy all of which i thoroughly enjoyed
Jun 26 2012,positive,my personal favorite out of the trilogy  this is most likely because of gollums character and personality  this one also has more action and suspense which helps build up for the epic conclusion  i give it 55 stars
Jun 25 2012,positive,an excellent continuation of the story even though it has to serve as a bridge film it creates plenty of its own tension and builds up to a climatic ending
Jun 23 2012,positive,actually my favorite out of the three
Jun 21 2012,positive,ive heard people say this movie wasnt good  on the contrary  with all the things they had to set up for return of the king i thought this movie still holds its own  viggo mortensen really shined i think as did andy serkis  opened up a whole new realm for special effects
Jun 21 2012,positive,this movie was probably the weakest in the entire series and its still amazing
Jun 21 2012,positive,i did not see any flaws in this movie incredible  gives you tears of joy because how awesome it is

Jun 16 2012,positive,the battle for helms deep was awesome
Jun 16 2012,positive,more political than the first but still just as good the war scene was done very well
Jun 16 2012,positive,i remember seeing this in the theatre and when it ended i was both amazed and frustrated amazed at seeing such a great movie and frustration from having to wait a year to watch the conclusion i am glad i can now watch the third one straight away
Jun 16 2012,positive,character development is one that is perfected during the trilogy
Jun 14 2012,positive,one of the most epic action movies ever
Jun 13 2012,positive,awesome finale of the film adaptions
Jun 13 2012,positive,usually a trilogy suffers from an unnecessary sequel trust me folks this one is very very necessary
Jun 12 2012,positive,magnificent  the scene in the ruined city is a bit nonsensical why does frodos behaviour motivate faramir to release him with the ring
Jun 11 2012,positive,great action this one continues the story love it plus gollum gets a good part in this one and i like gollum hes awesome
Jun 11 2012,positive,perhaps the strongest lord of the rings  it got a little long but it eclipsed the third movie by some ways
Jun 11 2012,positive,i like most of the two towers as much as i like the first lord of the rings movie the exception in this movie is that the final battle as well as the finale in general is stunning in this movie this movie also features andy serkis as gollum and he is an absolutely brilliant addition the story moves forward and leaves me eagerly waiting to watch the third movie overall i think its an improvement over fellowship and is a great entry in an already fantastic trilogy
Jun 11 2012,positive,love all lotr movies one of the best long but worth watching never a dull or boring moment
Jun 10 2012,positive,just as epic as the first but with more battles
Jun 10 2012,positive,it builds perfectly on the themes set and despite a few alterations to the original story stands as a fitting sequel
Jun 9 2012,positive,nothing happens and its inferior to fellowship but still one of the best action fantasy movies out there the ents are dumb though
Jun 8 2012,positive,absolutely breath taking movie
Jun 8 2012,positive,this movie had me holding in a piss so i could finish watching the whole movieliterally glued to my seat

Jun 6 2012,positive,climbing the ladder to success better than the first
Jun 6 2012,positive,picking up almost immediately after fellowship the two towers carries the second part of the story with great pace and ups the ante in terms of visual scale and storytelling  notably during the jawdropping battle of helms deep
Jun 5 2012,positive,short people rule
Jun 5 2012,positive,frodo and sams emotional journey complements the events surrounding the other fellowship members well in no way did legolas mount that horse like that though was an intern animating that shot how the fuck did that make it into film
Jun 4 2012,positive,the end battle is awesome
Jun 4 2012,positive,if you have read the book you will be surprized very close too the book
Jun 4 2012,positive,could probably be the best in the series with a fun to watch climax
Jun 4 2012,positive,uh huh i shouldnt even have to rate this

Jun 3 2012,neutral,toooooooooooooooo loooooooooooong  sorry not a big fan of these films
Jun 3 2012,positive,wonderful and effective storytelling
Jun 3 2012,positive,its less repetitive than the first instalment loosening the movie a little bit but remains to feel constricted and stuffed for the designated 3 hours causing some pacing issues none the less its enchanting score memorable performances utter complexity  spectacular visuals make this engaging and transfix eyes to the screen keeping full interest and deep intelligent thoughts during the movie
Jun 2 2012,positive,epic film its a masterpiece in the genre of fantasy
Jun 2 2012,positive,the battles are bigger the visuals more impressive the saga continues with little to complain about
Jun 2 2012,positive,fantastic there is just a character in there whos scenes could be taken out and the film could be no different aka i didnt like that character
Jun 1 2012,positive,the second chapter of peter jacksons epic trilogy is bigger and badder than its predecessor fueled and charged with engaged drama anticipating buildup and largerthanlife epic battle scenes this is quite the achievement in filmmaking
Jun 1 2012,positive,trop bon  so good
Jun 1 2012,positive,one of the best battles ever portrait in a movie
May 31 2012,positive,i liked all the action in this one
May 31 2012,positive,you should watch this immediately after watching the fellowship  if you do this i recommend watching these on a saturday or sunday  its worth it

May 28 2012,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is one of the greatest fantasy epics ever made  peter jackson has done an amazing job adapting jrr tolkiens novel making it a seamless continuation in this beloved trilogy  the special effects are astonishing delivering some of the most remarkable battle sequences ever made  additionally the cast has improved their performances and have really emerged themselves in their characters  everything in this film the cinematography the score the costumes the sets is spectacularly done  the two towers delivers a compelling story and an outstanding adventure

May 19 2012,positive,time to spit up and make a move
May 19 2012,negative,seriously my eye lids are soooo heavy maybe ill just shut then for a sec
May 18 2012,positive,just as engaging beautiful and dramatic as its predecessor the two towers continues the adventure in fantastic fashion while it might not be as exciting as the beginning or the ending of the trilogy its introduction of gollum and the separate stories more than make up for it battles are as epic as ever aided by stunning visual effects and beautiful settings the cast likewise continues to deliver strong performances across the board the two towers is yet another exciting entry in peter jacksons nearperfect trilogy
May 18 2012,positive,amazing effects great characters landscapes and incredible action lord of the rings the two towers isnt just the best movie of 2002 its might be the best movie of all time
May 17 2012,positive,i remember falling asleep at midnight durring this movie back in 5th grade    but the extended cut brought so much more to enjoy and keep myself awake for this is my least favorite of the three but the added character development with boromir and faramir was absolutely perfect and deserved a spot in the theatrical run    also they could have done a better job with some of the cuts and minor editing aspects that really make it looks dated already or even sloppy
May 15 2012,positive,the precious saga progresses with a substantial dose of memorable battle scenes demonstrating the films audio and video supremacy unmatched layers of complexity within both antagonist and protagonist execution and production unlike anything weve ever seen before
May 15 2012,positive,saga continuous along with fantastic cinematographygraphics and soundtrack
May 14 2012,positive,another great movie not as good as the first or the third but the battle at helms deep was pretty much amazing
May 14 2012,positive,beautifully made and just plain spectacular with outstanding cgi great acting great action great plot great story everything in the lotr trilogy is perfect true they arent that similar to the book but dude theyre are still some of the most amazing movies of all time even the soundtrack is amazing the whole movie is perfect in every way possible my second favorite out of the lotr trilogy behind the return of the king these movies the lotrs they are perfect the best trilogy of all time all of them have their own strong points and is just perfect you really need to see them if you havent already they are just perfect thats all you can say you should check em out they are awesome i highly recommend them
May 14 2012,positive,continues where it left off doesnt let anyone down
May 14 2012,positive,the story gets more complicated and there is a stronger focus on action and yet the two towers misses out on the magic of fellowship
May 14 2012,positive,oki really love dis one
May 14 2012,positive,this movie wasnt as impressive as the other lord of the rings movies but it was still very well done and exciting to watch
May 13 2012,positive,it was cool to watch with all the cg effects but not one i would watch over and over
May 13 2012,positive,wonderful adaptation of the classic novel
May 12 2012,positive,this one was just as good as the first
May 12 2012,negative,dross awful get to the end already
May 11 2012,positive,better than the fellowship with so much more to offer and has you eagerly awaiting the next one
May 11 2012,positive,i definitely liked just not the same as the 1st and 3rd
May 11 2012,positive,simply classic peter jackson cemented his skill as a truly amazing visionary
May 10 2012,positive,so much luv 4 the rings
May 9 2012,positive,i love this movie and would rate it a 5 if they hadnt brought the elves to helms deepwhat a horrible thing to do
May 9 2012,positive,best for action probably as good as the fellowship of the rjing  ents are badass treebeard is way older than pretty much every other entity in middle earth but could have been better if they threw in the part in the book where saruman has a good long conversation before disappearing from the story altogether
May 9 2012,positive,this movie brings the story to life
May 8 2012,positive,peter jackson stepped up the action sequences for the second offering in this epic trilogy without sacrificing character development and dialogue
May 8 2012,positive,clearly the best adventure trilogy to date if you watch the directors cut
May 7 2012,negative,boring had a nice nap
May 7 2012,positive,one of the best movies of all time if you havent seen it well you better get a move on
May 7 2012,positive,to follow up a masterpiece is a daunting task for any filmmakerthe task faced by peter jakson in making the two towers was fomidablebut the eventual product turned out to be  moresowell actedwoderfully shot and skillfully told storylinethe lord of the rings continues strongly thanks to the two towers
May 6 2012,positive,the first chapter was basically character introductions in the two towers we see the real adventure start to play out  there are some exciting moments in this one but the whole film is basically building up to an hourlong climatic battle of epic proportions  we are also introduced to the bizarre gollum character which that in itself is enough reason to watch
May 6 2012,positive,while not the best lor movie its certainly the most inventive
May 6 2012,positive,it benefits from being the middle film and not needing to start or finish conclusively but whatever the reason its an epic film that never loses its engagement and by far my favourite one in the trilogy
May 5 2012,positive,loved every second of it
May 5 2012,positive,was alright but needed for the other two
May 4 2012,positive,all seemed lost at helms deep until the arrival of the rohirrimm the best moment would have to be aragorn riding with the rohan king
May 4 2012,positive,the two towers presents a fresh darker and more epic tone than fellowship and uses the growing uncertainty of the rings fate to construct enough dramatic depth
May 3 2012,positive,all lotr are worth seeig many times
May 3 2012,negative,heres where the corruption ensued  the two oscars
May 3 2012,positive,my favourite of the series although they all deserve no less than 5 stars the epic the characters the relationships the complete encompassing of a whole new world battles its just fun fun fun
May 3 2012,positive,after watch this piece of art im only want more full of good action and intensity probably the best of the trilogy
May 2 2012,positive,the darkest of the three and the most hopeful talk about a great film
May 2 2012,positive,probably my favorite of the three
May 2 2012,positive,the weakest of the three lotr films still good
May 2 2012,positive,the best of the trilogy more action less walking
May 1 2012,positive,second if the trillogy this film focuses more on the war itself then the troubles of frodo battles are amazing
May 1 2012,positive,i absoultely love all of the lord of the rings movies
Apr 30 2012,positive,my favorite of the trilogy  the special effects are incredible
Apr 30 2012,positive,it has elijah wood in itnuff said
Apr 30 2012,positive,the battle of helms deep is a battle worth watching big broken courage and hope andy serkis pull an amazing role as gollum
Apr 30 2012,positive,great movie especially loved smeagolgollum
Apr 30 2012,positive,the most underrated chapter in the trilogy the two towers boasts one of the best battles in the history of cinema incredibly wellmade and superbly plotted everything builds up to that conflict yes it is slow moving at times but it rewards patience nothing short of a masterpiece
Apr 29 2012,positive,i love that movie it was great all the killing and stuff a saw it 20 times
Apr 29 2012,positive,educating alex with lotr he asks so many questions
Apr 28 2012,positive,every elemental aspect of what makes a film beautiful compliments one another here perfectly this time around jackson has nailed the element of atmospheric lighting more so than in the first installment crafting viscerally bleak sorrow that bleeds pure emotion with the driving structure of impacting performances the two towers is a movie created from experience shown through commitment that trumps its predecessor as it should by deftly blending drama and soul with its vast scope of epic fantasy action bringing cinematic art to awesomely powerful levels in every area
Apr 28 2012,positive,orlando bloom need i say more
Apr 28 2012,positive,the two towers is probably is my least favorite movie out of the series but i still love this movie even though this movie has the fewest action out of the trilogy whenever the action and battle sequences happen its nothing short from spectacular filled with fantastic acting fantastic direction and excellent storytelling i absoultely love this film
Apr 28 2012,positive,a monumental technical achievement
Apr 28 2012,positive,beyond improvement my favorite of the 3
Apr 27 2012,negative,boring dont understand why people go crazy for this
Apr 27 2012,positive,pretty good  but confusing
Apr 27 2012,positive,this is one of the best movies of the best series ever made it shouldnt be in the same category as all the others this one gets 15 stars
Apr 27 2012,positive,the battle at helms dee  one of the best fight scenes ive ever seen in a movie

Apr 23 2012,positive,what movie encouraged me to start writing
Apr 23 2012,positive,the better one of the trilogy
Apr 22 2012,positive,great pacing and again another wonderful gem from visionary peter jackson elijah woods performance would be the weakest aspect of this movie
Apr 21 2012,positive,read the hobbit in school loved the fantasy and the photography
Apr 21 2012,positive,everyone of these kept me satisfied
Apr 21 2012,positive,i really enjoyed these movies although i suggest reading the book to get the whole story
Apr 20 2012,positive,great movie in a great series
Apr 20 2012,positive,a pure epic the two towers is an exciting film featuring one of the greatest battles ever
Apr 20 2012,positive,i think this might have been my favorite out of the three
Apr 19 2012,positive,for me i found this much slower and even a bit less interesting then the fellowship of the ring but still this is an amazing achievment in many respects
Apr 19 2012,positive,this one is my absolute favorite of the triology i like the trees being apart of the war and handling their business i loved that gandalf was still alive and that he whoop butt too in this one i just appreciated the union
Apr 19 2012,positive,a    it delivers on every level
Apr 19 2012,positive,these movies are awesome especially the extended versions
Apr 19 2012,positive,a part two of a trilogy that rivals theempire strikes back a great achievement
Apr 19 2012,positive,the worst of the lord of the rings series too many unnecessary differences from the books for my liking but of course still fantastic
Apr 18 2012,positive,i know every thing about this movie
Apr 18 2012,positive,an brilliantly acted fantasy adventure that does tolkiens second chapter justice
Apr 17 2012,positive,not quite as deep as the books but in bringing the story to the masses jackson did a very good job of it
Apr 17 2012,neutral,least favorite out of the this series
Apr 17 2012,negative,too dark and i got really sick of frodo
Apr 17 2012,positive,awsome beginningbrings u rit in the thick of things
Apr 17 2012,positive,my favourite trilogy of all time
Apr 16 2012,positive,amasing this movie rocks
Apr 15 2012,positive,mind blowing takes your breath away
Apr 15 2012,positive,an essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time spectacular in every sense of the word even if you don t know an orc from a urukhai once again the cast are spot and every page at least almost comes alive with utter brilliance the cast are really getting into their characters now which seemed hard on paper and to bring middle earth alive is a great feat peter jackson has done a wonderful job and only nutcases cant see how much hard work and art has been put into this film it does get a little slow in the middle but after that is an epic rush its just so beautiful to watch the film draws you in and never lets you down as it delivers more action and more complexity than the first one it is a brilliant lead into the finale the fantastic thing about the film is that though it is of the fantasy genre we feel close to these characters and actually care about their situation its surprising that despite the use of cgi work nothing seems fake everything is tangible and raw
Apr 15 2012,positive,a great pt two of the 3 trilogy as with the first part it is visually stunning with great effects and brillant casting 
Apr 15 2012,positive,one thing of the two towers i didnt like was there was three main stories it kept switching from they were all good but it would be nice if it showed one story all the way through then the other then the other that is just me though other then that everything was good the acting especially from gandalf improved the ending gollums plan was a great closing along with the song gollums song i liked in the first one when they were all together instead of separate the battle for helms deep was magnificent
Apr 15 2012,positive,an amazing story  an amazing film adventure 
Apr 15 2012,positive,exceptional film acting is amazing and cinematography is beautiful
Apr 15 2012,positive,a great second act  the battle of helms deep is intese and exciting
Apr 15 2012,positive,i know it was boring but it was a filler to all the action that happened in the first and the last read the book it is really good loved the movie and book
Apr 14 2012,negative,slow motion bastards
Apr 14 2012,positive,this is my favorite out of the trilogy gollum is my fav

Apr 14 2012,positive,great movie sometimes a little slow and very informational but just to great
Apr 14 2012,positive,u all know how good it is
Apr 13 2012,positive,the two towers is practically the middle of the the lord of the rings story it doesnt have a beginning because that has been provided by the fellowship of the ring and it doesnt have an ending because that will be provided in the sequel     this is a little disappointing because its another mightily long movie 179 minutes that doesnt seem to materialise anywhere but the fact that i am still giving the rating of four stars most certainly implies that the sequel was still an excellent film to say the least    this time unlike in the predecessor where everyone stuck together the squad splits in three frodo wood and sam astin must continue in their quest to mordor where they come across devious creature gollum voiced by andy serkis who claims that he will help them in their quest to destroy the ring is their new ally as innocent as he seems however    the second group of the crew is made up of fellow hobbits merry dom monagham and pippin billy boyd the duo narrowly escape a brawl with saurons forces and are left alone in the woods with trees which are able to talk walk and are basically comparable to 80ft humans however will the two hobbits find a helpful ally in themor an unwanted villain    the third and biggest of the bunches are the warriors gandalf ian mckellen aragon viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom gimli john rhysdavis and co battle for middle earth against saurons forces protecting frodo and sam for them as they do this they plan to take down saruman christopher lee who is a big piece of saurons army    bigger and better than the first one i think not but a mightily good effort from jackson again replicating jrr tolkiens fine books again a little long but an equally good movie all the same
Apr 13 2012,positive,the action was a lot better than that of the first still i found the pace of this movie to be more or less stagnant until the long drawn out battle that had some really cool visuals
Apr 12 2012,positive,my favorite in the series not much to say greatest movie trilogy of all time
Apr 12 2012,positive,again i sooo love it
Apr 12 2012,positive,again i sooo love it
Apr 12 2012,positive,i rank the extended version up there with fellowship
Apr 11 2012,positive,best of the series much like empire strikes back before it
Apr 11 2012,positive,all three films11 glorious hours and 23 spectacular minutes of movie
Apr 11 2012,positive,a masterpiece peter jackson outdid himself
Apr 11 2012,neutral,a little bit better than the first especially with smeagle but still a tad too long
Apr 10 2012,positive,one ring to find them
Apr 10 2012,positive,the second of the epic series is a great continuation
Apr 10 2012,positive,every scene and bit and moment  awesome
Apr 10 2012,neutral,too many boring parts
Apr 10 2012,positive,i would definatley say that it was movie that left me on the edge of my seat and wanting to know what happens next
Apr 9 2012,positive,great movie but not the best of the trilogy
Apr 9 2012,positive,this is probably the best one
Apr 8 2012,positive,my least favorite of the three some of the fight scenes are good but theres a lot of boring stuff in there too
Apr 8 2012,positive,another great chapter in the trilogy
Apr 8 2012,positive,better than the 1st and every bit as epic loved it
Apr 8 2012,positive,i this movie luke gets his hang cut off by his father for making whoopie with his secret sister leia and there are elves
Apr 7 2012,positive,loved the fantasy of it
Apr 7 2012,positive,another great movie
Apr 6 2012,positive,this was really good
Apr 6 2012,positive,an exceptional sequel to the first installment of the trilogy but to be a 5 star film it has to be rated by someone who enjoys movies set in his time period
Apr 6 2012,positive,the worst of the trilogy but still the best trilogy in movie history  legolas and gimlis competition was really fun and the ents were amazing
Apr 6 2012,positive,lord of the rings  hello

Apr 3 2012,positive,better than the first but not as good as the 3rd and  yes orlando and viggo are beautiful
Apr 2 2012,positive,the whole trilogy is amazing
Apr 2 2012,positive,enjoyed it in the movie theater
Apr 2 2012,positive,dark but worth seeing stays with the story line
Apr 2 2012,positive,my favorite of the three sends chills through you and pulls you into the epic scenes the action scenes would make even lucas jealous and the storyline stays true
Apr 2 2012,positive,this movie will keep your attention i loved the time the movie took place the wardrobe and the battles great effects
Apr 1 2012,positive,the lotr trilogy was awesome love them all
Apr 1 2012,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers brings us back to the world of lotr and includes returning and new characters like gollum played and performed by the incredibly wonderfully talented andy serkis and treebeard voiced by john rhysdavies who also plays gimli exciting action sequences and a beautifully told continuation of lord of the rings
Apr 1 2012,positive,oh i love this film i like all of lord of the rings films
Apr 1 2012,positive,it is a great film    i like the characters
Apr 1 2012,positive,love the lord of the rings series
Apr 1 2012,positive,let this movie serve as a notice dwarves are better than elves
Mar 31 2012,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers picks up directly where the first film left off continuing the story that has now has its characters split asunder while its probably the weakest of the three films it certainly isnt unworthy it has some fantastic things about it just like the other films acting cinematography music action etc its all here but it does feel like a step down and doesnt feel quite as refined as the previous film the main reason being that the previous film had such a linear narrative that it didnt need to cut away to other events that often oh well its still a fantastic film but the least of the three at least in my opinion
Mar 31 2012,positive,the best movie ever
Mar 31 2012,positive,best movie and trilogy ever amazing
Mar 30 2012,positive,my favorite of the trilogy  absolutely amazing
Mar 29 2012,positive,my least favorite of the 3 but still amazingly powerful
Mar 29 2012,positive,the magnificence continues with the two towers stunning special effects and direction
Mar 28 2012,positive,the uruks turn north east theyre taking the hobbits to isengard
Mar 26 2012,positive,its in my greatest movies list it is flawless
Mar 25 2012,positive,definitely one of the most authentic and powerful films to be produced by peter jackson as can be said for the others but this one just seems to shine as my favourite for both its plot and strong casting line up being the second in the trilogy this installment could be seen merely as a lead up to one of the biggest and best finales in film history and peter does an outstanding job in creating yet another masterpiece for the critics to naturally love
Mar 25 2012,positive,my favorite lord of the rings
Mar 25 2012,positive,peter jackson could not have bridged the trilogy any better the buildup and battle at helms deep are just outstanding
Mar 24 2012,positive,the best of the lord of the rings trilogy
Mar 24 2012,positive,my favorite of the 3
Mar 24 2012,positive,pretty good but suffers from middle film stigma
Mar 23 2012,positive,brutal and relentless great rendition of tolkeins vision
Mar 22 2012,negative,if you have seen my ratings of the other 2 movies in this trilogy you might wonder what makes this one so much worse  well the funny part is that most of the stuff they got right in the first and third installments they also got right here  the cast obviously is still topnotch  the special effects and cgi are remarkable  the battle scenes are intense and very exciting  this movie does keep the story moving and will certainly leave you hanging anxious to watch the final installment  so where did this chapter go wrong for me    the two towers represents every single thing that i dislike in the movie trilogy and then some  if you listen to peter jackson and team talk about making the movies you will hear them frequently discuss how much they loved the tolkein novels  yet they constantly feel the need to embellish with the stories but its not just the fact that they made changes from the books i swear im not some diehard tolkien fan who is just upset that the movies dont look like the image in my head the real problem is the way they make changes    they took a classic and they gave it the hollywood blockbuster treatment oh we need a love triangle so lets add that in things are kind of slow here so lets throw in a battle just because oh and lets make everyone think aragorn is dead for awhile ooo could the elves show up here and make some impassioned speech about helping mankind all this garbage cheapens the story and makes it feel as mundane as any other movie then to take it to the point of absurdity they added so much of this hokey stuff they had to bump boromirs death to the first film and the epic tale of shelobs lair to the last the ultimate cliffhanger abandoned so that gimli and legolas have time to be reduced to comic relief ugh
Mar 22 2012,positive,why cant i give the film more stars for sure one of the best fantasy sagas ever and this very film shows it the epic battle between isengard and rohan was one of the best battles ive seen on screen peter jackson really knows what he does and the visual effects are just suberb could it be any better ah and dont forget the brilliant work of andy serkis making the gollum
Mar 21 2012,positive,this is where the humour got injected and watered the down the epic scope somewhat  still very enjoyable
Mar 21 2012,positive,the two towers continues the lord of the rings trilogy as one of the best sequels ever made along with empire strikes back
Mar 20 2012,positive,a perfect sequel quite possibly the greatest movie ive ever seen
Mar 20 2012,positive,good but sometimes its boaring the extended version makes it more fun
Mar 18 2012,positive,the best lord of the rings film period it had so many memorable moments and tons of brilliant action sequences believe it or not i liked orlando bloom this time around it is a lot more aware that it has to put important thing into the time limit instead of useless things it progresses the story further but sometimes i feel lost there is like 20 stories going on at a time
Mar 18 2012,positive,love love love it its one of the best trilogies ever made
Mar 17 2012,positive,the high point of the series and perfectly positioning the finale
Mar 17 2012,positive,easily the best one out of the trilogy
Mar 16 2012,positive,i 3 the battle of helms deep and the gollum scenes
Mar 15 2012,positive,good to watch for the sake of the series but does not bring anything other than effects to the table as far as emotional heartstring tugging
Mar 15 2012,neutral,got kind of tired of the rallying of armies
Mar 14 2012,positive,again its been a while but i know its good
Mar 14 2012,positive,lord of the rings is my favourite trilogy ever and i love it its just a beautiful epic
Mar 14 2012,positive,this was really good
Mar 12 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies will do review later
Mar 11 2012,positive,another amazing movie without a doubt keeps getting better 
Mar 10 2012,positive,my least favorite of all three films
Mar 9 2012,positive,i liked this one almost more than the first i do not see how peter jackson pulled off this magnificient movie triagy
Mar 8 2012,positive,with a much darker mood than its predecessor two towers does a wonderful job despite not benefitting from a beginning or a conclusion as the first and final films do notable performances include viggo mortensen as aragorn
Mar 8 2012,positive,epic best film of the trilogy
Mar 8 2012,positive,you should take an afternoon off to watch this everything is set on such a massive scale and its escapism like youve never seen before a must see for fans of sci fi and fantasy epics
Mar 7 2012,positive,a bit on the boring side
Mar 6 2012,positive,the best of the series the most violent and has the best fight scene
Mar 5 2012,positive,although not as eyeopening as the first film fellowship of the ring and impressively concluded as its successor a terrific film although slightly less engaging
Mar 4 2012,positive,really better in the special extended edition
Mar 3 2012,positive,the second movie in the lord of the rings was also really a good show to see
Mar 3 2012,positive,best of the series  the battle of helms deep will be legendary for years to come
Mar 1 2012,positive,personally this was not as good as the return of the king still an amazing movie with awesome cast great in so many levels
Feb 29 2012,positive,deeper characters and more fascinating drama propel the franchise forward in a far more exciting and intriguing installment than the opener
Feb 29 2012,positive,easily the greatest film series of our time    just sayin
Feb 28 2012,positive,best lord of the rings film
Feb 28 2012,positive,the one where all battles take place great sequel to the first definitely deserved to sweep the oscars
Feb 27 2012,positive,i really really really loved this movie great great sequel 
Feb 27 2012,positive,not as good as the first one and not as good as the third one but it is still better then a lot of movies
Feb 22 2012,positive,the second best movie ever
Feb 21 2012,positive,sin palabras the lord of the rings forever
Feb 21 2012,positive,love this movie its really good if you like adventure movies
Feb 21 2012,positive,even better than the first
Feb 21 2012,positive,my least favorite of the trilogy i didnt care for how this movie pretty much switched the protagonist from frodo to aragorn i didnt care for the romance between aragorn and arwen when i was a kid because i was nine but now as a film buff who loves great movie romance im still not on board with the aragorn and arwen story however the action sequences are impressive
Feb 20 2012,positive,previously on 24 i mean the lord of the rings the one ring of power has been found after a perilous journey for the fellowship of the ring that ended with gandalf ian mckellen falling to what seemed to be his doom with the balrog at the bridge of khazaddum the rest of the fellowship escaped after respite in the land of lothlorien they journeyed on and boromir sean bean succumbed to the rings power and fell against the uruk hai we pick up where that left off with a splintered fellowship heading in separate directions which expand the scope we have frodo and sam elijah wood and sean astin heading to mordor aragorn legolas and gimli viggo mortensen orlando bloom and john rhysdavies hunting the uruk hai of isengard one of the two towers who have merry and pippin dominic monaghan and billy boyd and think they have the ring these are the three main groups the perspective alternates between frodo and sam finally come facetoface with gollum andy serkis in his breakout motion capture performance and take him as a guide to mordor the other of the two towers in the two towers throughout frodo is the only one who treats him kindly but no one else does which will come into play in return of the king andy serkis does an amazing job both with capturing the motion and the emotion of gollum from the gangly movements to the gurgly voice that has become iconic in the 13 years since this film released and he performs gollums bipolar very well especially in scenes where smeagol and gollum talk to each other the diverse trio takes us to the kingdom of rohan where king theoden bernard hill has been corrupted by grima wormtongue brad dourif an advisor whose advice made theoden kick out his own nephew eomer karl urban who helps out the uruk hai trackers grimas advice eventually gets him in trouble with gandalf spoiler alert he survived but not a spoiler because he was in the trailers and the storys been around for 60 years as of my writing this review and theoden after learning of the terror saruman wrought in lands far off from the city of edoras the people all go to a fortress called helms deep and prepare for what is undoubtedly one of the most visuallystunning largescale battles ever committed to film and one that is more emotionally charged than anything peter jackson would put out ten years later it is not in computer generated imagery that battles are committed to film but in the emotional stakes and the gritty harshness of the battle hard rain truly imposing uruk hai and weapons of unimaginable to them destruction its good they didnt lead with this kind of battle finally the story alternates to merry and pippins encounter and subsequent travels with treebeard the ent voiced by gimlis john rhysdavies an ancient race of trees that can walk and talk like us but are easy going except when saruman christopher lee fells trees the ents know they take it personally this is a massive film but when there is not a climactic battle raging we get to know our main characters from the hobbits sentimentality many of us could relate to to gimli and legolas growing to trust each otherget along as best elves and dwarves can given their history the battle is spectacular and the cgi is incredible on gollum and the ents but one thing they couldnt breath life into were the backgrounds of mediumshots of merry and pippin riding on treebeard its too obvious dominic monaghan and billy boyd are in front of a greenscreen for these sequences when we see treebeard and them on him its as if theyre actually on a tree howard shore provides a grander score for the grander scope now that the story is starting to intensify gone are the flutes and easy tune of the hobbit themes except for a small dose here or there but they can never go back to the way it was things have certainly grown gloomy since frodo set out on his quest to destroy that ring but theres still the occasional laugh you can find i found one in helms deep gimli and legolas also provide great onscreen chemistry that creates almost as much comic relief as merry and pippin this may be the part where the kids would ask you to turn off the movie because its gotten too dark but you will have to watch through the end to see if the sun shines brighter than ever after an especially dark night
Feb 20 2012,positive,a sequel that improves on the first it does take a while to build up to the final battle at helms deep but its worth the wait
Feb 19 2012,positive,the little hobbits journey continues with an amazing sequel with an outstanding performance from andy serkis gollum the soundtrack continues to be perfect along with the great script the battle for middle earth is close to an end following the greatest fantasy adapted films
Feb 19 2012,positive,fantastic and even better than the 1st
Feb 19 2012,positive,how come this movie didnt get nominated for best direction and make up when i first saw this i was shocked by the realistic looking fantasy world it sucks you in and doesnt lets you out
Feb 18 2012,positive,incredible just amazing make sure you see the extended version
Feb 18 2012,positive,in the extended edition version of the two towers most of the changes come in the form of scenes that were already present in the theatrical version but have been extended here however there are a few notable differences therein such as additional footage of frodo and sam the ents and merry and pipin as well  among the most notable additions is a short scene showing theodreds theodens sons funeral  this version also gives us a lot more information regarding aragorns status as dunedain by finally revealing his age over 80 years old as well as a scene in which saruman becomes aware that aragorn is of dunedain lineage  my favorite new scene in this film is a flashback of faramir in which his relationship with his brother boromir and his father lord denethor who doesnt appear in the theatrical version is expanded on resulting in faramir being developed further as a character    
Feb 17 2012,positive,my favorite of the trilogy the battle  helms deep makes me cry every time
Feb 17 2012,positive,question could jackson make a sequel that is better than tfotr answerermyes defining the word big in a bigger way once again we follow the hobbits as they continue their journey to destroy the word ring i had one question in my head when i went to see this film can it possibly be better than the first film and it was it was astounding completely mesmerising darker and more dngerous it continues where the first film ended and frodo and sam have a long journey ahead not only is this the best of the trilogy for me its one of my favourite films attracting you so much you dont even notice the time flying by jackson yet again tells a story of hope love loss war and heart which we just cant step away from visual art all the way through from the massive mountains to small scale cities ttt has something has everything that tfotr had and much more as i said in my first review you develop a love for the characters which are fighting for the good of middle earth after all thats happening from all the bloodshed and walking that takes place you forget the realism to the film it notches into you when you least expect giving you a full taste that no one is invincible and everyone is mortal heart renching moments occur many times in the film some uplifting and some devestating enough to draw you to tears again oscar nominated acting which isnt really surprising not being noticed for what it achieves is in my opinion the most underated of the trilogy setting the concrete of the final battle for the ring and again leaving you with a gaping mouth wide open and a feeling of wanting to watch more underated and completely mindblowing in sequences this second part contains as much heart as the first film and a blast of power that the ring can have on you remember that feeling when you left the cinema and having to wait another year for the final part it was unbearable
Feb 17 2012,positive,my favorite of the trilogy it has the best and most memorable moments
Feb 16 2012,positive,my personal favourite of the series has the greatest battle out of all three this is part of one of the greatest trilogies of all time and these movies are among the greatest
Feb 16 2012,positive,the journey of frodo and sam continues elsewhere the army of soramon attacked rohan the much feared war between good and evil has finally begun sauron is getting stronger as the ring is getting close to him the power of the ring is weakening frodo  still he doesnt surrender to the evil he survives    though each of these sequels is extremely lengthy theres not a chance to get bored actually its almost impossible to stop watching till the very end
Feb 16 2012,positive,i rewatched it again today i wasnt wrong when i fell in love with this movie the first time i watched it
Feb 15 2012,positive,the epicness continues another great lotr movie from peter jackson and crew personally i didnt find this one as compelling as the first one maybe because it is the filler between the beginning and the end im not saying its bad or anything i just liked the first one better the acting was great the special effects especially in the battle for helms deep are absolutely amazing it always amazes me with these movies how they can take something that is frankly a really long book and turn it into such an epic tale of the ring a must see in the trilogy obviously
Feb 15 2012,positive,worst out of the three but still unbelievable
Feb 14 2012,positive,my personal favorite of the trilogy just for the ents and the battle of helms deep i probably cant say much about these films that others havent said a thousand times already but ill say that they have aged remarkably well they use massive amounts of cgi but also plenty of practical makeup and effects which combine to make the fantasy more convincing wonderful wonderful movie
Feb 13 2012,positive,follows on from fellowship with spectacular action acting and effects to help render tolkiens source material into a perfect second film in jacksons masterful franchise its hard not to get caught up in all of it simply marvelous
Feb 13 2012,positive,i cant praise this movie enough from one of the best openings of all time as gandalf battles the balrog to the grandeur of the plains of rohan and culminating in the epic battle of helms deep its this battle that is one of the few occasions where the film actually outshines the book the setting sound music editing its all first class  the main reason this movie sits above fellowship though is gollum an incredible blend of the acting of andy serkis and cgi trickery makes for one of the most pivotal characters coming to life he is fascinating to watch and as far as im concerned portrays tolkiens creation exactly  this is the best picture oscar winner of the three and an absolute masterpiece of modern cinema
Feb 12 2012,positive,this is not a sequel but merely just chapter two of a great epic trilogy the fight actions especially in the final battle were spectacular this film was not as slow as the first film but was faster paced which i did not know was possible for a three hour film i believe this film was actually the best one of the trilogy from the writing acting directing and the cinematography it gets lost in the shuffle because it is not the beginning nor the end of the series if any film of the three deserved the best picture it was this one great scenery and plot lines not to mention the internal conflict of both gollum and frodo as they near mount doom great film
Feb 12 2012,positive,visonary but formulaic
Feb 12 2012,positive,my fav of the series
Feb 12 2012,positive,i so wish more films were like this
Feb 10 2012,positive,god was i happy when i saw that this was the best reviewed of the 3 on here it is by far the best in terms of battles and character development it also has the best soundtrack the rohan theme is amazing
Feb 10 2012,positive,whoaaaaaa i definitely accept to myself that i love the movie before i dont like this but when my hubby show this i really appreciate the concept of the movie 
Feb 9 2012,positive,i love this movie i am a huge lotr fan and this movie is terrific peter jackson did a wonderful job there was one main difference the character of faramir was much darker than in the book and i cant see why he had to be either way though the movies just as good bravo
Feb 8 2012,negative,better than fellowship but still far off the epic masterpiece status it is hailed to be
Feb 8 2012,positive,i love watching war on film and i think this has one of the best war scenes ive ever seen
Feb 7 2012,positive,epic still building and really good movie
Feb 6 2012,positive,visually spectacular and lots of action  only complaint is that there was a lot of time spent walking which can give it an air of slowness
Feb 5 2012,positive,i do not know whether this film does justice to its source material partly because 1 film and literature are completely different media and 2 i have not read any of the novels yet and i probably never will even after spending almost 6 hours in the middleearth i still find it difficult to keep up with everything thats happening in this world too many characters too many white races with no distinct features with the exception of elves too many complicated names of regions and stuff in general which make it challenging for me to take the story seriously but around half way through the film i realized that i shouldnt take it too seriously hell this a fantasy film with magic and orcs and dwarves and all kinds of unrealistic shit so i decided to just go with it the result is quite spectacular and a really good time peter jackson once again succeeds in telling this epic tale of bravery and sacrifice terrific special effects exquisite production design and allaround strong performances make this installment an wildly entertaining ride its not without flaws and there are a couple of ridiculous and deliberately dramatic moments that made my eyes roll but in the end it made me yearn for the final chapter the two towers is damn entertaining
Feb 3 2012,positive,middle entries can be tricky but this film with its darker tone than the previous installment is great the battle of helms deep is simply amazing
Feb 2 2012,positive,i am a huge tolkien fan and the lord of the rings is my favourite book by far this is by far the best of the lord of the rings and in other words just astounding in this frodo continues his quest deeper into mordor with sam by his side and gollum has now joined the party do they dare trust him whilst all this is happening the allies have to fight the growing armies of saruman the white or fall in the attempt this film has adventure action and battles on epic scales which includes the battle of helms deep which is my favourite scene not without its flaws but after all lord of the rings is a hard book to turn into a movie this film is very faithful to the original story and is brimming with great actors for me it captures the book really well
Feb 1 2012,positive,just like several great series the lord of the rings present a surprising and exciting sequel of this spectacular tale with a terrific acting by andy serkis as gollum
Feb 1 2012,positive,the best between the 3 chapters
Jan 31 2012,positive,it still has some of the adventure and discovery of the first with the darkness and emotional resonance of its next installment personally because of this balance its my favourite in the trilogy
Jan 30 2012,positive,one of my all time favorites
Jan 30 2012,positive,great story and abundant action perhaps too abundant
Jan 30 2012,positive,amazing followup to the incredible first installment with more action and the introduction of one of the best characters ever put to film gollum the battle for helms deep is nothing short of amazing and is clearly the standout
Jan 30 2012,positive,best of the trilogy
Jan 30 2012,positive,just like the fellowship of the ring was epic groundbreaking and amazing this also goes on forever
Jan 30 2012,positive,possibly the greatest film of all time
Jan 29 2012,positive,even better than excellent this time around part 3 is perfection
Jan 27 2012,positive,gimli  legolas make a great team with aragorn
Jan 27 2012,positive,rating a  i recall about maybe a month or so ago i was in a discussion about lord of the rings  one person stated oh the two towers  this is the one in which nothing happens  the fellowship had the set up and return of the king has the great climax so the middle would just be filler right  im happy to say that is wrong  i still believe that if i was forced to decide which was the best lotr movie the two towers would still prevail as my favorite    the movie continues right where the first film left off  sam and frodo are traveling to mount doom to destroy the one ring in the fires of mount doom  along the way they come across smeagolgollum a creature who was once a hobbit but the power of the ring and darkness has turned him into an odd little creature  he has stalked them to obtain the ring which once belonged to him  rather than kill the creature frodo decides to keep him and use him as a guide to mordor  while they are on their journey merry and pippin have been taken by the urukai and are being brought to the wizard saruman under the idea they posses the ring  behind them aragorn legolas and gimli follow to recover their lost comrades  merry and pippin soon escape into the forest where they meet treebeard an ent  the others who miss them travel into rohan where the ruler theodin is under the control of saruman  through their rescue of the kingdom they learn saruman has sent an army 10000 strong to attack them  they flea to the fortress of helms deep and prepare to battle      to describe the plot in to much detail would spoil to much of the movie and its complex as it is  theres the love connection between aragorn and aerwin the travels of merry and pippin and smeagols story  it is a long movie but worth it    the acting is just as good as it was in the first one  wood astin boyd and monaghan are good as the hobbits and mortensen is great as aragorn  something i like they put slighty more focus on in this movie is the relationship between gimli and legolasplayed again by john ryesdavies and orlando bloom respectively  they work off each other well and it makes for great humor  nice knew aditions are bernard hill as theodin and bradhi im chucky wanna play dourif as wormtongue     however the main show stealing character and perhaps the main reason i like this film the best is smeagolgollum  hes such a rich character  hes not quite a villain but more of a fallen hero  he does bad things but you can tell theyre not entirely his fault the ring destroyed his life and he just cant live without it  its an addiction  he also has a great split personality its the one ive always thought of when i think split personality i recommended to a fellow drama student when she did a split personality monologue that one of her personalities be smeagol  he argues with himself and the best part of the movie is him telling his other half gollum who gets his name from the sound he makes to go away  you can tell smeagol struggle to retain power over gollum and its fun to see how he interacts with himself  gollum makes the film essentially it wouldnt work if he didnt  he works in part for two reasons  one of those reasons is andy serkis the actor who portrays him  and i dont just mean does the voice but he was on set and he acted out much of the motion which was used for the eventually cgi character  serkis has the perfect voice and facial expressions which make smeagol so great  serkis is a great for this kind of work he went on to play king kong in the king kong remake and played caesar in rise of the planet of the apes  he can get great expression and feeling through a performance which is mainly a cgi creation and you can feel smeagols pain and joy  i greatly appreciate serkis work and he essentially created one of the most memorable film characters in years  the other reason smeagol works well is because of the people at weta digital the effects company behind lotr king kong district 9 avatar and rise of the planet of the apes  they had smeagol created and ready during the first film but when serkis came onto play they changed the look entirely and doing far more work in two months than they had in two years  they motioned captured serkis and also used key frame animation to make smeagol come to life  they also rotoscoped over footage of serkis in shots to add smeagol into a scene so it would look more realistic  they also took a lot of time making him look realistic and i still believe its the best cgi ever put on film forget avatar wetas best work was still here    the other main reason i think this movie is great is the battle of helms deep  its so well shot and edited its riveting  this is what shocks me when people say nothing happened in this movie because helms deep was something  it mixes the right amount of action the right amount of humor its a great battle      the music is once again great  i played the music from this movie in band one year and it stuck out to me  its always been one of my favorites  the two best music moments occur during the ariel shots of rohan and when the ents march  the music compliments the scenes so well it engages you just as much as the film itself      the make up and effects are great once more due greatly to weta workshop and weta digital  again the miniatures dazzle and the creatures are amazing  the shots of the urukai army is a great achievement and you can barely tell it was done almost entirely in the computer even when it goes in for a close up      now to clarify the two towers are baraddur and isengard  tolkien the author of the books never made it clear which towers the title referred to  there are multiple options  i always thought growing up it was isengard and helms deep the two opposing forces but helms deep isnt really a tower  it has one but im not sure if it counts  the arguments of other places though makes me think its a possibility but what do i know  this also brings up the point of changes from the source material  yes they cut out tom bombadil from the first one though they reference him in the extended cut in the two towers but changes like those are necessary from a plot point of view  but they make nice changes like giving wormtongue the lines of a character someone else says in the book spoilers wont allow me to say who and giving smeagol his self speech which is the movies stand out scene   i overall like he changes    i do prefer the extended edition here unlike the fellowship because i think it adds more  it builds up more the character of faramir it gives more humor and it overall doesnt feel stretched in most places like the fellowship did it does once but its to reference the book and its a nice touch  both versions are great but i prefer the extended edition    the two towers was overall one of the best films of the 2000s well the whole trilogy was  i still think it was the best film of 2002 barely beating minority report and signs  its a great movie  i highly recommend
Jan 25 2012,positive,i love the way this one begins the story is darker then the first
Jan 25 2012,positive,who hasnt seen itits great
Jan 24 2012,positive,the two towers is just a solid a film as fellowship of the ring
Jan 23 2012,positive,excellent only that i can say best of the best
Jan 23 2012,positive,i really found this movie to be much better than the fellowship of the ring you actually see what actually happens to gandalf the background of golium the epic battles and having gandalf return in white really makes the film
Jan 22 2012,positive,and the story goes onstunningly
Jan 22 2012,positive,definitely one of my favorite movies and also one of the most loyal adaptations ever made however there are some cheesy scenes and characters some things that really dont go well with the story as tolkien wrote it the whole story the characters and the world created by j r r tolkien were dummied down in this trilogy but as a movie alone its good
Jan 22 2012,positive,goodlike the third best
Jan 22 2012,positive,the ents were pretty cool
Jan 21 2012,positive,i lied this is the best of the lotr trilogy
Jan 20 2012,positive,added a bit more excitement to the story
Jan 20 2012,positive,it just keeps getting better once again a remarkable book makes for a fantastic film
Jan 19 2012,positive,its all about the final film
Jan 18 2012,positive,my favorite cant get enough
Jan 18 2012,positive,when youre older youll be telling your children the story of frodo baggins and sam gamgee
Jan 18 2012,positive,not quite as good as the first but a fantastic piece nonetheless
Jan 17 2012,positive,twin towers wows absolutely amazing
Jan 17 2012,positive,just one thing theyre taking the hobbits to isengard
Jan 17 2012,positive,will you marry me legolas
Jan 16 2012,positive,shouldve been called the 3 towersfor the 2 in the movie and the 1 in my pants
Jan 16 2012,positive,loved the trilogy but this is perhaps the weakest of the 3 movies they turned a single chapter helm deep into a major battle that took over half the movie to tell this is an example of why the tolkien family was not happy with the movies jrr would be rolling in his grave
Jan 14 2012,positive,best of the trilogy
Jan 14 2012,positive,honestly i think this one is just as good as the third one the fellowship was a tamer less exciting installment while this one certainly entertains and  excites with its great directing
Jan 13 2012,positive,i love lord of the ring movies
Jan 13 2012,negative,they walk and walk and walk and walk
Jan 13 2012,positive,best of the trilogy
Jan 12 2012,positive,great movie beautiful cinematography excellent visuals and very good acting from the cast
Jan 12 2012,positive,it may be the bridge between the first and last films but it still counts as a masterpeice in itself as it successfully introduces new characters and locations
Jan 12 2012,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
Jan 11 2012,positive,while the two towers certainly has more action than its predecessor its much less fun going along for the ride andy serkis as gollumsmeagol is brilliant in proving that an actor can turn in a great performance as a cg character he steals every scene hes in the battle of helms deep is a master class in largescale action scenes that rivals some of the action in star wars but jackson does a nice job of not getting carried away and forgetting the storyline a great entry to the adventure genre but almost too dark to really be a fun watch
Jan 11 2012,positive,the fellowship is scattered across middle earth  merry  pippin in the hands of the orcs aragorn legalos  gimli on their trail and frodo  sam marching on to mt doom  the two towers feels very much like a middle film but it also happens to be my favorite of the bunch  this is where despair becomes an option for our heroes but thankfully weve got sam  aragorn to battle for hopeand weve got the visuals of cinemas greatest battle helms deep  plus youve got the introduction of the sad treacherous gollum  vf
Jan 11 2012,positive,enjoyed it but its one of those movies i can only watch once its way too long and drawn out lol smh
Jan 9 2012,positive,definitely has the lack of resolution that any middle film of a trilogy has but its lotr
Jan 9 2012,positive,there is nothing wrong with this series flawless filmmaking
Jan 9 2012,negative,well saw parts of it but couldnt wait until it was over the packers were whopping on the vikings so i had to leave the room to watch the game
Jan 9 2012,positive,the best of the three films the two towers has a great cinematic quality the climax is beautifully orchestrated and the pacing is fairly good but the best part of the movie is the thorough characterization
Jan 9 2012,positive,the lord of the rings trilogy defines the word epic
Jan 9 2012,positive,this is where it all starts to fall into place
Jan 8 2012,positive,the battle scenes in this movie are enough to warrant at least four stars then add in the excellent acting and intense atmosphere interesting characters and you got five stars
Jan 8 2012,positive,pretty much everything the first movie has to offer and more including andy serkis doing an excellent job as gollum  jackson really nailed the details in this movie
Jan 8 2012,positive,if you take the music visual effects and make up out it wouldnt be that impressive movie with a linear narrative predictable ending and a regular cast lord of the rings trio is highly overratted however if you were in love with the theme or if you ever played wow no offence and liked it you would most likely sanctify this movie
Jan 8 2012,neutral,sooo long  best scene when it finishes
Jan 8 2012,positive,the road goes ever on with the two towers the second film in the lord of the rings trilogy now as we split into three storys of the broken fellowship as frodo and sam continue to mordor to destroy the ring as they meet upon gollum who tries to split their relationship apart aragon legolas and gimli are taking villagers as to minus turth as later merry and pippin encounter treebeard and try to get to get to isengard as you might find weird pauses throughout the film the film itself is still fantastic to look at     95100 a
Jan 8 2012,positive,not the best one but still it was good all the same
Jan 7 2012,positive,i love the tollken trilogy all of the movies are fantastic great acting script stayed true to books and scenery and special effects are awesome
Jan 7 2012,neutral,the second lord of the rings movies for me was nearly disappointing as the second sequel to in the second star wars trilogy the movie was far too long and really did not carry the story really well the movie had some great scenes and some excellent visuals but falls flat in all other aspects
Jan 7 2012,positive,long but incredible
Jan 7 2012,positive,how is chicago better than this
Jan 6 2012,positive,i doubt it if there will ever be another trilogy of movies as epic as these are
Jan 6 2012,positive,as it was in the fellowship of the ring the two towers brought a fantastic spectacle in continuation of where it left off 
Jan 6 2012,positive,although pissed they dont end the movie in the same fashion as they do the books i love the suprises and challenges faced in this part of the trilogy
Jan 6 2012,positive,awesome special effects and storytelling
Jan 5 2012,positive,alright rotk might be the best of the series but this my favourite epic action huge improvement upon fellowship great scenes of humour and at times a little scary even a success on every level
Jan 5 2012,positive,go watch it but of course watch the first one first
Jan 5 2012,positive,oh yeah my favorite the best
Jan 4 2012,positive,another great epic flick
Jan 3 2012,positive,i love this movie and i think i watch this lotr movie the most
Jan 3 2012,positive,the film is already perfect but the extra 30 minutes just add even more depth and story the extended versions are really the only way to go
Jan 3 2012,positive,though a few details from the book series are removed in this portion its surprisingly better than the first of the trilogy its a great continuation and even more so leaves its audience wishing for more wanting to see how it will all end
Jan 3 2012,positive,casting was beautiful and i think it was made perfectly
Jan 2 2012,positive,the creatures and characters which were conjured up in my mind as my dad read the fellowship of the ring complete with voices and gestures will remain with me forever this is the challenge peter jackson was left with in creating the first in his lord of the rings trilogy the collective imagination of literally millions of fans each one filled with different intricacies and opinions concerning characters settings basically everything involved in production design and being a director in general with such a burden weighing on jacksons shoulders no one would have blamed him if he simply curled into the foetal position and sobbed when he actually bagged the role of director but im sure i speak for fans critics and the entire world when i say that im so glad that he didnt the first in the sweeping epic of the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring begins with the origin of the one ring an object created by the dark lord sauron in order to take over middle earth after a battle sequence or two we join up with our hero of the piece frodo baggins a hobbit from the shire after finding out that his uncle bilbos magic ring is in fact the ring in question its an adventure of a lifetime
Dec 31 2011,positive,in my personal opinion this is by far the best of the trilogy  it advances in the story in such a more interesting way  the atmosphere is more darker than the others
Dec 30 2011,positive,love all the lord of the rings
Dec 29 2011,positive,two towers switches back and forth between the adventures of the various characters which kept me from being completely emotionally invested with any of them still the tale is thrilling and the visual are breathtaking peter jackson juggles the many characters extremely well and creates a film that is more solid and consistently entertaining compared to fellowship three hours just went by like that
Dec 29 2011,positive,i watchd this movie and didnt want to blink i thought the movie was absolutely brilliant it picked up greatly with the characters and made me interested to keep interested the thing about this movie was that i was also interested in the music the soundtrack of this movie was beautiful i had never really listen to the soundtrack until this one   wonderful movie helms deep is thrilling battle
Dec 29 2011,negative,i watched all 3 of these movies in the span of a week and i honestly dont remember one thing about what makes this movie different from the other two  its all just a blurry 10 hours of the same crap
Dec 29 2011,positive,peter jackson cant help but make epic films great job of making the beloved books of tolkien and putting it on screen the action the acting the detail perfect
Dec 29 2011,positive,followed the book really well and was a good sequel to the first movie
Dec 28 2011,positive,the movie was really good it was just a little confusing and the movie was to long
Dec 28 2011,positive,i highly recommend the bluray extended edition
Dec 28 2011,positive,the two towers is everything what the first film was and needed to be thanks to great work from in front of the camara and behind it overall the two towers is everything that the series needs and more
Dec 28 2011,positive,my favorite of the trilogy timeless
Dec 28 2011,positive,second movie in the greatest trilogy of all time
Dec 27 2011,positive,good but not accurate
Dec 27 2011,positive,my favorite out of harry potter and star wars
Dec 27 2011,positive,the second entry in peter jacksons the lord of the rings film trilogy has the fellowship splitting into three groups as they continue their journey to the only place in the world where they can destroy the powerful ring among the new allies that accompany the members of the fellowship are a creature named gollum andy serkis who once used the ring and a walking talking tree named treebeard john rhysdavies although it has some of the same flaws as the fellowship of the ring and the return of the king the two towers easily ranks as the best in the series and that is due in large part to john rhysdavies performance as the bloodthirsty dwarf gimli who steals every scene that he is in
Dec 27 2011,positive,a great film with great action effects heart a epic score a great movie for everyone
Dec 27 2011,positive,45  part two in the lotr saga improves on every aspect over the first one particularly in pacing and variety as the two towers features an interesting multithreaded story that leads to an excellent standoff between the forces of evil wizard saruman lee and humanity peter jacksons own sfx company weta gets to really shine in conjuring up such a vivid world filled with all manner of beasts and fantastic buildings but very special mention must go to the character of gollum who is the result of a superb and pioneering motion capture performance by andy serkis lots to see
Dec 26 2011,positive,i like all the action
Dec 26 2011,positive,what issues id had with the fellowship of the ring have been more than made up for in the two towers the second installment of the lord of the rings trilogy frodo and sam are off on their own to continue their treacherous journey to mordor merry and pippin have been captured by the demonic urukhai and aragorn legolas and gimli are hot on their trail this film is a grandiose action adventure film like they gave us back in the distant days of an older coded hollywood system there is everything in this picture and it is at a much more deliberate yet never tedious pace watching the extended version of the film it clocks in at just under four hours yet i was ready and nearly willing to pop in the third and final chapter except that doing so would cost me another four hours of time and i dont have eight hours in a day which i can devote solely to watching movies
Dec 26 2011,positive,elves at the battle of helms deep    despite generally superb performances by this movies strong cast peter jackson committed an unforgivable sin in his butchery of tolkiens classic novel in this adaptation  i enjoyed most of it when i wasnt being offended by the liberties jackson took  the dialogue between elrond and arwen is especially goodmoving convincing poingiant even brilliant but tolkien deserves the credit for that not jackson  at least jackson had the good sense to preserve this dialogue unlike in return of the king which he butchered even more severely by omitting some of the best dialogue from the novel    fresh yes but not nearly as good as it could have been
Dec 26 2011,positive,my favorite of the trilogy the design alone is beautiful along with great actors and special effects it cant get better than this
Dec 26 2011,positive,the picturesque setting and the convincing acting often made me forget im watching a fantasy filmsuch compelling performances by the whole cast that it does not make us feel its a dramatization
Dec 25 2011,positive,the two towers follows after the fellowship of the ring and dilivers some good jokes and you will like the two towers better than the fellowship of the ring
Dec 25 2011,positive,i certainly enjoy these flicks
Dec 23 2011,positive,this wasnt the best yet it wasnt the worst it is really really good still i loved it i strongly reccomedn anyone also must go see movie its just that there were things missing from it and i felt it wasnt as good as the first one or the 3rd one also i thought it was a little slow some parts
Dec 23 2011,positive,if you read my review on the fellowship of the ring youll know exactly what i think of this one the only difference is that this time i get to see a clash not a few on many battle and i like it
Dec 23 2011,positive,long but watch it over again  again
Dec 22 2011,positive,epic strong willed and has the greatest battle scene in history
Dec 22 2011,positive,great action and amazing story
Dec 21 2011,positive,compared to the fellowship and the return of the king this movie is pretty bad but it isnt a bad movie its very good but the weakest of the trilogy    grade b
Dec 21 2011,positive,watching it right now its awesome
Dec 21 2011,positive,dissapointed after how good the first was still a well done film
Dec 21 2011,positive,the acting is magnificent and the visuals are as thrilling as ever beautifully directed by peter jackson the lord of the rings the two towers reigns as a superb epic fantasy film that should not be missed by any tolkiens fans
Dec 21 2011,negative,its characters are too two dimensional for me to care
Dec 20 2011,positive,i cant even imagine how ridiculous the production of this movie must have been
Dec 18 2011,positive,amazing movie the books are 100 better  
Dec 18 2011,positive,a solid improvement on the fellowship  the two towers offers brilliantly dramatic directing and visually impressive action sequences
Dec 17 2011,positive,the movie is loaded with epic battles scenes but i never thought for once it sacrificed story for action tough call to pick between this and the fellowship for my favorite one of the series but if you put a gun to my head id probably pick this one
Dec 17 2011,positive,and more walking and fighting and walking see comments about return of the king
Dec 15 2011,positive,the two towers perfectly bridges the differing styles of fellowship and return of the king with a much more laid back brooding atmosphere while its most impacting events typically epic battles hit in large waves spaced evenly across the film
Dec 15 2011,positive,as good as the first film this one stepped it up a notch on the special affects front tolkein would be truly proud of jacksons production of his most well known novels
Dec 15 2011,positive,this movie was sooooo exciting and now i cant get it off my mind
Dec 14 2011,positive,the journey to destroy the ring of sauron continues with the ring slowly taking over frodo  the second film in the lord of the ring trilogy offers many highlights like golums first appearance but overall its only the preparation for the epic finale in the third film    7  10
Dec 12 2011,positive,continuing on with the journey the characters have now split frodo and his friend sam elijah wood and sean aston respctively are continuing their journey with the ring but are now accompanied by a suspicious character smeagol andy serkis the two hobbits pippin and merry dominic monoghan and billy boyd respectively have now been captured by orcs and go on their own quest to stop them and the remaining men begin to discover the horrors that the orcs and along with the evil kingdom have caused the world in addition gandolf ian mcklennan returns after he falls down a cravass in underground cave after battle a firebreathing dragon as opposed to the 179 minute theatrical release i watched the 225 minute extendedcut and it is astonishingly superb this is an unbelievable experience filled with life involvement beauty and capitalizing on the superb traits of its predecessor the three hours and 45 minutes flew by length is never a problem nor anything else in this glorious film
Dec 11 2011,positive,best one of the trilogy
Dec 11 2011,positive,the two towers is brilliant a suitable continuation of the amazing work that was the fellowship of the ring where it falls short however would be the lingering lovesickness of arwen and aragorn whose dreamed romance takes up an unfortunate bite of time out of the already lengthy film yet the casting is perfect especially with the addition of andy serkis as gollum the beautifully imagined middleearth and her characters make this a sequel to be counted among the best such as godfather part ii aliens and the empire strikes back
Dec 10 2011,positive,a masterpiece that continues the brilliant legacy set by its predecessor
Dec 10 2011,positive,well written well directed amazing acting and special effects i think in 30 years the lotr movies will be mentioned in the same breath as star wars when teaching about movies that changed the world
Dec 8 2011,positive,my least favourite in the trilogy but still the third best movie of all time
Dec 7 2011,positive,probably on par with the first but lacks the same sense of journey again a terrific film though
Dec 5 2011,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time but all have already been said and done  except for a 3d version
Dec 5 2011,positive,the two towers manages to raise the bar even higher than its predecessor it also contains one of the best battle scenes ever
Dec 3 2011,positive,the helms deep battle scenes are my favorite  gotta love the action
Dec 3 2011,positive,come on this has to be one of the best trilogies ever
Dec 2 2011,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is the second adaption of the epic trilogy written by j r r tolkien and is one of the finest sequels ever put to film as well as one of the greatest films of alltime  peter jackson continues to amaze us with his passion and love for tolkiens literature and i would have to say that i think this film takes it up a notch from the previous film  the plot continues to show the journey of the fellowship and this movie really starts to show how sauron and his army are starting to attack and destroy middleearth  we see people being invaded from their homes armys being prepared for the final war and we really start to get the sense that all of this depends on frodo succeeding his mission  but my favorite addition to what makes the two towers so incredible is my favorite character of the lord of the rings trilogy gollum  gollum aka sméagol is such a deep and mesmerizing character because we see his backstory throughout the trilogy and how he actually used to be a good person but the temptations of the ring have split his personality into two and made him and disgusting creature  his creation is one of the main reason the lord of the rings is my favorite film ever made  the performances of sean astin ian mckellen elijah wood andy serkis and viggo mortensen continue to impress but i feel bernard hill is an underrated actor who should be remembered for his lasting a powerful performance in the film  the battle for helms deep is another reason that the two towers stands out in the trilogy because its by far the best battle in the trilogy and one of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed  i believe the battle truly stresses the gravity and darkness of battle and it truly captures the essence of why the lord of the rings is so important to cinema  howard shores brilliant score also proves to be one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever conducted as it really captures each scene of the movie brilliantly  the lord of the rings is the best trilogy ever made and the two towers is an incredible masterpiece as well as a great set up for the brilliant conclusion to the trilogy
Dec 2 2011,positive,ifirst thoughtthis movie would be awful but if you appreciate good writing of adventure and good scenery effects then you will like this movie the story line was good
Dec 1 2011,positive,the 2 towers is just as goodeven better
Nov 30 2011,positive,i love the whole lord of the rings trilogy and this movie is no exception
Nov 30 2011,positive,a triumphh  one of the greatest films ever created and will always be  there is no comparison to this movie simply stunning
Nov 28 2011,positive,by far the two towers and the return of the king are my favorite you will not be disapointed at all 3legolas greenleaf3
Nov 27 2011,positive,my favorite out of the trilogy this one is where all the fun happens
Nov 27 2011,positive,once again great and wanted to see more the soundtrack and the scenes are beautiful
Nov 27 2011,positive,one of my all time favorites
Nov 27 2011,positive,brilliant second part  awesome must see in sequence
Nov 26 2011,positive,i love the way this one begins the story is darker then the first
Nov 26 2011,positive,not so boring and with a lot more special effects and action this one takes the caked
Nov 25 2011,positive,love this movie action packed must see
Nov 25 2011,positive,takes a huge turn from the first film but does it oh so well
Nov 25 2011,positive,my favorite of the trilogy the darkest time in the series pulled a lot of emotion and triumph
Nov 25 2011,positive,this second installment is even better than the first  i remember feeling a genuine sense of awe and wonder when i first got to see gollum and treebeard come to life on the big screen  this movie really nurtures the imagination while at the same time offering an incredible amount of epic battles that will satisfy most movie fans  i love this movie
Nov 23 2011,positive,the lord of the rings trilogy is one of the few film franchises that gets better with the sequels
Nov 22 2011,positive,while not as magical as the first the two towers doesnt fall short of thrills with its action sequences and emotional battles
Nov 22 2011,positive,breath taking sequel  a deserving sequel with amazing action sequences and wonderful storyline
Nov 21 2011,positive,the most epic battle movie of the  year
Nov 21 2011,positive,one of the best sequels made
Nov 21 2011,positive,weakest of the three films
Nov 20 2011,positive,they say its the best of the series yet i fall asleep everytime i try watching it  still its 100      there is a lot of passion put into these films
Nov 19 2011,positive,second in the trilogy and excellent storytelling  great cast with plenty of action and drama  love this
Nov 19 2011,positive,just as amazing as the first
Nov 17 2011,positive,entertaining thrilling and improves on the first in pretty much every department
Nov 16 2011,positive,definitely not as good as the book but these series of movies continue to be wonderful achievements in filmmaking
Nov 15 2011,positive,continuation of amazement how did this movie not win best pic great action and adventure
Nov 15 2011,positive,love this trilogy
Nov 14 2011,positive,the best movies of all time no movies will ever surpass these movies peter jackson did a freaking amazing job on them and i cannot wait for the hobbit
Nov 13 2011,negative,i dont really like any of these movies but  
Nov 13 2011,positive,ths movie turned out almost exactly like the books  it is a fabulous movie  vigo did a great job and seeing sean astin again was wonderful
Nov 13 2011,positive,read my review here 
Nov 13 2011,positive,if you want to watch a movie watch this one
Nov 12 2011,positive,seems like a somewhat convenient story development  the movie though fittingly cliffhangs and pulls no punches that part iii is where you need to be
Nov 12 2011,positive,the only attempt that hollywood adapted jrr tolkiens epic fantasy novels before the liveaction films was in the form of a 1978 animation film that compressed all three novels in the span of 132 minutes a decade later director peter jackson made his name as part of hollywoods elite directors with the liveaction adaptation of the novels that were filmed backtobacktoback in jacksons native new zealand and released one year after the other around the holidays with the visual and makeup effects to create the fantasy world of middle earth the film also featured an outstanding ensemble that include eiljah wood as frodo oscarnominee ian mckellen as gandalf and oscarnominee viggo mortensen as aragon howard shores score can go down as one of the most recognizable score of all time the visual effects and the action sequences during the big battle is one of the highlights of the trilogy andy serkis performance as gollum is truly the best performance in the trilogy thanks to motion capture technology
Nov 9 2011,positive,the two towers be it the extended version or theatrical cut is as perfect a fantasy epic as this feeble mind can imagine and as perfect a cinematic adaptation of tolkiens work cinematic not staunchly faithful mind you as the fellowship of the ring jacksons films will always have their critics even the two towers arguably the most beloved and critically acclaimed of the three but i remain amazed not just by the film itself but by its ability to continue speaking to me after so many viewings to continue drawing viewers to its fold after so many years to still stand so high above every fantasy film and franchise thats arrived in its wake
Nov 8 2011,positive,you could call it the greatest achievement in cinema history a staggering colossal experience that towers see all the huge words im using here above all the rest in its genre filled to the brim with unforgettable characters spectacular battles and unsurpassed overall epicness the lord of the rings is just about as good as it gets
Nov 7 2011,positive,the best in the trilogy without a doubt the performances are amped up though sadly ian mckellen is not quite as memorable the visuals are a sheer delight and the battle sequences are breathtaking
Nov 7 2011,positive,the lord of the ring films are cool but if you have read the book they are a little lame
Nov 5 2011,positive,this viewers personal favorite film in the trilogy with the way it builds towards a spectacular finish the battle of helms deep is in my opinion the greatest battle ever created in movies the emotional attachment to characters is heightened even further and from a film making standpoint jackson continues to astound on a technical level
Nov 5 2011,positive,it didnt impress me as much as fellowship of the ring but it is still a marvelous followup that fails to make a costly mistake the battle scenes accompanied by christian allegories could have carried the entire film as well as the addition of smeegul who is more than likely the most diabolical villian in all of cinema as he sets out to steal the precious
Nov 4 2011,positive,the masterpiece continues it gets more desperate and becomes a great epic swashbuckler along the way
Nov 4 2011,positive,nice battles and almost interesting conversations very well done
Nov 1 2011,positive,while this is definitely my least favorite of the lotr films it is still very watchable
Oct 31 2011,neutral,for certain edits there is no excuse
Oct 27 2011,positive,phenomenal performances directing special effects damn near everything is impeccable in this lord of the rings sequel
Oct 24 2011,positive,a true masterpiece peter jackson has done the impossible he has successfully captured the brilliance of tolkiens work on film     the acting in this film is extraordinary each and every actor fits the role perfectly visually the film was awe inspiring turning new zealand into middle earth if the film wasnt spectacular enough the music amplifies its beauty tenfold truly expressing the epic beauty of tolkiens books    there is only one downside to this film its too short even the extended edition while there is a lot of detail it would be impossible to show everything in the book if they did it would require about 3 films per book
Oct 23 2011,positive,this is my favorite of the three lord of the rings films the characters were well established in the first film so the second instalment is freed up for more exploration of middle earth and more interesting things to happen the battle of helms deep is among one of my favorite parts i really feel that the supporting characters make the film i dont find frodo that interesting personally so its nice to see the relationships between all the different actors
Oct 20 2011,positive,its nothing like the book but ive learned to live with the changes throughout the years  in my opinion its a typical sequel  its good but not great like the first film  nevertheless its still a very wellmade masterpiece and the helms deep sequence is one of the greatest action sequences ever
Oct 15 2011,positive,im a dork and here are 5 stars to prove it
Oct 13 2011,positive,my least favourite in the trilogy but is a smash hit none the less
Oct 13 2011,positive,grand battle sequences emotional storytelling amazing characters and a spectacular script all help the two towers become one of the greatest film sequels of all time
Oct 11 2011,positive,in my opinion the weakest of the three movies but its rather common that the beginning and the ending are the most memorable parts of the story so this isnt really that surprising and dont get me wrong the battle of helms deep is pure brilliance in motion but the movie has some parts that are just unnecessary like the supposed death of aragorn or the fact that gimli is hardly more than a comic relief moat of the time those two things for example are a bit distracting and make the overall movie weaker not by much because this is still a great movie but still
Oct 11 2011,positive,i really enjoy the battle scene i dont know how much times shouting in cinema hall
Oct 9 2011,negative,i love the begining and the ending of the movies this one seems to go on forever and doesnt really enhance the plot at all i kept watching the clock wondering when it was going to come to an end there was no climatic point
Oct 9 2011,positive,all joined forces to win a battle against the dark side  and i love it    parents should never bury their children    my precious
Oct 8 2011,positive,even better than fellowship
Oct 7 2011,positive,with a completely over bloated running time and a plot that goes no where this is the one weak point in the trilogy
Oct 6 2011,positive,entertaining and emotionally satisfying this is great stuff
Oct 5 2011,positive,once again peter jackson does the novels justice with this amazing sequel just as emotional and action packed as the first with top performances and inspirational special effects most notably the introduction of gollum andy serkis portrays gollum with stateoftheart motion capture special effects the cgi with the character is done so well sometimes you forget that hes not real
Oct 5 2011,positive,two thumbs up always and foreverit keeps getting better and better
Oct 4 2011,positive,not only does this film have more action and drama than the first one this sequel really shows the importance of why the fellowship are going through so much trouble over the ring sauron desires world conquest and will eliminate anyone and everyone who opposes him  plus it is fun to see gollum become a part of the journey and to see his character development or characters if you include smeagol  the flow of the film is good has interesting new characters both heroes and villains breathtaking settings and the action will blow you away  for those who watch this it will leave you waiting for more and possibly interest you in the books  arguably the best of the three films
Oct 3 2011,positive,saw this with my cousins in nj
Oct 2 2011,positive,peter jackson keeps the momentum from the first film clipping along at a heated pace in the two towers once again the special effects and set pieces take center stage but the actors all slip comfortably back into their respective roles andy serkis as gollum is easily the greatest creation to emerge in the sequel the only issue i have with this movie is the fact that it fails to honor tolkiens novel and makes a break from the source material through the last hour still the two towers delivers on high expectations and leaves viewers fervent for the finale
Oct 2 2011,positive,much like star wars the middle one is the best
Oct 1 2011,positive,only minor quibbles middle chapter problems hokier writing provides epic moments of battle and emotion the stakes rise to stirring results technically superb as always the battle for helms deep is one of cinemas greatest battle sequences
Oct 1 2011,positive,the series goes on perfectly with confidence peter jackson he continues to relive this movie
Sep 30 2011,positive,could have been better lets be honest guys
Sep 30 2011,positive,my favorite of the three films the two towers doubles my love of lord of the rings peter jackson sure knew what he was doing i cannot see a reason why anyone would not like this film
Sep 27 2011,positive,not as strong as the first one but the end leaves you going woo woo
Sep 25 2011,positive,better than the firstthe darkness is amplified and the story is better put
Sep 23 2011,positive,definitely the high point of the trilogy like empire strikes back it has a sense of bleakness about it but you hope that things will turn out better it does a really good job at tugging on your heart
Sep 18 2011,positive,i give the same review to this film as the other two movies of this trilogy
Sep 17 2011,positive,one of the best films ive ever had the pleasure of watching
Sep 17 2011,positive,greatest movies of all time
Sep 17 2011,positive,peter jackson left the entire world on a cliffhanger when he finished the fellowship of the ring after having done such an impressive job with the first film and then having the balls to stay true to the source by finishing as he did he was almost setting himself up to fail giving himself a task even greater than the original undertaking a sequel not just any sequel a sequel to film being touted as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made and himself being declared a genius this sort of hype is almost impossible to live up to almost    taking up where its predecessor left off the two towers follows aragorn gimli and legolas as they chase down a troop of urukhai frodo and sam as they journey further towards mordor and merry and pippin as they well get into lots of trouble    the story is much more divided in comparison to the first of the series with a fellowship of nine journeying together rather than three different groups and their various shenanigans this is the first challenge to overcome for filmmaker peter jackson how to tell all these stories in under four hours not only that but how to allot time to the different storylines without 1 making it boring and 2 losing focus on the main story which just happens to be the more boring aspect of the source material frodo and sams trek towards mordor after all how inventive can one director be with half the story taking up by two diminutive figures walking towards a place which they dont actually reach by the time the films finishes    its almost as if jackson hasnt noticed these issues as the second film is just as fulfilling and storydriven as the first without sacrificing any major plot points or basically getting rid of anything that would cause a fan outcry yes technically the ents do show up to help at the battle of helms deep and no we dont get to see merry and pippin in treebeards house or talking to quickbeam but in the end peter jackson has conquered these seemingly mammoth tasks with ease this is a reflection on jacksons instinct for pace as the extended edition shows that these timeconsuming though unnecessary scenes were in fact filmed but were left on the editting floor jacksons fearlessness with the source material yet mindfullness of it as well means that the story is left completely intact enough to appease any fan jackson has also made room for the lighter moments as well revelling in the joy of discovery when merry and pippin first encounter treebeard and having time for jokes between the doubleact which just keeps getting better of legolas and gimli jackson doesnt forget about his characters either keeping the film from feeling hollow by introducing the beautiful miranda otto as nevertobe love interest eowyn and the abandonedbyhiscountry eomer as well as extending his existing characters in merry and pippin who only get more endearing frodo and sam whose seemingly unflappable relationship is beginning to show some strain and even though gandalfs character goes under a major revamp hes still the same enigmatic mentor as before albeit slightly more badass its this attention to detail which makes peter jacksons work so watchable all the way through the crazy runtime    shores score is as strong as ever this time bringing the beautiful theme of the world of men to the fore shores understanding of motif and mood is pivotal here even more so than fellowship as the story isnt as driving as its predecessor because of this shores score is able to ferry us through the slower moments and throughout the entire film    the performances here are just as textured as they were in the first film not only that but the sequel factor means that actors are able to loosen up a little more in particular in the case of orlando blooms legolas and john rhysdavies gimli the two of them have more fun than it should be possible to have in an epic of this size and they pull it off without ever feeling camp or not taking it seriously enough ian mckellens gandalf is still the standout of the series but its great to see the rest of the cast becoming more and more involved in their characters viggo mortensens aragorn is one of the performances which shows a lot of progression his presence has more gravitas in this one and his character is more layered than the original more difficult to read elijah wood has much less to do in this film leaving him to keep mostly the same expression on his face for most of the film while this may be true to story it does occassionally make you wish that he had something else to do than walk around some rocks for a while sean astins sam is similarly beleagured and while their parts of the film are integral to the story you sometimes wish that wed move back to the interesting parts a little sooner bernard hill makes a great addition to the cast as theoden as well as his onscreen daughter eowyn played with fragile strength by miranda otto brad dourifs grima wormtongue is fantastic a slimy manipulative groveller who snivells perfectly through every scene hes in    another of towers achievements lies in another of its new characters gollum gollum is a completely cg creation performed by andy serkis with groundbreaking technology enabling serkis to interact with the actual actors and thus makes the performances all the more real this innovation makes for incredible viewing as one of the more unfilmmable sections of tolkiens work is brought to life onscreen serkis performance is largely discounted in terms of acting accolades but its incredible to see his work here set the benchmark for motion capture    but all these technical factors fade into the background at the battle of helms deep a battle scene so epic that it drowns out everything that comes before it ten thousand urukhai facing off against rohans much depleted forces is so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to spot any kind of flaws in the rest of the film jackson seamlessly blend cg with fantastic costume and makeup to create an entirely believeable all out war which lives up to the scenes detailed in the book and revells in the little moments like legolas riding a shield down some stairs or a rousing speech from king to king jacksons sense of pace throughout the battle is fantastic moving from the entmoot to sam and frodo without ever losing momentum and the coupdegrace of gandalfs arrival is as breathtaking a moment as the series brings in any of its three films    while this may be the weaker cinematically of the three films the fact that im still giving it five stars shows you just how high the bar is set for this series the fact is that despite lacking the grandeur of the third and the sense of wonder and scariness of the first its still a better film than 90 of the blockbusters hollywood vomits up on regular basis truly incredible filmmaking    defining scene  the battle at helms deep of course    quotes  stupid fat hobbit    whats happening out there  shall i describe it to you or would you like me to find you a box    theyre taking the hobbits to isengard
Sep 16 2011,positive,probably the worst one of the trilogy but it is so close it doesnt even matter it still deserves as much praise as the first one did continuing the best story of the decade
Sep 15 2011,positive,a bigger and more entertaining adventure
Sep 14 2011,positive,possibly the best entry in the trilogy although all three are so good and uniform that it is hard to say one if better than the otherthey are essentially one long film  everything from the first film continues on here with a few more epically fantastic cg battle scenes  andy serkis as gollum is fantastic and probably one of the best uses of performance capture at least up to this point  cg can be amazing when the time and money is put into it and it is used properly
Sep 10 2011,positive,the second film of the trilogy begins where the first left off frodo and sam are now on there own without their fellow hobbits merry and pippin who have been captured by the orcs of sarumons army who ultimately escape and flee into the darkness of fangorn forrest but frodo and sam dont know theyre being followed by the lurking slime known as smeagol who wants his precious back once again and aragorn legolas and gimli are led to rohan by gandolf the white who was presumed to have died in the first film where king theoden is being taken over by the evil powers of sarumon king theodens niece ãowyn feels that aragorn and his men have what it takes to defeat sarumons army with rohans army joining them in battle ãowyn ends up falling for aragorn but aragorn doesnt know if he feels the same knowing he made his promise to return to arwen and with the battle between good and evil at the end it just shows that saurons army will keep growing and frodo and sam need to keep moving the two towers is an amazing followup to fellowship and features the same everamazing cast and adding the new characters like king theoden faramir and the amazing smeagol voiced by andy serkis peter jacksons direction style really showed off in this chapter and made everyone excited for return of the king which rightfully deserved everyone one of its 11 oscars people who arent fans or havent heard of lotr should be aware of what theyre missing out on truly the movie experience of a lifetime
Sep 10 2011,positive,i think its the best of the three because it spends the most time with the most interesting characters sam and gollum  but its still too long and has too many superfluous characters
Sep 10 2011,positive,the king in the story is the human warrior aragorn viggo mortensen but peter jackson is the true lord of these rings
Sep 8 2011,positive,one of the best storys told on screen all three are a must see for any film fan
Sep 6 2011,positive,after the first ones ending it picks up right after and continues the epic fantasy adventure the visuals introduction of new characters ie gollum more breathtaking battle scenes and an equally intriguing story makes this adventure another peice of genius work the music soundtrack is also breathtaking as the movie prolongs note this about the extended version
Sep 6 2011,positive,the best overall chapter of the lord of the rings trilogy the film particularly the extended edition provides phenomenal character development jawdropping cinematography and thrilling battle sequences the battle of helms deep is a highlight of cinema a classic heroic stand against evil
Sep 5 2011,positive,the lord of the rings  the two towers follows on from the fellowship of the ring no trouble at all
Sep 5 2011,positive,its drags on sometimes but it leads perfectly and the build up is really hardhitting its flawless just like the others
Sep 1 2011,positive,two towers is a great sequel that a good continuation of the fellowship of the ringthe plot is the sme but all the subplots and action keep this film engagingwhat is really great is the two towers allows characters to grow from the original like empire strikes backthe special effects are amazingthe design of gollumthe walking trees is astoundingthe makeup effects of the orcs and goclins is allows goodthe action in this is spectacularin particular the battle sequence at helms deepif you havent seen a lord of the rings movie your missing out
Aug 31 2011,positive,probably my favorite of the three
Aug 31 2011,positive,despite seeing this first than the first one i totally enjoyed despite a lot of subplots
Aug 31 2011,positive,bad ass sequel i think its my favorite one
Aug 31 2011,positive,bad ass sequel i think its my favorite one
Aug 31 2011,positive,the two towers is my favorite of the trilogy 8510
Aug 31 2011,positive,a perfect start for the final battle everyone is now geared up on how it will all end lotrthe two towers is a cunning grandeur amazing climax for the trilogy  you wouldnt dare miss
Aug 29 2011,positive,ohhhhhhhhhh baby the two towers this second part in jackson film adaptation of jrr tolkiens trilogy is outstanding once gain jackson does not fail to bring every major important detail from the book into the big screen the helms deep battle and the last march of the ents are to this day my two favorite battle scenes in all of cinema at the end of the movie i found myself wondering how jackson could top it with the final part the return of the king he would not dissapoint
Aug 29 2011,positive,such great movies this one is no exception
Aug 29 2011,positive,the bridge scene was pretty ridiculous
Aug 29 2011,positive,the best one out of the 3
Aug 29 2011,positive,it has the best war scenes
Aug 28 2011,positive,i could not believe that a sequel can be that good even i felt that it was slightly better than the earlier one the story concluded from the previous part and it have more wars going on which is a treat with marvelous cg effects this time the pace was faster than the fellowship of the ring the same efforts from peter jackson are clearly visible again everyone has done a great job in their respective acts i could easily watch the extended version without getting bored the character of gollum is quite interestingly made fit in the story  the battle of isengard is what this one is wholly about its quite a lengthy war but its one of the jawdropper overall i think again every technical aspect touched almost perfection although i feel this one was better a little still i dont feel like giving it a perfect 10 again a must watch
Aug 27 2011,positive,theres a lot of action and its pretty easy to keep watching despite the fact that its 3 hours long
Aug 27 2011,positive,let me just say i hate gollum i feel no sympathy for him whatsoever however his place in the two towers is beyond important whatever the case the movie is just as amazing as the fellowship
Aug 26 2011,positive,if you thought the lord of the rings couldnt get any more epic than you were wrong helms deep was like the best war ive ever seen in a movieuntill the return of the king lol
Aug 25 2011,positive,better than the first action packed suspenseful and most importantly entertaining
Aug 23 2011,positive,the second chapter is generally a great fantasy film with the same level as the previous chapter but greater in scale on effects and emotions as well being a little more serious its also a comparison to star wars episode v in scales and setting things up for the next and final chapter a    full review coming soon  with better wording and requires another viewing probably
Aug 23 2011,positive,more graphic in its violence and more fantastic in its imaginings than the first film
Aug 22 2011,positive,the two towers balances spectacular action with emotional storytelling leaving audiences both wholly satisfied and eager for the final chapter
Aug 20 2011,positive,one of the best films ever made  even better on bluray  extended version
Aug 20 2011,positive,i have to admit i enjoyed the battle of helms deep even more so than the battle for gondor in the trilogys conclusion  jackson also handles golems character and impact on the overall story with brilliance  lastly the characters of rohan add another level of depth to the storys complexity without feeling tacked on
Aug 20 2011,positive,except for its arduous length and excessive amount of characters there is really nothing else to complain about this movie
Aug 14 2011,positive,after thinking about it a lot i cant really complain about two towers even if i only saw the extended cut which is probably half an hour longer than fellowship of the ring
Aug 14 2011,positive,the journey continues but this time splits into three separate trips frodo and sam have gollum to contend with played by the brilliant andy serkis who becomes the star of the show merry and pippin have fangorn forest to negotiate with an ent and the others negotiate rohan and battle 10000 urukhai at helms deep jackson continues to show his brilliance keeping all the various strands moving along nicely absolute genius
Aug 13 2011,positive,the tricky middle one of the lord of the rings film trilogy falls slightly below the bar set by its predecessor and the final part but it is still a superb film
Aug 11 2011,positive,epic stompd harry potter anyday
Aug 11 2011,neutral,i must be the only one who doesnt understand the whole thing about the 2 towers p
Aug 9 2011,positive,i love the scenery in this movie i think that in this case the movie surpassed the books they are too complicated to read for me excellent film
Aug 9 2011,positive,it may be the weakest of the trilogy though not by much but this is still 5 star quality entertainment
Aug 9 2011,positive,has some slow parts but allinall the characters are more fleshed out and the story continues with this welcome addition to the trilogy
Aug 8 2011,positive,5 stars  faultless  these are so good  watch them  on to part 3 now even more entertainment wicked
Aug 7 2011,positive,extended version in bluray format   wow 
Aug 6 2011,positive,this is the second best movie of the decade after its sequel the return of the king batlle scenes are perfect  and so are the visual effects
Aug 5 2011,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
Aug 5 2011,positive,one of the best movies ever made
Aug 5 2011,positive,thems hobbits er homosexuals
Aug 4 2011,positive,sam mr frodo put the ring on just this once disappear   frodo i cant you were right sam the ring is taking me if i put it on he will find me     a new power is rising    peter jacksons second film in his epic fantasyadventure trilogy isnt quite as good as the first but its still one of the best movies of the 21st century jacksons lord of the rings are second to none when it comes to storytelling and visuals these movies are so entertaining and fun to watch all the details of these movies are just ridiculous in how perfect they are the battle sequences are amazing to say the least    the two towers is as jaw dropping as the first its a complete spectacle to describe the lord of the ring films as anything other then masterpieces is selling the films short its really hard to describe to people who havent seen these moviealthough there arent that many left how good they are i actually rewatched this trilogy with a friend who hadnt seen it when we started the first movie youd a thought i was about to kill him needless to say he got hooked after the first 15 minutes just like everyone else and ended up loving the series     no matter how many times i see this movie i am always amazed every time i watch it i notice things i hadnt the time before the lord of the ring movies are probably the most fun movies to go back and rewatch as you can always take something new away from it
Aug 3 2011,positive,not as good as return of the king or fellowship just more walking to a volcano see clerks ii for reference
Aug 3 2011,positive,i had never heard about this trilogy until i saw it in the teatres amazing
Aug 2 2011,positive,i personally thought this was the worst of the three movies
Aug 1 2011,positive,just as epic as the first one  final fantasy vi totally took from this story when they split up the resistance into three different sections  this split however is what made the pacing staccatolike but regardless still a great film  watch the special features so you can seriously appreciate the pain that this film crew endured to make this film
Aug 1 2011,positive,fun movie long run time left out a whole bunch of stuff from the book
Aug 1 2011,positive,possibly better than the first
Aug 1 2011,positive,the glue between the first and the last loved it
Jul 31 2011,negative,the worst of the middle earth films until the hobbit movies rolled around and shit really got awful just like its predecessor this film is bland and indifferently acted but also lacks the grand scope and epic feel that the first film brought
Jul 30 2011,positive,the weakest of the three films the two towers is saved mostly from serkiss brilliant performance as gollum the rest of the film is rather repetitive and the famous battle of helms deep is underwhelming compared to what comes in the next installment not a bad film but not great
Jul 30 2011,positive,epic the scale of this film is amazing it has amazing graphics that still hold up ten years later great landscapes cool battles and jam packed with emotion and feeling although lotr should be looked at collectively instead of individual films but if i must the two towers is a iconic fantasy film that absolutely should be seen by everyone and the fact that these films run 3 hours each is good thing since that means  the audience gets that much more content to sink our teeth into if thats your thing if you embrace the scale of the trilogy and the richdetailed lore that supports middle earth then lotr provides 5 star entertainment
Jul 30 2011,positive,i review that extended bluray version here there are no problems with the colour again thinking of original material the script is excellent but with some hiccups the theme of justified is critized especially by faramir but it seems this is halfbaked and would need some more reaching over the script the character of gollum  smeagol is written excellently and the faramir storyline gives some  yet a little bit halfbaked  bone what principles are you willing to follow or let to go just to get approvement of your fathers overall actors do splendid work and i find soundtrack really good
Jul 29 2011,positive,the lotr series are outstanding best fantasy movies of our times so far and classics well into the future
Jul 28 2011,positive,i dont really see this as a sequel just as a continuation very good nonetheless be sure to watch the extended edition
Jul 27 2011,positive,if its so great why am i so bored
Jul 25 2011,positive,the battle of helmsdeep is unmatched
Jul 25 2011,negative,same movie three times
Jul 25 2011,positive,more of the same from the first
Jul 25 2011,negative,unnecessarily long cheesy dialog  i felt quite disconnected from it throughout other than its special effects  great production value not much else going for it for me
Jul 25 2011,positive,jackson gets the ball rolling and never stops and im grateful for that
Jul 25 2011,positive,absolutely brilliant in every way  the casting is inspired each charicter looked the image of their paintings in my tolkien book
Jul 24 2011,positive,the second part in this trilogy was reminding me of the second part of the matrix movie or even the 1st part of the last harry potter movie its the in between you know that its not the ending but its going yo end on some kind of crescendo getting back to the bahai elements in this movie one of the characters say something along the lines what can men do against such reckless hate the response to this reminds me of ruhi book 1 if a thought of war comes apose it with a stronger thought of peace if a thought of hate comes apose it with an even stronger thought of love i like that part 3 tomorrow ladies and gents 
Jul 24 2011,positive,peter jackson brings his agame when with the two towers improving upon the original and paving the way to the return of the king
Jul 23 2011,positive,the second entry in the lord of the rings trilogy manages to surpass the first film in every way  packed with more adventure and action than the first  andy serkis gives a very chilling performance as gollum despite being in a motioncapture suit  the battle of helms deep is pure awesomeness
Jul 23 2011,positive,greatest movies of all time period all 3  great cast great actinggreat storygreat actiongreat romancegreat directing completely glued to the screen everytime i watch them goat no doubtthe trilogy is purely perfection
Jul 22 2011,positive,a part two of a trilogy that rivals theempire strikes back a great achievement
Jul 21 2011,positive,excellent if just a bit melodramatic  made my nerdy heart happy though
Jul 21 2011,positive,the high point of the series and perfectly positioning the finale
Jul 19 2011,positive,it follows the story with no problem
Jul 19 2011,positive,just like harry potter i think all lotr movies are cool but i dont get why the obsession
Jul 18 2011,positive,im aware this is the best rated movie of the trilogy yet it is my least favorite  why because of peter jackson  nevermind when gandalf arrives in his white horse a la john wayne or when the uruk hai runs with the torch as if he was going to light the olympic flame hell i might even be able to forgive the scene with legolas and the skateboard like shield   the butchery of the story is what took it too far king theodens character was done all sorts of wrong in this movie the corny ass scene where aragorn falls off and winds up back in the camp after his horse saves him as he holds arwens necklace was dripping syrup so corny it was the relationship between legolas and gimli was turned around for the worst i wasnt expecting it to be loyal to the book 100 but you cant simply put stuff there that was meant the opposite way and the worst part is that for example theodens character change and gimlilegolas relationship went back to how it was written in the third so this one seems like an anomaly of sorts  the cherry on top of the cake for me to dislike this movie is that peter jackson cant hide an infatuation he has with elves infatuation that tolkien didnt have so he adds them in the battle of helms deep just because he wants elves there even if it changes the actual story told in the book where it is a stand of humankind against saruman not humankind going to cower to caves while the elves come to save the day something they dont do in the book trilogy they are too busy leaving middle earth  visually this movie is stunning and the ents were just like how i had imagined as a kid sadly this is peter jacksons version of the books and how he reads emenjoys them not a movie about the book
Jul 18 2011,positive,favorite of the trilogy
Jul 18 2011,positive,lord of the rings the two towers puts yet another trophy on the mantle of director peter jackson and his powerhouse cast and crew its darker more epic and ultimately more engaging than the first movie a fantastic film
Jul 17 2011,positive,a suitable change of gear it worked
Jul 17 2011,positive,the adventure continues as frodo and sam venture across rugged lands carrying the one ring elsewhere aragorn legolas and gimli are out to find the captured merry and pippin      with continued splendor and vast scope jackson gives us another faithful and awesome adaption of tolkiens the two towers      each actor does amazing bringing each character to life gollum played by andy serkis delivers an astounding performance and advancement in technological achievement      a perfect sequel and deserving of every award the series eventually got
Jul 17 2011,positive,best fantasy stuff ever with thrilling parts great pics and a nice cast
Jul 16 2011,positive,the action is incredible it is even in a way more thrilling than the fellowship of the ring but the only problem with this movie is that in certain moemnts it turns very slowly
Jul 16 2011,positive,the movie was perfect the acting of the stars as well as the story line was magestic this time around the movie carefully followed and depicted the events which occured in the book there was no fault which i could personally find and i am delighted with the vision of peter jackson everyone should watch the movie as well as it predecessor and successor
Jul 15 2011,positive,loved it a huge lotr fan
Jul 13 2011,positive,honestly the greatest war scenes of any lotr movies were seen in here what a way to follow up the first film and not spoiling a good story the two towers kept it nice action was great great movie
Jul 13 2011,positive,the into was just amazinggandalf fighting a balrogwha a fantastic scenebut my most fevorit scen is at the min of moriajust fabulous
Jul 12 2011,positive,i have wanted to see this trilogy for a while  finally got to watch them  not only that but i watched the extended versions  the first one was a bit slow for me but i have a short attention span  add  it seemed like as the movies went on they got better  more exciting  all in all i enjoyed them  im not sure id sit through 12 hours of it again though
Jul 11 2011,positive,my favourite of the series
Jul 10 2011,positive,for what its worth this is a review on the extended edition    i spent most of my review of fellowship gushing over the production values the actors the music the direction cinematography the sense of history etc  ill save you the regurgitation of it here and only mention that the same level of quality continues on into the two towers    where as fellowship centered on a group of characters the entire running time two towers has them split up into three groups  the first consist of aragorn legolas and gimli as they find themselves in rohan home to the horse lords  the rohirrim are i suppose your typical quaint villagers most commonly found in fantasy epics  a little more beefedup historywise of course  theyre under direct threat of saruman  lest you forgot he strolls around his tower of orthanc building an army of super orcs urukhai and burning the surrounding lands to make way for an industrial age  rohans king theoden is not willing to risk open war so he decides to evacuate his people to the fortress of helms deep  there with aragorn fighting by his side he will make his last stand    meanwhile merry and pippin find themselves in the company of a tree  well if you want to get technical an ent talking tree named treebeard  id like to think his treeparents had a sense of humor when naming him  anywho merry finds himself wanting to play a bigger role in the battle for middleearth so he pushes treebeard and his ent friends to go to war with saruman    lastly and most importantly as far as the one ring is concerned frodo and sam make their way through emyn muil the dead marshes and right up to the black gates of mordor in their quest to cast the ring into the fires of mount doom  it doesnt take them long to get lost but they find a guide in smeagolgollum the previous owner of the ring before bilbo and another tragic figure in the lord of the rings trilogy    aragorn and the plight of rohan take center stage in this film and thats all fine and dandy  the introduction of rohan and much of its inhabitants make for a welcome change of pace  theoden king tends to babble on a bit much about    everything but finally acts with some balls come the films finale  theres also a love interest introduced in eowyn the kings niece  its not much of a love story mind you as aragorns heart still belongs to arwen but its an interesting angle nonetheless  i also mentioned last time that the characters of gimli and legolas got the short end of the stick  here theyre fleshed out a bit more  sure legolas is given most of the token badass moments and gimli is the comic relief    but for the most part it works because come the end of the film you really do enjoy the two and their constant game of trying to one up each other even in battle  of course gandalf plays more of an extended cameo in this flick but hes always a welcome addition    merry and pippin unfortunately have most of the boring stuff right up to the climax  ents are deliberately slow creatures and right when the movie is in the middle of something interesting sometimes it will cut to these guys and the pace slows to a crawl  still theres a great moment towards the end when the ents march on the tower of orthanc and fuck up sarumans shit so to speak  its the ultimate act of nature vs industry and a great moment of catharsis for those sick of treebeard droning on and on about trees    in frodos quest well theyre honestly not given a whole lot to do this movie  they walk  they walk some more  the interesting stuff is done via gollum the tortured soul always at war with himself and always in pursuit of the ring  gollum was the first cg character that people actually bought into and cared for  hes eccentric hes funny and hes compelling  the hobbit gang does run into faramir and then we get a bit more background on the sons of gondor but that aside this isnt their movie    to be honest this film was always my least favorite of the trilogy but that doesnt mean it isnt an incredible story  yeah i think this one has the same flaws as the first what with the incredibly long running time and some superfluous scenes but thats to be expected  what were given in return is a fantasy rich with great characters incredible locales and music and some great action  for those who like their epic battles helms deep is about as thrilling as it gets    the two towers like the other two lord of the rings films before and after it has a hurdle you have to get over  but if youre willing to go for it it almost ceases to become a movie and you feel yourself just getting transported into another world for a few hours  for me thats exactly what i look for in a fantasy epic and the best compliment that it can receive
Jul 10 2011,positive,awesome film with epic action great story
Jul 10 2011,positive,this movie was great the action scenes were exciting and fast paced and the actors brought tons more humor to this film than they did in the previous installment
Jul 9 2011,positive,weakest of the bunch but still amazing
Jul 9 2011,positive,kind of slow with all of the wandering to be done but just fine outside of that
Jul 8 2011,positive,excellent film excellent renditionjust perfection well almost p
Jul 8 2011,positive,tolkein would be proud if he knew his books were good enough to allow their screen adaptations to break the golden 2 12 hour max rule and still be masterpieces
Jul 7 2011,negative,fell asleep again cant believe people ever enjoyed this movie
Jul 7 2011,positive,best of all three if one had to be chosen
Jul 7 2011,positive,insanely good the battle of helms deep is so epic and grand in scale the monologue that sam gives at the end is amazing
Jul 6 2011,positive,legolas a red sun rises blood has been spilled this night     the battle for middleearth begins     i was amazed by how much better this was then the first one with more intense action better story great characters still and even better looking visuals definitely a must see for a great sequel improved in every way possible
Jul 6 2011,positive,everything about this film is epic the characters the battles but especially the emotion the emotion is what carries the two towers into iconic status
Jul 6 2011,positive,most satisfying movie in the trilogy
Jul 4 2011,positive,this is one of the best the lord of the rings film my favourite scene is the battle of helms deep what an amazing actionpacked i ever seen   viggo mortensen is one of the best hero characters as aragorn and brings an excellent performance with his amazing swordfights flunts and horseracer in this fantasy film of the lord of the rings series gollum shines in a muchwelcomed large role due to extremely realistic computer animation and a fine performance from andy serkis upon which the animation was modeled bernard hillss performance is truly first rate as theoden king of rohan a performance which contributed greatly to the battle of helms deep scenes which are a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer and this captures the deliriously beautiful new zealand landscapes  skilfully integrated extra footage makes this sequel much better than the cinema and previous dvd versions event without the hefty end credits you get another 35 minutes of battle action and details on aragorn his elf girlfriend liv tyler new gal pal miranda otto and talkative treebeard
Jul 4 2011,positive,as good as the first
Jul 3 2011,positive,likewise to its predecessor it does not fall short the film is remarkably consistent and plays almost as if it were the same movie as the first however it is not the best in the series mainly the middle ground between the beginning and the end
Jul 3 2011,positive,very good epic its been awhile since a movie this good has come around way better action scenes to the first a comparable to the third
Jul 3 2011,positive,its not a bad film but it suffers from being the middle of three parts
Jul 2 2011,positive,while the second installment is not the best of the trilogy it is still an amazing movie on its own the battle scenes are thrilling here we get a much stronger female character in eowyn played perfectly by the lovely miranda otto i can say that the score for two towers is by far my favorite in the series howard shore did such an amazing job with the music
Jul 1 2011,positive,as beautifully filmed and thrilling as ever the two towers is a bravely directed epic with memorable characterization and amazing landscapes
Jul 1 2011,positive,i found this one much more exciting than fellowship the helms deep battle is probably my favorite battle in movie history again i recommend the extended
Jun 30 2011,positive,alright so im on one of those watch the whole lord of the rings triology kicks  but i have to say its worth it  the story and movie are so good  i like this movie just a smidge less than the fellowhip  mostly because i find the whole talking tree thing a little weird but still the battle for helms deep  classic and gollum  great stuff  ill watch return of the king tomorrow
Jun 30 2011,positive,peter jackson takes what he did with the first installment of the franchise and pushes it as high as it can go the lord of the rings the two towers is grand epic that does absolutely everything right it expands a very vast universe from characters to locations and never seems to stumble while this sequel is considered the best of the trilogy its hard not to see why it doesnt carry the baggage of any exposition or have to tie the knots of a story it is simply here to take you on one of the most satisfying movie experiences ever put on screen
Jun 30 2011,positive,the first scene done most of the world building which in essence allows this film to breath this is a rare sequel and middle film that never feels bloated or over the top most sequels feel the need to be bigger but not the the two towers peter jackson never sacrifices storytelling for action or robs the film of the characters who mean so much the film is relentless and the ensemble cast guide the story into a place that will conclude with return of the king i caught the extended cut of this over the weekend and it is the cut you must experience it has so much life hollywood should respect source material like this film and never hand over material to a poor filmmaker peter jackson was the right choice for this series and his vision is what keeps this film from failing beatuiful music and filmmaking you could do much worse than revisiting middle earth 21102018
Jun 29 2011,positive,not as good as the 1st and 3rd movies but still really good
Jun 28 2011,positive,part two of an epic trilogy
Jun 28 2011,positive,this is in my opinion the best film in the lord of the rings trilogy
Jun 27 2011,positive,once the platform is set with and middle earth and its citizens are well introduced to us it is time for the plot to thicken the good or bad part of this trilogy is that peter jackson tried to incorporate almost everything from the book to screen the action sequences got better and the screenplay got stuck to the way how the book describes it gollum is a revelation and is wonderfully executed
Jun 27 2011,positive,why did aragorn fall off the cliff that part was so stupid
Jun 27 2011,positive,please see my review of the fellowship of the ring as the same goes for the two towers
Jun 27 2011,positive,this lotr movie is actually my least favorite of the trilogy but it is a book so this part had to be told elijah wood was the best choice to play frodo he plays it beautifully gollumsmeagol is the creepiest movie character i have ever seen its so cool
Jun 26 2011,positive,the middle story of any trilogy is always the toughest to tell and the two towers is no exception having said that it still easily achieves epic status
Jun 26 2011,positive,my favourite of the trilogy epic battles epic cast and epic production crew what more could any movie goer ask for
Jun 25 2011,positive,the best trilogy and adventure in history
Jun 24 2011,positive,i think its better than the first film and thats saying a lot i dont know if its better than its sequel but its certainly one of my favorite movies
Jun 24 2011,positive,the sequel to the first the two towers definitely matches up with the first after watching the first i was unbelievably excited to watch this  although they are very long films it works and i dont want them to end  by the end of this i wanted to pop in the return of the king right away     the two towers takes place right where the first ended  frodo and sam are now alone and begin their quest to mount doom  well arogan legolas and gimli search for the pack of orcs that took merry and pippen  frodo and sam also come across a the small creature gollum who was following them in the first  after they capture him he agrees to guide them to mordor since they are lost they have no choice but to trust him and he is now part of the quest      i was extremely pleased at the greatness of this film  it does not drop one bit from the first and if anything it has gotten better      i personally love all the characters in the film but if i had to pick one it would have to be legolas    gandalf also returns in the second as the white wizard  dont worry for those who havent seen the film it is not a spoiler    the two towers is an extraordinary film and proves that the first two are my favourite films of all time    my rating is  100
Jun 23 2011,positive,great expectations good film lousy followup unforgivable adaptation you see the difficulty in assigning something so arbitrary as a few stars
Jun 23 2011,positive,my favorite one what can be said about this fantastic trilogy that hasnt been said already spielberg said it was impposible to make the battle at helms deep is epic hopless and
Jun 23 2011,positive,man you guys have tot ry to be there for when they do return of the king on the 28th  700 cause out of what ive experienced from seeing fellowship and two towers on the big screen again seeing return of the king is going to be fantastic    plot 1 frodo and sam have been separated from the rest of the fellowship and are now continuing to make their way into mordor but things take a turn as they run into the creature gollum who is still trying to get the ring back  2now that borimir is gone aragorn legolas and gimbli chase the urukhai that have marry and pippin but when they chase the hobbits all the way into fangorn forest they meet an unlikely friend who takes them into a new quest to save the country of rohan  3pippin and merry went into fangorn after the urukhai that took them was attacked by rohirrim there they meet treebeard and come across the gathering of ents concerning what to do with saruman    after thinking about this movie when i saw it on the big screen the other night when one of my best friends asked me which movie was by favorite i began to reconsider as to which one is my favorite between two towers and return fo the king i mean sure who cares since i love them all and the trilogy has always been my favorite and unless my lord commands or guides me otherwise it always will be but what makes this movie in a sense stand out from the rest is how isdescribes or develops more it gets more into some of the characters such as gollum it gets more into the war but more importantly it gets more into the darkness and how there seems to be no hope at all for anyone this is mostly done concerning rohan with the music and the things saruman and his forces do to rohan how much they go though its just so powerful they played that so well long before helms deppthe most enduring battle scene in the history of cinema in my opinionthat in some ways its a slight wonder how it didnt win best picture over chicago besides the fact that chicago is good bad enough that fellowship lost to beautiful mind i have not seen it but from what my brother says who is a rather skeptical guy beautiful mind had no place in the nominations compared to fellowship so much was done to prepare for the finale and it was perfectly done    actorscharacters  elijah woodfrodo bagginsstill did an excellent job as frodo  sean astinsamwise sam gamgee same as frodo but i especially liked his monologue at the end that was well done  ian mckellengandalf the white he still did good if nto made the character slightly more intersting now that hes come more mystical and powerful  viggo mortensenaragornman hes just so much more bada in this movie you just have to love aragorn  orlando bloomlegolas what the heck was that sliding down the stairs using an urukhai shield while shooting down more urukhai the way he got on that horse during the fight with the wargs and their riders thats just so freaking awesome legolas is more and more lovable every time we see him  john rhysdavies gimbli and treebeard he is just as funny is not more funny in this film plus hes using a bigger ax so what can you do without leaving out that and i love treebeard id love to know what jrr tolkien wouldve thought about it   billy boyd and domonic monaghan perregrin pippin took and merriadoc merry brandybuck still lovable but they are getting better dramatic moments   andy serkisgollum and smeagolwow justwow i mean gollum was a unique character enough just out of the books but boy did serkis show that just as much with this film he did an amazing job   christopher leesarumanthsi was his big moment since this primarily focused on saruman and his plan to destroy rohan and he did it perfectly  bernard hillking theodin he was in interesting character concerning how he was so focused in saving rohan even when he was making rather stubborn choices which werent that bad i mean we got some wonderful battle scenes out of it  mirando ottoeowyn she played a very interesting character its a shame that she wasnt developed this much in the books i mean she was shown a bit of this during her time with faramir during return of the king but thats sort of it   david wenhamfarimir you really have to love farimir i mean what really does it is his back story this is another perfect example of why the extended edition is better because you see more of his back story i mean you find out already with what happens in the next film but the extra scene with that flashback that helped better     music excellent my favorite music was the main rohan song which really helped with showing what they were going through gollums song was very good too     effects awesome    makeup i forgot to say from the first film but they did a remarkable job on this especially with the orcs    editing excellent as as usual    and that is my review for the lord of the rings the two towers only one more to go and ill have reviewed them all and and written a total of 100 reviews see you guys then
Jun 23 2011,positive,watching the battle of helms deep on the big screen again reminds me of the magic of the theater the audience surrounding me cheers when gandalf reappears they clap as the orcs run into fangorn and are destroyed by the trees they explode as the film comes to an end and we all rejoice knowing we will gather next week for the final film if you ever get the chance to watch the film again in the theater dont miss it  this was the way they were designed to be seen long live the elves
Jun 23 2011,positive,my fave of the three films  cor  go viggo
Jun 22 2011,positive,all the movies a pretty much the same special effect which are pretty amazing
Jun 22 2011,positive,the task is underway the fellowship is broken and open war is on the verge of tearing the kingdoms of rohan and gondor apart these are the obstacles that the heroes in the lotr trilogy must overcome as the fight for middle earth begins darker and more action packed than its predecessor the two towers was challenged with trying to create its own story while still bridging the gap between the first and third movie it succeeds at this thanks to the wonderful chemistry between the actors a rousing score and one of the greatest battle scenes of this generation
Jun 22 2011,positive,this movie is even better than the the 1st part i cant believe this movie got only 96 this movie didnt deserve anything less than 100 peter jackson is a great filmmaker loved every bit of this movie lord of the rings trilogy and inception are the greatest movies i have ever seen the story was really epic the visual effects stunning the movie simply outstanding
Jun 22 2011,positive,another awesome movie  still a bit long but very good  i saw the extended edition today in theaters and it took a 3 hour movie and made it 3h 40m long  definitely still worth seeing and owning 
Jun 22 2011,positive,the two towers not only stands as my favorite chapter in the lotr trilogy it succeeds in being one of the greatest sequels of all time this fantasy film is full of delight and magic to please viewers from generation to generation
Jun 21 2011,positive,after seeing the extended version of the second installment of the lord of the rings trilogy in a theater packed full of lord of the rings fans im pretty confident that the third installment will not disappoint
Jun 21 2011,positive,sequels are normally no more than acceptable in quality but this one is actually quite exceptional everything that made the first film good is back possibly even better but once again it is the musical score of howard shore that steals the show
Jun 21 2011,positive,lets talk about the two towers well it seems a lot shorter to me than the last one so thats better it centers around the fellowship which has been separated in this movie into 3 groups and their quest to combat sauron the theme of this film i believe is centered around addiction true this theme was in the previous and probably next film but it is set up more clearly here frodo is has slowly begun to fall into temptation and he already seems to have grown attached to the precious ring i think the addiction theme is played out quite well hence gollum the victim of the ring who is the embodiment of addiction itselfthat and splitpersonality disorder so what do i have to say about gollum hes great the portrayal character special effect its all great he was done in a realistic manner in which you start to believe he is front of the camera i believe the directors knew this because when the film cuts away from him and frodo they stay away for a long time they new everyone liked him and they ended up keeping this critic glued in his seat waiting for his return now the battle sequence was frightening revealing with great detail the fear of war and how it affects people i do question though how aragorn mortensen gimli davies and legolas bloom survive being thrown into a pit of orcsoh right the plot says so one thing i didnt really like was the ring wraiths riding dragons they dont really seem as creepy as they did on horses but hey maybe they needed an upgrade well i have one more and then i will have finally seen the lord of the rings trilogy i give this film 5 rings out of 5 precious rings
Jun 21 2011,positive,my favorite movie of the trilogy  great cast acting story cinematography characters and direction
Jun 21 2011,positive,the movie was perfect the acting of the stars as well as the story line was magestic this time around the movie carefully followed and depicted the events which occured in the book there was no fault which i could personally find and i am delighted with the vision of peter jackson everyone should watch the movie as well as it predecessor and successor
Jun 19 2011,positive,probably the most action oriented part of the story but just as good as the others nonetheless the two towers is a gritty adaptation of the book which was much different the chapter depicting the battle at helms deep was about ten pages while it took up about an hour in the film so what makes it great   it is probably the greatest action movie of all time because it does not rely entirely on action this film went deeply into the magic of the world trekking through marshes going deeply into fangorn forest and ultimately preparing for the final battle the action sequences as always are superb the visual effects are mind blowing and i think that what ultimately makes this movie is the adventure it is impossible to look away you cannot even get up to go to the restroom i was completely captivated the entire time while the theatrical release may have been much different the extended edition which i believe was the film that jackson wanted to make is much truer to the book so if you want to bitch and moan about how much different the theatrical film is from the book the extended film is probably for you i think that the two towers is ultimately about the struggle not with just the hobbits but all of the characters they are all battling their own demons jacksons films still remain the greatest fantasy films ever made sorry folks but harry potter isnt a fantasy it is a fairy tale what most dont realize is that every fantasy written after this one copies it in some way or another this is the purest form of the genre if you do not like this story then you do not like fantasy
Jun 19 2011,negative,again the same thing over and over again
Jun 19 2011,positive,not as good as the first but still epic
Jun 18 2011,positive,tied with number 3 amazing movie overall
Jun 18 2011,positive,the best out of the trilogy the final battle is indiscriminate it just has to be witnessed
Jun 18 2011,positive,this film managers to hold its own and continue the trilogy perfectly its a great step and really shows how much thought peter jackson and his crew put into the whole trilogy its a great set up for the return of the king so it does its job perfectly that way
Jun 17 2011,positive,no not as good as star wars but i like em all
Jun 17 2011,positive,an amazing sequel that has a very different feel to first due to how the fellowship of the ring ended with all the main cast split in groups and we have 3 separate stories all connected but all have a different journey all the cast are great yet again with more added this time humour was taken out and replaced with suspense as it builds to one of the greatest on screen battles ever that still leaves me with goosebumps today my only concern was they made the actual ring journey take a backseat to the battle scenes too much but apart from that sit back and enjoy part 2 what will one day go down as another classic trilogy
Jun 15 2011,negative,trees talk and fight wars  why do people like this series
Jun 14 2011,positive,the two towers is truly the best lord of the rings film and it really should have won the oscar for best picture if any in the epic trilogy  this one is the most interesting and it doesnt carry on forever at all
Jun 14 2011,positive,loved this more than the last film
Jun 13 2011,positive,probably the best one
Jun 13 2011,positive,love the battle at helms deep
Jun 13 2011,positive,even more of a thriller than its predescessor the two towers conveys the world of tolkiens imagination through very mystical dialogue and impressive performances   pure poetry
Jun 12 2011,positive,peter jacksons lord of the rings keeps on rolling and is still as exciting and fantastic the two towers continues the epic story with new characters more drama and one hell of a climactic battle    frodo and sam continue their dangerous journey towards mordor but unexpectedly encounter gollum a creature who is tormented and obsessed by the ring meanwhile the trio of aragorn legolas and gimli follow their own adventures of finding an old friend saving a king and defending a kingdom from doom from sarumans large army like i said in the fellowship of the ring review theres nothing like the beginning of the adventure but the two towers is a followup that is just as memorable all the characters have to face certain death but they never turn back even when situations seem hopeless and there cant possibly be no good outcome its that kind of hope and will that really fires you up and raises your spirits but we get to see more character driven drama like frodos pitty for gollum because of what the ring has done to him mind we see a kings will to act like a king to save his people and aragorns fight for his kind even though we know his love has left middle earth and we get to see boromirs brother the passionate themes of the lord of the rings are incredible and the two towers is a great sequel carrying the same passion adventure and humour the body count game between gimli and legolas is just brilliant    the look of the two towers is just as impressive as the fellowships and peter jacksons directing is just as brilliant too his filming pacing of scenes and ability to balance action and drama is incredible and never falls flat for a second its jacksons experience with the thriller genre that makes the lord of the rings movies so interesting when the action heats up you are always at the edge of your set in amazement of the detail and surprises like before there is great amounts of detail in everything the costumes sets art direction weapons makeup cinematography everything has 100 effort and is absolutely stunning but spacifically i really love the battle of helms deep helms deep has to be the best battle sequence in the entire lord of the rings trilogy the cinematography and rainy setting looks wonderful and scary the cgi is amazing and the pacing of the battle is moving you see hope failure some funny bits struggle and the loss of hope all tightly fitted into a long battle that will take your breath away when it is over you also hear some new music scores for the two towers which i personally like its very fitting and uplifting    some may call the two towers the weaker of the trilogy but thats because the story isnt done yet but the two towers in none the less as emotionally compelling tale that has everything that makes a good story and the filmmaking is the best and pretty damn detailed and complicated youll ever see peter jackson makes the two towers an incredibly entertaining and wonderful movie as part of a brilliant trilogy    also note the special extended edition is the best version to get you get more story and stuff as a matter of fact that goes for the other 2 movies as well the extended editions are where its at
Jun 12 2011,negative,sorry not a fan of this one
Jun 12 2011,positive,who wouldve thought that a great movie would be a huge letdown thats exactly what i thought of the two towers the first film the fellowship of the ring was one of my favorite films of all time each scene had a major reasoning for being there and you can tell each scene had a lot of care and heart put towards it this movie doesnt have that feel to it sure it continues the story rather well but as a sequel to one of the greatest films of all time it falls flat i guess my biggest flaw with it is doesnt take itself seriously as much as the first film gollum is not very likable or serious the dialogue is not always intriguing the action is unrealistic and not as brutal as you might expect every actor looks as if they want all the cameras focused on them and the first couple minutes are more epic then the rest of the film even though its a flashback now i know what youre thinking whyd you give the film 3 12 stars even though you have so much complaints to it well because its an enjoyable adventure its flawed but it has heart the acting isnt the best but they get the job done it may not be as good as the first but its a great movie in its own right theres so many bad things yet theres plenty of good things to even out the score its just a flawed but still great film now for the best thing well besides the story and that would be the special effects which were even better than the first film and you feel as if you were transported to middleearth itself the only bad thing about the special effects is they upstage everything else but luckily the effects are subtle so it doesnt upstage the story if you liked the first film i really have no idea what youll think of this i thought it was pretty good but other people thought it was a masterpiece i guess ill recommend it if you liked the first but dont be surprised if its not as good
Jun 10 2011,positive,a rare sequel that matches the quality of the first
Jun 10 2011,positive,watching this again i seem to always be a fan of the second part of trilogies when it seems hopeless like sam says when it seems its darkest and it seems they are going to give up hope they choose to go on
Jun 10 2011,positive,excellent such an epic entertaining film cant wait to see the last installment
Jun 5 2011,positive,cooool gallum or smittle is up to no good sam is right
Jun 5 2011,positive,as with the books sam  frodo are the weakest part of this story    amazing adaptation of a great work of fiction
Jun 4 2011,positive,the two towers dodges being the typical middle chapter with epic action and powerful storytelling   grade a
Jun 4 2011,positive,much better the narrative picks up the film has a purpose the characters are more developed and the battle scene is epic even though it is a fantasy film
Jun 3 2011,positive,the epic quality of this film will always make this a go to movie
Jun 3 2011,positive,i think the best of the lotr movies
Jun 3 2011,positive,highest caliber of cinematography acting and writing makes this second installment of the trilogy just as enjoyable if not more so than the original
Jun 1 2011,positive,classic inspiring groundbreaking  5 galadriels
May 31 2011,positive,sequels arent usually as good as the first this is the exception
May 31 2011,positive,i watched the first lord of the rings films not all the long ago while i did enjoy it i wasnt as amazed with it like many others have been i did enjoy it a lot but my expectations were higher due to the praise the film has gotten i figured id still watch the other two to see if it would get better when i finally found time to sit and watch the two towers it did get better in fact i now see why so many have been blown away     the two towers is perfect in pretty much every possible way the special effects are spectacular the storytelling is phenomenal and the acting is any other synonym for those two words you can think of i cant believe this movie is 3 hours long youre thrown into this world and you lose track of time     the last hour of this film is really the best part the battle of helms deep is one of the most entertaining and engaging battle scenes ive ever watched and it may have become my favorit part to any movie i really cant say enough good things about it if you havent seen it then youre missing out    this film truly is a masterpiece there isnt one thing i can say bad about it the two towers has stormed into my top 10 of all time favorite movies and i can not wait until i watch the last one
May 30 2011,positive,if you ignore its moral philosophy it would be a very boring film however if you look a little deeper it will be a very satisfying experience even if you disagree with its many themes
May 29 2011,positive,more action but never less drama carries the second in the trilogy to a new epic height that fills in the gap and sets up for the epic ending to the trilogy
May 29 2011,positive,the best film ever made
May 28 2011,positive,second foray into tolkiens middle earth by peter jackson and his cronies displays a much more focused vision than its predecessor  after a dynamite opening sequence the forboding story kicks into high gear with frodo and sam forming an alliance with the sinister gollum whos a marvel of cgi andy serkis wore the cgi outfit for the body movements and supplied the raspy hissy voice as they trek to mount doom in order to destroy the one ring  parallel story threads include aragorns uniting with the people of rohan at the battle of helms deep merry and pippins encounter with the ents and much much more  writerdirector jackson succeeds this time around in maintaining a frenzied pace to the narrative with deftly timed pauses  newcomers brad dourif and bernard hill lend fine support as wormtongue and king theoden  in the end this movie scores a bullseye in large part due to the vivid characterization of gollum
May 28 2011,positive,if i could give this film 6 stars i would lort trilogy  best movies ever period dont argue it
May 27 2011,positive,not as good as the first but still visionary a
May 27 2011,positive,two towers was the worst lotr movie but it was ok
May 26 2011,positive,i have nothing to say  too awesome for a review 
May 25 2011,positive,incredible battle scenes and dazzling special effects continue this incredible trilogy
May 25 2011,negative,that was a looong walk
May 24 2011,positive,in action better than first
May 23 2011,positive,copy here what i said about the first part    the extra is a little critic in the field of plot changing it did bother me at first but is nothing that cant be forgiven
May 21 2011,positive,really good if you have the extended edition  those are always the best  kind of small compared to fellowship and return but still a great movie
May 21 2011,positive,everything was perfect best movie ever for me
May 20 2011,positive,one of the best medieval fantasy ever
May 19 2011,positive,this film is a masterpiece
May 18 2011,positive,my least favorite of the three but still great
May 17 2011,positive,im a dork and here are 5 stars to prove it
May 16 2011,positive,in the two towers peter jackson continues his majestic adaptation of tolkiens the lord of the rings and i adore this film for its brilliant and beautiful depictions of the novels two major battles the sacking of orthanc sarumans fortress and the battle of helms deep between the forces of saruman and the rohirrim under the command of king theoden and aragorn  like its predecessor in the film series the two towers deviates from the novel bit i applaud its embellishments because it actually depicts moments such as the ents attacking orthanc instead of just glossing over them  a powerful emotional and genuinely epic entry in one of the great fantasy film series of all time
May 16 2011,positive,though my least favorite of the lord of the rings thats not saying much as this is one of my favorite film franchises
May 16 2011,positive,the best in the trilogy
May 16 2011,positive,still cant decide which one of the trilogy is my favorite but probably this maybe not though
May 14 2011,positive,i think that this one is the best out of the three
May 14 2011,positive,even better than the first one epic characters epic setting and an epic plot timeless beautiful but in a dark way
May 14 2011,positive,up there with star wars as one of my favorite trilogies
May 12 2011,positive,liked it    considering how much i enjoyed the books and first movie this one was highly disappointing to me the entire side story of the ents was just painfully slow and agonizingly boring to watch so much so that it made me fall asleep in the theater i can honestly say that is something no other movie in the theater has ever managed to do to me    i own the entire trilogy now so ive seen it all the way through since and while i can watch without nodding off now im still just not overly impressed with this film golems side story and trekking closer and closer to the tower made me really engaged    overall id say i liked it but it was definitely a step back for me
May 10 2011,positive,helms deep is the best battle of the trilogy
May 10 2011,positive,its lotr what more should i say
May 9 2011,positive,this film is like a blur to me in my memory but i always think it was better than the first the battle of helmsdeep is the best part more than makes up for any lack in the rest of the film anyway
May 9 2011,positive,a truly classical fantasy
May 9 2011,positive,i dont know why two towers never gets recognition helms deep rohan gollum this is the most exciting chapter
May 9 2011,positive,best battle scene ever mmm pg13 at least
May 8 2011,negative,i know that trees walked otherwise very forgettable
May 8 2011,positive,never saw this kind of cinema before
May 7 2011,positive,weaker than the first but only just more great acting from sir ian and great direction from peter jackson
May 6 2011,positive,its an amazing adaptation of the book with action and stunning visuals
May 6 2011,positive,second best in lotr series
May 6 2011,positive,an excellent screenplay adaptation of the novel
May 5 2011,positive,really really enjoyed it
May 3 2011,positive,alongside return of the king  fellowship the greatest achievement in film ever bar none
May 3 2011,positive,and i still love the extended version   one of those epics which modern film needsperhaps many people would dislike this but it succeeds where tolkien could not plus the peter jackson remake is free from tolkiens racism of his time
May 3 2011,positive,extended edition review    a great second second film that truly shines in its extended form    again boromir fans you will love this edition
May 3 2011,positive,this is the weakest part of the 3 but its still good
May 2 2011,negative,the one that didnt need to be made a waste of three hours of my life i cant stand these films
May 1 2011,positive,my favorite of all three
Apr 26 2011,positive,an absolute triumph in breathtaking cinematography and beautiful action choreography one of the best sequels in cinema history
Apr 25 2011,positive,the best movie trilogy of all time
Apr 24 2011,positive,wowgollums one of the greatest achievements in film gandalfs resurrection is legenday and its justwow
Apr 24 2011,positive,this is the second of three movies in the lord of the rings series very long at 320 min so please plan a second bag of nukeable popcorn truly a wonderful movie
Apr 23 2011,positive,the movie is great for someone who hasnãât read the book there are many dull changes which doesnãât mke any sense at all eg faramirs personality or aragorns fake death shelob etc so i recommend to read the book and then watch the film knowing that you are no t getting a faithful adaptation still a great movie two thumbs up
Apr 22 2011,positive,it improves upon the first film in almost every way creating a fun and exciting epic adventure
Apr 21 2011,positive,great installment to my favorite film series of all time
Apr 20 2011,positive,though not as precise in its storytelling abilities as its predecessor the two towers makes up for its slowly paced plot with epic action pieces the battle of helms deep is massively exciting and impressive and serkis work as smeagol is just as brilliant the story may be a little bit of a drag in the second installment of the saga but the epic battle and final third make it all worth while
Apr 19 2011,positive,the second chapter of the lotr trilogy is much darker and filled with intense action amazing direction great acting and superb special effects make this movie absolutely brilliant
Apr 18 2011,positive,graphically astounding  the sound is beautiful  performances great    must see
Apr 17 2011,positive,i have to say the fight at the tower towers was pretty amazingi loved when legolas slides down the stairs and when him and gimili are bantering back and forth its all just great overall
Apr 17 2011,positive,helms deep for the win what a journey what a battle
Apr 17 2011,positive,outstanding best trilogy ever
Apr 17 2011,positive,a great film but rotk is better
Apr 17 2011,positive,the tree guys the tree guys dude
Apr 16 2011,positive,this movie is the best of the three  a
Apr 14 2011,positive,still a great film to see this one really has layers on where the characters are
Apr 14 2011,positive,suitably brilliant follow up to the fellowship
Apr 14 2011,positive,more graphic and more fantastic this sequel tops the first
Apr 13 2011,positive,entertaining liked it just had a great overall feel to it good imagination and visual effects good characters and story
Apr 10 2011,positive,spoiler alert      since this is my 100th review i have decided to review a film which is a top notch five stars 100 one the two towers is the second instalment of my favourite trilogy of all time the greatest thing about this trilogy is that it never finds the need to drag in lots of new characters like other franchises like narnia or harry potter as i said most characters have returned and are the same mainly the four hobbits aragorn legolas gimli and gandalf the fact that gandalf came back to life made me extremely happy especially after his death was one full of such emotion and pure awesomeness the other characters also still maintain their beauty and incredibility that made me fall in love with every one of them in the fellowship of the ring new characters introduced in this film were also brilliant especially gollumsmeagol who are portrayed by the brilliant actor andy serkis smeagol adds a little more zist to the story and later becomes a great conflict for frodos climax in return of the king the action steps up in this film as well turning from small riot in a forest to ten thousand badass uruk hai attacking a small impenetrable fortress containing about three hundred men and a few hundred elves the music in this film still upholds its great reputation that the fellowship had delivered me it really contrasts with the various situations upheld in this film really well overall one of the best films ever made in my opinion along with the rest of the trilogy
Apr 10 2011,positive,loved it because that is when the action begins my favourite of the trilogy
Apr 10 2011,positive,lacks the emotional resonance of the first but still a great adventure
Apr 9 2011,positive,it took peter jackson to do it right ralph bakshi tried it in the 70s but couldnt quite catch it jrr tolkiens epic vista cannot easily be reduced to one movie and so peter did all three at once not only that but he showed hollywood how to do a medieval movie and a fantasy at that to properly see this one should view the extended directors cuts as they encompass the fine points of the books pretty well a small gripe peter decided to not even deal with the scouring of the shire but that would have made the third movie way to long
Apr 9 2011,neutral,i find this film very confusing
Apr 9 2011,positive,a more compelling and thrilling sequel to the original due to the addition of gollum my precious
Apr 7 2011,positive,lord of the blockbuster
Apr 7 2011,positive,the second part of the lord of the rings trilogy is presented here it is a much darker deeper entry into the saga    gollum is one of the best pieces of cgi ive ever seen in a movie and the battle of helms deep is one of the most wellmade sequences ever committed to celluloid    i really dont have that much to say about it that wouldnt be reiterating everything everyone else has said i want to save all my praise for the final entry    so join me next time for the final entry in this saga when i review the lord of the rings the return of the king
Apr 6 2011,positive,better the the first still loved it
Apr 5 2011,positive,two towers continues the epic adventure instigated in fellowship of the ring
Apr 4 2011,positive,this trilogy is by far one of the best movies ive seen in my life two towers had some faults but its easy to overlook those with all its good aspects
Apr 4 2011,positive,personal score 1010    after the astoundingly brilliant first entry in the lord of the rings trilogy peter jackson and co brought us the second installment the two towers  the first entry the fellowship of the ring did a spectacular job of introducing the characters both good and bad and setting up what was to be a difficult and epic journey  truth be told one could easily hope to just skip right to the third entry to see where it all ends  but that is why the two towers is so excellent  it takes on the task of being the bridge between the beginning and the end and ends up standing beautifully amongst the other two films as a perfectly splendid masterpiece  the story for the two towers picks up directly where the fellowship of the ring left off with the fellowship broken and heroes frodo and sam on their own marching towards the dreaded land of mordor  along the way they encounter the hideous fiend gollum who must now be recognized as one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema  i wont go far into the tale itself  gollum is obsessed with the ring and has a dual nature that both hates and loves it  frodo pities gollum or smeagol as he calls him and allows him to lead them to mordor  sam however is extremely distrusting but accepts it all the same though he certainly keeps his eyes open  the other members of the fellowship being aragorn legolas and gimli set out to find merry and pippin who were taken by the urukhai abominations created by the evil wizard saruman  however in the middle of their pursuit they encounter a friend whom they had thought dead the newly risen gandalf the white who directs them instead to rohan where the last remnants of that kingdom face certain doom  now anyone who did their reading andor research before seeing this film was well aware of the epic battle that was to come in this film that being the battle at helms deep  so one could easily assume that any amount of time spent leading up to this battle was simply in the way  well it goes without saying that this incredible battle is absolutely amazing and the fact that it comprises almost a third of this film is certainly pleasing  however the build up to this battle sequence is one of the greatest achievements of this film particularly the 1015 minutes before the fight  we watch as the men of rohan arm every man from the smallest boys to the oldest man in a last ditch effort to thwart the overwhelming forces of isengard which stand at 10000 strong compared to about 300 men of rohan  the emotions portrayed by this seemingly hopeless situation are so unbelieveably palpable that one is almost brought to tears  it is beautifully overwhelming and the most impressive feat of this film  as with the first film all of the technical elements which made it great are present here  being the middle child in a trilogy can often be a difficult task but the two towers takes on the task perfectly  theres no point in picking a favorite between these three films  certainly most of us would choose the third film if we could only have one but i think that is only because we desire the closure it brings  thankfully that isnt necessary here  these films are each part of a greater whole and like the first and third parts the two towers is an essential piece of that whole
Apr 2 2011,positive,simply epic a direct continuation of the fellowship of the ring the two towers tells several separate stories about how our heroes are doing aragorn gimli and legolas go off to helms deep to fight frodo and sam go off with gollum to sneak into mordor and lastly merry and pippen enlist the aid of the treents to help fight saruman    the movie has a spectacular cast who work just so well together this film is a lot more action packed with an intense scene at the end thats just amazing the movie introduces some new characters that will later play important roles in the next film    the film is shot brilliantly based on a great book and is just a very memorable film definitely check this one out but make sure to watch the first film or else this one could be super confusing
Mar 31 2011,positive,the battle of helms deep was amazing one of the best battle scenes in movie history great acting effects and screenplay
Mar 30 2011,positive,all of these flix are awesome
Mar 29 2011,neutral,again bore fest to me
Mar 28 2011,positive,continuing the movie series  this stands as one of the only examples of a good reason to film backtoback
Mar 28 2011,positive,ironically this is the critics favorite of the trilogy but the audiences least favorite i still love it and this might have the best acting from the cast than the other two however the reason i love the series so much is because of the battle scenes and i think the other two are more proficient in that department
Mar 28 2011,neutral,better than the first one still dull though    includes a pointless conversation about chips
Mar 28 2011,positive,lacks the emotional resonance of the first but still a great adventure
Mar 26 2011,positive,lotr trilogy changed how movies are made today
Mar 26 2011,positive,the next installment in the series takes the action up a notch with some of the most epic battle scenes in any movie
Mar 25 2011,positive,my least favorite of the trilogy still awesome
Mar 24 2011,negative,only saw half jejeje
Mar 24 2011,positive,probably the best sequel of the decade 20002010
Mar 21 2011,positive, the fate of the world will now be decided 
Mar 20 2011,positive,the reason why i think this is the best of the three is pacing when the battle at helms deep starts you know its going to be a doozy and when it ends theres a crisp 5 minutes of foreshadowing before the credits
Mar 19 2011,positive,the best of the series especially if you see the extended version  the acting of bernard hill and miranda otto was great in this film
Mar 19 2011,positive,favorite one in the trilogy
Mar 17 2011,positive,after rewatching this film again i just cant get over how much i love it it brings back memories of high school and me nerding out all the time about it i wont say that this is my favorite of the trilogy because to tell you the truth i cant choose a favorite i believe that if you watch the first then you need to watch the second and third not necessarily backtoback but as close to each other as you possibly can anyways this film is amazing the battle scenes the thoughtful scenes peter jackson definitely adapted the film in the best way possible from the book
Mar 17 2011,positive,the whole trilogy is my favorite movie of all time
Mar 16 2011,positive,the extended edition of this flick is worth seeing along with every other extended edition but this one was my favorite
Mar 14 2011,positive,these movies get better and better the elf scenes were boring but eveything else was awesome
Mar 13 2011,positive,not as good as the first but probably the best sequel i have ever seen peter jackson pullls it off again with more violence in great fasion quiet possibly one of the best battles to ever make it to the big screen helms deep
Mar 12 2011,positive,more emotional than the first film and perhaps better overall i consider this the best in the trilogy
Mar 12 2011,positive,a must watch  great 
Mar 11 2011,positive,2nd best out of the trilogy
Mar 11 2011,positive,i have tried reviewing this from an objective view point a thousand times and i just cant despite its flaws  of which i think there are few  i adore the whole trilogy peter jackson has taken an epic story and translated it on screen to create a masterpiece he has managed to give the novels a new lease of life and offer it to a new generation of filmgoers and readers    the source material for the second instalment is inundated with many additional plot lines which offer relief from frodo wood and sams astin journey to mordor new characters manage to keep the viewing fresh while remembering old favourites from the fellowship and continuing to move the story along    probably one of the largest pulls to the trilogy is the presence of highly regarded actors such as ian mckellen andy serkis and viggo mortensen  every member of the cast has a firm grasp on the mannerisms and part their character has to play within the story which comes across with a strong sense of gratification    the scene where gandalf mckellen arrives at the battle with the riders of rohan and the sun rises behind him defines a truly perfect film experience for me the sheer magnitude makes you shiver and marks a triumph for the people losing hope at helms deep the battle scenes that jackson has constructed are marvellous and full of raw emotion and intensity rather than being bloodbath scenes with no meaning    jacksons direction has been consistently good from the fellowship of the ring and the two towers is no exception stylistically he has perfected the balance between the beauty of middleearth and the brutality of the war of the ring technically the trilogy has been a definite pinnacle of modern cinema and is certainly a landmark of the fantasy genre    being the only film i have so far given a 5 star rating the two towers is a favourite and will more than likely remain so for a long time
Mar 11 2011,positive,loved the entire trilogy
Mar 9 2011,negative,boringthe worst of the bunch
Mar 9 2011,positive,the two towers  coscreenplaydir by peter jackson    bringing us nonstop to the same remarkable journey of fellowship of the ring in this next chapter the two towers peter jackson yet again shows his ostentatious direction on the film counted amongst the best the grand journey into fantasy world continues with masterful direction of peter jackson
Mar 8 2011,positive,this movie pleasures my vag
Mar 8 2011,positive,the plot thickens and it leaves you wanting more
Mar 7 2011,positive,continuing the undeniably epic treatment from the first film and with an absolutely amazing opening sequence the second part of the trilogy avoids a great deal of the overuse of slowmotion that plagues peter jacksons greater works
Mar 6 2011,positive,part 2 of an epic story its hard to rate them separate but each could be a stand alone story of their own
Mar 5 2011,positive,a stunningly flawless epic of war where the characters battle not only against others but within themselves
Mar 5 2011,positive,too much yabbadiyap but otherwise good
Mar 4 2011,positive,not the best movie in the series but still a wonderful film
Mar 3 2011,positive,cant remember the theatrical version but the directors cut was really cool
Mar 2 2011,positive,whats not to love a true epic
Mar 2 2011,positive,a solid placeholder that didnt feel like a placeholder  the middle of the story is always the hardest to develop and to make an entire film the middle of a predetermined trilogy is a huge risk  peter jackson pulled it off  good job  810
Mar 1 2011,positive,every bit as good as the first one though it seems pointless to regard them as individual films  the trilogy is consistent  and watched back to back they feel like one giant epic
Feb 28 2011,positive,the continuation of the lord of the rings trilogy by peter jackson is one of epic sweeping intense breathtaking and extraordinary quality  loved every minute of it
Feb 28 2011,positive,i loved the battle scenes in this and again the performances were great i loved golumn in this
Feb 28 2011,positive,in the second part of the trilogy the fellowship is divided into three and their actions in this movie is seen in the next i love this movie as much as the other two and it contains some of the most artistic scenes
Feb 28 2011,positive,washes away the bad taste of george lucas awful prequels
Feb 27 2011,positive,i think we should start by saying that the two towers  my favorite part of this great trilogy huge universe of middleearth could not fit into a single movie but it was not necessary the original holders had planned on filming to create a dialogue but this does not happen it was given and in many ways it is an achievement of peter jackson for which i again say thanks to him he retained all the charm and charm which has managed to create a fellowship of the ring and successfully moved in the two towers     the fellowship has broken up and the hope is almost extinguished ringbearer weaker day by day and the path is still so long and dangerous evil condenses collects in a fist all power preparing for a decisive blow  but before that will be another battle it was she who decides the fate of the people of the west forces are not equal and the chance of success there is little but the fight will still take place appear before us the great country of rohan in the best of its latitude plains and rocky hills earths farmers and breeders  the best riders in the whole middleearth we are closely acquainted with their culture and way of life as well as very intense show their fortitude in the face of the ten thousandth army adamantine as previously thought urukhayev such an exemplary standoff orcs physical strength and fortitude of people so what is stronger urukhayev many many but they are only servants of the will of others people also have a goal and a worthy leader which will be ready to die with them and would fight until the very end     where now the horse combat   where sonorous horns singing   died down a mountain storm   otshumeli prairie winds   vanished days gone by in the sunset shadows   over the hills   c     in his review of fellowship of the ring i had a conversation about the members of this fraternity so i think its fair to talk about other heroes involved in continuing and adding to the actors part was impressive the appearance of a solid number of new characters greatly increased general interest     karl urban has embodied the proud handsome and fair eomer commander rohirric horsemen a brave and fearless i see that the potential for dramatic roles he does not but all his images including star trek and the chronicles of riddick i am very impressed i do not know what this stern warrior but with kind eyes and at least a good soul and most importantly loves his land his country his people miranda otto played a warrior eowyn whose role could get uma thurman do not know about you but i imagine little bride of the kill bill in the shell rather than in a yellow tracksuit and with a samurai sword and with weighty blade or even an ax miranda also coped well with his role here and there in my opinion is too widely opened her eyes did not properly stared at aragorn but in general played perfectly well     bernard hill personify the ageold wisdom and greatness of rohan in the face of king theoden who does not remember bernard played in the famous and beloved titanic where he was captain of the infamous ship why am i this in both films the power and supremacy however in the film by james cameron more shining one with the names of dicaprio and winslet in the film peter jacksons bernardo gave the opportunity for full selfrealization as an actor and in fact it has paid off christopher lee played the role of saruman gandalfs former mentor and gave power of light clicking on the side of sauron good character is recreated perfectly but a few as a result the fate of saruman remains in question prompting a fantasy for the viewer maybe this is the best     liv tyler was able to create an image of a plausible elf of all that i have met although there were many but not the essence indeed the actress really likes to be representative of this exotic nation once she convinced the director to replace one of the dialogues in the film from english into elvish thats what i call a full commitment and a detailed embodiment of the image david uenem its not too big but important role of the military chief of faramirs rangers perfectly fit into the ensemble cast wrote that the choice fell on the creators of david because of his resemblance to sean bean personally i do not see the similarities probably due to the fact that all too well acquainted with the filmography of both and they are for me quite polytypic actors     and one of the key characters in the picture  gollum who literally revived andy serkis initially rely only voice of the river residents gollum suffers from dissociative identity disorder saying in russian split personality moreover the split downright say the cardinal like two poles  the plus and nedorisovanny plus and this happiness therapist becomes a guide for our old friends  frodo and sam continuing their way to mount doom for the sake of destruction one ring agree not the safest companion but hell have to trust just anyone else     special attention is paid like the battle of helms padyu which is the most spectacular scene of the movie if one word epic but one word is enough no small part in so great a shock played a musical arrangement i envy those who seven years ago watching the picture on the big screen guys and maybe girls from the studio weta digital created an incredible milestone and its a miracle i remind you in 2002 do not even think most troops isengard has been created by these masters of the visual effects i thought that peter jacksons solid shell out for extras but he was smarter in my understanding this is called a shooter with a soul not heard so you its time to stop watching movies by michael bay and stephen sommers though i respect the first no unnecessary and wanton heroism and no affectedness fight scenes in other words everything is so perfect that its hard to believe     write a fullfledged sequel which is comparable with the original these days is impossible however peter jackson has proven i think everyone that nothing is impossible if the confident and informed approach to what is really striving to achieve and then everything will turn out and peter has shown us that despite the negativity that sometimes surrounds us in the world there is still good and worth fighting for it 
Feb 27 2011,negative,how long does it take to take a flippin ring to a volcano these 3 films could easily have been one yawn
Feb 26 2011,positive,just as good as the original and still lives up to the great name lord of the rings i loved it  still on their journey to mordor frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin are lost and after being ambushed by gollum andy serkis but capture him instead and they make him lead them to mordor  aarogorn viggio mortensen gimli john davies and legolas orlando bloom still fight saurons army and search for pippin and mary but will actually find the thought dead gandalf  isn mckellen  the plot adds on to the breathtaking trilogy and worldwide phenomenon  the action is amazing and surpasses the first one  the effects and make up are great and really detailed  acting is top notch and great  its better than the first i think it leads up to the great third film and is purely amazing
Feb 25 2011,positive,this one doesnt stand out as much as the other two but the quality of the film is still great with great performances all around
Feb 24 2011,negative,yawn  honestly they could have condensed all 3 movies into one but i guess the fanboys would have revolted
Feb 23 2011,positive,910  more action than the last one and less exhausting a must see
Feb 22 2011,positive,spectacular sequel is every bit as good as the first the specialy effects just as eye popping the scenery just as stunning and most importantley of all its just as unforgettable the ending battly scene is amazing but the movie itself is even more so
Feb 22 2011,positive,just the hour long battle scene at helms deep garners a star i really think this is the best lotr film
Feb 21 2011,positive,too long has its moments i guess
Feb 20 2011,positive,better than the first but not better than the last one great battle scenes and extremely enjoyable
Feb 20 2011,positive,it was good but it was too different from the book
Feb 19 2011,positive,not as good as the first but in what situation is the second high better than the first
Feb 17 2011,positive,good with a amazing ending
Feb 16 2011,positive,wednesday february 16 2011    2002 the lord of the rings the two towers  fantasy action    contains spoiler warnings    best one out of the three however the longer version was one of the worst versions i had ever seen in terms of longer cuts since the impact was much effective on the shorter version for theyre often unecessary long speeches especially toward the end of the film when the captors decided to allow the two elflings frodo and sam to continue on with their journey  also included on this is a much longer version of pointless slaughterings since the good guys had already won the battle against the orcs motivating them to later ran away escaping to the forest you can see the good guys also chasing after them for the intention of wiping them out making the film less sense since king theoden was prevented to kill snake when he had the chance had aragorn had not stopped him i felt the ending was a little of a contradiction what the film was metaphorically preaching but i guess its because they were just useless orcs i guess    short version 4 out of 4    longer version wouldve received about 80 which would be a 3 out of 4 for curious onlookers
Feb 16 2011,positive,best fantasy adventure film of all time
Feb 14 2011,positive,im not the first person who say that two hours of walking can be amazingly enjoyable its just true wonderful series
Feb 13 2011,positive,peter jackson made the right decision to make each book a separate film
Feb 13 2011,positive,the best of the three
Feb 13 2011,positive,one of the best movie ever
Feb 13 2011,positive,as with my previous review for fellowship this is based upon the extended cut of the film    the dedication of the film makers to the text is to be commended 10 years on the effects still stand up and the addition of at least half a dozen new characters is handle with confidence though much of that is probably down to the source material as well as the screen writers    as before this really is for die hard fans only the extra and expanded scenes pull us further into middleearth and its various cultures the two towers does however suffer from difficult middle film syndrome whilst it has an emotional conclusion its lacking the narrative conclusion the other big sticking point for myself is that with the addition of so many new characters we now have multiple story lines and with this i feel that there is just to much going on unlike the streamlined fellowship with its more linear plot    otherwise there is much to recommend this film just stick with it as its flaws are few and its a rare cinematic experience in this day and age
Feb 11 2011,positive,sort of a filler to buy sometime and make more money  i did enjoy it 100 though but i dont think that it was necessary
Feb 10 2011,positive,fantastic movie adaptation of the novels
Feb 10 2011,positive,best of the trilogy the helms deep battle was the most graphically amazing of all the movies
Feb 10 2011,positive,continues the high standard of the first instalment with excellent characterisation of gollum treebeard and the ents and of course the urukhai the battle at helms deep is long dark and poignant and the night cinematography is amazing
Feb 8 2011,positive,the alpha and omega of modern fantasy film part 2
Feb 8 2011,negative,who the fuck cares about this shit
Feb 7 2011,negative,slow plodding and frankly at times dull and effortless
Feb 7 2011,positive,my least favorite but it is still lotr so i cannot rate it any less the end is the best and the ents make it worthwhile solid performances as always
Feb 6 2011,negative,i really dont get the deal with these movies
Feb 5 2011,positive,very good it lost a bit of the charm from the first but still good
Feb 4 2011,positive,i love epic story lines and this is up there with the best
Feb 4 2011,positive,a carefully designed continuation of the fellowship and a perfect segue to the return of the king
Jan 30 2011,positive,excellent but too long  the fragmented plot lines are hard to follow at times  all in all a welltold story and a feast for the eyes
Jan 30 2011,positive,trilogi the lord of the ring mang keren2 semua
Jan 27 2011,positive,what an achievement in filmmaking the battle of helms deep is one of if not the best battle ever filmed
Jan 27 2011,positive,one of my favorite movies  now if only they would have followed the actual book
Jan 27 2011,positive,not as good as film one but still good the battle for helms deep is great
Jan 26 2011,positive,this movie is an instant classic fantasy movie
Jan 25 2011,positive,once again the fight scene at the end steals the show liked the comedy too with the little dwarf guy having some funny lines
Jan 23 2011,positive,extended great short not so great
Jan 23 2011,positive,my favorite of this trilogy  it contains all the smaller victories and the largest amount of heart  im looking at you sam  not to mention the brilliant performance of gollumsmeagol
Jan 20 2011,positive,epic battles and middle earth drama carry the second film and leaves us enthusiastic for the next chapter
Jan 19 2011,positive,the introduction to our favorite bipolar character gollum unless you count a small cameo in the first movie
Jan 18 2011,positive,well made movie with great story to go with remember when movies had that
Jan 17 2011,positive,continuing on with the moviemagic peter jacksons second entry into the lotr trilogy is even more satisfying than the first steadily and surely cementing this franchise into cinematic timelessness
Jan 16 2011,positive,probably my favorite of the trilogy
Jan 15 2011,positive,not as good as the first but it definitely towered over many other movies of the year     yes that was intended
Jan 15 2011,positive,two words helms deep    also    anything and everything that king theoden says    serkis performance as gollumsmeagol    legolas shield skateboard    howard shores score    the ents going to war    sams speech that theres some good in this world mr frodo and its worth fighting for
Jan 15 2011,positive,unlike the first film this one just drags on however it is not half as bad as the third one ugh
Jan 14 2011,positive,favourite of all of lord of the rings why smeagolgollum my precious
Jan 14 2011,positive,the fx are definitely incredible the helms deep dawn battle is the best dish

Jan 11 2011,positive,powerful moving  excited
Jan 11 2011,negative,omfg id rather hit myself in the head with a brick then watch lord of the rings same with harry potter
Jan 10 2011,positive,brilliant amazing gorgeous everyone of those adjectives does not describe how this film is unbielevably good its perfect in every part of it   and the battle for the helms deep makes me excited every time i watch it also after 8 years from the release of the film and probably not less than 5 or 6 visions sometime the middle part of trilogies are the weakest but thats not the case wrote someone before me i can only add in this trilogy the second part is the strongest
Jan 9 2011,positive,this whole series is just so epic whats not to like
Jan 8 2011,positive,a little too long but a good watch nevertheless wonderful battle scenes
Jan 6 2011,positive,not much crossfire here
Jan 6 2011,positive,superb nothing compares to lotr trilogy
Jan 5 2011,positive,the first is by far the best but though mistakes are made faramir comes to mind this is still a worthy middle child in a glorious trilogy
Jan 5 2011,positive,absolutely amazing best movie trilogy ever
Jan 4 2011,positive,epicly amazing everything about this movie is awesome the actors music plot special effects sets and practically everything else
Jan 4 2011,positive,although its not 100 accurate to the book of which its based the lord of the rings the two towers makes up for it through its brilliant action scenes particularly the battle at helms deep the direction and the acting though an adaption this film stands on its own
Jan 2 2011,positive,better in the extended version  the fight scenes in this one are the best of all three
Jan 1 2011,positive,no sophomore slump for this series but of course not its peter jackson
Jan 1 2011,positive,lord of the rings  the two towers  character driven but fantastically epic  pj pulls it off again of course no film in the trilogy is complete without the others but they work so powerfully as standalone films as well as in the other two the attention to detail is incredible i mean truly incredible middle earth is real guys peter jackson flawlessly took the image he and a lot of others envisioned and captured it  the biggest hiccup are the deviations from tolkien there were more in this film than the other two such as the warg fight and the trip to osgiliath i suppose for those who havent read the book everything flows and correlates but these were pretty upsetting if youre a tolkien fan  the movies greatest success well its successes were the elements story points and characters inspired or even directly copied from the book yes much of the film i spend not spent this one deserves an annual viewing holding my jaw open staring at the eye popping visuals however thats not reaaaally what its about its about frodo and sam and its obvious such tremendous effort is put into character development each of them falter and each is given a chance to redeem themselves primary credit to tolkien but partial credit to all those involved in the filmmaking process  the two towers in particular pushes the trilogy forward with the new character gollum andy serkis invested so much into this entirely animated loon and it shows a little example every time i and you too be honest watch the schizophrenic fight between gollum and smeagol im compelled    why 100  well despite the deviations from the book it does its source material justice and honestly i think of the two towers merely as the second chapter of one story the lord of the rings as it is but one story as a whole it is perfect the story of frodo and sam alone would be an incredible one but add compelling threedimensional supporting cast an array of battles and adventures and overall stunning visuals and you have a masterpiece    extra helpful in defining the word epic i find this movie to be wonderfully quotable ten thousand strong probably being the most popular i love how almost everyone agrees that the aragornlegolasgimli storyline is the best one followed by frodosam and then trailing at the back is merrypippin who spend most of the movie sitting in a tree
Dec 31 2010,positive,even better than the first movie but its hard for me to separate the movies in terms of how much i enjoyed them shelob was based off a native new zealand spider called a tunnelweb btw
Dec 30 2010,positive,plotsummary  set in a time of uncertainty in the land of middleearth a tale which charts a heroic quest which centers around an intrepid hobbit the future of civilization rests in the fate of the one ring which has been lost for centuries powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it but fate has placed it in the hands of a young hobbit named frodo baggins who inherits the ring and steps into legend a daunting task lies ahead for frodo when he becomes the ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the one ring in the fires of mount doom where it was forged but he cant accomplish this task alone a fellowship bands together to lend frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission the wisdom of gandalf the loyalty of his friends sam merry and pippin the courage of aragorn and boromir the precision of legolas and the strength of gimli they are aided in their quest by arwen galadriel and elrond whose knowledge of the ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey  my review  fans of director peter jacksons big screen adaptation of jrr tolkiens the fellowship of the ring have been eagerly anticipating the two towers  its actionintensive followup  for a year but even viewers in love with the first installment in this theatrical trilogy found it difficult not to ask a few very fair very basic questions chief among them can jackson do it again or will the whole shebang ultimately collapse under its own weight and excess like so many other films of this nature have in the past    they need worry no longer the two towers is an accomplishment equal to its predecessor but it succeeds in very different arenas where fellowship shocked viewers with its unrelenting focus on character development and dramatic truth such qualities are sidelined here in favor of propulsion and sheer grandeur with a twohour and fiftysomething minute running time ttt is remarkably well paced and is so texturally dense that several viewings may required just to take it all in those who felt the first film meandered a bit will find the two towers much more tightly focused and harddriving those who felt fellowships greatest triumph lay in its depth and characterization may find ttt a bit remote  more distancing and not as uninvolving    but such deficits are counterbalanced by the sheer audacity of the spectacle before us rarely if ever in the history of cinema have sequences of such magnitude been brought to the screen tensofthousands of soldiercreatures storm an imposing fortress called helms deep where human refugees are holding out in fight for survival and freedom  a fanciful riff on the legendary alamo armies of talking tree creatures tear into villain sarumans lair exacting primal revenge against those who have abused their brethren orcs ride herds of horsysized helldogs into battle against our heroes the list goes on  this thing is big    visual effects by weta are generally topnotch although observant viewers may catch a few pesky weaknesses suggesting the films vfx team may have simply just run out of time haloing around characters hairlines a little bit of green screen spill that makes for a sloppy composite runs rampant here animated objects such as the ents  the walking talking tree creatures mentioned above sometimes look inorganic with their surroundings and backgrounds the different layers of the effect are obvious and even basic compositing sometimes makes characters seem cut out or flat against a background of different texture or depth but for every shortcoming there is a triumph and despite the giddy vastness of the sequences mentioned above the greatest accomplishment of all is a guy named gollum        lr saruman christopher lee and wormtongue brad dourif mobilizing their army towards helms deep in the lord of the rings the two towers  interestingly enough gollum himself is imperfect his digital nature is often betrayed by his choppy squirrelly movements in long shots but when we see his face upclose his is instantly believable and thoroughly sympathetic and compelling taunted by a seemingly unceasing internalconflict he is constantly revealing his duality via a verbalized  and decidedly psychotic  inner monologue gollum gets more character development than anyone else in the two towers and quickly puts star wars writerdirector george lucas jar jar binks to shame looking like an ethiopian steve buscemi gollum may well be the first digital creature put onscreen who completely sells himself itself as a character and personality worthy of inclusion in a real world  theres not much to say about the returning cast  they are all prettymuch what they were established to be in the fellowship of the ring and rarely move beyond that newcomers include bernard hill captain of james camerons titanic as theoden ruler of a kingdom besieged by the forces of darkness genre freakazoid brad dourif as the duplicitous grima wormtongue miranda otto as eowyn who spends much of her time acting tough and pining for viggo mortensens aragorn david wenham as faramir brother of sean beans boromir who checkedout in the first film although wenham looks likeand pretty much acts likesean bean so im at a bit of a loss here and andy serkis as the liveaction motion template and voice of gollum both appeared briefly in fellowship but gollum is a fullfledged character here    viewers who find the the two towers spiritually unengaging can take heart in a recent interview with ign filmforce peter jackson reveals that the return of the king  the trilogys final installment  is his favorite film describing it as incredibly emotional despite the more cursory nature of ttt its beginning to look like oddball jackson may have accomplished the unimaginable and knocked one of historys most challenging literaturetofilm adaptations clean out of the park    no matter what one ultimate feels about the two towers one consideration shines brightly above the rest it will show you things youve never seen before and in this day and age thats not an accomplishment to be taken lightly

Dec 29 2010,positive,the lotr trilogy is a gem
Dec 29 2010,positive,i lied this is the best of the lotr trilogy
Dec 27 2010,positive,the lesser movie of the trilogy is still a fun ride nevertheless and showcases andy serkis as gollum who invents the new cgi model of the 2000s
Dec 27 2010,positive,i think this is my favorite of the three
Dec 27 2010,positive,one of my fave films 
Dec 26 2010,positive,an exhilarating tale is continued and jackson does well at continuing fellowships beautiful look and feel into the two towers  while still giving this installment its own identity
Dec 24 2010,positive,not many middle movies in a trilogy are able to capture the top prize the two towers is a rare exception because of its new characters exciting battle scenes and an entertaining plot
Dec 24 2010,positive,peter jackson keeps the goodness coming in the second part of jrr tolkiens epic fantastic performances from the entire cast are certainly still here with andy serkis entering the fray as smeagol the digital icon of the series who is iconic to us like yoda to star wars   this time around the plot moves a bit slower with more explanation and more movie magic to back it up the fellowship of the ring has broken apart with hobbits frodo and sam being guided by the mysterious smeagol to mount doom aragorn gandalf legolas and gilmi taking back the kingdom of rohan with its king hobbits pippin and merry stuck in the forest with magical talking trees and a dead member  the visual entertainment of the last film has improved but unlike the cgi disaster that took over the matrix the two towers gives more reason to have such awesome visuals
Dec 23 2010,positive,even better than the first one thanks to the most epic fight portrayal  this one i actually managed to watch in one sitting though at some parts it got horribly boring
Dec 23 2010,positive,this movie is my second fav of the three lotr movies very good  iangandalfmakes the hole movie for me goooo ian hope you will be in the hobbit
Dec 23 2010,positive,grander and tighter than the fellowship this one manages to tie in multiple story threads with ease continuing to enchant and enthrall and of course introducing one of the best cg characters ever smeagol gollum would almost steal the show if everyone else couldnt hold their own
Dec 23 2010,positive,just as good as the first although the scenery is not as colorful it still remains equally beautiful and the story was great the battle at helms deep was amazing
Dec 22 2010,positive,still think these movies are overrated
Dec 22 2010,positive,the fellowship is broken this is well not just as great as the first one but a great movie none the less this film i have watched about 10 times extendedand i am still thrilled by the visuals and the story it self
Dec 21 2010,positive,in the words of actor john rhysdavies part one was a damn wonderful film you aint seen nothing yet the lord of the rings the two towers is every bit as brilliant than its predecessor if not slightly better in some respects the stakes are raised and the story is darker but its also a film which demonstrates peter jacksons knack for balancing multiple storylines serving up eyepopping spectacle while keeping an unshakeable grip on the substance he introduced in the fellowship of the ring    where fellowship took its time to set up the world of the hobbits and flesh out the backstory surrounding the ring the two towers doesnt have any kind of initial exposition or recap to pull us back into the story it doesnt need to the opening sequence which takes us back in moria and shows us what happened next is as heartinmouth as you could possibly want it pulls us back into middle earth without simply retreading old ground so that by the time that frodo awakes from his dream we know exactly where we are and are raring to go    a common claim made about trilogies is that the second and or third instalments do not stand up as films in their own right but two towers defies this feeling every bit as wellcrafted and distinctive as the first film the lord of the rings trilogy is a misnomer since tolkien wrote it as one book which was then split into three by the publishers this is not a trilogy of one film with sequels like harry potter or the chronicles of narnia it is the second part of one story and all three parts blend together seamlessly    it is this seamless progression from one book to another which made it sensible to shoot the films simultaneously and is also this quality which allows jacksons more obvious creative decisions to work the single biggest change is that frodos deathdefying encounter with shelob is delayed until the start of the third film confounding expectations of those who had read the book in other circumstances this would have been a costly error but the level of skill present on screen leads you to implicitly trust the filmmaker so that even when there are noticeable alterations they remain within the tone of the film as a whole    as before the films production values are superb every prop costume and item of set is meticulously detailed and beautifully ornate absorbing you as a spectator and making you feel immersed in the cultures of rohan and ithilien the difference is that these designs now have to contend with far more kinetic and larger action setpieces than anything in the first film if fellowship laid the groundwork for both the story and the scale on which it would take place the second film builds on these foundations and flexes its muscles to show what can be achieved    to create the battle of helms deep jackson and his production team created a computer program called massive which entails creating hundreds of individual cg figures each capable of independent thought this makes the battles more believable with battalions of otherwise faceless armies taking on individual qualities if only for a moment the merging of cgi with reality is every bit as convincing as the amphitheatre scenes in gladiator but the organic effects are also terrific treebeard has all the physicality which comes from animatronics but none of the jerky drawbacks and the continued use of forced perspectives works as well as anything on eternal sunshine of the spotless mind    two special effects stand out in particular the first is the deageing of theoden where the zombielike king of rohan loses 40 years in a matter of seconds not only does his hair recede and change colour but the entire structure of his face is subtly altered and yet it feels as tactile as the makeup he wears at the beginning the other of course is gollum like the introduction to hobbiton this was a deathorglory moment for the trilogy since gollum is one of the connecting pieces in the story if we did not accept this portrayal than all would be lost but andy serkis succeeds with effort to spare putting in a tireless performance and truly inhabiting the character    the lord of the rings the two towers is a darker more threatening film than its predecessor a mood which is brilliantly conveyed in its battle scenes being a 12 certificate film we are still in fantasy violence territory the focus is on the suggestion of injury rather than lingering on blood like gladiator or braveheart for all the spearings and decapitations which again hint back to jacksons horror past the focus on violence is briefer and when individual pain is addressed as with haldir it is largely implied but despite the scale and the huge number of characters we still feel a huge emotional attachment thanks to jacksons camera positions and the rhythms of the battle ensuring that the characters pain and fear is very real    the film is also thematically rich drawing on tolkiens concerns about the destruction of the natural world and the potential enslaving of mankind through machinery tolkien consistently emphasised that his work was not allegorical  he found the device irritating baulking at his good friend c s lewis when he used it to great effort in the narnia series its tempting to substitute sauron and sarumans armies for the axis powers of world war ii  in light of the period in which the book was written  but to do so is to grossly oversimplify and reduce the lord of the rings what is certainly true is that tolkiens experience of world war i runs throughout his writing with his characters struggling through seemingly hopeless situations and good people being twisted into evil monsters despite their best intentions    this film places a neat twist on the theme of nature and machines clashing for the future of humanity in the first film the machines had it all their own way but with the arrival of the ents the shepherds of the forest who in turn control the trees nature is beginning to fight back however as the war turns the way of greenery on one front with the flooding of isengard at the other end the machinery of mordor is making mincemeat of the divided forces of gondor    in the middle of both these conflicts you have man and machine locked in combat for the control of the world the central battle between frodo and the ring stands on a knifeedge and it is increasingly unclear as to who is controlling whom as before the beauty of the lord of the rings is its harmony of the epic and the personal with all parties caught up in a conflict which is both physical and metaphysical    as with fellowship what really sticks with you after many viewings is the films noteperfect marriage of darkness and light in light of its imitators some pleasant some not we depict it as wholly dark bleak and brooding in a bid to drum up its heft and credibility but there is a lot of humour laced among even the darkest scenes the rivalry between gimli and legolas is beautifully judged and the scene of the latter killing soldiers while using a shield as a skateboard is straight out of bad taste even sams speech at the end about the great stories which teeters on message moment schmaltz works as an expression of hope amidst a gathering storm    the two towers is every bit as magnificent as its predecessor if not slightly moreso like mad max 2 or evil dead 2 it builds on everything that was brilliant in the first instalment while carving out its own identity howard shores score is brilliant especially in the dream sequences with arwen and jacksons direction is noteperfect beautifully judging the emotional impact of every last shot whether as a brilliantly constructed epic a fascinating or an intimate story of struggle and temptation there is something in the two towers for absolutely anyone
Dec 21 2010,positive,out of all the three epic lord of the  rings movies this had the most action many people consider the battle at helms deep was the greatest battle scene of all time well done peter jackson phillipa boyens and fran walsh for giving me the chance to experience the epic masterpeice that you guys made long live the king
Dec 21 2010,positive,spoiler free  as good as the first but with more action and the greatest battle in cinema history helms deep
Dec 20 2010,positive,this is another perfect film in whats most likely the greatest fantasy franchise ever harry potter doesnt count theres absolutely nothing wrong with it the only thing that even remotely irked me was that i found it a bit too long the acting the story the characters the visuals the battle of helms deep the villains the dialogue and the continuation of the story is what makes this film perfect yup that pretty much covers iteverything is just perfect    first of all the actors do really well in continuing the development of their characters especially frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin i also loved the introduction of gollumsmeagol played brilliantly by andy serkis they really play around with the split personalities and when bad things happened to him i felt genuinely sorry i cant wait for how theyll resolve smeagols problems in return of the king another thing i think smeagol can simultaneously be the cutest and ugliest creature in the whole world of fantasy but no one seems to agree with me     im glad that the rest of the characters in the fellowship are fleshed out and used a little more than in the fellowship of the ring aragorn is much more developed and arwens decision whether or not to live a mortal life is really explored and taken seriously as opposed to rushed legolas and gimli are used more and used better and that makes me very happy because theyre both great characters the friendship between frodo and sam really strengthened throughout the events of this movie and that is really shown well and showcases the good character in sam and his willingness to stick by mr frodo no matter what merry and pippin are also less goofy and shift out of their role of comic relief    this is another example of cgi done right the lord of the rings films prove that great visuals dont need to overwhelm or replace a good story these films just get even better as the series go by most likely because peter jackson is more secure with the fantasy genre and takes it further in the movie without taking it too far that being said the two towers is bigger louder and more overthetop in the usual sequel fashion but it uses that to its full advantage to perfect the battle of helms deep    i feel it is absolutely necessary to dedicate a portion of this review to christopher lees performance as saruman lee was probably the best actor in the movie and saruman is one of the greatest literary villains of all time he wasnt featured much in the fellowship of the ring but when he was featured he kicked ass in terms of casting you couldnt have gotten a better actor than christopher lee he looked the part he acted the part and most importantly he sounded the part seriously his voice is really freakin cool saruman is featured more in this movie and it is definitely better for it i can only wait and see what will happen to saruman when sauron is destroyed     i have not yet seen return of the king but seeing this i really desperately want to great characters great story great visuals great everything make for this perfect film if you havent seen it its a mustsee for anyone and one of the best fantasy films of all time i can only hope return of the king will be better
Dec 20 2010,positive,5 stars because of the battle of helms deep simply epic
Dec 19 2010,positive,good movie but probably the weakest one out of the trilogy
Dec 19 2010,positive,one of the best battles i have ever seen
Dec 18 2010,positive,i saw them all did not miss anything
Dec 17 2010,positive,this movie is a serious bummer its really good though
Dec 17 2010,positive,my favorite out of the whole trilogy
Dec 16 2010,positive,love love love this movie
Dec 15 2010,positive,loved it its a movie that i can enjoy with a nerdy fantasy
Dec 15 2010,positive,my personal fave in the series
Dec 14 2010,positive,fleshier than its previous film two towers rises above its predecessor through effective narrative techniques riveting battle sequences masterful scores from howard shore and beautiful dialogue from all characters this truly is a story that really matters
Dec 14 2010,positive,i have watched this movie from part one until the last part and it was so good
Dec 13 2010,positive,better than the first utter masterpiece
Dec 12 2010,positive,a masterpiece beyond imagination
Dec 12 2010,positive,great sequal to the trilogy peter jackson you done it again
Dec 11 2010,positive,not the best but good enough gollum was great
Dec 11 2010,positive,this somehow did not work for me if this was supposed to be serious it was verging on the ridiculous i could excuse the first one for a little lowbrow humour considering it didnâtmt get right into the journey at first but it was too overdone to at least lighten the mood in a serious context it also had massive pacing issues as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on and itâtms suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever  on the positive side the acting wasnâtmt affected too much the scenes with either legolas aragorn or frodo were beautifully done so i have come to terms with the fact that the acting can still be good even when the pacing isnâtmt despite that they should have taken a few of the characters out because they were kind of pointless i liked gollum or smã cagol but i think he was just there for the crazy factor overall it was good but was not as good as the first one this could definitely have been better maybe they should just have done two films if there was going to be such a big gap in the middle
Dec 10 2010,positive,excellent movie by peter jackson  gollum character is amazing in dis movie  excellent production designing
Dec 9 2010,positive,plainly splendid amazing job
Dec 7 2010,positive,the much darker second installment of the epic motion picture trilogy two towers ticks all the criteria for an excellent sequel with a host of new and interesting characters stunning new locations and cultures and some awesomely orgasmic battle scenes as well
Dec 6 2010,positive,although far more focused on aragorn and the travels of others besides the ring this movie is wonderful the climactic battle of helms deep could be one of the greatest scenes in movie history
Dec 6 2010,positive,extended edition bluray review what a precious sequel this is it does what a middle film in a trilogy should do it resumes where fellowship ended and sets up the grand finale that is return of the king again the extended edition is heads and shoulders above the theatrical one
Dec 6 2010,positive,i need a 6th star for this one
Dec 5 2010,positive,loved it loved it loved it
Dec 5 2010,positive,extended edition is even better  time to buy a projector to go with the full surround sound experience
Dec 5 2010,negative,okay  whatever  hobbits
Dec 3 2010,positive,gollum is such a beloved character my precious
Nov 29 2010,positive,this whole movie is a prelude to a battle and the battle itself takes way too long to come to an end however its still very entertaining highly atmospheric and drives relentlessly downward into the darker abysses of tolkiens epic bernard hills king théoden is an amazinglyacted surprisingly deep supporting character who adds much to this installment
Nov 28 2010,positive,even though it has a bad story this is the second movie in the series and the whole point of it is to continue the story and prepare for the final movie  even though i was disappointed with the movie because the second book is the best in the series i still thought it was entertaining when frodo has to tame smeagol  the special effects are phenomenal when they retreat to helms deep and besides a few messups with the story it is equal to the first and third film in the series
Nov 28 2010,positive,solid in effort so so in execution including many poorly made forced attempts at slapstick humor
Nov 27 2010,positive,how could you top the effects and story of fellowhip of the rings  two towers starts with a fiery descent through middle earth with gandalf battling the belroc  amazing opening  the ringwraiths have traded their bloody steeds for flying dragons the orc army poised to wipe out the last of man  the trees fighting back and toppling sarumans tower  gollumsmeagal takes center stage and is one the most convincing cgi characters in film at this point  highly recommended
Nov 27 2010,positive,loved it couldnt wait for the next movie  now waiting to see the hobbit
Nov 26 2010,positive,charged with advancing a colossal story on multiple fronts peter jacksons second installment in the storied trilogy sags a bit under the weight of its responsibilities and ends up coming down with a mild case of middlechapteritis thats not to say it doesnt get the job done the film does a decent job capturing the feeling that everything is moving inexorably forward to a catastrophic climax ian mckellen who dominated in the first film had far less to do here but fortunately andy serkis stepped up huge as the mocapvoice actor for gollum and ran the table on the rest of the cast even if he was largely cgi trickery brad dourif places second on the list of most captivating portrayals for a riveting and nuanced grima wormtongue that supersedes the novel version elijah wood and sean astin get a little weepy for my tastes but thats just me extended edition cut does nothing more than make the film longer a lot longer still a big win all around
Nov 25 2010,positive,goodit was ok but my fav is the first one
Nov 24 2010,positive,it is the worst lord of the rings movie but thats like saying that riding a magical flying unicorn through a lollipop forest is worse than riding a magical flying unicorn through a candy cane forest     the two towers along with all three of the lord of the rings movies deserves every bit of recognition it has received but i chose a least favorite and this is it
Nov 24 2010,positive,it definitely paid off to film these back to back because the tone remains consistent throughout and the action just gets better and better  and gollum is one of the great cinematic villains
Nov 23 2010,positive,my final analyisis it was above average but not much else i liked how they made gollumn a realistic character and not some evil freak like in the animated lotr it seemed a bit solw though the worst of the 3 but still pretty good
Nov 20 2010,positive,the best of the 3 imo
Nov 20 2010,positive,much slower than the first onebut still a great movie
Nov 19 2010,positive,the best movie collection ever
Nov 18 2010,positive,probably the most difficult film of the trilogy to make with no real beginning or ending however it is just as good as the other 2 the battle of helms deep was spectactular it made me want to join in
Nov 17 2010,positive,part two of the best trilogy ever
Nov 17 2010,positive,the more diplomaticallyminded film in the trilogy the muchunderrated two towers then again imdb has it listed in the top 30 but who cares is a very weird and beautiful mess with great action sequences and a very interesting change of pace for the adventure trilogy    while jackson flirted with traditional horror elements in the fellowship of the ring he mainly goes for body horror with this by introducing the world to the easilyparodiedbutnonethelessdisturbing gollumsmeagol a hermit whose complete obsession over that one very strange ring is so intense that he doesnt give a damn about the state of his whatappearstobedecaying body losing all of his teeth and hair to improper care the corruption of power has literally turned him into an animal albeit a very disturbed animal whose mind is split into two personalities good and evil gollum adds a very psychological aspect to the novel and film by showing us the end product of corruption death he looks like one of the walking dead  hell he acts like a zombie too    however the film isnt about gollum its about how the other nations are preparing for the eventual battle for middleearth and how sauron attempts to stop them dead in their tracks in that sense its a more diplomatic film giving the viewer a glimpse into the more political side of the battles and allowing aragorn to gain a more proactive role as de facto leader also its a commentary on the destruction of nature by industry one of tolkiens original intentions by comparing the naturallybeautiful places that we mostly linger at to the rustylooking and disturbinglydesigned isengard and its a commentary on love and how people will make seeminglystupid decisions to show that love transcends all things    then again the focus on the film is the battle of helms deep we focus quite a bit of time over there showing aragorn and this oncepossessed king trying to defend a very feeble people from a millionorc army hellbent on slaughtering every woman and child in all of middleearth only once in a while do we see merry and pippin talk to the trees about the ugliness of isengard or hell see frodo and sam slowly fray their friendship thanks to a hermit hobbit who just wants a piece of cursed jewelry    however the films problem is that it focuses on helms deep and all of the fighting too much we rarely see any character development save for sam frodo gollum and aragorn and again the issue of the dwarves men elves and hobbits completely annihilating the orcs mainly for defense and implied racist purposes is much ignored instead jackson opts for the born bad explanation ive heard way too many times in my life again i want to see what the orcs feel about the whole battle  what they feel about the other races and sauron and saruman and grima and all of those things are they just cartoon characters willing to be cannon fodder for a flashy legolas or are they actual creatures with feelings and souls    other than those flaws the two towers is a nice addition to the lotr trilogy note it needs much more gandalf the white that mans the ultimate badass
Nov 16 2010,positive,this one is good it has really good and interesting fight scenes in it plus gollum has a bigger role in this one and he is one of my favorite characters
Nov 15 2010,positive,in my opinion the best out of the three movies
Nov 14 2010,positive,sorrybig fan of this story i watch all three at xmas timepretty much every year
Nov 12 2010,positive,an excellent continuation of the first this film develops the multiple storylines that grow from the fellowship breaking apart in the first film a lot of surprises come forth and the film is executed extremely well
Nov 9 2010,positive,all of the lord of the rings movies are masterpieces to me
Nov 8 2010,positive,this is the way to go great running time and great depth each character was awesome and i have never been more absorbed into a film i love the books too and the two tower is by far the best adaption i love how jackson enhances on the story and puts his own charm into it two towers is a success
Nov 7 2010,positive,this is probably my least favorite of the three but its still five stars my one complaint is that this time around even on bluray with dtshd 61 master audio way too much of the dialogue is still almost incomprehensible i had to go back and hit subs several times especially with treebeard i still love it
Nov 7 2010,positive,i dont know do we really need to break up reviews between the three lord of the rings films or can we just give it a standard rating does this film prove the theory that a second film is the best of a trilogy no but it is still damn good
Nov 7 2010,positive,best movie trillogy ever there is nothing more i need to say
Nov 6 2010,positive,23 done  theo slept through most of it  these movies arent really what i thought they were gonna be but i like them
Nov 6 2010,positive,the two towers is a big departure from the faithful adaptation the saga had in the previous part the story arc divides into three parts but still turned out to be extremely well narrated the story adds new characters without confusing the viewers the performances are more evolved the tone is darker the direction is better the visuals get a major upgrade the battles get bigger  gollums performance wins hearts arguably better than its predecessor in some aspects the two towers is a work of art filled with some great cinematic moments the climactic battle of helms deep will always be remembered overall without a definite beginning or end the two towers is a stunning masterpiece  sets a really high bar for the final part of the legendary saga
Nov 6 2010,positive,better then the first one
Nov 5 2010,positive,the two towers loses none of the flair of its predecessor if anything it feels even grander in scale and stupendous battle scenes only heighten its impact
Nov 4 2010,positive,prob my favorite of the three  the battle at the gates was quite amazing
Nov 4 2010,positive,brilliant on every level plus one of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed
Nov 3 2010,positive,split into three sideswhich side are you onthat final act when livetrees  and hobbits attacking sarumans headquarters ownedyesim on that side
Nov 3 2010,positive,likely the best adaptation of book to screen in the recent history of fantasy and literature outstanding
Nov 3 2010,positive,my favourite of all 3 films
Nov 2 2010,positive,spectacular the escapism film
Nov 2 2010,positive,not as good as the first way too much battle scenes take away the effect for those who prefer a calmer action movie still a good movie highly reccomended for those actionlovers
Nov 2 2010,positive,if you thought the first lotr movie was amazing watch out for this one its bigger better more complex and much longer which in this case is a good thing with an epic battle not to be missed
Nov 2 2010,positive,badass film the fight at helms deep was awesome and the fight of the ents also you get to see alot of gollum in this film the whole lotr trilogy is an epic movie series that peter jackson and jrr tolkien should be very proud of for years to come
Oct 31 2010,positive,takes the middle chapter and makes it cinematically entertaining in its own right
Oct 31 2010,positive,simply excellent  this hits all the right notes that the middle movie of a trilogy should
Oct 31 2010,positive,it suffers from being the middle film no real beginning or ending but it still is good entertainment it also gives us a chance to see a wonderful performance by andy serkis as gollumsmeagol
Oct 31 2010,positive,part of the greatest trilogy ever made
Oct 30 2010,positive,the empire strikes back of the lord of the rings trilogy  the second out does the first
Oct 29 2010,positive,ok i ma not a big fan of this movie of this trilogy better say but this movie was actually good for 2 things gollun nad the battle scenes they were rat in motion so good better that i spectec  the delevolmen of the acting was actually good the movie have a relly good stuff that miss the eyesa thing this was so good even as aãgood as the 3 partbut this was missview by manyno to take credit of the 3 film i enjoy this as i did with the 3 xsif i enjoyi dont think so
Oct 28 2010,positive,this second part is great aswell just a wee bit slower still it takes you to magical of orc elves hobbits place and after watching a movie you want more absolutely great best movie ever
Oct 27 2010,positive,love all the lotr movies unreal
Oct 26 2010,positive,like the first film two towers also takes risk with its length and increased special effects but by retaining its cast smart direction and absorbing storytelling two towers once again proves itself to be one of the greatest films in history
Oct 25 2010,positive,really you have to see thes movies there awesome and great
Oct 23 2010,positive,the best  just the best
Oct 22 2010,positive,a little hodgey and not as good as the first or third installments but still a really good movie all around
Oct 22 2010,positive,i have seen parts of it and what i have seen its been better than the first
Oct 22 2010,positive,because of the plot and as a whole i liked the first one better bur this one improves in terms of characthers and action scenes the battle in helms place is superb for example and gollum is a great character  so it is a great follow up for the saga and a great movie overall
Oct 21 2010,positive,if i had to pick one out of the trilogy this would be it but really it represents all three as a whole
Oct 20 2010,positive,great sequel i will forever love lotr
Oct 19 2010,positive,this is just as good as the first if not better it has all the same qualities that made the first film great this is a fantastic sequel
Oct 19 2010,positive,like the books like the movies
Oct 18 2010,positive,stepping up the pace of the first film of the series in a lot of places this is a more interesting choice than the fellowship a bit lengthy and at times not wellfocused its still a solid movie with a lot of entertainment value
Oct 17 2010,positive,at the time quite impressive regarding its effects amazing and faithful adaption the battles are amazing
Oct 16 2010,positive,the two towers is most certainly my favorite part in the trilogy every action scene is breathtaking and epic on every level and unlike the first one the film doesnt drag on too much also the characters are well fleshed out in this one so we care what happens to them    the films story continues were the fellowship of the ring left off as the group have gone there seperate ways frodo and sam have gone off on there own to destroy the ring mary and pipin have been captured by the orcs and aragorn legolas and gimli are on the trail trying to save them frodo and sam find gollum who is there guide leading them to mordor after mary and pipin escape the orcs they come across an ent named treebeard and they plan to destroy isengard aragorn legolas and gimli find gandalf the white and they ride to rohan to free the king of sarumans clutches after that they ride to helms deep and so begins an epic battle what i like about this story is how there are three different events happening at the same time the hobbits do feel like they are on the sidelines not getting much action but they do towards the end much more characters are introduced and we learn more about aragorns love for arwen i do think that is explored a bit too much anyway the story is intresting the structure can be confusing at times but that didnt bother me    the acting really just the same as the first one i still dont like liv tylers performance and john rhysdavis as gimli he also voices treebeard is still my favorite his character is more of comic relif i also like his complicated relationship with legolas they seem like very good friends but they keep teasing each other about there race and in gimlis case his height i also like how they compete in battle to get the most kills gimli is also very eager and always wants to fight like in the warg rider fight when dead warg riders kept piling on top of him and he was missing all the action sam does seem rather obsessed with looking after frodo and always asks him if he is alright we should of seen more of mary and pipin i like the actors who play them and in this they seems to not move much while the others are usually miles ahead were we see mary and pipin at the start is where we see them at the end great acting by all bar one    i would like to say that these are some of the best action scenes put on film even the minor action scenes are better then anything michael bay can do the helms deep battle is an amzing acheivment in filming and i frankly dont want to know how they did it because it will ruin the experience of that epic scene i also thought the scene when the ents destoryed isengard was also as good as the battle of helms deep despite it not being very long but you have to see it to beleave it i love the script more then the first movie i love the conversations they have i love all the humor they put into it and not once was it boring gollum how can i not talk about him he is also a fantasic acheivment his personality disorder is very intresting the way he argues with himself fantastic     i never noticed the soundtrack to this film when the credits came up i got up to turn it off but before i could press the eject button on my ps3 a very beatiful song came up i dont know the name of the song but it made me drop my controller and i just listened to it right through the credits that was the icing on the cake to this film that song    overall the two towers is amazing in every single way i cant think of any flaw apart from liv tyler it is a step up from the orginal  9810
Oct 16 2010,positive,a stunning achievement
Oct 15 2010,positive,the two towers is a great great film it is not as awesome as fellowship of the ring in my opinion the two towers is a magnificint film that improves the lord of the rings franchise again the lord of the rings films take like 3 hours but again it is all worth each minute of it i give this movie an exact 98 a better score than fellowship of the ring so overall this is an awesome film that everyone will like but warning orcs may be scary to the little ones but little kids will probably love the film as well cause of the whole journey to destroy evil again you will love it
Oct 15 2010,positive,probably the best of the 3loved helms deep
Oct 14 2010,positive,the best fantasy mideval movies
Oct 13 2010,positive,applaudable fiction the writer ie rtolkien is trully blessed just like rl stine
Oct 12 2010,positive,again too long but full of action and insight thanks to peter jackson
Oct 12 2010,positive,loved the sceens of the movie 
Oct 12 2010,negative,aka short guys walking part 2
Oct 11 2010,negative,i never thought i would watch people walk for hours and i never intend to again aside from that creature that appears to be decomposing before your eyes wich i found very amusing i believe i would of died watching this one
Oct 10 2010,positive,the ironic thing about lord of the rings is that it gets better after each sequel unlike most movies that lack the depth and story it had from the first movie    i immensely enjoy the two towers and the development of the story and the different places in middle earth where different charactres exist and different situations are going on i have to say that the trees kind of annoy me because of the slow response they have in helping to save the world however the story is pure excellence    1010
Oct 10 2010,positive,the acting is magnificent and the visuals are as thrilling as ever beautifully directed by peter jackson the lord of the rings the two towers reigns as a superb epic fantasy film that should not be missed by any tolkiens fans
Oct 10 2010,positive,interesting 3ds and mythological film part two classics
Oct 9 2010,positive,wow i had no idea how phenomenal of an actor elijah wood was until i saw him absolutely nail this double role well actually i guess its more like a triple role what with sméagols split personality oh sorry thats not elijah wood its steve buscemi who really shows just how excellent of an actor he no wait that wasnt him either sorry but the cg was so phenomenal that i just cant buy that chunky apefaced andy serkis as sméagol and it doesnt help that his performance is so unbelievably stellar and transformative that he doesnt even give us the slightest bit of hint in his voice really my only problem with his performance is that he picked the wrong film to be great in because when youre dealing with the lord of the rings you dont stand a chance of being the only good thing in the film still he is among the most impressive things in this film which is really saying a lot still no matter how great this film is its not quite up to par with its predecessor being as flawed as ever    okay now im okay with no recaps of the previous film if the followup is a direct continuation of the story but im not okay with immediate development being lacking let alone when its completely absent now its much harder to develop the followup in a series than it is to develop the beginning of one because weve already established the characters and must find away to reestablish the emotional conncetion and only that but really the writers could have at least tried because the storyline has become so scattered and so complex that with this lack of emotional development its hard to lock into the film causing any immediate sense of tension or emotion  of which there is a deal right out of the gate  to ring false sure development gets there but its a rough road partially because were once again dealing with the previous films flaw of scenes going on as long as intended which is a long time and yet more events than ever feel rather abrupt and forced something else that has gone down in quality is the writing which isnt absolutely terrible but still packed with cheese and some pretty bad dialogue even the cool sequences are plagued with dialogue like release him or ill cut your throat which i know doesnt sound too bad but now i want you to imagine that its being said by elijah wood with an english accent now im not saying that elijah wood is bad but the more cheesy material is at its worst during his sean astin and the newcoming andy serkis segment and it only gets worse from there still although there is much to complain about in this film for every small fault this film makes it makes many more accomplishments and although its not quite as fine as its predecessor its still kicked things up a notch in a few departments    theres no not talking about one of these films without praising the technical even if you have before and sure enough theres no way around repeating myself when i say that the technical value is beyond masterful with stunning cinematography boasting such slickness and width in the scope to capture every bit of the glorious production designs that are so lively so inventive and only matched by the visual effects that are absolutely stellar however here theyve toned down the scope of the cg and are now using them in more intimate places and thats what makes these visual effects better than those of the last because you get to see just how seamless the cg is as they create authentic life with it seriously elijah woods eyes looked so real even though i knew that no ones eyes could be that big no i am of course refering to treebeard no im talking about the sméagolgollum effect now im going to stop pretending that im talking from 2002 and talk to the people of 2009 who walked out of avatar saying that it was groundbreaking in its cg and say that they not only broke that ground seven years from then with this film but avatar isnt fit to shine the shoes of the cg characters in this especially sméagol who is so seamless and authenticlooking in his interactions with the environment movement and of course his appearance that even though theres no way that someone can look like theyre in this bad of shape you still havent the foggiest that this character is merely the spawn of modern filmmaking at its finest of course another reason why you cant tell is because the guy behind it all gives it his all which isnt to say that he doesnt leave some room for his costars to shine    something that a lot of people dont realize is the this series has solid performances all throughout it and this film is no exception featuring a wide cast of very distinctive and memorable characters all portrayed with charisma and talent and youll often find yourself glued to the screen not just because of the phenomenal eyecandy but because you get many fine performances particularly by our young hobbit cast here our bigfooted but generally tiny leads are given more to do with the exception of elijah wood who is once again only asked to do a solid english accent and convey the pressures pushing down on his shoulders sharply and let me tell you he does just a good a job as ever still the spotlight now focuses more on woods buddies and i must say that it was worth the wait to see dominic monaghan and billy boyd get to show off more of their charm which isnt to say that it wasnt also a thrill to see sean astin establish himself as a leader but one who still needs to learn a thing or two if hes to get the job done still no matter how great everyone is it all comes back to andy serkis who is one of the finest examples of a solid cg actor who can do more than just throw on the gear now i know that sméagol is cg but hes an overlay of a real performer and if you pay attention serkis physical performance is so believable so distinctive and really defines the pains of his character though not quite as sharply as his ability to nail the painful yet rather human mannerisms and characteristics something else worth mentioning is his more subtle bits of acting and yes again i know that sméagol is cg but that makeup reaches the facial regions and serkis really know how to give the effects team plenty to work with because his facial performance is so authentic and tough to watch that even if he wasnt digitally transformed and stood before us as andy serkis he would still transform into this entirely different person or people if you will speaking of which let us not forget serkis absolutely phenomenal job at nailing this split personality in a fashion that doesnt really have you believing that he is with two minds interacting with each other but that he is an unstable easily manipulated soul that is going through a constant internal battle with these two entirely different people thus making him one of the most compelling types of antiheroes out there one to summon sympathy as well as tension as he leaves you to wonder if his next move is going to be good or bad as well as questioning if any of his moves were ever genuinely good to begin with    now i finally come to the end of this chapter in a fashion that this film taught me is the best with explosive action now as much as i loved the first one the action was too good to come around every once and a while and for those who felt the same i hate to break it to you but the action in here isnt that much more prominent still what action there is is worth the wait but what really makes this action more worth discussing than the action in the first one is the final battle which is one of the greatest climactic war sequences in the history of film i could go on all day about how amazing the final war sequence is but i believe that i can best summarize my praise for it by simply saying this monsters warriors elf archers a dwarf with a battle axe wizards and giant tree people all for a glorious 30plus minutes it definately makes it past the really high standard set right out of the gate with a hook that is a repeat of what was an emotional sequence in the predecessor only this time pete jackson says now that weve gotten all of the mushy stuff out of the way lets see what really happened and leaves us to kick back relax and enjoy an explosively amazing action sequence that immediately sets a nearimpossible standard for the rest of the film and i assure you that said standard does not go unmet if not surpassed still although i joke about jackson cutting out the emotion of that scene a repeat of the emotional resonance wouldnt have fit the tone but jackson makes up for that by doing what he can to develop emotion so that when all of the heart and tension come into play it delivers    at the end of the day although all of the faults made by the predecessor as well as a lack of immediate development and plenty of cheesiness keep it from being up to par with the preceeding film the dazzling technical value and powerhouse action spice up this still very compelling story that is carried by its solid cast of performers  particularly andy serkis  and director peter jackson leaving the lord of the rings the two towers to still stand as a true work of art and satisfying continuation of the magnificent saga    45  great
Oct 9 2010,positive,better than the first and had my attention still nothing shouts obsess over me like qualities of harry potter and star wars but still it had alot of great action andy serkis gives a wonderful and creepy performance and the usual brits that i love like ian mckellen are great as ever
Oct 9 2010,negative,the best film i ever saw
Oct 7 2010,positive,i think it is the best trilogy of all time my superfavourite too i love all the castings they portray the characters really really well superbly done jrr tolkien would have been so proud  
Oct 7 2010,positive,the best of the lotr series and thats saying alot
Oct 6 2010,positive,decent movie though it departs in some annoying little ways from the book  the battle of helms deep is probably the most satisfying of all the big battles in the trilogy
Oct 5 2010,positive,words cannot describe how much i love this film
Oct 5 2010,positive,new classics  peter jackson is someone id stand in line to meet
Oct 4 2010,positive,one of the greatest movies ever created
Oct 3 2010,positive,such an amazing sequel its very rare for a movie to be better then its first and the two towers nailed it completly one of the best sequels to a movie ever and personally my favourite lord of the rings picture of the three its historical battle near the end was so epic it kept my eyes glued to the screen like every time never really blinked you see alot more in depth on how the story is progressing further more characters are included its battles love humour and setting is all a five star special this is precision
Oct 3 2010,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
Oct 2 2010,positive,great middle to the trilogy but its the weak link in the chain
Oct 2 2010,positive,one of those movies that made history is a 10
Oct 1 2010,positive,like sam i would reject gollum speaking of gollum the cgi that brings him to like is amazing like the fellowship it is awesome
Oct 1 2010,positive,more things are taken out and several scenes are put in gollums portrayal is perfect  furthermore there is that spectacular scene of boromir giving a postbattle speech inspiring and magnificently written perfectly acted by the excellent sean bean
Oct 1 2010,positive,though the plot feels less coherent the two towers still achieves as an incredible film  andy serkiss turn as gollum is haunting
Sep 29 2010,positive,by far the best from the trilogy 3
Sep 28 2010,positive,best movie of the trilogy
Sep 27 2010,positive,real old movie tight
Sep 27 2010,positive,the two towers is a spectacular movie  the dramatic battle of helms deep was breath taking why all three parts of the trilogy is not in the rt top 100 list beats me i can watch this trilogy again and again and again  i cant wait until the extended edition version is released for bluray
Sep 27 2010,positive,theoden steals the show most underrated character in the series
Sep 27 2010,positive,fantastic continuation of the journey from frodo and sam in their mission to save middleearth peter jacksons return to continue his job to delivering one of the grandest entertainment in this century the plot is more intelligent more mature appearance of the wood mckellen and mortensen as well as drama and action has a far more powerful making this adaptation of jrr tolkiens book as the best of the trilogy good job
Sep 26 2010,positive,enjoyable in spite of some narrative turns that dont help the flow or the ideas behind the story chief among these are the aragorn death scene faramir following his lust for the ring and frodo offering the ring to the nazgul that said gollum is fantastic as are all of his scenes with frodo and sam helms deep is also a very wellexecuted battle scene as is the ents cleansing of isengard well done even if a bit overblown in places
Sep 24 2010,positive,widely known as the lesser of the three in the lord of the rings saga it can be a major snoozefest the two towers has the awkward set up of being the middle act jackson wisley steals events from the first chapters of the two towers and supplants them in the first film to wrap things up nicely unfortunately this makes two towers even worse    it begins on a high recapping the amazing battle between gandalf and the balrog then its all down hill gandalf goes on some acid trip and comes back dressed in white with lack of memory like he returned from the looney bin     then we get aragorn and his merry men running in fields for 30 minutes blah    this movie is mired by elflore talking trees and liv tyler all three together will give a warm bed and liquid nyquil a run for their money elves are a stuffy pompous bunch who blibber blubber about the misgivings of others treebeard and his woodenwoodies are painful to watch making me check an infomercial on axes and saws and go crazy in a forest liv tyler has zero chemistry with wide eyed aragorn in fact if jackson casted queen latifah instead things would be much more interesting    too many cut scenes to boring elftree jazz instead of focusing on action the climactic scene at helms deep is one of the best moments in cinema history for example then there is a cut away to treebeard figuring out something to say and taking a very long time to say it when did gimli the dwarf become scottish the hobbits start to get really annoying too you find yourself rooting on the orcs to make hobbit stew    gollum steals whats left of the film what a wonderful character schizophrenic double personalities and hideous to behold i remember his performance by andy serkis pushed actors in general to rethink awarding roles done in cgi    i also disliked the men of rohan and wished they lost king theoden is an egomaniac dumb and insecure      the film still every bit technically good as the first and last lost all sense of adventure to me and ended on a sour note probably one of the worst film endings out there but what can you do return of the king is the smallest book of the 3 the scope of this film and the next keeps growing in scale and becomes more and more epic moving further away from what made the first film so sublime
Sep 24 2010,positive,now that theyve introduced the story they get to the interesting part right away theres a bit of boring talking but the dialog is usually pretty interesting this time theres better action and more of it the battle sequences are amazing when the slow talking trees come around they dont mind smacking the crap out of what ever they can reach and causing mass destruction i always forget that frodo and sam are the main characters because so little of the movie is on them but im never bothered by this because they make the rest of it fairly interesting the visuals and musical score are both as beautiful as ever the action a great improvement on the last one but is all saved for the end not as good as the first but still a great movie
Sep 23 2010,positive,the two towers the second installment in the best trilogy of all time the lord of the rings comes out swinging in this masterpeice of a movie just as the first the visuals acting screenplay score and directing are phenominal  andy serkis does a fantastic job that stands out from the rest as unique and original amazing job
Sep 23 2010,positive,one of the greatest fantasy films of all time a testament to how brilliant a filmmaker peter jackson really is great stuff
Sep 20 2010,positive,long bur still a good movie
Sep 20 2010,positive,this is definitely my favorite one in the series it has the best battles and it is just really captivating i love it
Sep 20 2010,positive,my comment is under return of the king
Sep 19 2010,positive,not enough happening
Sep 19 2010,positive,omg this is was so so amazing  def going on my fav movies list  it was alot better than the first one personally  the 3 hours was amazing like many movies in one the acting and characters were great too  cant wait to see third now
Sep 18 2010,positive,after being complete awe of the first film and knowing they filmed the entire trilogy at the same time i had little doubt this film would be great too however i was not expecting it to completely obliterate all of my expectations  the film like the rest of the trilogy is one of the purest works of fiction youll ever come by and yet it still manages to find mountains worth of material with witch one can identify oh yes and the battle of helms deep is only one of the finest battle sequences ever filmed
Sep 18 2010,negative,too long lost interest
Sep 18 2010,positive,ok surely better than the first one but still
Sep 17 2010,positive,another breath taking lord of the rings movie i loved it a must see
Sep 15 2010,positive,watching 2nite luv it
Sep 15 2010,positive,still watch it sometimes on dvd fantasic storyline
Sep 14 2010,positive,perfect sequel peter jackson took the rescue to bring tolkiens work to the screen with one of the most complex film projects in recent years the two towers was the most difficult to do for two reasons  a for being the one in the middle it has neither a beginning nor an end so he must engage the audience from the start and motivate the public to see the return of the king the final  b the two towers is the weakest of three books and take it to the screen needed alot of skill and charm and visual impact to viewers  the three films were shot at the same time evidence of the great assembly the three tell the same story the three present and this no less than the rest impressive costumes especially the dresses of the rohirrim both natural scenery and by computer really impressive so faithful to the descriptions in the novel here stands the milieu of edoras and helms deep especially meduseld castle  drama war adventure fantasy all combine in this superproduction jackson once again demonstrated its capacity  soundtrack to a category admirable the rohan theme is beautiful and epic perfectly conveying the warrior heart of this people that tolkien translated so well in the novels and peter jackson in the movies
Sep 14 2010,positive,excellent sequal  the drama that unfolds all leads to the eventual grand battle  and what a battle it is  helms deep is quite possibly one of the best epic battle scenes in all of film  thats saying alot  i can recall almost every visual and sound in that whole sequence  this to me was the best movie of the trilogy  well directed from open to finish excellent acting and the special effects were unbelievable  the sheer fact that a cg character like golum could be considered for a supporting actor award is telling of how well edited this film was
Sep 13 2010,positive,for me this is my least favorite and doesnt exactly compare to the other two its sort of hard though when youve got a really kickass launch to a brilliant trilogy and a powerful closing thats why this movie falls in between as sort of an episodic filler but hear me out when i say its all still good this movies pacing is slower but picks up right where the action left off the music is still sensational and action is top notch this movie takes itself seriously and does not disappoint christopher lee steps up his performance as the main villain but its a little discerning that gandalfwho comes back even more badass doesnt even come face to face with saruman he just lingers and leads the three warriors with wisdom and thats what i find this film to be most about just the next step forward no nothing happens thats new except maybe gollum who steals the show but its still great fantasy entertainment the story continues in a moremedieval tone then ever
Sep 13 2010,positive,excellentwould love to own the entire set
Sep 13 2010,positive,no hope only a fool s hope
Sep 13 2010,positive,good but it didnt live up to the other ones
Sep 13 2010,positive,its a tnt lotr marathon  oh the sexy elf and human king
Sep 12 2010,positive,the two towers continues the epic and classic tale of destroying the one ring with more battle sequences and intensity but still containing the heroic and epic atmosphere from the previous installment
Sep 12 2010,positive,the best of the bunch
Sep 11 2010,negative,i could not stay awake for this movie
Sep 10 2010,positive,truly an epic adventure that continues the quest to destroy the one ring this epic film features my favorite battle scene of all time the battle for helms deep 10000 urukhai against hundreds of men and elves the movie gets more intense when frodo and sam discover smeagol the three hunters continue to look for merry and pippin while gandalf is being resurrected a great score that i fell in love with great acting by an allstar cast epic battles and a kickass storyline
Sep 10 2010,positive,the trilogy remains a landmark of modern popcinema the source material remains one of the greatest of popular fiction of the 20th century so the only real review to make regards where the two towers ranks in relation to the fellowship of the ring and the return of the king    one can easily make the claim that is possesses all the epic action and battles lacking in the former and excessing in the later one could also say that the large role for saruman is a strength not possessed by either of the other films its really hard to balance arguments regarding relative strength of present characters as each installment possess greater amounts of a number of strong characters    i can say that the film does not seem overlong as the real complaint leveled at the return of the king and that the epic action sequences make the two towers a far more impressive spectacle to witness than the fellowship of the ring was thus the two towers has to rate for me as the best of the three films
Sep 9 2010,positive,as great as the first one but made more memorable if only because of gollum played with great intensity by alex serkis
Sep 8 2010,positive,see my review of the first film
Sep 7 2010,positive,just a bit better than the first movie plus a little bit more interesting  the new characher gollum was a big hit for me  plus a much better final
Sep 6 2010,positive,the memorable second installment of the lotr trilogy was jacksons most difficult assignment of the three and he carried it off in style the recent rerelease of the films on the big screen afforded another look at the extended editions of these films and ten years later they still have power and huge entertainment value while some would argue that two towers has a flawed flow to it cutting constantly back and forth between the various characters theres no denying that if you have the patience for the film it all comes together so well you hardly notice the pacing is brisk the development of new characters is robust and the action is tense and spectacular    my opinion is that a linking film like this is the most difficult to make because of the new characters and narrative action the film manages to do some things really well that are critical to the story gollum is masterfully pulled off and hes a critical part of these films the animation still looks good ten years later because of the advanced techniques they used at the time the subplot of saruman is successfully explained and carried out and the battle for helms deep is excellent the ents were another difficult assignment and they come off well also they provide a whimsical story for the two hobbits to work within while their brethren are off doing darker more dangerous work     the strength of the ensemble cast cannot be undervalued here either the supporting characters add just the right amount of depth and gravitas to the proceedings rather than distracting from the major fellowship characters in the extended we even get to see boromir again in a brief sequence explaining more about faramir his brother purists might quibble about what jackson included and what he left out but im as much of a purist as the next and i thought he kept what he needed and modified what he didnt have     yes the extended adds in some talky areas but by this time youve invested in these characters and any additional footage is just candy to be eaten without question again musical score art direction cinematography effects and costumes are all first rate its not a stand alone movie but i appreciate it more now than i did then
Sep 4 2010,positive,once againawesome
Sep 4 2010,positive,i dont want dont want to give this movie a 100 but since rotten tomatoes doesnt allow a 97 i need to round up    my review of the fellowship of the ring has all you need to know about the series but ill say this movie doesnt meet my imagination as much as the first one    still it is a high quality movie which peter jackson took as serious as you could possibly take as a director the acting is again superb the cg is top notch and of the highest quality    a must for all dvd collections a must to see at least once in the best quality environment big screen big sound high replay value
Sep 4 2010,positive,the two towers left off where fellowship left off usually sequels get worse but not in the case of lotr the battle at helms deep is truly epic and gollum is amazing addition to the onscreen presence  you truly find yourself going  okay what is goin to happen to frodo in the fellowship your not to aware of whats to happen to this ring  but at the end of towers your just pumped for whats to come in the finale
Sep 4 2010,positive,superb 2nd installment just slightly inferior to the 1st film due to the suprise and scenery elements having gone but deffo my favourite films ever
Sep 3 2010,positive,this one is just as good as the fellowship of the ring but it was gullum who stole the show andy circus is really good playing him the battle of helms deep is pretty spectacular to watch and the ending makes a perfect tie into return of the king
Sep 3 2010,positive,best film ever based on the best story ever
Sep 3 2010,positive,it just doesnt lose a beat there is no drop off in quality of cast story scenery or performances
Sep 2 2010,positive,to be honest brilliant story telling i much enjoyed  everything it was for its time
Sep 2 2010,positive,i have to tell you the two towers is defiently an outstanding sequle and its intensely thrilling in the film frodo bagginselijah wood and samwise gamgeesean astin continue thier way to mordor as middle earth stands on brink of near despair as the forces of sauron and sarumanchristopher lee beging waging war on rohan and its people can frodo and sam make it to mordor and destroy the ring before chaos strikes your gonna half to watch the film and find out    i really have to say the two towers is one of best film achivements of 2002 and its one of those sequles that raely work this is probably the darkest installment of series and it offers alot of depth the the fellowship of the ring couldnt provide i also have to admit that the battle of helms deep is the best battle scenes in cinema history its very actioned packed the films story is epic the visuals are fantastic and it succeeds in where other sequles fail my tomatomter rating is a 98 precent the two towers in my option is a must see is completely epic and is thrilling to the last minuet
Aug 31 2010,positive,when i first saw this movie i absolutely hated it i walked out of the theater all in a tizzy over something someone who has not read the books may find silly faramir was kind of a dick and that cocktease ending where they cut off just before gollum leads the hobbits to shelob ive since grown to realize that the movies were far more human than the books and its okay to have a character whose morals are torn and after watching pirates of the carribean 2 dead mans chest endings where the fates of the characters are not very well wrapped up leading into the next film kind of suck donkey balls so basically ive since grown to forgive jackson and the like especially after watching return of the king in all its glory and upon re watching the two towers have grown to love it as well for its innovative epic battle scene at the end and perhaps most of all gollum who is perhaps the most artfully crafted cgi character of all time while fellowship still holds that special place in my heart two towers in many ways surpasses its predecessor but also begins the long line of lord of the rings cornball deus ex machinas ah well are these movie fan boy hype or the real deal lets take a look    alright so the film opens with an eagle circling a snow capped mountain screeching already drawing imagery from the misty mountains in the first filmwell that and you can hear gandalf ian mckellan giving a much more subdued performance this time shouting from within followed by the camera zooming in to the mines of moria and a reenacting of gandalfs death at the hands of the balrog from the previous film however as he falls we follow him this time and he continues to battle the balrog until the chasm bottoms out into an underground lake which is one of the coolest movie scenes youll ever see but its all just a dream as frodo elijah wood as the films progress and frodo becomes increasingly more deranged woods performance gets surprisingly versatile awakes with a cry frodo and sam sean astin wasnt as big a part of this one as the other two are traveling through the bleak hills they overlooked at the end of the previous film one night theyre attacked by the creature gollum andy serkis weird as shit but my god this man has got to be some kind of geniuswho wishes to retrieve the ring that bilbo had stolen from him so many years ago frodo however binds him by the power of the ring to be their guide to mordor which he promises fearfully to do anyone else think this sounds like a terrible idea already eh im giving to much away in the city of rohan mean while aragorn viggo mortenson continuing to be sexy badass personified legolas orlando bloom not an elf but a fairy and gimli john rhys davies gruffer than a mother fucker the latter two whom further develop their humorous buddy cop friendship fearlessly pursue some urukhai who still have merry dominic monaghan god hes in an eminem video how the mighty have fallen and pippin billy boyd always entertaining captured meanwhile at evil sarumon christopher leeahhh what a voice is behest orcs and men are raping and pillaging the land of rohan while ailing king theoden bernard hill in one of the films best performances as the torn and guilt ridden king is being poisoned into complacency by his evil steward grima wormtongue brad dourif what a creepy but awesome motherfucker we see a scene of a mother sending her kids to the capitol on horseback while a city is destroyed happy stufftheodens nephew and head of the cavalry the riders of rohan eomer karl urban also quite fantastic as the bitter and betrayed warrior informs theoden that his son the prince has been killed by orcs and angered at his seeming nonchalance attacks wormtongue calling him a spy and as a result is banished roaming the land trying to reestablish order the now nomadic eomer and his riders attack the uruk hai one night allowing merry and pippin to narrowly avoid being eaten but the film cuts away right as a horse is about to bash in pippins skull     meanwhile frodo and sam make their way through some marshes to avoid a scouring airborne ringwraith and gollum saves frodo from drowning as hes hypnotized by some corpses at long last they reach the gate and a scene unfolds oddly similar to the scene outside the wicked witchs castle in the wizard of ozgollum however pleads them not to attempt entry that way as theyll be captured and tells them of a secret passage hed neglected to mention until literally the last minute sam whos a sensible hobbit is suspicious but frodo thinking to how gollum saved him in the swamp agrees to go his way aragorn and company run into a bitter eomer who tells them he destroyed the uruk hais that they were tracking and he regrets to say that none where left alive he warns against going to the capitol and they part ways the trio investigate the battlefield and aragorn in tracker moves that would put csi to shame discovers and we see as he discoversagain very cool scene the hobbits did manage to escape and made it into the large fangorn forest where though the trio doesnt realize this they are rescued and taken to safety by a large talking tree or ent named treebeard john rhys davies one deus ex machina i wont complain about because i love ents and the movie does them well the trio however do run across a shiny wizard who they think to be sarumon and attempt to attack but reveals himself to be gandalfthe white it seems after killing the balrog he was granted rebirth as gandalfthe white i love gandalfim glad hes backbut thats just stupid and the movie knows it as it doesnt even try to explain the logistics of it ah well the four now travel to the capitol of rohan and fuck up wormtongues little operation and exorcise sarumon from inside of theoden wormtongue is about to be killed by theoden when aragorn stops him saying nobly enough blood has been spilled on his accountwormtongue consequently is allowed to escape to sarumon noone stops himthis is really fucking stupid im not even being blood thirsty here hes going to his evil lord and your enemy to tell him every weakness of your stronghold enough blood has been spilled on his account way to go aragorn thanks to you it will be fountains morei get a little mad about that poor judgment maybe you shouldnt be king aragorn theoden is brutally awoken to the horrors of what has happened and after seeing the two kids from earlier arrive decides to take his people to bunker down in the mountain stronghold of helms deep rather than risk open war despite aragorns protests oh all eager for blood now are we gandalf knows sarumons uruk hais will destroy the castle without help so leaves to retrieve eomer and the riders promising to be back on the sunrise of the fifth day the people begin a mass exodus to helms deep and aragorn forms a close friendship with eomers sister eowyn miranda otto who does pretty darn good on the road trip and discusses with her how his previous love arwen liv tyler she cries and rides horses thats it is being pressured heavily to leave middle earth with the other elves by her father elrond the always excellent hugo weaving which we then actually see happen in the meantime wormtongue is at sarumons tower and tells him that the people are going to helms deep and how to destroy the wall sarumon adresses his massive army to leave no one alive great fucking call there aragorn    gollum has up till now faithfully lead the hobbits to their destination but at night we see an inner turmoil within him that shows jackson as a master director and serkis as a mad genius i dunno something about that scene where gollum and smeagol gollums good side basically do mental battle for control is rife with tension brilliant character development and even a bit of humor good good shit frodo and sam not to long after gollums epiphany are captured however by rangers from gondor meanwhile we get a pretty cool scene where some orcs riding worgs attack the rohan people and are pretty effectively destroyed but one drags aragorn off a cliff also to be noted is legolas mastery with a bow he can shoot a target while doing this weird swing flip thing onto a horse remember this meanwhile elronds basically going fuck middle earth and he and galadriel cate blanchett postulate on if this is the right course of action so frodo and sam find themselves in the stronghold of the rangers or whatever and in the hands of faramir david wenham is there a not solid performance in these movies who is you guessed it boromirs brother it seems theyve found his body set adrift in the last film and hes rightfully suspicious of frodo who admits to being his traveling companion and claims not to know of his fate faramir also tricks frodo into admitting gollum is with their crew when they threaten to kill the creature which is fishing on their sacred grounds if it is of no consequence to the hobbits through gollum he learns of the ring and seeking to impress his daddy takes the hobbits and the rings to gondor right across the river from mordor aragorn is awoken on a shore by his fucking horse not shitting you he sees the approaching army on his way to helms deep and somehow beats them there warning everyone and leading to fear and tension in the ranks as to how outnumbered they are even legolas however word is sent to the elves of lothlorien and that cool cocky elf from the first one shows up with a battalion really quickly ready to fight god these uruk hai are slow as shit     the battle at helms deep was probably the most epic thing any movie audience had ever seen in terms of fantasy warfare or even just movie warfare braveheart would have shit itself its impossible to describe its a long action driven battle but basically the uruks are raising these big ass ladders to scale the wall and the rohan people are pushing the ladders off and picking off uruk hai with their archers the cocky elf guy dies regrettably and theres some pretty amusing and badass moments from our three protagonists banter between gimli and legolas a reference to a line from the previous film nobody tosses a dwarf and legolas surfing down some stairs on a shield shooting mother fuckers all the way shit gets weird when one uruk decides its time for the lighting of the olympic torch and starts running with the torch to this like hole in the castle wall wormtongue has revealed to be a weakness legolas is ordered to take him down that thing is moving slow as shit legolas actually puts two in his arm but cant bring him down this guy has been able to shoot anything that moves the whole time and suddenly when its crucial he shoot one guy he chokes my god anyways merry and pippin and treebeard have called an ent meeting ents are lazy bastards and talk really slowly but after some rallying words and a showing of sarumons devastation of the forest the ents set out to kick sarumons wizard ass    now the conclusions of all three of these storylines four if you count gandalf i wont reveal but i will say theyre all epic well done and its basically the opposite of empire strikes back read into that what you will ok i mean that this sequel ends with the bad guys getting the shit kicked out of them or thwarted at least on all fronts much like the last one it sets itself up nicely for the sequel in sam and frodos case at least but not shameless or cliff hangerly an excellent film and a brilliant sequel yet again jacksons found that medium between shameless blockbuster fun and art
Aug 30 2010,positive,continues the lord of the rings trilogy and it sure is better then the first one which i didnt like as much    the sequel to the fellowship of the ring is a lot less boring then the first film as it contains some very intenseand awesome medieval battle scenes the movie also improved in the technical levels as it contains some breathtaking cgi the film is still beautiful and emotionally brilliant just as the first film and i thought smeagle the creature gave quite an amazing performance creeping me out but also making me actually shed a tear for him the first half of the film was a little boring but the second half is full of epic events taking place and makes me a person who never was interested in the lotr trilogy and thought the first was boring very eager to see the final and for sure to be epic film    rating 75
Aug 30 2010,positive,loved this film it did not let me down in the slightest brilliant story and special effects
Aug 29 2010,positive,about as good as the last one but talking trees come on
Aug 29 2010,positive,great movie while the first was probably better on a technical level the two towers stands firm and offers even more of what the fellowship of the ring delivered
Aug 28 2010,positive,great movie even though it is my least favorite of the trilogy the movie is still excellent
Aug 28 2010,positive,a good sequel to a good film
Aug 28 2010,positive,i think its the best one of the three the visuals are amazing and i love it
Aug 26 2010,positive,the third best of the trilogy but you cant say the worst of the trilogy because theres absolutely nothing negative about this film at all the others are just more perfect this installment of the trilogy introduces new characters as the adventure splits into different paths we meet characters like eowyn faramir eomer theodenin which the supporting actors portray brilliantly again as in the first film the supporting cast really adds to the movie the fighting scenes in this film are so epic the battle of helms deep is so awesome   this is a great perfect film that adds depth emotion and character to the trilogy
Aug 26 2010,positive,what is it with these movies seriously  i just cant put my finger on it how peter jackson was able to direct such a perfect series  im not really sure what to say but i love to watch these movies over and over again  the two towers was a daring sequel to the fellowship of the ring  and viggo mortensen was easily the best person for the part of aragorn  i cannot even imagine someone else playing as him
Aug 25 2010,positive,the best of the three in my eyes two towers takes the solidly developed characters and thrusts them further into tolkiens vast world of trolls orcs dragons and other mythical beasts our heroes dont seem to stand a chance and its all the more exciting to see what they make of the circumstances every battle sequence is impressive and every character is given opportunity after opportunity to continue fleshing out
Aug 25 2010,positive,the extended version of the two towers is at times very painful to watch most of the additional footage revolves around arwen  aragorn and is absolutely dreadful what was always the weakest of the trilogy has been made even worse
Aug 24 2010,positive,i just want to watch it again
Aug 24 2010,positive,beautiful with amazing battles
Aug 23 2010,positive,one of the bet movies of 2002
Aug 22 2010,positive,i like fellowship of the ring morebut barely more the two towers is the middle film of the lotr trilogy and it delivers the battle of helms deep is one of the best battles to ever be portrayed on screen and just like the 1st film the acting is flawless and the music blends in perfectley with every scene the cgi gollum is also a amazing achievement as he looks almost real in several scenes again one of the best films ever made to one of the best trilogies ever made
Aug 21 2010,positive,my favourite in the trilogy and plenty of andy serkis to go around
Aug 21 2010,positive,boring but good and well done
Aug 20 2010,positive,a standing ovation for all concernedthe two towers can only be explained in one word beautiful this film left me breathless i was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the fellowship of the ring and i must say that it has surpassed the film completely i will have a hard time watching the fellowship and seeing the ending knowing there is so much more waiting
Aug 18 2010,positive,an alltime favorite of mine
Aug 18 2010,positive,as for me  the most epic part of 3
Aug 17 2010,positive,seamlessly move on from the first the way a second part of a true trilogy would  the scale is not quite as grand as the first but we do get to know the remanding members of the fellowship better and care for them more  the battle of helms deep also gives us a idea of what the final on will look like yet stands different and amazing by its self  my only complaint is there is not enough gandalf but that is made up for in the next chapter
Aug 17 2010,positive,absolutely in tune with how i imagined middle earth
Aug 16 2010,positive,my favourite of the trilogy
Aug 15 2010,positive,great epic a really great storyline and action

Aug 15 2010,positive,this is one of those very rare middleoftheseries movies that is just as good as the others it moves along and answers questions while still nodding towards the final movie also the battles are epic
Aug 14 2010,positive,best movies ever weither u like them or not top quality
Aug 14 2010,positive,a fantastic intepretation of a classic novel
Aug 12 2010,neutral,the trip to mordor that momentarily went off track
Aug 12 2010,positive,these movies are perfect ill never be able to read the books again without seeing these films in my head
Aug 11 2010,positive,this movie also had a lot of action and a good story to it the ending seemed a little better although of course the story goes on at any rate this is definitely worth watching
Aug 11 2010,positive,peter jackson does it again with the second part of his lord of the rings trilogy the fellowship is no more and sam and frodo head to mordor alone aragorn legolas and gimli rescue pippin  and merry  the story unfolds really quickly and the film doesnt waste time in telling this awesome story the film seems well paced and way more action packed than the first film as theres always something going on on screen thats not saying that the first one sucked far from it it was terrific  but this one as the war of the ring is beginning has of course more action than the first  the two towers is an incredible sequel to an incredible film it is a work of genius that is greater than epic  the actors really shine here more than they did in the first everything is bigger and better in this film the battles the characters the special effects everything the two towers is a towering film going experience that you wont forget for a long time to come one of the greatest things about this film is the battle of helms deep exciting and epic you will definitely be blown away by the scope of this battle its action packed and delivers one of the most exciting fantasy battle scenes  ever filmed peter jackson is a master filmmaker and the two towers proves it once again
Aug 8 2010,positive,my favourite of the lotr saga the two towers pulls all stops out and achieves the rare feat of the second in a trilogy being the superior film passionate and scary the two towers takes lotr to a whole new level with sparkling cast additions and a more fastpaced adrenalinefueled plot
Aug 8 2010,positive,an instant classic initially when i watched the movie when it first came out i had no idea it was a book or had this much back history so i somewhat expected it to be like a harry potter type because it came out around the same time it had me dialed in from the beginning til the end i wouldntve minded if the movie was 6 hrs because i didnt want it to end
Aug 7 2010,positive,one of the first on screen battles that literally made my jaw drop
Aug 7 2010,positive,andy serkis steals the film as gollum but the battle of helms deep is immense
Aug 6 2010,positive,perhaps not as emotionally jarring as the first and third movie in the trilogy but still a wonderful movie filled with battles treachery despair and gollum
Aug 6 2010,positive,they overemphasized gollum it took time away from progressing the story so they were forced to push some of book 2s story into the 3rd movie
Aug 5 2010,positive,amazing view and scene
Aug 5 2010,positive,while some might consider it to be stretched the two towers delivers even more creative ideas and the moral of fighting for what we feel is right along with everything that made the first lotr so spectacular resulting in yet another heartwarming adventurous and well constructed fantasy epic
Aug 5 2010,positive,leaps and bounds above the first
Aug 4 2010,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers is the second of three chapters of the great tale of the lord of the rings  it is just as good if not better than the first film and it sure is a delight to behold    this time around the entire fellowship has been broken up frodo and sam are still on the long road to mordor to destory the one ring to rule them all but a trecherous creature named gollum is hot on their trail aragorn legolas and gimli take the war path as a humoungous army of urakhai under the command of saruman is headed to the land of rohan set out to destroy them  and finally merry and pippin get lost it the dark forrest and learn more wisdom than ever from the great and wise treebeard  the whole thing could easily have become a big mess but it is well organized great fun and well done    the highlight of the film for sure is the ending nearly hour long battle of helms deep featuring some of the best special effects for the time but would it be topped  find out later  if there is one leg of the trilogy that has been the most passed up on it is saddly this one  the third film lives on in infamousy and the first is also wellremembered but this one is left in the dark  it is still great but why is it forgotten  high praise from me
Aug 4 2010,positive,the battle to be lord of the rings continues  now the bat boy is trying to jack the ring along with a myriad of other monsters and shit  meanwhile theres some dirty motherfuckas trying to storm the castle like fat bitches storm the walmart    then some trees come out of the woods and fuck shit up
Aug 2 2010,positive,adequate film adaptation of the book well done mr jackson
Aug 1 2010,positive,the third best of the trilogy but you cant say the worst of the trilogy because theres absolutely nothing negative about this film at all the others are just more perfect this installment of the trilogy introduces new characters as the adventure splits into different paths we meet characters like eowyn faramir eomer theodenin which the supporting actors portray brilliantly again as in the first film the supporting cast really adds to the movie the fighting scenes in this film are so epic the battle of helms deep is so awesome   this is a great perfect film that adds depth emotion and character to the trilogy
Aug 1 2010,positive,my favorite in the trilogy
Jul 31 2010,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers continues the journey to destroy the ring of power frodo and his companion sam journey to the fires of mordor with the creature gollum at their side meanwhile aragorn legolas and gimli follow a band of urukhai and orcs who have captured merry and pippin and are taking them to the evil wizard saruman who also has the king of rohan under his spell    this all seems clustered yes well fear not because its all very good all the way to the end once more peter jackson serves up some great visuals and story as we see so much turmoil with the characters many messages are brought out but i will not talk of them because youll have to figure them out yourselves please see it its much better than the first
Jul 31 2010,positive,brilliant follow up to fellowship the battle of isengard is huge and grand
Jul 30 2010,positive,i have a few ring can share with someone
Jul 30 2010,positive,the best in its trilogy lots of tower defending this movie is why i watched lotr 4 times
Jul 28 2010,positive,the battle of helms deep is over the battle for middle earth is about to begin
Jul 28 2010,positive, good   my personal favourite of the three films the major battle scene is undeniably impressive
Jul 28 2010,positive,even though i didnt really know what exactly was going on all of the time blaming lack of concentration for that oneand the fact that a lot of the characters look exactly the same it was still clear that this second installment was much better than the actionless and overlong is that a word first movie
Jul 28 2010,positive,the most iconic and aweinspiring of the trilogy in my opinion the entire trilogy is an amazing experience but this movie outshines the rest the scene where the ents go to war is engraved in my mind forever along with some of the best quotes out of any movie helms deep is also one of the best filmed battles ever to be in a movie
Jul 27 2010,positive,a sequel that no doubt triumps over its predecessor
Jul 27 2010,positive,what a story to follow up  woo all the people they use and creature they use they out did them self it was the greatest those are the great movie of all time
Jul 27 2010,neutral,read the books  maybe watch the first or third  skip this one for sure
Jul 27 2010,positive,a very good sequal to a very good first the story really starts to unfold and the battles are much better than in the first here the length actually starts to help immersing you in jrr tolkins world
Jul 27 2010,positive,seeing as how theres no real beginning or conclusion its amazing that this film is so compelling  mortensen deserved an oscar nomination here as did andy serkis as gollum
Jul 26 2010,positive,my favorite of the trilogy and consequently on of my favorite movies of all time     no one can deny that these movies are the visual representations of jrr tolkiens masterpieces and with all of the iconic scenes in this part of the story its easily the greatest segment of middle earths story my favorite scene when the ents go to war
Jul 25 2010,positive,while this is the middle child of the series i still maintain that this film hold some of the best battle sequences of the series with helms deep and isengard this is also the film that really picks up on the action and dives into the meat of the story where fellowship of the ring dragged at times one of the few movies i wanted to see again immediately after viewing it the first time
Jul 25 2010,positive,watched it countless times and i dont get tired of this fantasy world and characters the lenght is what i love the most could watch more every time the quest to save middle earth great trilogy cant talk about only one lov the hole story
Jul 25 2010,positive,the journey continues and keeps getting better this is one of the best middle chapters to a film trilogy that you will ever see it deserves its place along side the empire strikes back
Jul 25 2010,positive,i forgot how awesome this movie is
Jul 25 2010,positive,i created a word for this series fantagasm
Jul 25 2010,positive,i think this is the best of the three in the series simply for the massive scale of the last battle wow that was an amazing film acheivement gollum makes the movie though with who wicked he is and his relationship with frodo and sam make the movie
Jul 24 2010,positive,the trilogy is obviously one of the greatest of all time but i think this one is the best of the three  it has the most raw and dark feeling to it  it is the greatest of the three  the first one was dull at points because of a good deal of exposition and the last one ran just a bit too long but the second one was quite close to perfection  helms deep was awesome
Jul 24 2010,positive,best of the trilogy
Jul 24 2010,positive,great stuff amazing watch
Jul 24 2010,positive,this was my favourite of the lord of the rings films
Jul 24 2010,neutral,it is a good film with a very defined direction but the length is killer i actually did fall asleep in the theater while watching it
Jul 24 2010,positive,i actually read this book before i read the fellowship so i got the story backwards anyways about this film the action is awesome as usually the story is long and its got some kick ass trees tree huggers should find entertaining

Jul 21 2010,positive,im a geek  and i love lotr
Jul 21 2010,negative,a movie i wish i have never seen
Jul 21 2010,positive,the fate of middleearth is uncertain  taking off where the last film left us jackson again tells the tolkien story with amazing clarity  it seems like each film in this series is subsequently better than the next  kudos to peter jackson on the battle for helms deep  also andy serkis deserves honorable mention for his role as gollum  the depth and passion that he brought to that role was undeniably genious
Jul 21 2010,positive,an accellerating and thrilling middle part of the lord of the rings trilogy andy serkis gives a brilliant preformance as gollum
Jul 21 2010,positive,and the adventure continues a welldone film but not nearly as solid as the first in many ways the low point of the series but stilll a great ride
Jul 20 2010,positive,all the lotr movies are great
Jul 20 2010,negative,they got me on the first one the first one was very good but this one was just slow and so weird talking trees ugh do not see it 
Jul 19 2010,positive,the fellowship of the ring is way to better
Jul 18 2010,positive,the second part is mostly fighting which is action packed and interesting 
Jul 18 2010,positive,with all lord of the rings films the casting is excellent this particular film is one of my favourites from the battle with the two towers to a quest for the rings destruction played an important role and was interesting to see what paths await for all the main characters

Jul 15 2010,positive,final verdict still perfection and expands upon the trilogy with the addition of gollum and an amazing finale at helms deep
Jul 15 2010,positive,this movie was a very worth while experience and i have enjoyed watching it over again even to this day let me start out by saying that there are 3 main parts i like for in a movie like this the first is the ability to transition from novel to movie form in a flawless manor and i really do feel that the two towers was good at doing that       the second is the effects and acting i really do feel that the acting from elijah wood viggo mortenson and ian mckellan have probably one of the best triple threat acting performances ever done on film viggo is the calm cool and collective ba aragornthe ranger from the north ian is the smart and tactically genius grey wizard gone white gandalfthe white rider finally elijah is the small protagonist of the story with the weight of everyone that is good in middle earth on his shoulders frodothe halfling         the smaller cast also does a phenomenal job i mean the regulars orlando bloom legolas the elf john rhysdavies gimli the dwarve as well as the other hobbits sam merry and pippinsean astin dominic monaghan billy boyd all play a great part in this movie now on to the effects the warg attack on the traveling rohan people   the attacking of isengard by the ents and the battle of helms deep are all cinematically beautiful pieces of art        they are all well done also the transformation of the ents from inanimate to animate and the cgi on the wargs is done terrifically now to the third part the third part i look for in a movie is how new characters are introduced and acted out i do not consider a new character as part of the second element of the three          the rohanians theodeneowyn and eomer are all phenomenally portrayed by bernard hill miranda otto and karl urban eowyns forlorn love for aragorn actually caused me to feel a sense of emotional sorrow that she could not have him theoden did a good job making the transformation from brainwashed king to their leader at the battle of the hornburg eomer also did a good job as the outcast nephew of theoden and brother of eowyn as well as the leader of the eored           in the end i would have to give jrr tolkiens plot a 1010 peter jacksons directing a 9510 the acting of the cast a 910 and the effectsscreenplay a 8510 which comes to a 3740 or a 3740 stars being that this is a fantasy film i will round it up to 40 as a handicap for all fantasy films
Jul 14 2010,positive,seen en all and really liked em
Jul 14 2010,positive,part 2 of 3 parts of the single best movie ever made
Jul 14 2010,positive,a great sequal to the already fantastic series
Jul 14 2010,positive,i still cant deside which of the three films i like the most and i dont think i ever will simply timeless
Jul 13 2010,positive,i so loved this movie not sure if a fantasy sage can surpass lotr
Jul 13 2010,positive,this was most likely the best of the trilogy the action and acting was better than the first and the story was definitely more colorful than the first as well despite these great parts i felt the movie had focused too much on the action instead of character development and script a
Jul 13 2010,positive,better than its predecessor but obviously not as good its successor the two towers had a good mix of every that the trilogy encompasses
Jul 13 2010,positive,of all the books this was the one i didnt really like however even though it was not the best of the threeit was still a good movie with good performances
Jul 12 2010,positive,certainly a very good movie great acting however you just have to follow the storyline closely so that you dont get lost
Jul 12 2010,positive,this film works but its just too long for me to truly enjoy it
Jul 12 2010,positive,an excellent middle chapter in the trilogy pretty much everything about it is perfect great writing great acting great special effects great direction great music great art direction i had forgotten about sams excellent speech at the end which pretty much sums up everything that is great about the lord of the rings and storytelling in general it also hit me much harder this time just how much of a tragic character smeagolgollum really is if you can get over the wonderful visual effects that created him and the funny voice and actually think about him as a character his story is just so sad and painful i really felt sorry for him this time around this movie also has a lot of treebeard which is awesome did you know treebeard was based on tolkiens friend c s lewis well he was i also noticed that king denethor of gondor was also walter from fringe theres just so much to love and admire in these movies its astonishing
Jul 12 2010,positive,best part of the trilogy
Jul 12 2010,positive,with even better visuals characters and scenery the two towers manages to be even better than the first one the one downfall though is that some of the special effects are completely unbelievable people flipping onto their horses for example is impossible despite this the movie deserves serious consideration in terms of what movies you want to have in your collection
Jul 12 2010,positive,the books are better 
Jul 11 2010,positive,ahhhh the lord of the rings the two towers another reason for americans to get more major landscape envy because new zealand is just so damn beautiful in this movie oh and did i mention that peter jackson is a great director from new zealand too for once i can be proud of something that new zealand has done in the film industry if only we could do more of this kind of stuff  frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin continue their journey to destroy the one ring they have in their possession they meet a creature who once had the ring gollum andy serkis who they trust to lead them the right way the people they left behind are now launching an attack on isengard making the battle for the ring bigger and worse than they had expected   i liked the two towers a bit better than the fellowship of the ring because this one has a higher entertainment factor i think this was probably because of the character gollum who we see a lot more of and turns out to be quite a mysterious character albeit an ugly and crazy one what i like about it is that it is crammed full with characters but it doesnt turn into a usual mishmash of people because the depth and characteristics of them are evident even if they have some pretty short scenes like cate blanchett as galadriel   again what can i say i know it everybody with half a brain knows it the lord of the rings films are masterpieces and just because i can im gonna say this is the best thing new zealand has ever done the two towers is a fantastic second installment if only other sequels could be as good as this i look forward to the last one   another thrilling chapter to the lord of the rings better than the first but only by a whisker
Jul 11 2010,positive,the second installment to the trilogy and wow the end of the movie leaves you at the edge of your seat wanting more and more of the movie great acting great storyline what more is there to say tolken wrote a great book and the directors took that and made a better movie
Jul 11 2010,positive,the second part of the ring series good action and the battle are reall good the actors are good as well and the new characters fits in this story this movie is an masterpiece and only the next one is better
Jul 10 2010,positive,seeing gollum for the first time was hugely memorable
Jul 10 2010,positive,best movie trilogy of all time hands down
Jul 8 2010,positive,lotr all i have to say
Jul 8 2010,positive,really good but too long should have been done in two parts
Jul 8 2010,positive,filled with great action and marvelous visuals that dazzle to this day the two towers is a very worthy sequel
Jul 7 2010,positive,once again i see no flaws here other than length and the length of a film doesnt really bother me at all why because the film is so epic so well done length doesnt bother me one little bit lord of the rings the two towers is a great fantasy epic film and peter jackson really knows how to deliver with excellent cinematography sets effects and story bravo jackson bravo

Jul 4 2010,positive,the darkest one in the lord of the rings yet the most inspiring one for hope
Jul 4 2010,positive,no flaws at all incredible and intense
Jul 4 2010,positive,possibly the weakest of the trilogybut still a fantastic film by all measures and not to forget some of the greatest battle scenes ever orchestrated
Jul 3 2010,neutral,it was ok book was way better

Jun 29 2010,positive,wwith the other two in the series the two towers will be studied for generations as a how to adapt books to the screen excellent
Jun 29 2010,positive,lotr fan thats me wish there more
Jun 29 2010,positive,cant stand the soppywhinging hobbits but the movies and most of all a great story
Jun 28 2010,positive,the journey that was started in the fellowhip of the ring continues in the two towers but this time the fellowship has been seperated into three groups ever since the ending of the movie boromir is dead and merry and pippin were captured by sarumans forces with aragorn gimli and legolas are on their trail but most importantly frodo and sam are on their way to morder to destroy the one ring of sauron    since the fellowship of the ring proved an enormous success among audiences there was of course going to be a lot of excitement for the two towers and the return of the king is this movie as good as the fellowship of the ring yes it is but its also better    the two towers starts right where the fellowship of the ring left off the first few minutes show us what really happened to gandalf ian mckellen in the previous film when we saw the grey wizard fight against the balrog of morgoth he was pulled down with it now we see that they were actually fighting as they fell into a nearly bottomless fall    then it cuts to frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin on their way to mordor but they keep getting lost but then one night gollum andy serkis attacks them to try and steal the ring they manage to subdue him but frodo makes him their guide to mordor as they travel we see that the creature has split personalities the meek and more kindly smeagol and the greedy and sinister gollum frodo grows to trust him but sam despises him    meanwhile aragorn viggo mortensen gimli john ryesdavies and legolas are following the urukhai who captured merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd who eventually manage to escape into the fanghorn forest which is occupied by ents the chase leads them into rohan the home of the horselords which is led by king theoden bernard hill but he is under the venomous influence of saruman christopher lee through his servant grima wormtongue brad dourif    saruman is intending to wage war against rohan to eliminate those who would oppose sauron but not all hope was not lost gandalf has come from beyond the grave now more powerful than ever he is now gandalf the white and when theoden recovers he must prepare his men for war against sarumans forces at helms deep    this adaptation of the second book doesnt cover everything that was in its source material the film only tells about two thirds of it the first chapter the departure of boromir was moved to the ending of the fellowship of the ring the two towers goes through chapters 27 from book iii aragorn gandalf and the others story and chapters 16 in book iv frodo sam and gollums story the rest would be inserted into the return of the king    the transition is also not quite as faithful as the fellowship of the ring was plenty of things are left out and some things are changed like the elves arriving at helms deep and frodo sam and gollum are taken by faramir and his men to osgiliath some of the characters personalities are a little different too particularly faramir but as with fellowship it carries the heart of the book    just as with its predecessor the movie has an excellent story and is technically stunning the visual effects are excellent the best of them are used on treebeard and the other ents the makeup done on the urukhai is also worthy of note but the really good parts are the action scenes theres the fight with the balrog at the beginning a fight with wargs but the battle for helms deep is a highpoint and one of the best battle scenes in cinema    the acting is just as great and even better than it was in fellowship and even then it was excellent the actors are really starting to grow into their characters elijah wood makes frodos struggle with being the ringbearer believeable sam is also a great companion to frodo and is a more braver character than he was in the previous film gandalf who doesnt have as much screentime this time is still the perfect gandalf viggo mortensens aragorn is more heroic in this as he takes on army of urukhai and the two duos of merrypippin and gimillegolas are also fun to watch    the supporting and new cast is also quite good the most engaging is andy serkis as gollum who makes the split personalities really work particularly in one scene in the middle of the movie christopher lee gives it his all as saruman and like ian mckellen does with gandalf he embodies the role bernard hill gives a voice of authority as king theoden brad dourif gives a chilling performance as the sly grima miranda otto makes a good eowyn karl urban doesnt get very much screentime but he makes a good eomer david wenham also makes a good faramir hugo weaving liv tyler and cate blanchett also have small appearances in the movie    just as i loved the fellowship of the ring this i also love
Jun 28 2010,negative,this series is overrated whats the big dealhobbits are so gay hobbits  blue ppl from avatar are both lame cool battle scenes  the few there are
Jun 27 2010,positive,sequel doesnt dissapointwar sequences are mindblowinjuss waitin to get my hands on 3rd one 
Jun 27 2010,positive,the weakest of the film series and also the books the battle of helms deep was so epic and what takes away from this being a 5 star film is the ents yes i know in the book they play a very large role but in the film theyre just very annoying especially when youre trying to watch one of the greatest battles ever put to screen
Jun 26 2010,positive,truly an epic adventure that continues the quest to destroy the one ring this epic film features my favorite battle scene of all time the battle for helms deep 10000 urukhai against hundreds of men and elves the movie gets more intense when frodo and sam discover smeagol the three hunters continue to look for merry and pippin while gandalf is being resurrected a great score that i fell in love with great acting by an allstar cast epic battles and a kickass storyline
Jun 25 2010,positive,its the weakest book as well as the weakest film with the battle of helms deep being the major and brilliant attraction in this bridge between fotr and rotk still an incredible movie well worth the time
Jun 25 2010,positive,the second feature of the epic saga    its hard to find people who have not seen any of the lord of the rings saga    from acadamy award wining director peter jacksonthe lord of the rings is based on one of the most popular books of all timewhich is also titled the lord of the ringswritten by jrtolken    the two towers is the sequal to the first movie of the saga titled the fellowship of the ringsthe film is set around a hobbit named frodo baggins and his best friend sam wisegange  frodo has been givin a task that will deturmen the faith of middle earthhe must destroy the one ringthe most powerful weapon in the world that was forged by the dark lord sauron  but no axe or sword can break the ring the only way is to throw it into the firy pits of tartulas from where it was made    the film is heart warmingscaryromantic and action packed from start to finish and it would be a crime not to see all 3
Jun 25 2010,positive,so long and yet you wish it never ends
Jun 23 2010,positive,this movie had such a hold on me the first time i saw it the siege on the fort was really the part that got me most except for the walking trees i like the walking trees i hate sauroman for cutting down the forest in that he got just what he deserved anyways its definitely worth seeing
Jun 22 2010,positive,it is a great movie it is way better then the first one ill have to see which one is my favourite after i watch the 3rd one
Jun 21 2010,positive,the worst of the three but very good nonetheless
Jun 21 2010,positive,once again elija wood have the one ring to rule them all
Jun 20 2010,positive,easily the best sequel ever made
Jun 20 2010,negative,wonderful effects but goes on and on and onlost the will to live
Jun 19 2010,positive,great movieb violence
Jun 19 2010,positive,for me the absolute best of the three  has everything any filmlover could want in it  amazing
Jun 19 2010,positive,the worst lord of the rings but that doesnt mean its bad
Jun 19 2010,positive,whoa love lotr always especially the war part got really absorbed in the story kudos lotr
Jun 18 2010,positive,great film epic war scenes love helms deep when its all quiet and then you just hear the rain drops dumming on armour
Jun 18 2010,positive,jackson does a great job here adapting a rather complex storyline well to the screen with some brilliant battle  scenes and wonderfully etched out performances in fact for me this  was his toughest part as the movie was neither an  epilogue nor a prologue but somewhere in between and  jackson rises to the occasion
Jun 17 2010,positive,an amazing sequel to a splendid film  the lord of the rings the two towers brings us closer to the midddle earth as director peter jackson once again startles us
Jun 17 2010,positive,most epic shit ever
Jun 17 2010,positive,probably not the best part of the trilogy but imo the battle scene in the end is a masterpiece
Jun 16 2010,positive,possibly the only modern epic though i do class all 3 movies as one movie up there to rival star wars in what it set as a standard for a genre
Jun 15 2010,positive,the lord of the rings fotr tt rotk great movies  peter jacksons lord of the rings movies is best seen as a singlealbeit longwork these 3 films flows together almost seamlessly from the spectacular monologue to the suitably final epic closing credits   everything in these movies are recordsetting from how it was made to the extent of its eventual incredible success if youve seen any of these 3 it will come as no surprise that all won oscars for visual effects they are filled with impressive beasts and battles the scale of each escalating from movie to movie it is the tragic figure of gollum that most captured audience imagination destroyed in mind and body by his addiction to the powerful ring he veers through vicious hatred selfloathing and even something approaching glee yet his character is cgi its still believable as a real character  its perhaps this that encapsulates jacksons greatest achievement to remember that spectacle and technical wizardry arent enough to make a great film the hobbits elves and wizards are all very human gollum has regrets tries to be good and teases sam gandalf is avuncular even mischievous yet retains his power and authority frodo and sam grow from brave but naïve adventurers to true heroes as the awful truth of their task becomes apparent   the scenery is stunning beautiful landscapes soaring music as the camera simply tracks from mountaintop to mountaintop as signal fires flare up against the sky the screenplay manages to wrestle a dense and unwieldy mass of source material into a swift and engaging narrative   despite the vast canvas upon which jackson was painting at its heart his film is about people their relationships and the decisions they make friendship and selfsacrifice figure strongly as does a pervading sense of mortality the final scenes make it clear that victory can be noble and yet still come at too deep a personal cost it is moments like this that elevate jacksons film from movie blockbuster to genuine masterpiece
Jun 15 2010,neutral,too much time spent on the battle scenes makes this my least favourite of the trilogy still a great watch
Jun 13 2010,positive,valiant visionary inspiring what more do you want jackson even managed to throw in some combat humour which i have a soft spot for
Jun 13 2010,positive,the greatest trilogy the film industry   has seen in a long time the history mythology and the speacial effects are superior to all as well as the directing
Jun 12 2010,positive,the extended version if the version to see  it explains the importance of the new characters and story arcs  the original cut may leave you scratching your head while you say what is this who is that shouldnt the story be on sam and frodo and the journey to the destroy the one ring still an awesome movie just the hardest to sit through
Jun 12 2010,positive,you just cant go wrong it takes the story to new levels bringing back gandalf as gandalf the white its justamazing enough said really
Jun 11 2010,positive,a long movie but its worth seeing
Jun 11 2010,positive,classic book equals classic movie
Jun 11 2010,positive,action packed and amazing  better than fotr not quite as phenomenal as rotk perfect transition

Jun 9 2010,positive,retarded as the best movie ever in my opinion peter jackson at his best
Jun 9 2010,positive,i love it toooo much
Jun 7 2010,positive,greater than the first i guesss but the first is amazing in the way it starts off the entire story  the two towers is better than the first   great film again
Jun 7 2010,positive,man im such a geek books were amazing too
Jun 7 2010,positive,jacksons ability to adapt a movie so nicely detailed from tolkiens book is astonishing however unlike the first film there is a great amount of details stories and important plot lines that are missing from the book i understand that there is a time limit and jackson does a great job in telling a cohesive story through the film without the detail but looking at some of the scenes and trying to act like i have never read the books i began to realize that there were just too many details missing in the plot line that didnt really work in the film itself the seeing orb for one has an entire backstory to it and the motivation behind wormtounge seems to lack     one thing holds true the graphics and locations in this film will surpass time visually a masterpiece performance wise brilliant and the battles give that outstanding feeling and wow factor that can only be delivered by such an amazing editing job and battle sequence
Jun 7 2010,positive,wonderfully done excellent movie
Jun 7 2010,positive,watched this movie again after a long time and loved every bit of it
Jun 7 2010,positive,everything you learned in fellowship of the ring better be common knowledge at this point cause part 2 of the epic trilogy doesnt stop to breathe for a moment this movie throws in new locations characters and creaturesgollum namely and keeps it all in balance the story could not have been told better that it is right here cinema at its best in every aspect and everyone who has witnessed these films will tell you the same movie perfection that will have you screaming to see part 3
Jun 6 2010,positive,13 of the best films ever
Jun 6 2010,positive,the best of the trilogy
Jun 6 2010,positive,the saga continues along with its triumphant success
Jun 6 2010,positive,i love all of the lord of the rings movies
Jun 5 2010,positive,the extended versions of all three are excellent check it out
Jun 5 2010,neutral,i think i liked the second one a bit less than other two but it was nice
Jun 5 2010,positive,the best film of probably the best trilogy ever made  helms deep might be the greatest movie battle sequence  i ride with rohan
Jun 4 2010,positive,all 3 of these are parts of a whole a tribute to the great classic by jrr tolkein crafted by a great director peter jackson definitely in my top 100 films of all time
Jun 4 2010,positive,awesome loved it  good old good vs bad   amazing effects  good storyline
Jun 2 2010,positive,i love golumthats all i watch it forlolz
Jun 1 2010,positive,the saga continues  i got the chance to sit down and watch the 223minute special extended edition and man the two towers is still just as epic as i remembered  samwise and frodo continue their journey to destroy the everpowerful ring in the fires of mount doom  but at the same time the dark lord sauron is building an enormous army with the sole purpose of trampling all of middle earth  man is the first species on the extinction list and they fight for their lives on two fronts  the two towers is where we are officially introduced to the tragic character of gollum his story is such a sad one and the way they handle his character with seamless special effects is beautiful  the cgi and special effects here even though they coming up on being eight years old still hold up and look great they look better than 95 of what we are getting in movies today  there is a certain craft about the making of this trilogy you rarely see the fantasy genre approached with such care and peter jackson with his camera dynamics and moviemaking comprehension was the perfect person for the project  i still have to watch it again because i still havenât seen it since it first came out on dvd but i think i may prefer the theatrical cut to the extended  donât get me wrong the extended cut more than merits a watch there is a lot more character development and motivations defined  i prefer the extended cut of the fellowship of the ring because you get a much richer backstory to this magical world you are being introduced to  with this second movie however the first two thirds of the movie are just building and building to a climactic third act that kicks your ass  building wonderfully yes but you still want to get there before the 150minute mark and the added material while insightful doesnât allow the movie to flow as fluently as the theatrical cut  it is an engrossing movie with every 1015 minute scene just flying by but the extended cut is for hardcore fans only
Jun 1 2010,positive,the best film from the trilogy
Jun 1 2010,positive,everyone needs to read these books and see the movies

May 27 2010,positive,even better than the fellowship of the ring
May 26 2010,positive,my favorite of the series great movie
May 24 2010,positive,this was my favorite one of the three
May 24 2010,positive,the director peter jacksons scrupulous devotion to the spirit of j r r tolkiens lord of the rings trilogy manifests itself in a gripping intense fashion for the second of the film adaptations the two towers it may be the first sequel that does not bother to reprise the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately the plan is to simply drop us right into the action    even for those deeply immersed in the material this stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension  the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin are experiencing on their journey this mission began in the fellowship of the ring when frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and incidentally begins the end of life in middle earth as was indicated in the first ring movie the fellowship of the ring    never has a film so strongly been a product of a directors respect for its source mr jackson uses all his talents in the service of that reverence creating a rare perfect mating of filmmaker and material mr jacksons ploy in this beautifully considered epic is to give viewers the same feeling of confusion that his characters are experiencing by doing this he simultaneously answers those who complained that too much of the previous rings was about setup    a brief recap of a climactic battle between the friendly wizard gandalf ian mckellen and a fire demon  one of many climactic battles from fellowship  is shown near the start but this scene is used to set the two towers in motion it is a daring gambit to have viewers enter a movie bearing such complex preceding action with so little information even though the first film took in enough cash to jumpstart the flagging united states economy singlehandedly mr jackson does not seem to understand that there are people who havent absorbed the rings chronology into the entirety of their beings and there may even be folks out there who havent seen fellowship but will be lured into theaters for towers by all the attention that fellowship attracted such moviegoers may feel left out puzzled and unable to keep up    with the narrative of rings tolkien was investigating determination loyalty and finally faith finding innumerable ways to offer up the concept of purity of heart as found in matthew 58 and in kierkegaard whose contention was that purity of heart was the ability to will one thing into being the pursuit of purity is at the center of towers    for our hero frodo whose quest is to purge the forces of menacing evil from middle earth purity is demonstrated by combating the temptation to wear the ring and be consumed by its corrupting power he gets a taste of what the future might be like when he and sam meet gollum a hobbit who was once seduced by the ring he is now an emotional and physical shambles emaciated and slunk into a perpetual crouch gollums translucent waxy skin is a membrane that just barely contains his insides    gollum is divided within himself he is an infantilized wreck who wants to please and befriend the hobbits but he is also a hissing bitter childman whose paranoia keeps him breathing and plotting gollum is a computergenerated creation and as fully realized a character as can be found in towers  perhaps the most fully realized he has been dropped into the movie more effectively than george lucas crammed jar jar binks into his recent star wars addenda with the voice of andy serkis whose movements were also copied by the animators gollum is torn by his nature and mr jackson allows him to be conflicted in a way none of the other characters in the film are    this is partially because towers is more or less a bridge to the finale of the rings trilogy due a year from now though this picture is one of the most accomplished holding actions ever    so much of the flow of towers is dictated by the amount of information that has to be saved for the next installment mr jackson compensates for that by inflating the warrior aragorn viggo mortensen into an even more assured reflexive action hero he helps a bewitched king bernard hill defend his castle against the endless possessed armies of the villainous magician saruman christopher lee the foe responsible for the fate of gandalf in his flowing white gowns and beard mr lees warlock is a force to be reckoned with because he alone has a voice as commanding as mr mckellens    in sheer action mechanics mr jacksons achievements in towers are even more compelling than what he managed the first time around he has given the martial scenes of this sequel a completely different thrust his engrossing action style is exciting and dramatic when the swells of sarumans army crash into the walls of the kings castle we could be watching orson welless chimes at midnight as directed by george a romero  shakespeareanscale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie the exultant creepiness of horror films is mr jacksons instinctive filmmaking style he exaggerates it here in epic terms and the grandeur is astonishing  one scene of sarumans creatures flinging themselves at the castle is framed as an overhead shot with their shields moving like the wings of a peculiarly lyric and fatal insect    mr jacksons mastery of craft in some areas is so powerful that the flaws are more noticeable than in the first film the littleboy allure of the storytelling in towers is sure to evoke the same reaction that it did in fellowship towers is like a familyoriented erated video game with no emotional complications other than saving the day women have so little to do here that they serve almost as plotdevice flight attendants offering a trough of diet coke to refresh the geekmagnet story it is a lapse in tolkiens work that mr jackson has not figured out a way to correct even with the token reappearances of liv tyler and cate blanchett from the first film    mr mckellen is a marginal presence this time around which is unfortunate because he is needed for ballast rings is such a kids fantasy that a daddy figure is required he is the father who soothes his charges under the spell of tolkiens baddream threats but he does get one  only one  whooping chance to do so in towers    the most incredible accomplishment of towers is that at its heart it is a transition film that lasts nearly three hours and holds the viewers attention because the two towers which opens worldwide today has to keep so much story in reserve for the last installment the movie falls short on emotional involvement still mr jackson rises so completely to the challenges here that i cant wait to see his next movie  by that i mean the one after the ring cycle ends
May 24 2010,positive,my favorite of the series long as well but action packed
May 23 2010,positive,very good no disappointments here
May 23 2010,positive,number one movie that year
May 23 2010,positive,a new power is rising
May 22 2010,positive,excellent cinematography and a great
May 22 2010,positive,simply even better than the first film the two towers is pure perfection
May 22 2010,positive,they are all one movie anon
May 22 2010,positive,better than the book because its more exciting and visual like the others great battle scenes costumes props sets locations
May 22 2010,positive,the film may not be as good as the first and third films but still the two towers is an epic adventure of bravery
May 21 2010,positive,revenge its not good but payback its no 1
May 21 2010,positive,this is the part where i truly liked lotr 
May 20 2010,positive,best in the trilogy you can literally feel the despair durin the battle of helms deep poor elves lol
May 18 2010,positive,the battle of helms deep makes this film as the rest merely seems plodding buildup to it but the battle scenes are so fantastic i actually went and tried to read the book then realised it was turgid incompetently written crap
May 17 2010,positive,a lot of action that made up for the boringness of the first installment
May 17 2010,positive,second favorite of the trillogy i enjoy watching this one because of the battle of helms deep
May 16 2010,negative,i had tremendous trouble caring about this movie as it snailed through its 3 hour running time climaxing in a very poor final battle scene yes most of the acting and special effects are good but my goodness its boring
May 16 2010,positive,sometimes the 2nd part in trilogys can be poor but this is not the case we are introduced to new characters treebeard golum eowyn and places helms deep fangorn forest in this film and even get a huge battle at the end another good peter jackson film hope the 3rd one is even better
May 14 2010,positive,an incredibly entertaining and involving followup that lives up to the first movie and better yet even manages to live up to its source material
May 14 2010,positive,not as good as the first and third films mostly because not as much happens in the 3 hours and the story is told in a less interesting way   smeagol appears however and quickly becomes one of the greatest characters of modern film technologically as well as through his conflict with his inner evil gollum
May 14 2010,positive,another incredible installment in the lotr series by peter jackson its hard for me to decide which film is my favorite since all are so entertaining but i love the helms deep battle in this movie so much its incredible
May 14 2010,positive,definitely an a in this film more action more orcs and more talent
May 14 2010,positive,pretty good visual interpretation of the book of which ive been a big fan every since my early teenage years given the different format it concentrates more on action but its really really well done and the images are pretty good  new zealandaustralia was a perfect find for shooting and so were some of the actors the one playing sam for example was a great choice
May 13 2010,positive,probably the best second movie of a trilogy ever in my opinion and lets face it its hard to make a good middle movie  andy serkis is my hero
May 13 2010,positive,its hard to love this film considering how good number one is and how good number 3 isseeing as its in between it just seems likeitskilling time till the third one but the reason its good is because it works its not boring and its still got lots and lots of great action in itdefinitely a worthy sequel to the firs one
May 12 2010,positive,epic part 2 this is an important part of the trilgoy but i have to admit it was not my favorite of the three so all in all this was an effective middle part to the trilogy but im still stuck with the intial discovery and wonder of the fellowship of the ring also the return of the king was an ok third part but fotr remains my favorite
May 11 2010,positive,this trilogy just got better and better
May 11 2010,positive,very great epic movie
May 10 2010,positive,gotta watch all three if you get the chance
May 10 2010,positive,greatest movie ever
May 10 2010,negative,i couldnt figure out what this movie had to do with getting the ring to mt doom  thats a really important connection isnt it  i couldnt figure out what the two towers were either  i felt like this movie was only for those that had read the book
May 9 2010,positive,it could be argued that this is the best of the trilogy the people who argue this have never seen return of the king
May 9 2010,positive,masterpiece enough said
May 9 2010,positive,reminds me of a neighbour i once had
May 9 2010,positive,this movie continues the trilogy started by the fellowship of the ring it is very good and meets the standard set by the first one however i felt more bored through a lot of the movie than the first one this movie basically is three parts that switches every five or ten minutes there is merry and pippen yawn who are off with this talking tree called treebeard frodo and sam continue their long journey and have to trust gollum to get to mordor but not much really happens within their journey what really saves this movie is the parts with aragorn legolas and gimli they start off trying to rescue mary and pippen and keep going from there this part really saves the movie and otherwise i would have quickly fallen asleep the soundtrack is still great everything still looks cool and there is an awesome battle at the end the movie is three hours just like the first one so its defintaly worth watching if you can stay awake through the boring parts
May 8 2010,positive,maybe the most even film of the trilogy helms deep in particular will blow you away
May 8 2010,positive,strays but is as good as both of the others
May 8 2010,positive,the lord of the rings trilogy or thrillogy as i prefer to call it is beyond doubt seen by so many fantasy fans myself included as the best book to film adaptation series ever made    firstly the shooting of these films on location in new zealand was a brilliant decision by peter jackson the beauty and diversity of the brilliant country is second to none in terms of filming locations     the acting quality of these 3 movies is near enough faultless and jacksons special effects team does a brilliant job making an audience 510 years after they were made think wow i saw a film a week ago with worse special effects the sight of the riders of rohan charging towards minas tirith is a sight to behold even 7 years after the films theatrical release    these films deserve all the interest they get in the early noughties and need to be remembered for years to come as some of the best and most captivating films of all time     even the fact that all 3 films were shot before even the first was released shows the confidence that peter jackson had that his 3 films were going to go down in history of cinema    for being nothing below works of priceless art a 1010 for all 3 parts of this masterful trilogy    jack xx
May 8 2010,positive,lotd the two towers is the best sequl ever made unless you count it succedor
May 8 2010,positive,though buttnumingly long this one of the rare sequels that are as good as or better than the ifrst
May 7 2010,neutral,some memorable moments but for me no opening no ending and repetitive sweeping camera scenes enough time to go to the toilet have dinner and a shower and still miss nothing spectacular yet flawed
May 7 2010,positive,this one is my absolute favorite of the triology i like the trees being apart of the war and handling their business i loved that gandalf was still alive and that he whoop butt too in this one i just appreciated the union
May 7 2010,positive,the weakest of an impressive film trilogy
May 3 2010,positive,i love elves that shoot arrows and trees
May 2 2010,positive,best of the lord of the rings in my opinion just breath taking amazing creatures the battle of helms deep the greatest fight scene of all time     wellington represent woo new zealand d
May 2 2010,positive,the battles in this movie was amazing and got even better and the next two movies
May 2 2010,positive,this is my favorite story of all time i love the epic journey these characters go on especially frodo  sam this movie is a little slow in the middle compare to the other two movies in the series but i still love it
May 2 2010,positive,peter jackson has always maintained that the two towers is the second act of his epic undertaking and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context as a standalone film however the two towers is not quite as good as fellowship nor indeed does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of the empire strikes back that it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set picking up pretty much where fellowship left off this is a considerably darker film with frodo wood falling further under the influence of the ring giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations while saruman christopher lee wreaks even more havoc theres also the first appearance of sarumans spy the sinister wormtongue brad dourif and the complex gollum a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from andy serkis the campaign for a best supporting actor oscar starts here t may lack the firstviewthrill and natural dramatic shape of fellowship but this is both funnier and darker than the first film and certainly more actionpacked an essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time
Apr 30 2010,positive,best of the lotr trilogy
Apr 28 2010,positive,im totally gay for this movie and the others in the trilogy dont judge me
Apr 28 2010,positive,much less mystical than the first but by no means is it a lesser film two towers is a more raw more human more of desperation and second thinking the introduction of gollum lends a great deal of villany and comapnionship and i still say anthony serkis deserved at least a nomination a great midway in a great trilogy
Apr 28 2010,positive,hell to the yea love all three
Apr 28 2010,positive,and thislove it too
Apr 27 2010,positive,where can i begin with the film the lord of the rings the two towers lets begin with a few words amazing spellbinding perfect the lord of the rings the two towers is a perfect movie visually acting dialogue everything it is a major improvement from the nearperfect lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring another great acting ensemble and many oscar worthy acts the visual effects like before are worthy of the oscar that it received the story line though based off the book was phoenomenal the intense battle scenes kept me on the edge of my seat and the dialogue between the characters kept me interested all the way and when the ending finally came and the credits began rolling i rushed home and marked my calendar on the day of the release date of the final film the lord of the rings the two towers is in short for a better word perfect
Apr 27 2010,positive,who would have thought it would start with an epic bang even though it is a middle film part continues the journey and doesnt look back with a suspenceful climactic battle
Apr 27 2010,positive,nice movie to connect the first and third movie in the series
Apr 26 2010,positive,amazing what more is there to say but then again i will go on forever
Apr 26 2010,positive,love the series great movies
Apr 26 2010,positive,i liked this one better than the first one  the addition of battle scenes make this movie better in my opinion  the movie is again long but enjoyable to watch
Apr 25 2010,positive,it may be my least favorite out of both the books and movies but the film is still practically flawless its still aweinspiring featuring much more action and fantasy war and much less sentimental monologues than the first film
Apr 25 2010,positive,the first one was better
Apr 25 2010,positive,too many evil army  oh well very cool  lol
Apr 25 2010,negative,to much war teeth grinding and silly tolkienness
Apr 25 2010,positive,the two towers is somewhat burdened with the most difficult job in the series that is to let the series make a transition from the first installment to the last one obviously the second installment in a trilogy is typically the weakest and as its own film the two towers will probably be another testament to this rule but at the end of the day does this really matter peter jackson intended these three films to be one gigantic one not unlike how tolkein intended the original books to be one behemoth book and for what its supposed to dothat is to form a bridge between fellowship of the ring and return of the king and still be an exciting film in its own rightthe film does splendidly this installment is more episodic than fellowship probably because whats left of the broken fellowship is on their own in little groups now but this is to the films advantage as the climax near the end of the film is breathtaking whereas the first film was sort of lyrical in its execution this film is much more of an actionthrillerwar film so the established great performances from the first film mckellen mortensen and company dont quite stand out as much that said there is one dynamite performance in this film and that is andy serkiss chilling nowiconic turn as gollum the devious hobbitlike creature its still wellwritten its still welldirected its still wellacted and its still technically gorgeous but its hard to straightup enjoy this film as a standalone film since virtually everything in it is an obvious buildup to the third film
Apr 25 2010,positive,not better than the fellowship but still amazing and had the epic factor really no downside it just wasnt the first they seem like they changed directorial directions for the films dont watch it with no prior knowledge because it picks up exactly seconds after the first
Apr 24 2010,positive,this film is just as memorable and breathtaking as the first one the weakest of the trilogy but still one of the best films as the story heats up the films gets better but its still too cgi and just not dark enough
Apr 24 2010,positive,my favourite trilogy not close to the book but could not be better adapted
Apr 23 2010,negative,i found this movie to be quite morning from what i remember though i havent seen this movie in over 6 years so im not really sure how great it was
Apr 23 2010,positive,best films everespecially the beginning
Apr 23 2010,positive,with the second movie it shows us the vastness of tolkiens world and those within it that hold bearing to mr baggins peter jackson knows has my respect
Apr 22 2010,positive,in my personal opinion the lord of the rings  the two towers is the most magical impressive and visually stunning film in existence peter jackson has succeeded in creating a timeless classic there are some of you that argue it is overrated which i think is a travesty the story of the ring is epic in itself with the trilogy by j r r tolkien one of the most well known all around the world and as the sunday times said and you know you can trust a tabloid newspaperahem the englishspeaking world is divided into those who have read the hobbit and the lord of the rings and those who are going to read them peter jackson has successfully taken this story and created a translation onto screen in so much depth bringing the story to a whole new generation     it is obvious in the viewing of the lord of the rings of the painstaking care and love that went into its creation if i had been given the cast list for the lord of the rings i would have been amazed by how many big stars were on board and would have told you that it wouldnt work i would have been wrong ian mckellen andy serkis hugo weaving orlando bloom viggo mortensen etcetera are in a word prodigious each and every member of the cast offers the perfect portrayl of characters in their mannerisms and identity in esscence no one else could have done it better     one thing that really struck me about the lord of the rings  the two towers were the battle scenes which again were brought to life in return of the king if i could choose one moment that defines a perfect film experience for me i would say the scene where gandalf arrives with the riders of rohan with the sun rising behind him it is epic in proportion and none of the emotion is lost in trying to make bloodbath scenes jackson was much more subtle and it pays off    overall no matter whether you love it or hate it the lord of the rings trilogy is the pinnacle of modern cinema as i think the lord of the rings  the two towers is the strongest of the trilogy surely it is the best film in existence
Apr 22 2010,positive,usually in these types of sagas the sequel is the best example empire however that is not the case with this sagabut this is still a great film
Apr 22 2010,positive,an other great movie if you have read my critic of the fellowship of the ring well its the same thing the visual effect are as good as the other movie and its the same thing for the story its really hard for a director to fallow the story of a book without forgetting things well done jackson    history 55 movie 45  total 910    un autre super film si vous avez lu ma critique pour la communauté de lanneau et bien cest la même chose les effets visuel sont toujours aussi bon et cest la même chose pour lhistoire cest très difficile pour un réalisateur de suivre lhistoire dun livre sans oublier des détails important bon travail jackson
Apr 22 2010,positive,sekuel ii of the great movie of tolkiens masterpiece lotr
Apr 22 2010,positive,an excellent epic movie that is breathtaking and beautifully directed
Apr 22 2010,positive,all three of these movies are incredible  peter jackson drained every bit of his awesome movie directing life force into them theyre all pretty much one big movie  i wish the studio would rerelease them in theaters  theyre beautiful sweeping epic films and they belong on the big screen
Apr 21 2010,positive,not as good as the first one but still epic
Apr 21 2010,positive,itz a must watch movie
Apr 19 2010,positive,i liked this movie because it is very stressful  1000 love it
Apr 19 2010,positive,this had some amazing action sequences and was vastly superior to the first one the side characters take more of a spotlight here
Apr 19 2010,positive,orlando bloomi think that about covers it
Apr 19 2010,positive,superblove it this film is just as memorable and breathtaking as the first one  a brilliantly conceived adventure that has the capacity to take your breath away a thrilling work of film craft amazing the greatest achievement in this film was the epic battle at helms deep this is hands down the greatest fantasy battle scene in cinematic history it was dark and gritty you could literally feel the fear those brave fighters felt it was inspiring and one of the most heroic moments in the entire saga outstanding
Apr 18 2010,positive,i like more than the fellowship of the ring but neither won the oscar for best picture
Apr 18 2010,positive,continuation of the fellowship amazing effects and fantastic perfomances from all actors
Apr 17 2010,positive,i like the lord of the rings movies but theyre soooooo long and dragged out it gets on my nerves
Apr 17 2010,positive,the opening scene of the two towers provides an outstanding yet very brief taste of action cinematography and special effects only to be matched and far surpassed in the final hour of the film the stunning events of the third hour of the two towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film and while the first two hours serve finely as story development they primarily build anticipation for the final hour which mostly depicts the battle of helms deep more than anything else the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience its a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour but i take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while    as stated the road to the battle of helms deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film perhaps the two towers biggest fault is in its own accomplishments the first two thirds of the film are well shot well paced and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline but when compared to the spectacular final hour the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant however to be fair i feel that its simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of helms deep its difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time peter jackson has had to create six hours so far of finished film the battle of helms deep is simply unreal its unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained and regained popularity    as assumed the two towers begins where the fellowship of the ring ended the majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines frodo and sam aragorn and legolas merry and pippin and saruman and his army the performances live well up to the standards of the first film with a particularly notable performance from viggo mortensen as aragorn whose role is significantly larger in the two towers aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for a thirst that was left partly unquenched in fellowship its much easier to root for aragorn than it is for frodo aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man a soldier and a hero more than once did the audience filled mostly with academy voters applaud the heroics of aragorn gollum also shines in a muchwelcomed large role due to extremely realistic computer animation and a fine performance from andy serkis upon which the animation was modeled in fellowship it was appropriate to consider gollum one of the many great features of the film however here he is more of a leading character and a star and his convincing dualpersonality stabbing voice and wellchoreographed body movements make him consistently eyegrabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears    as was the fellowship of the ring the two towers is a visual delight those who have seen fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of new zealand the cinematography is again one of the best aspects of the film the swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this postmatrix era the shots of the ascending enemyladen ladders in the battle of helms deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once the visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film while the visual effects in fellowship were outstanding the battle of helms deep provides for the best application of cgi since the rippling waves of the matrixs bullet time the battle of helms deep features absolutely aweinspiring and seamless integration of acting stunts and computer animation each orc seems to have its own personality demonstrated in its movements and visual features the masses of armies fight with strategy and true character which i imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers the only problem i have with the visual department is the look of gimli the treebeard gimlis visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film but again there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of helms deep george lucas and the wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of the two towers final hour and i doubt they will do so anytime soon    in the fellowship of the ring i had a few minor problems with howard shores score while i thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes i dont think it handled the sentimental scenes opening in the shire gandalfs passing properly i thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much resembling the emotions from james horners titanic however i believe that the two towers requires the type of score which howard shore accomplishes best dark continuous and unrelenting as demonstrated in se7en and silence of the lambs the theme used in many of the action scenes in fellowship low brass six notes repeated with a rest in between is much more present in the two towers appropriately a brand new theme is also unveiled the theme for rohan a prominent kingdom in middle earth rohans theme is played more often than any other melody in the film underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect howard shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an alist composer and with a possible double oscar nomination this year for the two towers and gangs of new york he could get propelled to the very top of the alist right beside john williams and hans zimmer in terms of demand    if not the picture itself there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of helms deep the battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form the choreography of the battle the visual effects the pacing acting cinematography and music all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be for this very reason no one whether a fan of fellowship or not should miss the two towers
Apr 16 2010,positive,45 this is my review of the trilogy as a whole can you imagine how fascinating it would have been to have a pint of cider with jrr tolkien  that certainly would have been something  i can think of  few other people throughout history id rather sit down with jesus odysseus moses cleopatra buddha elizabeth etc being other options  i used to read the lord of the rings novels every year when i was younger but i havent read a word since prior to seeing this film my freshman year just south of columbia university at the nearest theater on broadway  i went to each of the three films just before either heading back to minnesota departing for the united kingdom or hopping over to france for my winter vacation  it was a great way to end the first semester every year and i definitely remember missing it my senior year when the fourth film in the trilogy failed to arrive for the holiday season  due to the fact that it has been so long since ive read the books it is easier for me to view the films as films instead of as adaptations of the novel  i of course cant entirely divorce the two experiences and i still long to see certain scenes  some of the scenes i longed to see this time around were actually in the extended version  ill have to buy that when it comes out on bluray as well  the film doesnt look spectacular on bluray when compared to some of the more pristine newer releases but it still blows dvd away of course  the fact that i read the novels so many times at such a young age means that they will be forever tied to a certain time and place  theyll always hold a special place in my heart and psyche  thus the films will never compete for my affections in precisely the same way  i do love the films though  they are spectacularly entertaining and spectacularly good  the only feature film trilogies that immediately come to mind that can compare are kieslowskis three colors trilogy and the original star wars trilogy  there are television series such as band of brothers or my favorite televisions shows and film series longer than a trilogy such as the up series that compare but very few  the production design costumes makeup digital effects locations setsprops etc are all superb  new zealand does really seem to have been the perfect location for the trilogy  the casting is quite exceptional as well  i had minor qualms initially some of which linger but ive grown to accept just about everyone in their roles i still hate celeborn though   gollumandy serkiss performance is particularly powerful  i really think it was worthy of an academy award  the pacing of each of the films is superb  the films dont lag for a second  each scene is absolutely riveting and essential for me  i can think of few areas where the script could have been improved  the places where it strays too far from the text of the lord of the rings and begins to incorporate elements of the silmarillion are some of the weaker sections but some of these also give the film an even greater hinted at depth  each act each scene each film simply leaves me wanting more  the third film is almost impossibly brilliant  i cant think of another picture out there to include all of my favorite films that id be more apprehensive about seeing with a significant other  there is no other film that leaves me as emotionally naked  i cant help but oozing tears and bearing my soul to some extent at least  the third act in particular the last 15 minutes or so is magnificent  it doesnt get much better  few filmmakers have the guts to drag a film on like this  normally i feel like filmmakers put off the ending in order to arrive at some sort of resolution  this is the opposite  jackson and company delay the resolution as long as possible and thereby comply with the books demands  it is close to perfection  i cant wait for the extended versions on bluray  amazing in every sense of the word  it does make me wonder what other filmmakers would have made of it  i am intensely curious about del toros take on the world
Apr 16 2010,positive,the two towers continues peter jacksons epic trilogy with us knowing that the adventure is almost over but us not knowing how the two towers is an amazing film and wonderfully continues the story picking up from the previous film peter jackson has already proved that he is a master storyteller and this film works perfectly the music is still grand the acting is terrific and the cinematography is beautiful the final battle at helms deep is probably the films best part while andy serkis delivers an incredible supporting performance as gollum toward the end we wonder how everything will get completed and how the whole story will come to an end
Apr 16 2010,negative,gollum and the scale
Apr 14 2010,positive,even more visually stunning than the first film two towers soars  it left me on the edge of my seat for the full duration of the movie  brilliant
Apr 14 2010,positive,second part of a trilogy is perhaps doomed to be the weakest one
Apr 14 2010,positive,must have in your movie collection
Apr 13 2010,positive,one of the best sequels of all time
Apr 13 2010,positive,didnt win the amount of oscars it deserved the highlight being helms deep
Apr 13 2010,positive,well lets see lord of the rings yah awesome
Apr 11 2010,positive,great film but a few too many liberties taken with the source material in this one have to watch the extended cut though or several of the major scenes dont really make a lot of sense
Apr 11 2010,negative,bad bad bad  i actually slept during the helms depp  battle  cmon lah run run run hack hack hack show fiery eye  yuck
Apr 10 2010,positive,the best of the lotr trilogy
Apr 10 2010,positive,this is actually my favorite film of the trilogy it by far deserved the oscar for best picture over chicago in my opinion at least this may be the only film that is purly fast paced and completely captivating i am particularly fond of this film because of the epic war scenes which brings out far more intensity than the previous film this is the only lord of the rings film i am able to watch several times so what makes this film so appealing and well made  the story and plot fascinating how all this could have been dreamed up and created in the form of a book than captured on film the attention to detail jackson has is undoubtably one of the most committed of all time espicially here it is in this film we are introduced to gollum one of the more interesting characters on the entire story he sets an aura for the majority of the film keeping us on the edge of our seats wondering what he is capable of and what he will actually do the characters of sam and frodo grow far more interesting as their will and abilities are put to the test once again it is the war scenes that really push this films through and astound me and keep me glued to the tv  the acting the acting in this film is much the same as the last with a few exceptions viggo mortenson really pulls through and demonstrates  the ruthless and sensitive side of aragon this for me was the standout of the entire film wood and austin really show their grit and talent as their characters are strained and tested the share size of the cast is also astonishing once again the attention to detail in the casting and extras is masterful  a final note is the dazzeling effects the costumes are perfectly made and a wonder to the eyes   overall this is without a doubt the best of the entire trilogy i recommend this to every movie lover and anyone who enjoys the epics or fantasy stories
Apr 9 2010,positive,epic fantsasy frodo is a homo though good thing there are a lot of other really cool characters
Apr 8 2010,positive,awesome simply awesomebreathtaking mind blowingone of my all time favourited
Apr 7 2010,positive,the worst of the trilogy and thats not saying much
Apr 7 2010,negative,actually i cant fairly judge this movie considering i was asleep half the time hmmlets see two towerstwo stars
Apr 6 2010,positive,the second installment in the trilogy of the adapted tales from jrr tolkien picks up exactly where the fellowship of the ring left off where we see the hobbits frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin continue there journey to the depths mordor in their mission to destroy the ring whilst there departed companions make new allies and forge an assault on isengard undeniably separated aragon viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom and gimli john rhysdavies desperately search to find the missing hobbits who are captured by the orcs meanwhile gandalf ian mckellen travels in an attempt to locate help for the engaging battle that soon followed director peter jackson does deliver a excellent offering for a sequel though it falls a twinge short of the felllowship the screenwriting team did manipulate some major storylines from the novels though the many differences never reflected in this enterprising endeavor the film was nominated for six academy awards and won best sound effects and editing the visual effects team did another fantastic job as they created more engaging battle sequences and the introduction of the cgi character gollum despite the manipulated plot the two towers is still a very entertaining film filled lots of action and stunning visual and sound effects    story b  acting a  direction b  visuals a  overall b    12 out of 4 stars
Apr 6 2010,positive,nothing more can i say the best of its trilogy this will a classic this is a classic
Apr 6 2010,positive,i live this series i love the actors i love the story i love the imagination that this book and movie took to create awesome
Apr 6 2010,negative,these movies as good as they may be put me to sleep too long
Apr 5 2010,positive,this film may only give part of the payoff for the setup in the fellowship of the ring but boy is it sweet peter jackson delivers something in the two towers that improves it greatly from the first film and it is represented by two things one is the cgi gollum who is the most chilling character in the film but also provides much of the comic relief the other is the awesomely epic battle of helms deep this battle redefined the epic scope of the trilogy and was one of the greatest battles in the history of film however this film is highly confusing at times and often crams way too many characters into one scene you must watch fellowship of the ring first the extended cut on the other hand does much more for me than the theatrical version as it not only gives us a funeral scene for ãowyns brother thã codred it also gives us an excellent flashback to gondor this flashback gives us more sean bean as boromir and who didnt want that and gives us our first look at john noble as denethor boromir and faramirs sinister father who plays poor faramir against his older brother whom he favors as for other performances ian mckellen still excels as gandalf though the mystic nature of the white character makes me somewhat miss the simple kindheartedness of the original grey christopher lee continues to play villains spectacularly as the evil white wizard saruman and elijah wood and sean astin give it their all as a frodo and sam in great peril dominic monaghan and billy boyd are given more to do in this installment providing both humor and drama as merry and pippin especially in the extended scenes with the orcs hugo weaving liv tyler and cate blanchett provide a mystic presence in their respective characters of elrond arwen and galadriel and trilogy newcomer david wenham miranda otto bernard hill brad dourif and karl urban all provide great performances as faramir ãowyn thã coden grima wormtongue and ãomer respectively but as stated above andy serkis truly is the best actor in this film even in motion capture his gollum is compelling fascinating comedic and frightening all rolled into one and shows what could happen to any poor soul corrupted by the power of the ring after the expository nature of the fellowship of the ring the two towers ups the stakes moving the film trilogy one step closer to its epic conclusion
Apr 4 2010,positive,great action sequences and amazing effects but dosent realy move the story along as much as 1 or 3
Apr 4 2010,positive,there are a lot of recycled elements from the first installment for example the false death scenario fellowshipring is gandalf really dead no cant be his face in on the cover of the next one two towers is aragorn really dead no the third one is called return of the king and his face is the cover of the next one another example the evergrowing bond between frodo and sam fellowshipring sam thats it mr frodo the next step i take will be the farthest from home ive ever been frodo looking longingly into sams eyes for just a little too long frodo its okay sam i love you two towers sam someday theyll tell stories about us all the kids will gather and say tell us the one about frodo frodo still looking longingly into sams eyes for just a little too long frodo and dont forget sam the great whom i love    stuff like that    overall peter jackson did good work there were a little more cheesy moments and odd filmmaking techniques than in the first one but for the most part theyre right on par with one another
Apr 4 2010,positive,picks up the pace that starts at the end of fellowship and leads up to one of the most memorable battles in cinema greatness
Apr 3 2010,positive,the battle of helms deep nuff said
Apr 3 2010,positive,better to watch a three hour movie than trying to understand the book
Apr 2 2010,positive,the often overlooked second chapter a brilliant film sandwiched in between its brothers less innovative than either of them yet bursting with character and boasting more storyline than both of its kin a masterpiece
Apr 2 2010,positive,this sequel is less entertaining than the last one but is a more epic spectacular and bigger movie
Apr 2 2010,positive,peter jackson returns with a much more gleeful entertaining and dark sequel that surpasses its predecessor and preps the audience for whats to come
Apr 2 2010,neutral,sooo long  best scene when it finishes
Apr 1 2010,negative,boring and not even close to excitinghow is this so epicits more fun to watch the history of potatoes on the history channel than watch this
Apr 1 2010,negative,too lengthy  mr jackson lost much of the subtle character development that mr tolkein included in the book also  bad film  do not bother watching this po junk  very terrible  one of the worst pictures that ive ever seen in fact  boo
Apr 1 2010,positive,i saw a perfect projection of the extended edition last night  there is some great character stuff in here and a handful of awesome moments there is also some stupid stuff killing gimli off would have been preferable to what they did with him here  i also still think its odd how upbeat of a note the story ends on seems like the end of the middle movie should end on a lower note  they had no business cutting out the faramirboromir flashback it is so central to both his arc and frodos
Mar 31 2010,positive,this movie is pretty different then the first  what i mean is the first movie centers around bringing you into the world of lord of the rings  there is a lot of back story and a lot of legend of the land going on throughout there adventure which again brings us into the world of lord of the rings    real quick kinda some spoilers in this review so if you have not seen it you might wanna skip this part    now this second installment is completely centered around the adventure in fact i would say the majority of the movie is following frodosam and gollum as they travel to mount doom and aragorngimlilegolas trying to save the people of rohan  the story really leads up towards the end battle which i must say is some of the greatest cgi ive ever seen     getting on to the movie it doesnt work as well as the first as its own independent movie but it definitely has different aspects  an example is the large war there really was nothing like that in the first installment  this film definitely improves on the sorrow of the land which in my opinion is what makes this film so good on its own  it is very saddening to see what the war over the ring has done to the people of middleearth like the ents or people of rohan  an overlooked faction which i like is the people of osgiliath  their story is overlapped by the battle of helms deep so they are often forgotten when people talk about this movie  their story is much more gruesome then the other previously mentioned factions and it really adds to the overall pessimistic view this movie seems to have    end of spoilerish part    to sum it up this movie is probably the weakest when you look at all 3 movies together the only aspect that was really added to it was the totalwarish helmsdeep part  yet helms deep is definitely overshadowed by the gigantic war of lord of the rings 3return of the king  two towers was not as innovative as the first so i felt very reluctant to give it a 100 but it is definitely my favorite of the series so i guess it deserves a 100  again a very great watch and if you havent seen it watch it right now but maybe with another of the series because it seems to be much weaker if you just watch it independently real quick a little tidbit at the end i personally love how frodo and sam are almost aware of how they should be in a story in two towers     sort of spoiler sequel below    there was a little bit before the end where sam wanted to read a book about frodo which i thought was an absolutely hilarious thought
Mar 31 2010,positive,much more fulfilled than most second films in trilogies what was a group adventure in the fellowship of the ring now becomes a segmented journey following three different groups frodo and sam heading to mordor and coming across the maniacal gollum merry and pippin in the company of treebeard and the ents and eventually the battle of isengard and aragorn legolas and gimli meeting gandalf in his reemergence and fighting alongside theodin king of rohan in the battle of helms deep the two towers still has plenty of villains and henchmen the most interesting being wormtongue theodins righthand man who is poisoning the kings mind for lord saruman each character has a complete arc which is what differs this film from other middle entries by the end of this film you are begging for the third and final entry in the lord of the rings trilogy in the best of ways
Mar 31 2010,neutral,saw this like 4 times each time it was still boring
Mar 29 2010,positive,two towers is a little weaker in plot than its predesesor the plot is just very quick and rush the weekness of if is that pretty much every thing is a build up for the helms deep battle the obvious strong side of this one is thats its way more action oriented the battles are extremely well done and the battle of helms deep the first time i watched it i had never expirence an all out war so well put together as this one in terms of character development gollum is the king greatest cgi character of all time the guy is so insane and twisted but also so simpathetic and funny he even has a split personality disorder but you can still feel symapthy for him what a terrific performance overall a really good fantasy action film and possibly one of the greatest sequels out there
Mar 29 2010,positive,eye popping graphics gave justice to one of scifis classic novels
Mar 28 2010,neutral,ive had frends tell me they rushed through the books story i cant imagine how this long long film is rushing just read the book
Mar 28 2010,positive,this along with the two companion films are a cinematic masterpiece
Mar 28 2010,positive,to me the lord of the rings has always been overrated my favourite of the three i thought that the first movie was good but dragged a bit and ive never seen the third through to the end very overlong i dont think any movie should be too long unless its going to be really spectacular which in my opinion this is not  gollumn was definately my favourite and probably the most entertaining part of the film  well in the end those looking for something fast paced then remember to think twice about any lord of the rings movie but those looking for something epic and large in spectacle and very ambitious with great special effects then lord of the rings just might what your looking for  the most fast paced of the three
Mar 28 2010,positive,ah this was a really exceptional sandwich movie nestled in between th egreat bookens of fellowship and return  this is really a great fantasy epic though not for everyone  personally i enjoyed all three and plan on watching them again very soon
Mar 28 2010,positive,after waiting for the second installment for ages we finally got to see part two of this brilliant trilogy to be and like i expected it was nothing but pure genius and as amazing as the previous film everything that was amazing in the first one we get to see here and if anything it only gets better    costumes make up stage literally everything was astounding then it comes to the visual effects and seriously there is only one word to describe them perfection its a real joy watching something has flawless as they are specially when it comes to characters like gollum whos amazingly done and of course treebeard you cant either forget about the battle at helms deepi was close to dropping my jaw to the ground it was that amazing probably the most brilliant and powerful scene mixed with actors amazing background and visual effects and i doubt you can to better with the technology today     the acting is also strong like in the previous film but you do see that the actors had to put more work into this movie then the previous one the two tower is more emotionally rich more human and because of that much more demanding of the actors viggo mortensen elijah wood ian mckellen who doesnt get as much screen time as he deserves sean asting and others all bring great and confident performances to the table also the new ones arent any worse brad dourif for example is brilliant as the mask of wormtounge bernhard hill and miranda otto completely fit also karl urban even with a really small part still leaves something behind have to mention john rhysdavies but he is hilarious as gimli    i have been trying to avoid from comparing two towers to fellowship because i cant say which one i like better fellowship didnt offer as good battles and action or wasnt as impressive but two towers suffers slightly for one thing the movie doesnt really have a beginning and you are just thrown into the middle of events happening but those small details dont affect the over all results in the end peter jackson doesnt do anything wrong here again he has done something that many directors have been trying to do making and building a project that will have its place in the history books as one of best works in the business    9410
Mar 26 2010,positive,shhh just nod fantastic
Mar 25 2010,positive,i cant decide if this is my second or third favorite of the series
Mar 25 2010,positive,the epic saga that changed storytelling worldwide
Mar 25 2010,positive,i was fully expecting the second movie to be a rubbish but thankfully it was just as good as the first maybe even better  peter jackson really didnt allow the standards to slip not one bit
Mar 24 2010,positive,actually this is a fantastic film doesnt drag at all foolish me how dare did i give this a 90 haha this might be the best of the three
Mar 24 2010,positive,review for the trilogy the trilogy took seven years and scores of gifted artists to execute i have never read the book and intially had preconceived ideas that it would be slow and drawn out and not really my thing how wrong was i the story of frodo baggins who inherits a ring of power which in the hands of sauron the lord of the rings would bring about the destruction of the world superb cinematography shot in beautiful new zealand and to constrast jaw dropping computergenerated action scenes gollum is played by the awesome andy serkis perfect casting good casting all round the music score was perfect for the film and has ability to get you involved on all levels a fantastic job by howard shore simply put this is more than a movie its a artistic masterpiece
Mar 23 2010,positive,os there anything better
Mar 23 2010,positive,i believe this movie surpasses the first i know not said often but it has better action better plot and better character depth the additions to aragorns character and gollums subplot were enticing but i think much of the elvish backstory and talking in preparation to the battle for helms deep was unnecessary frodo other than falling facefirst into the swamp wasnt as dumb and helpless i do like how it ends on an uncertain note as well the darkest part of the trilogy where you arent sure as to how theyll survive the next onslaught and how frodo will make it to mount doom great movie toooooo looooong
Mar 23 2010,positive,better than the original so much action to entertain anyone one of the best battle scenes ever
Mar 23 2010,positive,i think is the best movie of this fantastic trilogy
Mar 23 2010,positive,no beginning and no end to this movie full of adventure drama  action setting it up for the final battle off middleearth    love it

Mar 23 2010,positive,more exciting more deeply emotional and moving return to middle earth and witness the followup of jrr tolkiens legendary epic trilogy
Mar 22 2010,positive,better than the first very good action and definately some funny parts too
Mar 21 2010,positive,this is the least good of the three of them but its still awesome  gollum is just fantastic  he doesnt spit or breath flames  he lives in a cavern and eats raw fishes  one of the best characters of the decade
Mar 21 2010,positive,my favorite quote of this movie is when legolas hits the dead orc and saysit moved and gimil saidthats because my axe is in his nervous system lol
Mar 20 2010,positive,the two towers is the greatest middle of any films series ever
Mar 20 2010,positive,the trilogy that keeps on giving
Mar 19 2010,positive,couldnt wait for this oneand couldnt wait for the next
Mar 18 2010,positive,the entire trilogy is remarkable    the battle for helms deep was a 40 minute battle of greatness      excellent movie
Mar 18 2010,positive,excellant story line contined great movie
Mar 18 2010,positive,fantastic film in my opinion the best of the trilogy due to the elongated ending in return of the king jackson has produced an epic film with special effects that are second to none not even avatar
Mar 18 2010,neutral,again extended version prefered
Mar 17 2010,positive,top of the list  definately
Mar 17 2010,positive,best one of the three like the book amazing movie

Mar 11 2010,positive,the special effects blew my mind when i saw this at the cinema pretty good
Mar 10 2010,positive,yeah whatever good movie books are betterread
Mar 9 2010,positive,since this one picked up right where fellowship of the ring left off its a really improvement we get to know the characters more we get deeper in the story we get to see some great action scenes and we get introduced to gollum    it still suffers from the fact that like fellowship of he ring it ends on a cliff hanger but just like this one return of the king came out the following year
Mar 9 2010,positive,the weakest of the three but still the shit
Mar 8 2010,positive,honestly all the lotr movies blend together in my head so i cant remember how good they were individually
Mar 8 2010,positive,this trilogy is one of the greatest accomplishments in the film industry to date i genuinely feel for the characters portrayed in the film the siege of helms deep is a spectacle to behold
Mar 8 2010,positive,i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor go back to the shadow the dark fire will not avail you flame of udun you shall not pass  this is where the trilogy really starts to get meaty we meet all the real big players gollums tragedy becomes clear and heartbreaking and the action starts to heat up beautiful vast visuals accompany convincing performances and make for an excellent second act of one of the finest trilogies of all time
Mar 8 2010,positive,i could go on forever they managed to take the most difficult of the three books and straighten it out into a single time line beautiful brilliant touching and serkis is a genius
Mar 8 2010,positive,this movie shows bravery and how different types and groups of people can work together or against one another  more than anything i enjoyed merry and pippen who experienced life the same whether in the shire or in the middle of an international dispute
Mar 8 2010,positive,wish more movies were made this good its longshot approved
Mar 7 2010,positive,it was a bit too long for me but still very good xx
Mar 6 2010,positive,helms deep is the best battle scene i think i have seen  lots of great orc dialogue and the music is amazing  i think its my favorite of the trilogy
Mar 6 2010,positive,best of the lord of the rings movies
Mar 6 2010,positive,gollum and final battle sequence are extraordinary  almost as perfect as the first
Mar 5 2010,negative,is aragorn some kind of god gods need no sympathy neither do godlike female elves they made the books seem worse
Mar 5 2010,positive,the weakest of the trilogy but still an amazing film in its own right  its like the lamborghini sitting next to the ferrari and the aston martin  it might be your 3rd favorite but it still beats the crap out of most other cars on the road
Mar 5 2010,positive,the best sequel ever made better than godfathers sequel a sequel to best fantasy movie ever made
Mar 4 2010,positive,again amazing filmmaking not as many memorable moments as the other two but still very enjoyable and engaging
Mar 4 2010,positive,absolutely fantastic i dont need to say much more
Mar 4 2010,positive,a wild thrill ride and an excellent combination of high fantasy and epic battles and a struggle between good and evil the two towers is the most memorable of the trilogy
Mar 4 2010,positive,a hidden gem if you watch the extended edition
Mar 3 2010,positive,same as the first brilliant
Mar 2 2010,positive,ok maybe this movie is great but i dont think so  i watched it on tv but the advertisements on tv really that many and i went sleepy every time i watched it so i havent watched it until finished  but i admit that the story is good and the sudden appearance of gandalf the white surprised me  the setting of mordor is really cool
Mar 1 2010,positive,i hadnt seen this for a while but it was fantastic  first of all im madly in love with viggo mortensen  second i found it hilarious when legolas skateboarded down steps using a shield  this movie is more violent than the others but i still like it a lot
Mar 1 2010,positive,a fantastic sequel that continues the brilliance of the first one it also officially introduces the deceitful but strangely tragic gollum
Mar 1 2010,positive,full actioni like this
Feb 28 2010,positive,magnificentespecially the extended version
Feb 28 2010,positive,i love the battle scenes
Feb 27 2010,positive,probably my least favorite out of the three but still a decent film
Feb 27 2010,neutral,yes they were longbut i did enjoy watching this
Feb 27 2010,positive,a bit lousy compared to other two
Feb 26 2010,positive,nearly perfect in just about everything its my favorite of the 3 just because of how every story is fragmented from the fellowship yet still so closely connected each story creates a sense of empathetic rapport with the audience though there are warriors present everyone seems to have a vulnerability that we all can relate to action sequences are wonderful and all the costumes and dialogue are spot on awesome mr jackson
Feb 26 2010,positive,just as stunning as the first movie with the addition of even more characters that i ended up loving waiting another year for the conclusion of the story was painful after this
Feb 26 2010,positive,another excellent film  i am rewatching the trilogy with my fiancee who is seeing them for the first time and she is loving them  its fun to watch full of excitement and excellent story  look out return of the king here we come    sorry i know its not much of a review
Feb 25 2010,positive,obviously had two towers never come to be a live action epic 300  the swarm of sword   bow war movies troy kingdom of heaven etc would most likely never have come to pass thank you peter jackson says every movie trying to cash in on this films success
Feb 25 2010,positive,pretty awsome almost makes me want to read the books
Feb 24 2010,positive,this was my favorite of the 3
Feb 24 2010,positive,this movie is absolutely awesome i dont feel that it should have won best picture like the first one should have and the third one did it should have gone to the pianist instead of chicago but i still lived this movie i particularly liked the battle for helms deep also the warg fight where legolas does that cool horse trick is good too i also love that this is the movie that introduces the character of gollumsmeagol fully in the first one he was more of a shadowy figure that gandalf talked about to frodo for 2 minutes in this one he is his own awesome character the special effects set and costumes are pretty much the same through the three movies and they are amazing
Feb 24 2010,positive,good but monotonous
Feb 23 2010,positive,anything by jr tolken is good
Feb 23 2010,positive,see the first one yes sir 
Feb 23 2010,positive,there was applause in the theater haha
Feb 23 2010,positive,best for action probably as good as the fellowship of the rjing  ents are badass treebeard is way older than pretty much every other entity in middle earth but could have been better if they threw in the part in the book where saruman has a good long conversation before disappearing from the story altogether
Feb 22 2010,positive,this movie may start off quite slowly but it gradually paces with great adventure and one of the greatest battles ive ever seen on screen
Feb 22 2010,positive,dont harm the precious haha golem is funnywhew there is alot to say about this movie but im just going to sum it down to one wordphenomenal
Feb 21 2010,positive,could be the best trilogy everstar wars ruined itself
Feb 20 2010,positive,loved all lord of the rings
Feb 20 2010,positive,better than the first i love this movie
Feb 20 2010,positive,excellent movie cant wait for the hobbit
Feb 20 2010,positive,its hard to rate this movie as well as its predecessor the fellowship of the ring and its sequel return of the king as seperate entities the entire thrill of the lord of the rings trilogy was that it stood as a cohesive and complete movie spaced out over the span of three seperate films as such i have posted the same review for all three movies in the series with minor changes concerning plots near the end all three of these movies are filled with a vibrancy of the sort that is rarely seen in films of any type let alone a fantasy epic the attention to detail and the obvious care of the source material stands out in every part of jacksons trilogy masterpiece this is more than a movie it is a work of loving respect by a man who understood what it meant to be able to lose yourself for even a short time in the mystical world of jrr tolkiens middle earth everything about these movies is of the highest standards the acting is believable which is amazing considering that they were expected to make us believe in wizards and elves and moreso the acting is honest there is no attempts to carry things overly dramatic or to seek a spotlight above the others these are roles that are fun to watch and instantly create a bond of caring between viewer and actor the plot is of course based upon one of the greatest selling series of books of all time as expected it is thrilling heroic tragic chilling suspenseful as well as actionpacked the direction is spoton and the filmwork itself is beautiful everything about these three movies is of the highest calibre and make for one of the defining series of filmmaking for this generation  potential spoiler alert  the action picks up immediately from the end of the fellowship of the ring and does not slow down for the entire length of the picture  the development of the characters continues with elements of the friendships between characters now allowing for inside laughs that the audience can enjoy as well  these are no longer a group of strangers they are a group of friends that the audience has come to know just as well as they have  the introduction of the smeagolgollum character and the job done in bringing him to life is absolutely stunning  andy serkis is absolutely genius in his portrayal of a character so tragic that you cannot help but become entralled with him  the true magic is that you begin to cease seeing the character as a special effect and begin to see him as a real person inhabiting this movie  brilliant  little can be said about the awesome spectacle that is the climactic battle at the end of this movie that has not already been said before  it is an awe inspiring scene of such fluid pacing yet startling vividness and grandeur that you cannot help but be impressed by it
Feb 19 2010,positive,dvd deluxe edition boxed set
Feb 19 2010,positive,great middle erth action  story with scenery to match
Feb 19 2010,positive,the best of the trilogy
Feb 19 2010,positive,the film that holds the entire trilogy together featuring its breathtaking final battle at helms deep 910
Feb 17 2010,positive,this is actually my favorite one out of the trilogy in one of the final battle scenes of this movie i was taken away by gandolf the white and his horse as they came down the large hill
Feb 17 2010,positive,terrific ensemble performance
Feb 16 2010,positive,would be 5 star too if not for legolas gaybo shieldsurfing antics at helms deep yes im a hard man to please
Feb 16 2010,positive,my favourite of the series i cannot complain about anything contained within this movie its long so you better be in the movie wating mood when you begin the quality of the battle at helms deep is completly unparallel to anything before or since the more internal story line as we follow frodo and sams progress is of the highest quality however probably my favourite part of the whole movie is the dialogue it never crosses the line from epic to corny it has a modern feel to it without ever taking us out of middle earth and quite frankly it occasionally gives me goose bumps
Feb 16 2010,positive,i have all 3 great movies
Feb 15 2010,positive,may not be quite as good as fellowship but still a great movie
Feb 15 2010,positive,wowwhat a budgetn stories  two thumbs up for gandalf sir ian mckellen and aragorn hugo w but is there any private relationship between frodo and sam they are more than close i think
Feb 15 2010,positive,everything i faulted the first movie for seems to have been corrected in the two towers gandalfs lighthearted moments were subtle not goofy elijah wood was better in some unquantifiable way viggo mortensen looks even better as aragorn when hes haggard and tired this movie also does a great job of capturing the friendshiprivalry between legolas and gimli which is one of my favorite aspects of the books    i neglected to mention the creature effects in the fellowship review so ill hit on them now in fellowship i thought the orcs and goblins looked terrible pretty much onpar with the ooze creatures in the power rangers movie they look a lot better in two towers the ents look a little wonky something about their eyes but i have to say gollum looks fantastic i cant think of anything that they could improve    and i guess the music was good i didnt really pay attention p
Feb 15 2010,positive,the story continues love it
Feb 15 2010,positive,the followup to the smashing fellowship a sequel is rarely better than its prequel and two towers is no exeption but that doesnt mean that it is bad quite the contrary
Feb 14 2010,positive,great movie of all time hands down
Feb 14 2010,positive,all the movies are visually stunning and are fun to watch
Feb 13 2010,positive,superb  the taming of smeagol and the battle at helms deep  this was a great movie  if peter jackson would have made gollumsmeagol any less than what andy serkus put into him the movie would be a flop  the schizophrenic argument between smeagol and gollum was magnificant  the grittiness and shear grandeur of the battle at helms deep was beyond anything ever accomplished
Feb 13 2010,positive,this was my favorite of the three  so many good things about it  especially how everyones fighting with swords n mallots n the elf guy is using bow and arrows n hes kicking ass
Feb 12 2010,positive,the second in the trilogy
Feb 11 2010,positive,spectacular preformance awesome effects and mindbending war scenes
Feb 10 2010,positive,it is the triologia of movies but good that and seen  thanks to all those that made those movies are a delight to the eyes
Feb 9 2010,positive,all 3 episodes of lord of the rings are excellent  the filming the acting the storyline everything is really top form but for me its a thinking movie a long thinking movie at that  generally im a simplistic girl
Feb 9 2010,positive,the two towers  continues to break new ground with visual effects and additional characters
Feb 9 2010,positive,love it one of my favs own it
Feb 9 2010,positive,excellent film to a promising and entertaining trilogy
Feb 8 2010,negative,though i actually liked the first movie i didnt like this at all it was boring and the story got more complicated for viewers who havent read the book i didnt care for the shift in focus to war scenes watching this was torture in a lot of ways first viewing  december 2002 in theaters
Feb 8 2010,positive,really i should probably let this film soak in a bit i am after all on something of a postviewing high right now however at this moment my feeling remains the same from the first installment  this is the movie experience ive been waiting my whole life for in case you havent gathered this movie is visually stunning literally breathtaking i mean that some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks shocked at the pure enveloping beauty of the shot peter jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had    the acting is as always superb specific mention goes to both john rhysdavies in his well enjoyed comic turn and very largely to andy serkis who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly wellperformed cgi character ive ever seen gollum    for the most part and as a fan of the books i take no offense to the slight plot modifications my understanding is that tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of lotr would require a somewhat different take on his work and was apparently open to such minute changes     in short if you found the continual enjoyment i did with the first movie of lotr this movie will in no way let you down not even for a minute
Feb 7 2010,positive,not as strong as the first film it lacks the emotional focus but still remains a truly inspired piece of art the film feels a bit drawn out at spots but the final battles more than make up for its pacing in its first half and most of the reason for it not being as successful as in most parts of a planned trilogy is that the first one was just incredible and so hard to measure up to and its the middle chapter leading up to all the upcoming incredible events of the next chapter
Feb 6 2010,negative,this is officially one of the most tedious films i have ever been forced to watch in my life
Feb 6 2010,positive,see itits really good
Feb 6 2010,positive,it was an intresting and i loved it
Feb 5 2010,neutral,a lot better than the first one but i still dont like
Feb 5 2010,neutral,easily the weakest film in the trilogy it really grinds my gears that so few other people realise what a borderline catastrophe this was its kind of just a dumb action movie the plot doesnt move forward and gollum really isnt that funny fuck you
Feb 4 2010,positive,its  so good its hard to explain go choke on a fart
Feb 4 2010,positive,the best movies lot 0f adventureb0ut frenzshipn sacrifice
Feb 4 2010,positive,the cinematography is spectacular
Feb 3 2010,positive,an amazing movie youd have to watch it to appreciate it
Feb 3 2010,neutral,mmm mixed feelings about these movies
Feb 2 2010,positive,this is good movie but it loses points for a long long ending
Feb 2 2010,positive,1star the direction of pgotography 2 stars te movie not good to me but if youre a tolkien fan well
Feb 2 2010,positive,simply the most well made film of all time even if your not keen on this genre of film
Feb 1 2010,positive,the most entertaining movie experience you will ever have
Feb 1 2010,positive,for me the two towers slumps just a tiny tiny bit but dont get me wrong it is still absolutly astonishing this one turns the heat up or steps up to the next level jackson really understands this world and the peoples that live in it this one has a little bit more action and the final battle was great it kept you on the edge of your seat and made you want even more
Feb 1 2010,positive,when i saw this movie i was like a nodding dog obviously peter jacksons interpretation  of the greatest trilogy ever written surpassed even my expectations cant wait for the hobbit
Jan 31 2010,positive,the best of the lotr trilogy with an amazing performance by andy serkis as gollum forth eorlingas
Jan 31 2010,positive,very good movie with a very nice story good characters and acting nice action and special effects
Jan 31 2010,positive,really intense and filled with suspense had me sitting at the edge of my seat the whole time
Jan 30 2010,positive,it was not my favorite of the trilogy but i loved it
Jan 29 2010,positive,incredible battle most fav quote the battle of helms deep is over and the battle for middle earth is about to begin gandalf the white
Jan 29 2010,positive,epic part 2 to the trilogy again get the extended version
Jan 28 2010,positive,favorite of all 3
Jan 28 2010,positive,everything i said about the first i can keep about this one so there not much to say if you liked the first theres no way youre not gonna like this one and theres no way youre gonna miss it it keeps epic beautifull and a catch to the eye peter jackson created one of the best movie series ever and should get the director of the decade for it
Jan 28 2010,positive,the first entry in peter jacksons film adaptation of the lord of the rings was so perfectly plotted and engaging the films that follow almost feel weaker in comparison  the filmmakers task with the middle segment of the trilogy is certainly rife with more challenges  with the breaking of the fellowship at the end of the first film were now asked to follow three separate stories  frodo and sam continue their journey to mordor to try and slamdunk the one ring into mount doom with the aid of the sneaky gollum  aragorn legolas and gimli attempt to rally the kingdom of rohan to battle against sauron which culminates with the siege of helms deep whilst merry and pippin escape the clutches of their orc captors and encounter treebeard the ent whom they hope will take the fight to saruman in isengard  whoooof  well this wouldnt be too bad if jackson didnt engage in some bizarre choices which actually lengthen an already cumbersome plot  the character of faramir has always been the antithesis of his brother boromir but here screenwriters fran walsh  philippa boyens make him just as obsessed as his brother to exploit the power of the one ring  so were treated to a painful not to mention expensivelooking detour as faramir drags the hobbits back to osgiliath  the first time i saw this i was pretty pissed but the socalled extended edition which was subsequently released makes this more palatable by interspersing some flashbacks of faramir being swayed by the impossibly strict wishes of his father denethor  in fact if the movie suffers from anything its the dearth of flashbacks  for example livs tylers already freestyle role as arwen is pulled through the thread of two towers like a lengthy splinter im sure she was injected into the films merely to flesh out more of the female roles which i agree with in theory  but the scenes between her and aragorn which were omitted from the first film are now shoehorned into this central chapter in the form of flashbacks increasing the scattershot effects of the narrative  jackson also telegraphs the whole concept of the kingdom of men coming into their own age of independence by having the elves intervene in the final battle  all is not dire however  there is lots to admire in this film and jackson certainly gets more right than wrong in this massive undertaking  gollum for example is certainly one of the most memorable and fullblooded cgi characters in cinema history  having andy serkis in a motion capture suit on set to interact with elijah wood and  sean astin was something i wish george lucas would adopt  speaking of our favorite evilring couriers the depth of frodo and sams relationship deepens and you really get the sense that sams insistence in accompanying frodo at the end of fellowship is perhaps the most pivotal moment in the entire trilogy  frankly i also think its great that billy boyd and dominic monaghan get their own segment with the ents driving home the point that two characters so small in stature can have a major impact on the story  in the human camp david wenham is great new addition as if he actually were related to sean beans boromir from the first film  he strikes an intense but honorable air as faramir and certainly comes into his own in return of the king   the people of edoras are also well represented  karl urban before his triumphant turn as dr mccoy in the recent star trek reboot is commanding and authoritative as eomer  veteran actor bernard hill is equally fantastic as king theoden literally coming to life before your eyes to rally his people to war  speaking of one of numerous devils in the trilogy brad dourif is appropriately slimy as earpoisoner to the king grima wormtongue  finally the angelic miranda otto is hypnotic as eowyn making me ponder aragorns curious headspace as he keeps pining for the snifflylooking arwen  the film culminates with an epic battle at helms deep which also ends up being a bit of a mixed bag  when jackson pulls the camera back we get plenty of spectacle but when he closes in on the frantic melee action quite often he resorts to blurry closeup or much worse inexplicable slowmotion shots  a certain staffwielding wizard also makes a timely reappearance his return spoiled somewhat by yet another flashback at the tail end of the battle just in time to presage the battle for helms deep is over the battle for middleearth is about to begin   but once again this is a tale for another telling  tilt up
Jan 28 2010,positive,easily the best in the series
Jan 28 2010,positive,loved all 3 lotr movies
Jan 27 2010,positive,i think this one was my favourite
Jan 27 2010,positive,great dramatical story
Jan 26 2010,positive,helms deep was just an epic battle
Jan 26 2010,positive,so this is my second favorite of the franchise its pretty epic cool and creative i have nothing much to say about this film all i have to say about this film is that its awesome
Jan 25 2010,positive,excellent only that i can say best of the best
Jan 25 2010,positive,more action more adventure and less stealth  loved watching it
Jan 24 2010,positive,one of the best fantasy films ever made a gripping tale of middle earth but still frodo is back to his damsel is distress role the helms deep battle was great action sequence this film creates an great  involvement with the audience with a group of characters they care about this is done brillantly an great sequal in a trilogoy
Jan 24 2010,positive,after reading all of tolkiens works and watching each of these movies the two towers strikes me as being the best as well as the most powerfully awe inspiring of the three movies that exist as of now the hobbit being the next it is the empire strikes back of lord of the rings it ties up loose ends and opens new doors as any good part 2 of a trilogy should be
Jan 24 2010,positive,have you been searching for a film that is worth your time and money look no further there are only a handful of films that i would label amazing and this second installment in the thrilling lord of the rings trilogy is definitely one of them i wasnt sure if this film could top its predecessor the fellowship of the ring and it didnt but it was a very close call the two towers is one of those rare sequels that rivals its predecessor in quality but thats just it this movie is a rarity at the moment i cant think of a better movie save for the return of the king but that movie simply cant be topped but the two towers hold its own and that is quite a feat it is a direct continuation of the fellowship of the ring picking up right after its climax i had not read the books when i first saw this movie so i was anxious to see what became of the characters who survived the events of the first one the point of view changes every now and then which i thought was appropriate given the fact that the major characters are in different parts of the land facing different challenges and meeting new characters many new faces are introduced in the two towers some good some bad and others who dont have major roles and some characters introduced dont have any significant roles until the next installment eowyn is a prime example but all of them have some relevance to the story and therefore are important enough to keep in the film some characters from the book were left out completely so anyone who hasnt read the book will have no idea that those characters even exist now on to the plot       the two towers picks up literally right after the fight in the forest at the end of the first film the fellowship has split up with the hobbits frodo and sam going one way and aragorn the elf legolas and the dwarf gimli going after the other hobbits merry and pippin who were captured during the battle in the woods  two members of the fellowship are gone one is killed by orcs and the other fallsliterally in battle against a balrog a terrifying beast that dwells in the dangerous mines of moria frodo and sam are making their way towards mount doom in the fiery land of mordor so they can destroy the ring of power that frodo carries on their journey they meet the pitiful but dangerous creature called gollum who agrees to show them the way to their destination meanwhile aragorn legolas and gilmi are hot on the trail of merry pippin and their ruthless captors and they will not rest until they find their friends new characters like the brave eomer and king theoden and they each play a vital role in the battle against the powerful wizard saruman who causes a great deal of trouble for the films protagonists aragorn and his companions meet up with eomer theoden and a character who was supposedly killed in moria aragorn eomer and the others gather at the ancient fortress helms deep where they battle a massive army of orcs sent by saruman to obliterate them     this movie is an instant classic the director peter jackson is known everywhere for his work on the lord of the rings trilogy and he deserves every bit of praise he receives jackson is one of the finest directors ever in the history of movies and he is definitely one of my favorites he was very careful about who he chose for the major characters and im glad he was the acting was splendid especially viggo mortensen as aragorn elijah wood as frodo baggins and sean astin as samwise gamgee every actor played their part well and they each brought something special to their character i enjoyed watching them interact on screen quite a bit was cut out during the transition from book to screen but i didnt have a problem with it in fact i thought that the movie flowed better than the book it is a very long movie though and it takes a pretty long attention span to keep up with the story and understand what is going on there is plenty of violence and action so it is not easy to fall asleep   i thoroughly enjoyed the triumph that is the two towers and i have always had a great time watching it
Jan 24 2010,positive,the second lotr movie shows what fantasy movies are capable of the siege of rohan captivates and previews the epic battles of the final film
Jan 24 2010,positive,not the biggest fan ever of the series but still a great film  i spent most of my time waiting for the 3rd one though to be honest
Jan 24 2010,positive,the spectacular continuation of jrr tolkiens classic trilogy the fellowship has been broken boromir is dead frodo and samwise have gone alone and unprotected to mordor to destroy the one ring  in their quest to prevent the dark lord sauron from enslaving all of middleearth merry and pippin have been captured by the monstrous urukhai aragon legeolas and gimli have joined the warriors of rohan to stand against saurons puppet the corrupt wizard saruman the white who has specially bred 10000 powerful ferocious fighting manbeasts to destroy rohan and the world of men the gargantuan climatic battle at the human stronghold known as helms deep is one of the greatest battle sequences in film history darker more focused then the original film it is also deeply emotional and much more exciting the first installment with a mesmerizing array of technical wizardry the visual effects are absolutely breathtaking as are the sterling performances from elijah wood who delivers a passionate portrayal  of frodo the majestic ian mckellen delivers a majestic performance as the resurrected gandalf the white sean astin delivers a superb endearing turn as the loyal samwise viggo mortsensen comes into his own with a magnificently dark brooding performance as the heroic aragom orlando bloom is fabulous as legolas the warrior elf the marvelous john rhysdavies as gimli becomes a wonderful comic scenestealer the beautiful liv tyler is absolutely luminous as arwen bernard hill delivers a regal performance as king theoden miranda otto gives a fine spirited turn as eowyn and brad dourif  perfectly embodies the slimy grima wormtongue highlighted by the presence of gollum who is hopeless possessed by the evil ring of power he is an extraordinary blend of cgi and andy serkiss amazing motioncapture performance his dual personally and wellchoreographed body movements make him a starting creation the great artistry that director peter jackson brings to the epic fantasy is staggering won oscars for special visual effects  sound editing an astonishing film experience in every sense of the word     highly recommended
Jan 24 2010,positive,one of the all time amazing films
Jan 23 2010,positive,one of my favorites i consider the lord of the rings trilogy as one epic film
Jan 23 2010,positive,started as my least favorite now one of the best still thought king theoden was too weak

Jan 22 2010,positive,tightness confirmed
Jan 22 2010,positive,again jackson does it two towers is a monumental achievement it gives war a new name i am in awe
Jan 21 2010,positive,the darkest of the 3 moviesits a great story and visually amazing introducing gollum the maniac enjoy

Jan 20 2010,positive,just cant help but love it
Jan 19 2010,positive,this movie was the second movie that changed the movie world for me i think i really opened my eyes in the world of scifi tha battle scene was absolutely terriffic and action packed too bad smeegle turned out to by greedy and began to seek the ring
Jan 18 2010,positive,a sequel that doesnt dissapoint
Jan 17 2010,positive,i class the trilogy as one long epic a masterpiece in cinema
Jan 17 2010,positive,not a huge fan its one story told over the course of three movies thats a long time to wait for resolution its slow and how do they fill all the excess time way too much camera time on frodos big blue eyes swelling up over his unrelenting love and friendship for his friend that other hobbit    meh nice effects though    however if i ever see another orc dragon or elf again i may be forced to throw my own eyeballs into a volcano
Jan 17 2010,positive,the best part of this movie is the addition of gollum he is half funny and relatable and half creepy and distorted and frodo feels for gollum because he feels the same way and knows that eventually he might become some sort of gollum it is way more epic than the first also as everything comes in a larger scale the third is still the best
Jan 17 2010,positive,the little things in the first film are fixed and the film sucks you in and youre stuck from beginning to end never drags and never ceases to amaze
Jan 17 2010,positive,the war between good and evil never stops
Jan 17 2010,positive,fellowship of the ring is epic but two towers is freakin epic
Jan 17 2010,positive,read all 4 books while in school and had seen lesser version released  even the cartoon version of the hobbit  when i found out they were shooting all three books and saw the cast and the proposed budget i was really hoping it was going to be an epic event  it didnt fail  probably one of the best movie sequals made when talking about all three movies  the costimes acting scenary etc  it was well done and probably made tolkien proud
Jan 16 2010,positive,so the journey continues never a dull moment this one was good
Jan 16 2010,positive,continuation of the trilogy this movie continues to do a great job
Jan 16 2010,positive,this movie is fantastic usually i get bored of epic battles that last for most of the movie but they are just so spectacularly done i cant help but enjoy them again the acting is genius and im still loving the soundtrack im enjoying the plot progression too because even though its so different from the books its actually quite as interesting this way and not quite as dry awesome
Jan 16 2010,positive,i think this is better than the first one although the multiple storylines makes it confusing it also makes it interesting like the first one though i am still getting confused with all these medieval names
Jan 14 2010,positive,the best out of the 3 films the acting is great and so is the storyline the action and war scenes are memorable and full of excitement this movie seems like it was made yesterday with the special effects and beautiful scenes each character shows both passion and aggresion throughout a masterful sequel that is just as good if not better than the original
Jan 14 2010,positive,i loved the entire series it was just a beautiful movie 
Jan 14 2010,positive,for honor for freedom  the best
Jan 14 2010,positive,iconic retelling of this bit of classic fantasy story telling  the whole of middle earth brilliantly breathed to life on the big screen
Jan 13 2010,positive,the fellowship of the ring was an amazing achievement a fantasy epic and one of the most amazing movies of our time this movie is no different the lord of the rings the two towers is a fantastic film and doesnt disappoint at all     this movie picks up right where the the last film left off so it springs right into action everything is just as good in this movie as it was in the original with some additional characters this movie remains entertaining to the final credit     this movie looks like it was an effort to make which it was and this isnt a bad thing because the movie ended up excellent the battle of helms deep looks to me like one of the most enduring difficult and amazing scenes ever to be produced in cinema i heard it took months to shoot so you really have to appreciate this film and all its hard work     howard shore has done a good job on all of the lotr movies and the two towers has a great soundtrack the music keeps us watching and this film is much better with it then without it     plot wise we see a build up of emotion from many characters for instance frodo starts to feel more and more of the burden of the ring and legolas and gimli are starting to build as friends this in my opinion is just like the book and i love how these three films stay true to the novel     this film is excellent though out of my opinion this is the worst in the series that hardly means its not fantastic its a great film in every sense of the word a fantasy masterpiece
Jan 13 2010,positive,it gets better with each installment kudos
Jan 13 2010,positive,okay for my liking the two towers is not as exciting as the first film but the payoff is much grander the stakes are much higher and the visuals have improved but the middle of this story just feels like it drags on a bit before getting to the good stuff but not to say that the slow parts are not fantastically written because they are in fact the final act of this film is my favourite part of the entire trilogy the battle at helms deep is some of the best films action i have ever seen the choreography is immensely impressive the second instalment in the lord of the rings trilogy is the strongest plot and characterwise but my least favourite when it comes to the viewing itself this is such an incredible trilogy
Jan 13 2010,positive,this movie is a triumph of a sequel that has all the power of the first movie and more               double the action double the characters and even better cgi especially helms deep and the ents the actors come back in full throttle reviving their characters for this powerful sequel i am completely drawn in for the entire movie 1010
Jan 13 2010,positive,what can i say about this film that has not already been said instant classic again peter jackson brings to life the characters we grew up loving the actors again delivered a stellar perfomance
Jan 13 2010,positive,the strongest of the three films and one of the greatest films ever made the two towers is a phenomenal triumph every part of it is flawless from the acting to the cinematography even its lengthy running time doesnt effect its beauty peter jacksons greatest piece by far
Jan 12 2010,positive,awesome movie all three of them
Jan 12 2010,positive,i loved this movie
Jan 12 2010,positive,directorpeter jackson  won 2 oscars another 65 wins  76 nominations
Jan 12 2010,positive,part two of one of the greatest achievements in all film
Jan 11 2010,positive,i think the interpretations of the ents was an epic failure but rohan was pretty awesome
Jan 11 2010,positive,once again great acting brilliant effects and the tremendously good story and overall plot the pace is a bit slower than the first one but packs a massive punch the epic continues
Jan 11 2010,positive,you cant rate these no matter what criteria you use its the vision of jackson not mine and luckily so
Jan 11 2010,positive,love the lord of the rings 
Jan 10 2010,positive,you appreciate it more if you watch it for the second time the third time forth time d

Jan 10 2010,positive,the lord of the rings series are the best movies ever
Jan 10 2010,positive,nothing needs to be said more at this point
Jan 10 2010,positive,9610  cannot give it the 100 like its predecessor while the film was excellent it wasnt flawless  new characters emmerged here gollumsmeagol eowyn riders of rohan theoden  smeagol was wonderful as he played out a deceptiveatthesurface but underlyingly endearing troubled soul this film tied the first and third together well but did lack in some areas  for one it did have some slow spots ents and did drag a bit but overall definitly worth a watch and a purchase
Jan 9 2010,positive,one of my most favorite movies i love the way peter jackson can bounce around 3 different storylines in a way that not only doesnt annoy audiences it captivates them
Jan 9 2010,negative,2nd film in a pointless line of films which could be done in literally 10 seconds one day i will give it a try im sure it is interesting but i just didnt get it
Jan 8 2010,positive,almost as good as the book 
Jan 8 2010,positive,5 star end of story period 
Jan 7 2010,positive,im a lotr nerd too xd
Jan 7 2010,positive,it ties the first and third movie together okay but it definitely is the worst of the trilogy
Jan 7 2010,positive,being the middle chapter of a trilogy is a tough gig but peter jackson manages to pull it off personally i think it lacks the pacing of fellowship of the ring but it matches return of the king in terms of grandeur
Jan 7 2010,positive,one of the best sequels made
Jan 6 2010,positive,the first is better the fighting is overdone in this film however ive never been a real fan of the lord of the rings so its hard for me to judge

Jan 4 2010,positive,wondrously brilliant peter jackson has wonderfully and faithfully created a fantastical world from tolkiens classic tale of good against bad
Jan 3 2010,positive,this is actually my favorite of the series which should really all be considered one big film mainly because it introduces gollum who you begin to really hope can be saved from his state something the book doesnt do for us it has equally amazing sets costumes characters battles scenery visuals and story as the first of the trilogy
Jan 3 2010,positive,favorite of the trilogy
Jan 3 2010,neutral,great looking film but i didnt really enjoy it very much    i found the making of documentary a lot more entertaining and interesting

Jan 2 2010,positive,the first half is awesome i love the portrayal of the rohan and some fantastic scenes between phenomenal actors like ian mckellen bernard hill and christopher lee
Dec 31 2009,positive,even though i slightly disagree that this installment is better then the first one it still is a strong sequel and more action packed then its predecessor   this story has us following frodo baggins and his best friend sam they lead there journey alone now and the power of the ring is slowly taking control over frodo we are introduced to a new characters gollomsmeagle mildly creepy humorous and sometimes endearing creature helps lead frodo and sam into the right direction we also have a strong war brewing between saruman and basically everybody else he is breeding a new army to take over everything and everyone this story brings back our favorite characters from the first film aragorn legolas gandalf and gimli who help in the attempt to defeat saruman  this film is action packed emotionally well connected and just plain epic a strong sequel to a powerful first movie
Dec 31 2009,positive,peter jackson did a great job with all of these movies  he had great vison and had great actors palying in all the roles
Dec 31 2009,positive,least fav lotr movie because of the stupid trees

Dec 30 2009,positive,the two towers is better than the first movie in the lord of the rings trilogy an adaption of the classic series by jrr tolkien  the scale of the battle scenes are incredible and very impressive but are a little tiresome after about an hour the two towers is still an incredible film
Dec 30 2009,positive,great graphicsphotography fun imaginery story interesting characters
Dec 30 2009,positive,you have to see the trilogy  in order
Dec 30 2009,positive,epic trilogy and must have in any collection
Dec 30 2009,positive,better than the first better action sequences not as repetitive and does lots in its long running time very highly recommended
Dec 30 2009,positive,one of my all time favourites
Dec 29 2009,positive,sad to say i own all of these too
Dec 29 2009,positive,for the first time in years i immediately felt the urge to watch them all again and they run over seven hours in total
Dec 29 2009,positive,similar quality of the first movie and same as before i find this movie overated its good but not superb also i think that is a little bit naive and some of the characters are as annoying as jar jar binks
Dec 29 2009,positive,great movie with a lot of emotions really exciting with the best battle scenes youve ever seen
Dec 28 2009,positive,if you found the continual enjoyment i did with the first movie of lotr this movie will in no way let you down not even for a minute
Dec 28 2009,positive,with return of the king and two towers neck and neck it lost out simpluy due to a bit of confusion in one action scene but it is absolutely brilliant anyway
Dec 28 2009,positive,this film starts off where the fellowship of the ring leaves off frodo and sam are on their own and heading to mordor with the sinister sméagol who has promised to guide them through the mountains merry and pippin are in the hands of sarumans orcs as they return to isengard and aragorn legolas and gimli are in pursuit until they are diverted into helping king theoden of rohan    the film switches between the three groups so we never get chance to forget what the characters are doing i think this is the only film that ive seen where the narrative follows different groups who never meet each other the action is even more spectacular then the previous film the storming of helms deep is one of the most spectacular scenes that ive ever seen also amazing are the realism of sméagol the cgi creature based on the movements of andy serkis and the ents huge creatures that look like walking trees    the actors did a great job especially elijah wood as frodo as he approached mordor you could almost feel the increasing weight of the ring hanging from his neck the cast of characters here is quite a lot larger than the previous film giving us some great new characters the most obvious is sméagol who was only glimpsed before but there is also the wonderfully vile grima wormtongue and eowyn king theodens niece who is smitten with aragorn    i strongly feel that it is the work of peter jackson that prevails above all else you see his love for the books as it explodes from the screen the tension that slowly begins to build up as we hear of the impending doom that the urukhai bring with them from the main characters    i felt that the battle at helmsdeep was executed magnificently you felt each rain droplet each roar each swipe of a blade as it decapitated the monstersthroughout the film there is also an amazing soundtrack that runs through it giving the film a wonderful quality    if you havent seen any of the lord of the rings films i strongly recommend this but only after watching the fellowship of the ring if you dont watch that it will be hard to understand what happens here    truly magnificent
Dec 28 2009,positive,as in the first one the landscape are incredibly beautiful the castles and special effect are so well done it just makes you wanna be there and the battle are just intense and epic the good thing is that there is also room for romance and humour i loved it
Dec 27 2009,positive,wow i didnt know hollywood could be this good since star wars

Dec 27 2009,positive,this is a truly awesome movie  the first part is kind of slow  the movie overall is so well put together you dont care about that  the battle of helms deep is awesome  even better rotk and i love that one
Dec 27 2009,positive,  the best acted  most concise of the 3 installments helms deep is exceptional entertainment darkened tone heightens the peril  suspense of the saga      the ents talked too much  too slowly several stops  starts

Dec 7 2009,positive,extremely long with linger storylines and at times very hard to stay involved in the story youd be better off sticking to the original material

Dec 5 2009,positive,lord of the silver screen
Dec 4 2009,positive,the lord of the rings the two towersthe best one yet a perfect mixture of magic and action all in one film the best acting and character development of the series and also featuring the best completely cgi character gollumsmeagol to date and with perhaps one of the best last 45 minutes of film 1010
Dec 4 2009,positive,in my personal opinion the lord of the rings  the two towers is the most magical impressive and visually stunning film in existence peter jackson has succeeded in creating a timeless classic there are some of you that argue it is overrated which i think is a travesty    the story of the ring is epic in itself with the trilogy by j r r tolkien one of the most well known all around the world and as the sunday times said and you know you can trust them the englishspeaking world is divided into those who have read the hobbit and the lord of the rings and those who are going to read them peter jackson has successfully taken this story and created a translation onto screen in so much depth bringing the story to a whole new generation it is obvious in the viewing of the lord of the rings of the painstaking care and love that went into its creation    if i had been given the cast list for the lord of the rings i would have been amazed by how many big stars were on board and would have told you that it wouldnt work i would have been wrong ian mckellen andy serkis hugo weaving orlando bloom viggo mortensen etcetera are in a word prodigious each and every member of the cast offers the perfect portrayl of characters in their mannerisms and identity in esscence no one else could have done it better    one thing that really struck me about the lord of the rings  the two towers were the battle scenes which again were brought to life in return of the king if i could choose one moment that defines film for me i would say the scene where gandalf arrives with the riders of rohan with the sun rising behind him it is epic simply epic sheer epicness epic    overall the lord of the rings trilogy is the pinnacle of modern cinema as i think the lord of the rings  the two towers is the strongest of the trilogy surely it is the best film in existence
Dec 3 2009,positive,omg i love this trilogy the visual effects alone are phenominal the cast was fantastic the story line brilliant
Dec 2 2009,positive,i couldnt wait to see this after the first oneit owned up to all expectations which were very high
Dec 2 2009,positive,yet another peter jackson masterpiece  had i spotted a flaw it would not have ruined the overall movie experience  this is a great movie for the book readers as well as those who have yet to fill such a gap in their lives 1010
Dec 2 2009,negative,could never follow it
Dec 2 2009,positive,gandalf the white 333
Dec 1 2009,positive,love the whole series   this one slightly less because its the middle of a story cant be helped and i dont like the ents too much
Dec 1 2009,positive,violence always rules
Nov 30 2009,positive,picking up where the first film left off peter jacksons the two towers throws the remaining members of the fellowship into the scattered chaos of middleearth now fully under siege by the forces of sauron while frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin journey to the dreaded mordor merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd are held captive by orcs and aragorn viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom and gimli john rhysdavies search for their abducted companions
Nov 30 2009,positive,this movie is beautiful filled with actionromance and drama the extended edition is even better
Nov 30 2009,positive,awesome movie the best of the three
Nov 29 2009,positive,the parts i stayed awake for were ok
Nov 29 2009,positive,god im such a huge fan of this series and elijah wood is sooo hot brad dourif is hot still3333
Nov 29 2009,positive,just as good as the first film this film doesnt miss a step
Nov 29 2009,positive,best of the series i think personally
Nov 29 2009,positive,like this trilogy more than star trek or star wars xd
Nov 28 2009,positive,the second film in this triology takes up a peg with more earth shatering effects and starts were the fellowship left the viewer
Nov 28 2009,positive,battles inside and outside on the creatures of middleearth fighting to keep they hope alive
Nov 27 2009,positive,this was a good movie im excited for the third one
Nov 27 2009,negative,2 towers2 stars  these films are way too long and i  lost interest 5 minutes into the movie
Nov 27 2009,positive,the best of the ltr triology  the action with the battle scenes was just incedible
Nov 26 2009,positive,didnt like it as much as the first one but still great
Nov 25 2009,positive,this is the slowest of the movies and in my opinion calls for more attention than the other two the first half is bogged down by a lot of politics and people with silly names but the second half picks the pace up    even though this is my least favorite of the three films it is still one of the best modern films that has ever been made
Nov 24 2009,positive,darker than the first but continued the story with excellent action sequences and nail biting suspense have i mentioned these films are pure perfection
Nov 24 2009,positive,the battle for helms deep could have been its own movie next time theyll have to do lotr in 7 parts
Nov 24 2009,negative,the worst of the rings
Nov 24 2009,positive,i love these movies  but then again who doesnt
Nov 23 2009,positive,could watch it over and over again
Nov 23 2009,positive,epic still building and really good movie
Nov 23 2009,positive,a seamless transition from the fellowship of the ring as the fellowship has broken their objective continues however as we proceed with three seperate storylines this method of continuing the story was very effective as all three stories are effective in setting up an action packed end to the trilogy my favorite film of the trilogy for sure
Nov 22 2009,positive,the ringwraiths ride dragons what more do you need    the lord of the rings trilogy pushed the boundaries of what could be achieved with cgi in films and is especially true with the entirety of this film there are entire characters that are computer generated there are magnificent cities created artificially at least for  some shots and it all culminates in one of the greatest battles ever put on screen the battle for helms deep the film lacks the whimsical flow that fellowship had but brings to the table a new level of drama with more characters with impossible to remember names and their ultimate quest to save humanity itll be curious to see if the effects in this film hold up over time but it will always be in the pages of history for using cgi for storytelling instead of spectacle though it acts as both    
Nov 22 2009,positive,the ringwraiths ride dragons what more do you need    
Nov 21 2009,positive,the slowestmoving of the three  this film continues to develop the entire story very nicely
Nov 20 2009,positive,an amazing second installment of this trilogy
Nov 20 2009,positive,the awesomeness continues
Nov 19 2009,positive,a superb film that makes viewers pine to see what happens in the conclusion the direction and scenery show off what is so great about jacksons imagery and view of how movies should be made
Nov 19 2009,positive,the book and the films are unique
Nov 19 2009,positive,my least fav lotr movie but it was still great
Nov 19 2009,positive,completely underrated this was in my opinion the best of the trilogy wed sat for an arse numbing 214 mins of intro via the fellowship and now we get to it    it has often been criticised for being the middle part and therefore dragging but for my money the first two movies make a nice  story of their own and in many ways its the return of the king that is tagged on    short of seven hours of story had rolled on by the time we get to the end of this movie and though you certainly feel it i beleive that is in fact the gem of this often  criticised trilogy    it is in many ways overly long but i feel that its just about paced correctly not to strain the audiance to much a problem which plagues this trilogy are its drawn out sequences which could easily be shortened without losing the impact    the camera work is also a problem for me jackson will not keep his camera still for 5 minutes whenever theres an epic introduction of a hill mountain boat or horse the camera is flying around usually on a plane or helecopter    its simply tells me that jackson had no faith in these stunning enviroments convieing their own beuty without help form his over direction    otherwise this was a well concieved trilogy and this was its underrated jewel in the crown
Nov 19 2009,positive,the continuation of story and characters is just as strong as the first and develops even further this time around you really got to see the acting shine in this gollum was a great addition to the cast the action sequences were amazing helms deep was one of the greatest ive ever seen peter jackson delivered on creating a plausible and mature look into middle earth
Nov 18 2009,positive,i would say this is the most epic well made fantasy film of its type peter jackson did a great job two towers would have been a struggle
Nov 18 2009,positive,it is my precious the problem with most movie sequels is a they suck the big one compared to the original the two towers isnt one of those films in fact its better then fellowship of the ring so the story continues where the last film left off with the fellowship disbanding and frodo and sam heading to mordor to destroy the one ring now the story is fantastic its very gripping exciting interesting and never boring and i watched the extended version the action scenes and effects are awsome and allways exelerating the acting was top notch like the last cast list    elijah wood as frodo baggins the hobbit who must destroy the one ring the burden of which is becoming heavier  sean astin as samwise gamgee frodos loyal hobbit companion better known as sam  viggo mortensen as aragorn the heirinexile to the throne of gondor who has come to the defence of rohan  ian mckellen as gandalf the white the wizard who fell fighting the balrog who has now returned more powerful than ever to finish his task  dominic monaghan as meriadoc brandybuck the hobbit captured by the urukhai pippins best friend better known as merry  billy boyd as peregrin took the hobbit captured by the urukhai merrys best friend better known as pippin  orlando bloom as legolas the elven archer and one of aragorns companions  john rhysdavies as gimli the dwarf warrior and one of aragorns companions   also voices treebeard the leader of the ents who is roused to anger against saruman  andy serkis as sméagolgollum the devious hobbitlike4 creature owner of the ring for centuries who guides frodo on his quest voice and motion capture  christopher lee as saruman the wizard waging war upon rohan and devastating fangorn forest who allies himself with sauron  bernard hill as théoden king of rohan who is healed by gandalf to lead his people once more  miranda otto as éowyn théodens niece who is in love with aragorn the role was first offered to alison doody who turned it down because of her pregnancy uma thurman was slated for the role at one point but declined due to scheduling  karl urban as éomer théodens nephew and previously chief marshal of the riddermark exiled by gríma  brad dourif as gríma wormtongue sarumans agent at edoras who renders théoden incapable of decisions and desires éowyn  hugo weaving as elrond the elven lord of rivendell who expresses doubt over his daughters love for aragorn  liv tyler as arwen elronds daughter and elven princess aragorns lover  david wenham as faramir the captain of the ithilien rangers who captures frodo sam and gollum ethan hawke was slated for the role at one point but declined due to scheduling  cate blanchett as galadriel the elven queen of lórien who discusses the future of middleearth with elrond  craig parker as haldir of lórien the leader of the lórien elves sent by elrond and galadriel to defend helms deep  john leigh as háma the loyal doorwarden of the golden hall and a majordomo of théoden  bruce hopkins as gamling théodens chief lieutenant and a skilled member of the royal guard of rohan  john bach as madril faramirs closest aide who informs him of battle preparations  the following only appear in the extended edition  sean bean as boromir the former member of the fellowship brother of faramir flashback  john noble as denethor steward of gondor and boromir and faramirs father  this is easily a terrific film and if you havnt seen it go watch itnow
Nov 18 2009,positive,have watchd more than ten times anstill wana watch it  tha whole trilogy
Nov 17 2009,positive,amazing series see it asap ill letcha borrow it

Nov 16 2009,positive,all three parts are superb
Nov 16 2009,positive,i know return of the king got all the awards but this is itthe best of the beston par with empire strikes back in surpassing the original by milesand becoming the best in its set
Nov 16 2009,positive,elves     yes please    now this is a movie part 2
Nov 15 2009,negative,thought it will never end
Nov 15 2009,positive,this is my favourite of the three movies unexpectedly mainly due to the fact that i think it worked harder at sticking to the book and including little references to past events
Nov 14 2009,positive,not only is it one of the most satisfying sequels in cinema history the two towers can also be enjoyed by those who may have missed out on the first film its extremely difficult to review any of these films apart from the first because very much like the source material jackson doesnt create a fantasy that is meant to be enjoyed in segments he creates a sweeping journey meant to be explored as one single piece though it wont leave any of the less elite to tolkien lore behind
Nov 13 2009,positive,the lord of the rings triology is one of the best movies i have ever watched peter jackson brought the story alive in my mind one of the best adventure movies of all times i have watched it over and over i even got the collectors edition with all the added effect superb
Nov 13 2009,positive,read the books first
Nov 12 2009,positive,its a bit less eventful and exciting than the other two but it still has cracking setpieces and fantastic performances and direction a solid middle entry to the trilogy
Nov 12 2009,neutral,my least favorite of the trilogy even with the ents
Nov 12 2009,positive,the second film in tolkeins fantasy trilogy finds the fellowship shattered and scattered to the winds gets a little slow in spots but very watchable
Nov 12 2009,neutral,more boredom done well
Nov 11 2009,positive,definetly the weakest of the three but it should be know surprise it is still good
Nov 11 2009,positive,a long but well worth the wait to get to the 3rd lord of the rings
Nov 11 2009,positive,not as good as the 1st and 3rd but still a great movie series
Nov 10 2009,positive,u thouhjt part 1 was cool dis 1 has a lot n store 4 ya
Nov 10 2009,positive,fantastic battle scenes 
Nov 9 2009,positive,the best of the trilogy
Nov 9 2009,positive,love it beautiful scenery characters are well interesting great trilogy not biblical like most people say good vs evil maybe but thats it
Nov 8 2009,positive,great movie despite all that was taken from the book additional scenes were added to round out the story but the spirit of the narrative remain strong this film is an expanded middle the beginning and end of the book were shuffled out to the movies preceding and following  the battle of helms deep is more epic than in the book the healing of theoden is more powerful and faramirs struggle is more compelling in the movies telling  an already excellent cast is strengthened with the additions of bernard hill titanic  miranda otto what lies beneath karl urban ghost ship and brad dourif whos been in so much its hard to begin from one flew over the cuckoos nest to the voice of chucky in the childs play movies
Nov 8 2009,positive,the more action version of the lord of the rings and is now a big part of the series
Nov 7 2009,positive,the best part of an awesome trilogy
Nov 7 2009,positive,absolutely outstanding

Nov 5 2009,positive,another great one  thank you peter
Nov 4 2009,positive,far beyond imaginations
Nov 4 2009,positive,like the first film enjoyed it much more the second time round epic stuff
Nov 4 2009,positive,spectacular second part of peter jacksons epic adaptation of jrr tolkiens fantasyadventure trilogy the lord of the rings in this installment three story lines converge the diminutive hobbits frodo elijah woods and sam sean astin continue on their quest to mount doom to have the ring destroyed hobbits merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd enact the help of treebeard an ent who is a walking and talking tree an heir to the throne viggo mortensen a dwarf john rhysdavies and elf orlando bloom lead in battle against the evil orcs jackson miraculously keeps the action coherent and doesnt overwhelm us with exposition emotionally this is the most despairing of the trilogy as a middle segment there is no onset and the ending is unresolved we are introduced to the schizophrenic fetuslooking gollum voiced by andy serkis who is the most compelling fantasy character in movies since yoda the nocturnal rainy battle at helms deep is one of the great battle scenes in movie history on a grand scale that earns jackson comparisons to griffith eisenstein ford kurosawa and welles won oscars for best visual effects and sound editing written by jackson fran walsh philippa boyens stephen sinclair cinematography by andrew lesnie score by howard shore with ian mckellen as the wizard gandalf liv tyler cate blanchett bernard hill christopher lee hugo weaving miranda otto filmed on location in new zealand running time is three hours
Nov 4 2009,neutral,i like all  of this genre
Nov 3 2009,positive,the first film was incredible and this film does not lose a step it is one of the most intense films i have ever seen especially the battle at helms deep you do feel like there is no hope or moving forward for the human race     preformances were fantastic so passionate and real with great direction from peter jackson who seems to live and breath this amazing story     everything from the first film is continued here not much more to be said only that this film is a must see     directing  2020  preformances  2020  specialvisual effects  2020  musical score  2020  entertainment  2020    100  perfect
Nov 3 2009,positive,its hard to review the lord of the rings trilogy as individual movies   i consider them all as one long 10 hour epic but i would say that its never easy being the second movie   the first film set up the characters and the third lets us know how it will all end    the two towers is a great achievement  effortlessly continuing the story leading up to return of the king    it could have all fallen to pieces having 3 separate stories to follow with frodosamgollumaragongimli and legolas and merrypippin and treebeard  but peter jackson made it all flow together beautifully to create a sequel that leaves other sequels in the dust    the battle of helms deep showcases how far we have come in digital special effects adding 10 thousand cgi characters perfectly into the shot to create one hell of a movie battle    and gollum is an achievement all in itself  andy serkis deserves so much credit for helping create one of the all time best movie characters    an oscar nomination was sadly missed in my opinion for the first proper on screen cgi character that works perfectly    eat itjar jar binks
Nov 2 2009,positive,my favourite one of the trilogy im positive i heard an orc say cowabunga when the one ladder was pushed off the castle wallpositive

Oct 29 2009,negative,all of the lord of the rings movies could have been trimmed down to 1 good movie as they are it
Oct 29 2009,negative,boring didnt build on the first just one big battle scene after another
Oct 29 2009,negative,even more freaking walking man this installent was dull as dishwater with the only saving grace being the awesome brad dourif

Oct 26 2009,positive,bleddy brilliant tolkiens story properly told
Oct 25 2009,positive,ive seen this film and if u havent u r missing out on a lot
Oct 25 2009,negative,worlds longest trailer should have condensed all the films into one might have enjoyed sitting through that
Oct 24 2009,positive,the lord of the rings saga is one of the best film series of all time and the two towers is the best of the three great story all the way through the series and the climactic battle scene is one of the best action sequences of all time breathtaking recreation of tolkiens middle earth by the filmmakers wonderful direction from jackson who made what most assumed would be a guilty pleasure at best into a beautiful piece of cinema awesome  9110
Oct 24 2009,positive,the opening scene of the two towers provides an outstanding yet very brief taste of action cinematography and special effects only to be matched and far surpassed in the final hour of the film the stunning events of the third hour of the two towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film and while the first two hours serve finely as story development they primarily build anticipation for the final hour which mostly depicts the battle of helms deep more than anything else the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience its a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour but i take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while    as stated the road to the battle of helms deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film perhaps the two towers biggest fault is in its own accomplishments the first two thirds of the film are well shot well paced and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline but when compared to the spectacular final hour the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant however to be fair i feel that its simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of helms deep its difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time peter jackson has had to create six hours so far of finished film the battle of helms deep is simply unreal its unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained and regained popularity    as assumed the two towers begins where the fellowship of the ring ended the majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines frodo and sam aragorn and legolas merry and pippin and saruman and his army the performances live well up to the standards of the first film with a particularly notable performance from viggo mortensen as aragorn whose role is significantly larger in the two towers aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for a thirst that was left partly unquenched in fellowship its much easier to root for aragorn than it is for frodo aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man a soldier and a hero more than once did the audience filled mostly with academy voters applaud the heroics of aragorn gollum also shines in a muchwelcomed large role due to extremely realistic computer animation and a fine performance from andy serkis upon which the animation was modeled in fellowship it was appropriate to consider gollum one of the many great features of the film however here he is more of a leading character and a star and his convincing dualpersonality stabbing voice and wellchoreographed body movements make him consistently eyegrabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears    as was the fellowship of the ring the two towers is a visual delight those who have seen fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of new zealand the cinematography is again one of the best aspects of the film the swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this postmatrix era the shots of the ascending enemyladen ladders in the battle of helms deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once the visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film while the visual effects in fellowship were outstanding the battle of helms deep provides for the best application of cgi since the rippling waves of the matrixs bullet time the battle of helms deep features absolutely aweinspiring and seamless integration of acting stunts and computer animation each orc seems to have its own personality demonstrated in its movements and visual features the masses of armies fight with strategy and true character which i imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers the only problem i have with the visual department is the look of gimli the treebeard gimlis visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film but again there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of helms deep george lucas and the wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of the two towers final hour and i doubt they will do so anytime soon    in the fellowship of the ring i had a few minor problems with howard shores score while i thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes i dont think it handled the sentimental scenes opening in the shire gandalfs passing properly i thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much resembling the emotions from james horners titanic however i believe that the two towers requires the type of score which howard shore accomplishes best dark continuous and unrelenting as demonstrated in se7en and silence of the lambs the theme used in many of the action scenes in fellowship low brass six notes repeated with a rest in between is much more present in the two towers appropriately a brand new theme is also unveiled the theme for rohan a prominent kingdom in middle earth rohans theme is played more often than any other melody in the film underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect howard shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an alist composer and with a possible double oscar nomination this year for the two towers and gangs of new york he could get propelled to the very top of the alist right beside john williams and hans zimmer in terms of demand    if not the picture itself there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of helms deep the battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form the choreography of the battle the visual effects the pacing acting cinematography and music all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be for this very reason no one whether a fan of fellowship or not should miss the two towers
Oct 24 2009,positive,it will capture your attention for the actions until the last partone action fantasy movie that will set your focuslove this movie ehehehe especially w legolas

Oct 21 2009,positive,lotr awesome trilogy excellent story actors and so on
Oct 21 2009,positive,continuing on with the awesomeness that was the fellowship of the ring
Oct 20 2009,positive,the worst of the three but still excellent
Oct 20 2009,positive,one of the best adveture movies made great scenery and story two towers is the best part of this trilogy great fights and costumes as well
Oct 20 2009,positive,imo is the less great movie of the three nevertheless is great the scenes with tha talking trees were a bit boring
Oct 19 2009,neutral,fell aspleep a few times during it
Oct 19 2009,positive,this movie is the best of the great series  it kept the plot alive throughout the whole movie and it is impossible to get bored once i think that peter jackson is a great director who keeps the story alive throughout  it is a very good movie and the best of the trilogy

Oct 16 2009,positive,epic continuation to an epic story  all who play in this play well
Oct 15 2009,positive,peter jackson did it again thank you for this masterpiece the extended edition was worth the wait im glad for more boromir and faramir shots there were a great many inconsistencies with the book but who cares when peter jackson managed to bring the world of tolkien alive once again
Oct 15 2009,positive,a step up from the first movie peter jackson keeps the lotr franchise succesfully going  this is a movie with very very few mishaps in fact they are so insignificant they are not even worth talking about  just like the first film it had great acting directing and an even better score   not really much else to add on to that except if you haventt seen the lotr trilogy yet slap yourself in the face and go rentbuy the movies now
Oct 15 2009,positive,i enjoy all the lotr movies
Oct 14 2009,positive,the weakest for me of the trilogy but its quite a spectacle
Oct 14 2009,positive,i love viggo mortensen in these movies to me this is the best in the series and the original is second best

Oct 11 2009,positive,the person with great imagination will surely like this movie
Oct 10 2009,positive,absolutely stunning this is the perfect sequel and although they have to change small parts in the book like where the second book actually ends they honestly are doing an amazing job with this trilogy you are cheering on the heroes and waiting for karma to bite the villains in the rear
Oct 10 2009,positive,the weakest of the three  the only one where i felt like they were trying to bash us over the head with morals no war all life is sacred etc
Oct 10 2009,positive,the first lotr movie i saw therefore my favorite minus the one part w the creepy things that give me nightmares xd
Oct 10 2009,positive,watch all 3 great work

Oct 7 2009,positive,actually my favoirte of the three movies
Oct 7 2009,positive,another amazing movie to add in with the trilogy
Oct 7 2009,positive,perfect again the best out of all three

Oct 4 2009,neutral,the best of the 3 mostly bc it has talking trees
Oct 4 2009,positive,second in the trilogy and excellent storytelling  great cast with plenty of action and drama  love this
Oct 3 2009,positive,i cannot believe how absolutely amazing this film is even though it strayed even further from the books seeing the kingdom of rohan isengard and helms deep and fangorn forest really bought the vision of jrr tolkiens book to life i think if tolkien were alive today he would have been proud of this film the story is perfect and the new characters introduced really give this film some extra depth this is without a doubt my favorite part of the trilogy and my very favourite fantasy film of all time
Oct 2 2009,positive,awesomewatch it thousand times
Oct 2 2009,positive,part 2 of the triligy and the movie is good but the book as so much more and so much better but other than that the movie is a must see if you ask me
Oct 2 2009,positive,this one ventured from the books more than the others but what it produced was a fantastic movie gollum set motion capture forward to heights that would set a standard for films to follow that decade
Oct 2 2009,positive,one of the best movies ever made
Oct 2 2009,negative,10 for effects read the book again to wash your brain from soap
Oct 1 2009,positive,i loved these movies
Oct 1 2009,positive,understand a bit more  hopefully by the end of the third film i will have it sussed
Sep 30 2009,positive,as with all trilogies the 2nd is the best
Sep 30 2009,positive,this trilogy was brillliant i will love it forever
Sep 29 2009,positive,on the contrary to many other reviewers i do not believe that two towers lost anything great that fellowship had  the cast is expanded to new characters following the book so many people have to readjust to the new characters  the mix of new and old cast works just as harmoniously as it did in fellowship  for those who need action two towers definitely has more of it and the battle of helms deep is better than how i imagined when i read the books  the extended edition of the film adds much to the story which i believe should not have been left out  should have won more awards than it did but hey still one of the best
Sep 29 2009,positive,in my opinion the best of the trilogy although they are all astoundingly awesome the two towers dominates the screen with all the goodness from the fellowship of the ring as well as even more mindboggling special effects and what is quite possibly the greatest battle sequence ever filmed the battle of helms deep that occupys much of the last hour or so of the movie
Sep 29 2009,positive,playing the middle part in the trilogy is very difficult but it is done very well in this movie
Sep 29 2009,positive,what more can i say
Sep 28 2009,negative,love the book but not really keen on the movies
Sep 28 2009,positive,awesome is all i can say
Sep 27 2009,positive,i love the visual effects
Sep 26 2009,positive,i regard the two towers almost as highly as i do the fellowship of the ring the story is still fantastic and brings the novel to the screen perfectly the acting is solid and the special effects are incredible its run time is a bit too long for my liking but thats just about the only bad thing about it every scene with gollum is an utter spectacle to watch as the character has an unbelievable amount of depth although it doesnt get too boring or confusing
Sep 25 2009,positive,can this movie be anymore brillant than it is now    peter jackson is a genius
Sep 25 2009,positive,i felt a little bit of the heart of the first film was replaced with two hours of epic battles still a wonderful film and a necessary part of the bigger masterpiece that is the lotr trilogy
Sep 25 2009,positive,one of the best fantasy films ever to grace the big screen
Sep 25 2009,positive,the second is also the same as the first
Sep 25 2009,positive,part of one of the best trilogies ever madecasting was done perfectlystar studded and they all play their roles perfectlyjust get past all the walking scenes and this is a perfect movie
Sep 25 2009,positive,you really need to see the whole trilogy to rate this i give it five stars bc  all three movies together are perfect if this is the only one you watch you may feel disappointed
Sep 25 2009,positive,didnt like it as much as fellowship
Sep 24 2009,positive,visual it is a masterpiece you have to love this kind of movies or hate them
Sep 23 2009,positive,a member of the greatest fantasy series ever made is now a member of the greatest fantasy franchise of all time i would write more but that just about says it all
Sep 23 2009,positive,brilliant though it is the most emotionally draining film out apart from the follow up you have to simply decide not to do anything the day you watch it for it wants to suck you dry brilliant movie
Sep 23 2009,neutral,this movie is bleh and it picks up right where the first movie left off this movie has very little good moments as well as the same problems that the first lord of the rings movie had dont watch this movie its plot is too thin to make u care about it and frodo is too much of a pussy in this movie 510
Sep 22 2009,positive,huge fan of the series
Sep 21 2009,positive,not as good as others but still good
Sep 21 2009,positive,best trilogy ever the seige of helms deep is brilliant gollum is one of the best animated characters ive seen
Sep 21 2009,positive,trying to write review for this film is like trying to define the word love there are countless others who have done far better a job than you ever could and at the same time the idea of writing about such a thing is beyond your imagination because how could you ever hope to shed any more light on the subject i would try but with only one word perfection the lord of the rings the two towers is unequivocally perfect
Sep 20 2009,positive,eh the filler movie not a huge fan
Sep 20 2009,positive,i loved the fellowship of the ring and the return of the king equally as well as the two towers
Sep 19 2009,positive,the best sequel ive ever seen this movie has all the battle scence romance comedy and adventure all mashed together into another masterpiece
Sep 19 2009,positive,i love every lotr moviesthey are amazingly well done
Sep 19 2009,positive,my precious lol that is all i have to say
Sep 19 2009,positive,love the orc wargreat visual effect

Sep 18 2009,positive,make sure you watch the extended edition
Sep 17 2009,positive,probably my least favorite of the trilogy but that doesnt mean i cant still love it gollum is a excellent addition to the cast and the buildup to the final battles at the end are well worth the wait
Sep 17 2009,positive,empire strikes back get your coat and leave
Sep 15 2009,positive,a great sequel to a great movie story is great the music is great a really good cast i just love it what else can i say
Sep 15 2009,positive,another series i loved not enough to learn to speak in elf but you get the picture fantastic action fantasy they really did the books justice
Sep 14 2009,positive,its lotr and orlando as legolas  what else can you ask for
Sep 14 2009,positive,one liner    peter jackson does brilliantly in making the second book come to life
Sep 14 2009,positive,yes definately brilliant
Sep 13 2009,positive,the second in a unforgettable trilogy
Sep 13 2009,positive,it was meh i like fantasy films and i thought i would be more into it but alas i wasnt 
Sep 13 2009,positive,you need to watch the first and last film of this trilogy before and after watching this one if you know how to create a 3hour  plus taht starts and end at the middle of the entire story but doing it with poise which this film did then you are a good director kudos to peter jackson
Sep 13 2009,positive,much better and longer than the first filmmore fight secenes more dead orcsahh you get the picture
Sep 12 2009,negative,i hate lord of the rings
Sep 12 2009,positive,an earthshattering film the cgi was monumental it still looks impressive by todays standards the acting and writting was top notch elijah wood improved his performance and made it even better it was fabulous the cast was perfect and in terms of just being plain epic it doesnt get any better than this i didnt even notice that this movie clocked in 3 hours
Sep 12 2009,positive,anotjer great peter jackson film  good lead up to the third movie
Sep 12 2009,positive,some flix so gala cant be made again

Sep 7 2009,positive,good fights and battles gollum is brilliant but again whiney frodo is annoying
Sep 6 2009,positive,all of the lord of the rings are great
Sep 6 2009,positive,one of the only sequels that was every bit as good as the original it was exactly what a sequel should be  it continued the story added an amazing new character golum and had an even more impressive fight at the end of the movie than the first one yet it wasnt about topping the first movie it was about continuing the story and thats where the two towers really just destroys virtually every other part ii movie thats out there  i would even go so far as to say it is the best sequel ever yes even better than godfather ii or empire strikes back
Sep 6 2009,positive,this was the special extended edition dazzling visuals and a good story a sequel that gets better and not worse like some trilogies
Sep 6 2009,positive,an excellent film and adaptation of the books overall with fellowship and return of the king    one of the best films of all time

Sep 2 2009,positive,amazingggg lord of the rings are the best films ever the end samwise gamgee 3
Sep 2 2009,positive,that was awesome fantasy storyline
Sep 1 2009,positive,this is more like it from an enjoyment perspective as the journey to deliver the ring to the fires of mount doom starts to heat upas frodo has split from the pack to make it to his destination on his own whilst the legolas aragorn etc fight off sarumans forces whilst gollum obstructs frodos path as he also has a desire to have the ringmuch better movie than the previous ones with better battles and overly just more exciting

Aug 31 2009,positive,got kind of boring what with all the walking 3rd film was the bests
Aug 31 2009,positive,might be my favorite of the 3
Aug 31 2009,positive,epic film its a masterpiece in the genre of fantasy
Aug 30 2009,negative,possibly the best of the three as it contains the most action but is still shallow and transitional and generally just not very good
Aug 30 2009,positive,amazing incredible breathtaking
Aug 30 2009,positive,more excellence in this film much like that provided in the first film  again the casting is superb and all characters are well portrayed by their respective actors  the battle scenes are more epic in nature and very well done  the score is still awesome  the story in this film is not as close to the novel as the first film but i find this to be alright as it does add more drama to different plot threads that may have been lacking in the novel  again this movie is quite excellent in my opinion
Aug 30 2009,positive,before ya watch this watch the first ones first so u can get the story line its a good movie overall
Aug 30 2009,positive,was fortunate to see this film on the big screen again last night  this time with a live orchestra performing the score at wolf trap the music is so powerful  majestic in this 2nd part of the trilogy anyway but live it was magical
Aug 30 2009,positive,they keep getting better
Aug 30 2009,positive,the second movie in peter jacksons epic that wrote him into the movie directors hall of fame it is one of the best movies ever made

Aug 24 2009,positive,why this didnt win best picture for 2003  is unknown
Aug 24 2009,positive,still good as the others but kind of got bored for about a whole of five minutes
Aug 23 2009,positive,the follow up to fellowship raises the stakes of the narrative with epic battle sequences and rising action  the development of the characters ripens and we become more emotionally vested in them  another example of why this is one of the best fantasy films of all time
Aug 23 2009,positive,this chapter of the lord of the rings saga is my favorite get a big screen tv and turn the volume up to the point that your house shakes because this movie was designed to be a complete experience
Aug 23 2009,positive,a visual masterpiece of a favorite authors work
Aug 23 2009,positive,whoop whoopgo gandalf  a triumphant achievement in filmmakingbut the books are better
Aug 23 2009,positive,the best of the lotr films in my opinion great battle scene at helms deep makes it worth it
Aug 22 2009,positive,better than the first movie which is saying something a differant kind of beast compared to the first movie with a much darker tone and differant pathways for our fellowship that culminates into what can only be described as a battle the swipes away all epic battles that came before it on celuloidthe final battle of helms deep is a feast for the sences loudbloody and raw and did i mention a lil guy named gollum cinema at its finesta few hours away from the real world that was worth takingover and over again
Aug 22 2009,positive,1010    rarely does a sequel top the original in all aspects of film peter jackson once again outdoes himself the two towers presents more action something that the predecessor the fellowship of the ring occasionally lacked this is the best film in the trilogy
Aug 21 2009,positive,love the fight and legolas
Aug 21 2009,positive,battle for the helms deep the good forces join hands and are one step closer in the destruction of evil
Aug 21 2009,positive,the weakest of the trilogy in my opinion this is still a grand epic piece of cinema and the new additions to the cast do some good work
Aug 21 2009,positive,excellent  the story is epic  the look and feel is exactly what a fantasy movie should be  some great battles also  not to mention the special effects
Aug 21 2009,positive,watched many times while exercising  lots of action
Aug 21 2009,positive,watched many times while exercising  lots of action
Aug 21 2009,positive,its a phenomenal film  but it cant help but feel like a leadup to return of the king you know where they introduce a ton of new characters that might have small parts in this one but big parts in the finale it just doesnt have as much of a wow factor as the other two having said that the battle of helms deep is still one of the greatest battles in the trilogy also the ents messing up isengard is pretty freakin sweet
Aug 21 2009,positive,a few sloggy spots aside the two towers is an outstanding effort that maintains the integrity and purpose that distinguished the fellowship of the ring
Aug 20 2009,positive,want my world like that
Aug 20 2009,positive,the untold story of trees that could talk the movie is 3 hours because the trees talk so sssslllllooooo
Aug 19 2009,positive,finally my favorite movie 
Aug 18 2009,negative,worst of the three movies imo but all right
Aug 18 2009,positive,i wish i could just judge the whole trilogy on its own  i thought lotr was unfilmable  i have a ton of nits but i cant argue that jackson delivered something pretty special here
Aug 18 2009,positive,amazing film when movies were created it was for this purpose
Aug 18 2009,positive,i liked it the epic war sequences were beautiful and the actors are all very good its better than the first so good for that but this series just doesnt appeal to me as much but from a fan stand point its amazing thumbs up
Aug 17 2009,positive,it was okay not very exciting like the 3rd one better
Aug 17 2009,positive,the continuation of the greatest cinematic masterpiece of our time     sure it may be the weakest in the series due to its lack of beginning and end but the very first scene arguably the best opening scene of all three films and the action definitely builds and provides a natural crescendo from the first film into the third
Aug 17 2009,negative,omg one of the most boring films ever
Aug 17 2009,positive,this topped the first one the cast which already set a high bar in fellowship perform even better i especially enjoy watching elijah woods frodo as he struggles againt the rings corruption andy serkis is an absolute delight as gollum and orlando bloom and john rhysdavies have incredible chemistry sams emotionally charged the tales that really mattered speech has become my favorite quote of the entire trilogy and the battle of helms deep leaves me breathless ever time
Aug 17 2009,positive,i loved the books and now the movies
Aug 17 2009,positive,the best of the best pt tata
Aug 16 2009,positive,the 2nd installment of the lord of the ringsand does not disappoint  in fact does more than the first  more intense battle scenes funnier dialogue and goes way beyond with the special effects  this movie also has one of the best opening sequences i have ever seen in movie  on top of all this introducing new characters and creatures adds so much more to this movie while still maintaining the greatness that was the fellowship of the ringits beyond belief  peter jackson has done one hell of a job and if your fan of fantasy you will love the hell out of lord of the rings
Aug 16 2009,positive,amazing cast  effects very good adapted screenplay people who work at weta workshop are crazy sauce excellent
Aug 16 2009,positive,lord of the rings the two towers is the squeal to the first of the three lord of the rings movies  it has outstanding special effects which are bought together with a excellent level of performance delivered by the dedicated actors of this movie the actors performance is great and even if you are not a fan i would suggest checking this movie out on the acting grounds alone  the only let down of the movie is long drawn out conversations that seem to deviate from the storyline but it still remains a solid movie despite this fact
Aug 16 2009,positive,love the scene where eomer comes back to king theoden
Aug 15 2009,positive,the books were better if slower
Aug 15 2009,positive,an improvement upon the first film showing the determination through all odds of a fractured fellowship against all forces of evil and the introduction of some truly brilliant characters two towers is a masterpiece and a go to guide for epics to come
Aug 15 2009,positive,a grand epic just as stunning as the first film in the series this one is more slow paced and more of a character film but it still manages to be extremely powerful and quite emotional  ian mckellen still deserves an oscar for his portrayal of gandalf and viggo mortensen gives a brilliant performance as well the technical aspects of the film are astounding and the battle sequences are like none other ive ever seen another brilliant classic from peter jackson
Aug 15 2009,positive,i love the lord of the rings movies
Aug 15 2009,positive,what can i say fantastic
Aug 15 2009,positive,great film the fight scene last over 30 minutes it was brilliant best movie out of the three
Aug 15 2009,positive,boromir holding the ring after frodo has lost it it is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing such a little thing
Aug 14 2009,positive,lord of the rings is the best movie ever  its long but really good
Aug 14 2009,positive,agen a very good lord of de rings film 
Aug 13 2009,positive,i am a sucker for number 2s
Aug 13 2009,positive,part 2 in the second best trilogy of all time the first being the original star wars trilogy  the effects are outstanding and peter jackson is an epic story teller  the infamous battle of helms deep is breathtaking and a neoclassic moment in film history
Aug 13 2009,positive,all of them are great movies
Aug 13 2009,positive,fantastic the movie is on a whole other level
Aug 13 2009,positive,great movie lots of action good story
Aug 13 2009,positive,a major step forward for the middle earth saga peter jackson can sure make a movie that is more in depth unlike the original this one is exciting from begining to end it became more then just frodo it had a second story to it that became one of the most epic yet    the story still follows frodo of course elijah wood this time improves his acting and i can actually watch him without having to worry he and samwise gamgeeyes thats his name are on their way to mordor in the meantime in rohan a king is under the influence of the dark lord and his family as well as his kindom has become ghosts its up to the three heroes aragorn legolas and gimli to save someone yet agian despite chasing two fellow hobbits guess they didnt matter but they cant do it alone they must need the white gandalf apparently he didnt die and is now back stronger then ever ian mckellen once agian flourishes but with whiter hair    the film focuses on two stories the old king who listens to a homeless guy yes a homeless man who has bad odor and doesnt seem to wash his hair not to forget he has a crush on a young gal who doesnt show a hair of interest in him the other story would be frodo and his bff trying to destroy the ring but they keep going around in circles so they get help from gollum of course the ingrate that tried to steal the ring yet they need him since he knows the way so might as well suck it up samwise gamgee isnt that his job to be wise i guess not because he focuses to much on how to feed frodo then to protect him gollum actually saves frodo on more then one occasion  i liked how jackson told two stories at the same time while playing splitscreen he keeps it in balance and it doesnt lose track    the acting has always been superb and in this latest installment it hasnt changed this film features great cinematography and stunning visuals that doesnt bore you it actually makes worth its 3 hours which is hard for any filmmaker to do a definant improvement from the original    a near masterpiece that is drivened by soulful characters that features some of the best looks in film history its dazzling of course but it tells a great story that always amazes me i can admit that i am more frodo friendly a must see film that deserves its oscars
Aug 12 2009,positive,best trilogy ever by far
Aug 12 2009,positive,i like this movie because it is very consistent throughout the movie and although it doesnt end the story there is a definite end to this segment of the story check it out if you havent already
Aug 11 2009,positive,its a good film nothing to really think about but still good
Aug 11 2009,positive,my personal favorite out of the three
Aug 11 2009,positive,absolutley amazing
Aug 11 2009,negative,i hated it its borin
Aug 11 2009,positive,i thought this was the best of the threei was so impressed and thought it was an amazing film

Aug 10 2009,positive,i love this series  the battle for helms deep was amazing in the theater
Aug 10 2009,positive,i liked this movie but the third one is better
Aug 9 2009,positive,there are many beautiful landscapes here middleearth and its inhabitants look comepletly authentic the story splits up into 3 interesting storylines and creates a very rich and stimulating experience i love the storyline involving the walking tress who are very well visualized and whose voices sound incredibly majestic feels a little longish though once again the action sequences dont sit too well with me they feel kinda sluggish but they are incredibly detailed with hundreds of soldiers battling at the same time and i cant comepletaly comprehend the lore and expanding narrative of the saga i feel like im cramming for a test
Aug 9 2009,positive,this is my favorite of the trilogy battle at helms deep
Aug 9 2009,positive,anyone who dislikes lotr is an idiot
Aug 9 2009,positive,a classic piece of phantasy fitted as screenplay the numerous intriguing subplots will get any viewer through this threehour specialfx farrago of adventure suspense war distant memories love  friendship
Aug 9 2009,positive,i love this one too
Aug 9 2009,positive,weakest of the three but still a great movie
Aug 8 2009,positive,probably my least favorite theatrical version of the 3 films but the extended version bumps it up there with the other 2 movies in the trilogy i cant get tired of watching these films year after year
Aug 8 2009,positive,crazy wow  this series shows how each installment actually gets better  loved this film when i first saw it on christmas day 2002 love it now
Aug 8 2009,positive,its great all of them
Aug 8 2009,positive,as part of the novel trilogy part 2 may of been the weak section in the movies it may be the best of the 3  the diversity of the subplots is what gives it that extra boost and oddly enough the frodo quest is the weakest of the group      the ranger the elf and the dwarf search for merry and pippin who have been captured by orcs and in the process they also find the wizard gandalf who helps them release the spell put on the king of rohan and points them in the direction of the real culprit the white wizard saruman      what was once the weak point of the novel turns into a strong point of the movie the introduction of the ents  a tree that becomes lifelike can seem pretty comic like if put in lesser qualified hands but in jackson the ents not only provide a seamless transition but are one of the highlights in the whole series
Aug 8 2009,positive,loved it breathtakig
Aug 8 2009,positive,my favorite one out of the three
Aug 7 2009,positive,the extended version hits all the right spots and explains alot the theatrical didnt a must see
Aug 7 2009,positive,helms deep greatest battle of all time
Aug 6 2009,positive,great film the least of the series but still a very good film has lots of action with a good story
Aug 6 2009,positive,trumps the first with intense action and well done character moments the extended version is even better
Aug 6 2009,positive,dunno if its the best of the trilogy but i certainly prefer the battles in this one if we could somehow make a cross between fellowship and two towers then itd be an incredible movie  also remembered theres the osgiliath part which could have been perfectly left out not the extended scene featuring boromir and faramir mind you which was great but the frodosam part particularly since its not in the book
Aug 6 2009,positive,beautiful  moveand   nice  history
Aug 6 2009,positive,great movie decent adaptation amazing visuals i think i liked the extra on this film more than i like to rewatch the movie

Aug 2 2009,neutral,witch one is this one again      to long of films
Aug 2 2009,positive,yet again lotr used dazzeling graphics that make the movie more exciting and fun to watch
Aug 2 2009,positive,best one of them all

Aug 1 2009,positive,my favorite of the three movies it is a masterpiece visual effects are outstanding love this movie it makes my top ten if all time
Aug 1 2009,positive,excellent open ended storyline what would be expected with the middle film great special fx
Aug 1 2009,positive,1 of my most favourite movies my favourite part is the battle of helms deep
Jul 31 2009,positive,loved that trilogy everything is well done  you can see how passionate the irector is about everything hes filming a great piece of cinema
Jul 31 2009,positive,peter jackson left the entire world on a cliffhanger when he finished the fellowship of the ring after having done such an impressive job with the first film and then having the balls to stay true to the source by finishing as he did he was almost setting himself up to fail giving himself a task even greater than the original undertaking a sequel not just any sequel a sequel to film being touted as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made and himself being declared a genius this sort of hype is almost impossible to live up to almost    taking up where its predecessor left off the two towers follows aragorn gimli and legolas as they chase down a troop of urukhai frodo and sam as they journey further towards mordor and merry and pippin as they well get into lots of trouble    the story is much more divided in comparison to the first of the series with a fellowship of nine journeying together rather than three different groups and their various shenanigans this is the first challenge to overcome for filmmaker peter jackson how to tell all these stories in under four hours not only that but how to allot time to the different storylines without 1 making it boring and 2 losing focus on the main story which just happens to be the more boring aspect of the source material frodo and sams trek towards mordor after all how inventive can one director be with half the story taking up by two diminutive figures walking towards a place which they dont actually reach by the time the films finishes    its almost as if jackson hasnt noticed these issues as the second film is just as fulfilling and storydriven as the first without sacrificing any major plot points or basically getting rid of anything that would cause a fan outcry yes technically the ents do show up to help at the battle of helms deep and no we dont get to see merry and pippin in treebeards house or talking to quickbeam but in the end peter jackson has conquered these seemingly mammoth tasks with ease this is a reflection on jacksons instinct for pace as the extended edition shows that these timeconsuming though unnecessary scenes were in fact filmed but were left on the editting floor jacksons fearlessness with the source material yet mindfullness of it as well means that the story is left completely intact enough to appease any fan jackson has also made room for the lighter moments as well revelling in the joy of discovery when merry and pippin first encounter treebeard and having time for jokes between the doubleact which just keeps getting better of legolas and gimli jackson doesnt forget about his characters either keeping the film from feeling hollow by introducing the beautiful miranda otto as nevertobe love interest eowyn and the abandonedbyhiscountry eomer as well as extending his existing characters in merry and pippin who only get more endearing frodo and sam whose seemingly unflappable relationship is beginning to show some strain and even though gandalfs character goes under a major revamp hes still the same enigmatic mentor as before albeit slightly more badass its this attention to detail which makes peter jacksons work so watchable all the way through the crazy runtime    shores score is as strong as ever this time bringing the beautiful theme of the world of men to the fore shores understanding of motif and mood is pivotal here even more so than fellowship as the story isnt as driving as its predecessor because of this shores score is able to ferry us through the slower moments and throughout the entire film    the performances here are just as textured as they were in the first film not only that but the sequel factor means that actors are able to loosen up a little more in particular in the case of orlando blooms legolas and john rhysdavies gimli the two of them have more fun than it should be possible to have in an epic of this size and they pull it off without ever feeling camp or not taking it seriously enough ian mckellens gandalf is still the standout of the series but its great to see the rest of the cast becoming more and more involved in their characters viggo mortensens aragorn is one of the performances which shows a lot of progression his presence has more gravitas in this one and his character is more layered than the original more difficult to read elijah wood has much less to do in this film leaving him to keep mostly the same expression on his face for most of the film while this may be true to story it does occassionally make you wish that he had something else to do than walk around some rocks for a while sean astins sam is similarly beleagured and while their parts of the film are integral to the story you sometimes wish that wed move back to the interesting parts a little sooner bernard hill makes a great addition to the cast as theoden as well as his onscreen daughter eowyn played with fragile strength by miranda otto brad dourifs grima wormtongue is fantastic a slimy manipulative groveller who snivells perfectly through every scene hes in    another of towers achievements lies in another of its new characters gollum gollum is a completely cg creation performed by andy serkis with groundbreaking technology enabling serkis to interact with the actual actors and thus makes the performances all the more real this innovation makes for incredible viewing as one of the more unfilmmable sections of tolkiens work is brought to life onscreen serkis performance is largely discounted in terms of acting accolades but its incredible to see his work here set the benchmark for motion capture    but all these technical factors fade into the background at the battle of helms deep a battle scene so epic that it drowns out everything that comes before it ten thousand urukhai facing off against rohans much depleted forces is so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to spot any kind of flaws in the rest of the film jackson seamlessly blend cg with fantastic costume and makeup to create an entirely believeable all out war which lives up to the scenes detailed in the book and revells in the little moments like legolas riding a shield down some stairs or a rousing speech from king to king jacksons sense of pace throughout the battle is fantastic moving from the entmoot to sam and frodo without ever losing momentum and the coupdegrace of gandalfs arrival is as breathtaking a moment as the series brings in any of its three films    while this may be the weaker cinematically of the three films the fact that im still giving it five stars shows you just how high the bar is set for this series the fact is that despite lacking the grandeur of the third and the sense of wonder and scariness of the first its still a better film than 90 of the blockbusters hollywood vomits up on regular basis truly incredible filmmaking    defining scene  the battle at helms deep of course    quotes  stupid fat hobbit    whats happening out there  shall i describe it to you or would you like me to find you a box    theyre taking the hobbits to isengard
Jul 31 2009,positive,great movieseen it many timesstill its the best movie ever made till date
Jul 31 2009,positive,peter jackson takes the director chair once again on this sequel to the fellowship of the ring did he captivated audience worldwide again yes    packed with superior cgi greater battles and memorable dialogues the two towers not only makes you feel that the nearly 3 hours you just spend sitting down and watching greatness werent enough but makes the audience feel excited for the final part of the epic trilogy based on jrr tolkiens series of books    better than the fellowship of the ring and arguably the return of the king mainly because of peter jacksons fantastic vision the two towers easily ranks as one of the best movies of 00s
Jul 30 2009,positive,as thrilling and richly drawn as it is there is an obvious awkwardness in the dialogue and direction the production values are naturally brilliant and carry the film along with jrr tolkiens imaginative and deeplyconstructed story
Jul 30 2009,positive,9610 the best of the 3 still you want more
Jul 30 2009,positive,luv this trilogy film

Jul 24 2009,positive,my favorite of the trilogy great war scenes
Jul 24 2009,positive,the best of the trilogy in my opinion the siege at the end is one of the best moments in cinema history and i love the trees as well a real mile stone in fantasy adventure films that i cant ever see being beaten
Jul 24 2009,positive,dark well executed and is a brilliant enough standalone film even by itself the second movie deserves my five stars and is by far my favourite among the trilogy of an equally brilliant franchise thumbs up all four of them
Jul 23 2009,positive,continuing the saga  warning watch this film in its entire special edition version  the theatrical cut is disjointed and does tremendous disservice to the narrative
Jul 23 2009,positive,it was very good cgi was amazing story was well made and loved most of the characters it was very good but i thought of it more as a filler movie but i still enjoyed it
Jul 23 2009,neutral,just the filler movie in between the two good ones
Jul 22 2009,positive,good it was the best one in the series
Jul 22 2009,positive,good film if you can keep up with who is who
Jul 21 2009,positive,extended version is much more in depth with characters my least favorite of the three films but still great the creation of gollum is spectacular
Jul 20 2009,positive,another great installment of the trilogy but i did think the ents went on for ever  way too sloooooooooooow and tedious but i guess it is the nature of those gnarlyass tree characters treebeard  i dig your wisdom dude but can you finish this little insight before the next millenium those scenes were interminable thxb2g for fast forward and scene scan
Jul 20 2009,positive,my least favourite of the three but still very good
Jul 20 2009,positive,this is how its meant to be done
Jul 20 2009,positive,this film is truly flawless and beautifully continues the lord of the rings series this film is a massive improvement from the first film the scenes are much more interesting and they move at a perfect speed and give enough time for the viewer to understand the plot this film introduces new characters which have great depth the battle scenes are truly epic this film in my opinion is far better then the first one in terms of action and entertainment this film also has strong emotion a true epic and classic
Jul 19 2009,positive,my favorite movie of the lord of the rings trilogy
Jul 19 2009,positive,one of the greatest action films ever
Jul 19 2009,positive,better than the last one not as good as the first
Jul 18 2009,positive,by far one of the most epic fight scenes of all time
Jul 18 2009,positive,the reason i dont give this one full points is the scene where legolas is surfinâdown a stairway on a shield a totally ridicolus idea from mr jackson
Jul 18 2009,positive,the fellowship of the ring was an amazing achievement a fantasy epic and one of the most amazing movies of our time this movie is no different the lord of the rings the two towers is a fantastic film and doesnt disappoint at all     this movie picks up right where the the last film left off so it springs right into action everything is just as good in this movie as it was in the original with some additional characters this movie remains entertaining to the final credit     this movie looks like it was an effort to make which it was and this isnt a bad thing because the movie ended up excellent the battle of helms deep looks to me like one of the most enduring difficult and amazing scenes ever to be produced in cinema i heard it took months to shoot so you really have to appreciate this film and all its hard work     howard shore has done a good job on all of the lotr movies and the two towers has a great soundtrack the music keeps us watching and this film is much better with it then without it     plot wise we see a build up of emotion from many characters for instance frodo starts to feel more and more of the burden of the ring and legolas and gimli are starting to build as friends this in my opinion is just like the book and i love how these three films stay true to the novel     this film is excellent though out of my opinion this is the worst in the series that hardly means its not fantastic its a great film in every sense of the word a fantasy masterpiece
Jul 18 2009,positive,this movie is pretty much flawless and an excellent followup to its prequel fellowship of the ring the movie is genuine in its own way and gives the lotr feeling a boost in plot and story it gets much more intense and theres good character development  one thing about this movie that will catch anyones eye is the amazing special effects there phenomenal for 2002 id say this film is the best of its trilogy and the trilogy is amazing so watch it and be amazed

Jul 13 2009,positive,im a fan of the trilogy also of orlando bloom
Jul 13 2009,positive,i really like the battle scenes
Jul 12 2009,neutral,just like the first i found this one very boring and dull  a few more action scenes had me glancing up from facebook now and then but overall very boring
Jul 12 2009,positive,it was aweome but the other two are betteer
Jul 12 2009,positive,great movie to watchd
Jul 12 2009,negative,liked this less than the 1st  even though i had read the books i couldnt tell who was who  i thought the 1st one was dark to watch  well this was even worse  i couldnt wait for it to end
Jul 11 2009,positive,lord of the rings is a work of true genius
Jul 11 2009,positive,when i read the book i went right to the battle at helms deep great movie
Jul 11 2009,positive,its awesome buy it
Jul 11 2009,positive,the bridging book builds the mood and brings in the big guns and leaves us salivating for what awaits us next with return of the king
Jul 11 2009,positive,too much of the same thing for me still a great movie though
Jul 11 2009,positive,i liked it almost as equally as the first it was pretty fantastic
Jul 11 2009,positive,not my favorite of the trilogy
Jul 10 2009,positive,good but very long movie
Jul 10 2009,positive,the cgi is better but the story doesnt progress very much good character development though i think the highlight of the movie is easily the introduction of gollumsmeagol
Jul 10 2009,positive,the weakest of the trilogy since there is occasional cheesy dialogue but this is mostly compensated for by the multistranded plot and the fact that gollum a schizophrenic cgi monster filled with character and given great voice acting by andy serkis gets the most screen time in this one
Jul 10 2009,positive,my personal favorite of the trilogy
Jul 10 2009,positive,a good movie you ought to watch it
Jul 9 2009,positive,all that is gold does not glitter  not all those who wander are lost  the old that is strong does not wither  deep roots are not reached by frost  from the ashes a fire shall be woken  a light from the shadows shall spring  renewed shall be blade that was broken  the crownless again shall be king        peter jackson did a great job in 2nd time around if youre looking for a cinematic masterpiece look no further these entire trilogy is by far the greatest movie i have ever seen legolas is the best character of bloom my favorite scene was in the photo above  when legolas ride in the horse   this film is very memorable celebrating christmas eve in the hospital because of this film
Jul 9 2009,positive,where the first film bored me slightly this one expands on it with some exciting action sequences and a highly engaging plot as the fellowship has dispanded the trip to mordor becomes a treacherous trail brilliant film and in my opinion the best of the trilogy
Jul 9 2009,positive,gollum we wants it we needs it must have the precious they stole it from us sneaky little hobbitses wicked tricksy false   smeagol no not master   gollum yes precious false they will cheat you hurt you lie   smeagol master is our friend   gollum you dont have any friends nobody likes you   smeagol im not listening im not listening   gollum youre a liar and a thief   smeagol no   gollum murderer   smeagol go away   gollum go away   gollum laughs as smeagol begins crying   smeagol i hate you i hate you   gollum where would you be without me gollum gollum i saved us it was me we survived because of me   smeagol stops crying not anymore   gollum what did you say   smeagol master looks after us now we dont need you anymore   gollum what   smeagol leave now and never come back   gollum no   smeagol leave now and never come back   gollum screams in frustration   smeagol leave now and never come back   gollum is silent   smeagol looks around we told him to go away and away he goes precious gone gone gone smeagol is free     lord of the rings the two towers al igual que la primera son obras de arte a pesar de que le puse un 9 en vez de el máximo puntaje no le quita ese reconocimiento lo único que le tengo que criticar es el hecho de que luego de the fellowship of the ring que es una película tan llena de magia y descubrimiento ya que es el comienzo de todo viene esta que es totalmente distinta más oscura seria y casi todo en un mismo ambiente no es que tenga nada de malo pero supongo que la primera me preparó para algo que ésta no me entregó pero eso no le quita el hecho que en su propio merito sea increíble
Jul 9 2009,neutral,only like it cause orlando bloom is in it 
Jul 8 2009,positive,watched it but didnt really watch
Jul 8 2009,positive,awesome film one of the best sequels of all time too

Jul 5 2009,positive,one of my favorite movies
Jul 5 2009,positive,jackson delivers again with greater cinematic intensity  andy serkis as gollum shall be revered as one of the best motion capture performances ever the ensemble cast delivers once again while howard shore continues with a great original score  the battle scenes in particular have been beefed up from the first and it must be said that the action and plot development do seam cohesivley to create a breathtaking and mindblowing experience in terms of depth and scope    best film of 2002 yes   my only disapointment from the film is that of the three it won the least amount of awards
Jul 5 2009,positive,long but good fim prefer return of the king

Jul 3 2009,positive,i love this movie absolutely superb 
Jul 3 2009,positive,great epic battle sequences and just like the other two didnt mind that it was 3 hours long
Jul 3 2009,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers continues the saga of the quest of the fellowship of the ring to destroy the one ring this chapter sees them scattered and the movie focuses on the exploits of the people of rohan at the battle of the hornburg peter jackson may have focused more on the fight sequences and added the coming of the elves for dramatic purposes but all in all he captures the struggle of the impossible fight middle earth was facing to overcome such a relentless movie absolutely stunningthe greatest fantasy of all time
Jul 3 2009,negative,so bad even for this shit series
Jul 3 2009,positive,a case of the whole being better than the sum of its parts    watch on its ownpointless    with its friendsindestructable
Jul 2 2009,positive,all of these are so much more interesting than the books and surprisingly accurate like to the word accurate
Jul 2 2009,positive,all the lotr movies were beautifully crafted they take you away to a world of might magic legend and adventure and does not let go of your imagination long after the movie is over  i enjoyed 2 more than i enjoyed the first one  simply stunning cinema that is if you enjoy a reality escape from time to time  i do
Jul 2 2009,positive,a story about the power of friendship
Jul 2 2009,positive,expectations of reality  depression
Jul 2 2009,positive,the battle at helms deep alone is worth the whole movie awesome cgi mixed with practical effects great performances by the entire cast a very underrated movie
Jul 2 2009,negative,this was endless i thought i was going to die
Jul 1 2009,positive,justice always win
Jul 1 2009,positive,the battle at helms deep is probably one of my favorite battle scenes great movie
Jul 1 2009,positive,oh jeez you have no idea how this movie reminds me og my freshmen english teacher
Jul 1 2009,positive,andy serkis is unbelievable christopher lee is a great saruman that voice but imho doesnt get nerarly enough to do old wormtongue is suitably unpleasant but what the hell is the deal with faramir i mean no disrespect to david wenham but he looks wrong and ok lets by all means cut extraneous material in the interests of running time but why did they have to start making shit up purlease theres a whole plot strand here that never happened sorry to be a sad pedant but there it is  it utterly changes the characterisation and everything honestly some people    treebeard rocked however    and shelob scuttled shudder wonderful
Jul 1 2009,negative,boring boring boring even more boring than the book
Jun 30 2009,positive,oddly enough this one was my favorite of the three for awhile i dont know if it still would be but i love it
Jun 30 2009,positive,solid middlepart of perhaps the greatest fantasy film of our time
Jun 30 2009,positive,not entirely faithful vide elves at helms deep hobbits in osgiliath but i do love the intercutting between events in books iii  iv and the trilogy is and always will be one of my best movies ever
Jun 30 2009,positive,action is great love the fight scenes one  the best movies ever

Jun 29 2009,neutral,watched the lord of the rings wasnt my movies
Jun 28 2009,positive,my least fav of the three but its still pretty sweet
Jun 28 2009,positive,peter jackson did not let us down as the sequel of lotr the fellowships of the ring is a masterpiece amazing cgi effects were applied and the new character smeagol although revolting in my opinion has definitely played its part well
Jun 28 2009,positive,favorite of the three original for some reason
Jun 28 2009,positive,the weaker of the three if i am totlay honest but still one of my all time favorites
Jun 28 2009,positive,its better than the other two
Jun 27 2009,positive,the weakest link in a strong trilogy of films the two towers sports some amazing acting and great action sequences
Jun 27 2009,positive,better than the first one but still overrated
Jun 27 2009,positive,i remember after 911 that people wanted the name to be called tlotr two towers  idiots
Jun 27 2009,positive,bigger better and more amazing than the fellowship of the rings
Jun 26 2009,positive,well i completed lord of the rings in the weirdest fashion possible i watched the last one the first one and finally the middle one much like the first one i enjoyed the movie but its annoying that it ends so unresolved of course since ive seen the third of the trilogy i knew what was going to happen this just filled in some details for me i am a little annoyed by movies like these that require you have a list of all the character names and definitions to random madeup words if you want to be completely aware of whats going on
Jun 26 2009,positive,peter jackson did a fantastic job interpreting this epic piece
Jun 26 2009,positive,one of the best movies i got
Jun 25 2009,negative,why oh why do we get this trash after the great movie that was fellowship what on earth or middleearth would possess peter jackson to abandon the source material in favor of wargriders and a ridiculous sidetrack to osgiliath just to get the faramir character to a point at which he should have been when he met frodo remove that crap and you could have had shelob in this movie where she belongs legolas what do you elfeyes see a bunch of elves marching into helms deep which never effing happened this movie is crap
Jun 25 2009,positive,my fav one in all of the trilogy but also my fav films ever
Jun 25 2009,positive,frodo baggins is the worst name of all time

Jun 23 2009,positive,the lord of the rings are possibly the best movies ever made    absolutely amazing from start to finnish    stunning with an excellent story    perfectly cast     if u have not seen these moves you are missing the amazing adventure unlike any other
Jun 23 2009,positive,just like the 1st this film is awesome here we see a new character who had little tiny scenes in the first film called gollum and he adds brilliance to the whole film lotr ttt was really epic and brilliant and i recommend everyone to see it if they dont want to miss out on a superb film
Jun 23 2009,positive,as with the first in this trilogy of films this is a wonderful adaptation of tolkiens masterful work of fantasy which does great justice to the original material    the casting is great the special effects are wonderful and i can think of nothing bad to say about this movie and the extended cut dvd is even better    a must see film that has earned all the praise it has received
Jun 22 2009,positive,it was alright it was my least favorite of the series the battle of helms deep was amazing though
Jun 22 2009,positive,you should see it even if you havent read the books  personally i got very soon bored but i acknowledge the importance of this trilogy
Jun 22 2009,positive,oh i loved this as well as the first 1 and the thid one as well
Jun 21 2009,positive,i adored the wars in it
Jun 21 2009,positive,keeping all the magic and charm of the first movie and adding in some spectacular action peter jacksons presentation of this phenomenal sequel takes the standards of filmmaking up another level and presents some scenes that will never be forgotten
Jun 21 2009,positive,ummmm the last march of the ents the battle for helms deep  awesome
Jun 21 2009,positive,the two towers is a worthy followup to the fellowship of the rings acting scenery makeup everything is topnotch and peter jackson has truly brought tolkiens masterpiece to life on the big screen whether you are a tolkien fan or simply enjoy an engrossing film experience the two towers is definitely worthy of your attention the battle of helms deep was my eldest sons favourite
Jun 21 2009,negative,hate it too long and too pointless
Jun 20 2009,positive,the best installment in my favorite movie trilogy of all time awesome fantasy battle scenes amazing special effects and very true to tolkeins novels
Jun 20 2009,positive,the second part in the epic trilogy originally written by tolkien and adapted by peter jackson is sensational   the two towers stars elijah wood ian mckellen viggo mortensen christopher lee liv tyler bernard hill andy serkis sean astin miranda otto and cate blanchett and they are all brilliant it also stars orlando bloom john rhysdavis dominic monaghan billy boyd karl urban and hugo weaving the cast are all fantastic  the film follows frodo wood and sam astin as they struggle to reach mordor and mount doom they find the help of gollum serkis  meanwhile aragorn mortensen legolas bloom and gimli rhysdavies search for merry monaghan and pippin boyd and instead encounter gandalf mckellen who has come back to life   saruman lee is becoming more powerful and securing his place next to sauron during the destruction of middle earth filled with fantastic effects a brilliant script and great acting  the two towers is incredible  overall  extremely enjoyable  96
Jun 20 2009,positive,the second movie of three the two towers continues to follow frodo and sam on their dangerous mission to mount doom to destroy the one ring
Jun 20 2009,negative,so painfully boring the other two are classics but this is a mess
Jun 19 2009,positive,my favorite of the 3
Jun 19 2009,positive,the only triology that gets better with each successive film
Jun 19 2009,positive,really long movie but unforgetable
Jun 19 2009,positive,the battle at helms deep really gives the a detailed action feel that the previous and proceeding lord of the rings film werent able to provide raaaar to the urak hais
Jun 19 2009,positive,this film everyone has to see its an epic movie of its time  just make sure you watch the first of the trilogy then this and then go on to lotr return of the king
Jun 19 2009,positive,the walk keeps going
Jun 18 2009,positive,another one in da rowamazing cinematographyloved watching it
Jun 18 2009,positive,amazing movie not to be seen in the middle of the night all alone  ive seen it i want to see it again and abolutely love it
Jun 18 2009,positive,if this story was remade 50 years from now there is no possible way it would be an improvement on this current triology it manages to portray the atmosphere and drama of the book perfectly it is perfection
Jun 17 2009,positive,now that i see it amongst the other lotr movies it suffers from classic middle movie syndrome  but it is still cool
Jun 17 2009,positive,this is lotr were talking aboutian mckellen is brilliantand then there oh god just about everyone else except orlando bloomhe sucks at acting
Jun 17 2009,positive,the 2nd installation of the novel great battle scenes
Jun 17 2009,positive,this was much better than the first andy serkis should have won an award for his performance or whatever computer genius that brought him to life also the introduction of the ents was a bonus i havent read the book but if the script is any where close then tolkien had some serious issues with women or at least whoever he based his dwarf on who is always drooling over human women and elf women saying some really disparaging remarks concerning dwarf women and with the amount of ents there were how the hell did they all lose their wives in this part we learn that orcs started off as elves and although elves can be killed apparently they can also live for ever or just a long long time however if you still look as old as hugo weaving and your hairline recedes what good is that
Jun 17 2009,positive,the weakest one out of the three it was like a waiting film until the the big finale
Jun 17 2009,positive,even better than the first one peter jackson and company continue their story without many flaws
Jun 16 2009,positive,the weakest of the trilogy still has its strengths

Jun 15 2009,positive,great movie   stayed very close to the book
Jun 15 2009,positive,easily my favorite of the film trilogy
Jun 15 2009,positive,this is my favorite out of the 3
Jun 15 2009,positive,best to keep ones enemys close
Jun 14 2009,positive,now this one is a better movie than the last
Jun 14 2009,positive,my favorite of the three but i have a soft spot for lastditchstand stories
Jun 14 2009,positive,the story about the battle of good and evil as well as the quest of frodo continues in this terrific sequel the best parts for me were the battle of the hornburg and the flooding of isengard
Jun 13 2009,negative,i hate alll the lord of the rings

Jun 13 2009,positive,the most interesting of the trilogy
Jun 12 2009,positive,decent installment but still good for all fans of the lotr trilogy
Jun 12 2009,positive,a great followup to a great beginning perhaps the best sequel ever made it continues tolkeins vison flawlessly portrays the now familiar characters as ones of increasing sympathy with greater weights on their shoulders it makes seeing the final film imperative which is the point of any sequel superb
Jun 12 2009,positive,suffers from middle child syndrome
Jun 12 2009,positive,filler but how sweet it is
Jun 12 2009,positive,bomb diggity one of the best battle scenes ever
Jun 11 2009,positive,this is what i mean
Jun 11 2009,neutral,its just toooooo loooong to watch
Jun 11 2009,positive,awesome just awesome
Jun 11 2009,positive,an intense actionpacked and truly fantastic second part which manages to maintain all the allure and integrity of the original the character of gollum is visually astounding and the acting on the whole is an incredible thing to behold at times it does suffer from being the middle chunk of a story but to its credit it fights off any worries you may have before they manage to crop up in your mind
Jun 11 2009,positive,aragorn so lovely
Jun 11 2009,positive,this is my favourite of the three
Jun 11 2009,positive,once again i love the adventure

Jun 6 2009,positive,meet me  middleearth
Jun 5 2009,positive,perhaps the most exciting of the three films it also has some very poignant turns by miranda otto and bernard hill
Jun 5 2009,positive,i love the lord of the rings i guess that makes me a nerd  lol
Jun 5 2009,positive,the lord of the rings movie trilogy in undoubtedly one of the largest causes of my passion for epic fantasy to pick the best movie of the 2000s decade i would have to cheat and choose the entire trilogy it is visually perfect shown in an epic scope still unsurpassed in cinema even by visually ambitious films like avatar the acting is wonderful with ian mckellen as a perfect gandalf and howard shores soundtrack captures the soul of this storys grand adventure brilliantly the lord of the rings trilogy is the best movie event of the 2000s and one of the absolute best of all time
Jun 5 2009,positive,awesome finale of the film adaptions
Jun 5 2009,positive,my favorite movie of all time
Jun 4 2009,positive,less cheesy than the first epic awesome
Jun 4 2009,positive,from what i saw before the disc crapped out on me really good
Jun 4 2009,positive,never missed any of it
Jun 4 2009,positive,at least they added in some humor to keep you interested
Jun 3 2009,positive,to tell u d truth it made me cry  no more cments
Jun 3 2009,positive,ok if you like that type of moviesthe company was better than the movie
Jun 3 2009,positive,classic action my precious
Jun 2 2009,positive,the trilogy were great
Jun 2 2009,positive,awsome but better than the first one the battle of helms deep is the best
Jun 2 2009,positive,   wow go legolas kinda sad coz boromir died
Jun 1 2009,positive,a slower second act to the trilogy but a crucial part to an epic quest a great bridge between our other films and a strong pivotal developing point for our heroes  wonderful
Jun 1 2009,positive,mr carlson my film comp teacher in high school said that he thought each lord of the rings film was better than the last because peter jackson had more time to work on them as you go down the line i agree i think each part in the story gets more intense the battles are more perfected the stakes higher and im not going to pretend it doesnt have its slow moments but for as slow as those moments are the battle scenes are as actionpacked and just as fellowship did you are more than ready to watch the next installment upon the films end
Jun 1 2009,positive,best of the series three thumbs up
Jun 1 2009,positive,again i liked the action of course and the twists in the plot i liked it less because gandalf died of course
Jun 1 2009,positive,my fav of the tril love the movies and the soundtracks well done
May 31 2009,positive,good but third is the bomb
May 31 2009,positive,excellent  loved this movie
May 31 2009,positive,the second chapter of the lord of the rings trilogy is amazing just as the other two are
May 31 2009,negative,have tried  keep falling asleep
May 31 2009,positive,why didnt i rate this before    anyways this is the best movie ever ever    from music to scenery to the cg in gandalfs beard this movie screams perfection even its 3 hours long itll make you stare at the screen until it goes to a break    a must watch for fan of sorcery and medieval type movies
May 30 2009,positive,peter jackson is my hero
May 30 2009,positive,really entertaining
May 30 2009,positive,it needs but one foe to breed a war and those who have not swords can still die upon them the two towers a prowar film would be denounced if released today in 2009 demonstrating the perils of appeasing evil the necessity of distinguishing friend from foe the folly of isolationism and the risks of immoderate deliberation this is a film with traditionalist lessons
May 30 2009,positive,the middle act of a trilogy is inevitably difficult to pull off  while the two towers is not perfect it does do an awful lot of things well  gollum is formally introduced and the technology behind the pathetic creature is technically amazing  the residents of rohan a land of majestic horses are pulled into the struggle against sauron and his dark forces  the ents an ancient race that are closely related to trees are also caught in the middle  the fellowship remains splintered and that allows for growth of character for sam sean astin frodo elijah wood merry dominic monaghan pippin billy boyd aragorn viggo mortensen and gandalf the white ian mckellen  new characters faramir david wenham theoden bernard hill and eowyn miranda otto help to enrich the alreadyrich world  the battle of helms deep is a truly great scene of cinema although much exposition is necessary it all pays off in the final film
May 30 2009,positive,it was an interesting movie the acting was good but the story was a bit too complex if you didnt read the book too many characters to keep track of
May 30 2009,positive,awesome give it to someone you idolise
May 29 2009,positive,ok movie but way too long and boring this seems like it was a filler movie there wasnt much action
May 29 2009,neutral,i know its the middle film in the trilogy but its still way too long for a film with such a flimsynearly nonexistent plot
May 29 2009,positive,totally badass and gollumsmeagol steals the film
May 29 2009,positive,epic movie u have to see thats the perfect trilogy ive ever saw
May 29 2009,positive,this wasnt my favourite at all dodnt judge me i just dont know why i didnt enjoy it as much 
May 28 2009,positive,good sequel no let down
May 28 2009,positive,really really love these really really love these  really really love these
May 28 2009,positive,i enjoy all of the rings but the last one could have ended better i mean not so many times
May 28 2009,positive,is it just me or is christopher lee never a good guy
May 28 2009,positive,not as good as the last one
May 28 2009,positive,very true to the novels loved it
May 28 2009,positive,great movie awesome effects
May 27 2009,negative,not much better than the first however the army of trees were the main highlight of the film
May 27 2009,positive,this trilogy is awesome  each of the 3 movies is at the same caliber
May 27 2009,positive,shall i describe it to you or would you like me to find you a box
May 26 2009,positive,my favorite part of the trilogy of films the plots simple enough to follow the cinematography and musical score are astounding and the battle of helms deep is breathtaking king theoden makes the best speeches of the film and the scene in which the people of rohan prepare for battle is a beautifully constructed one i loved the vikinglike athmospere throughout the happenings in rohan as well as the gloomy sights in osgiliath a bit of a pity is the fact that gimli is turned into a comic relief but i can forgive that much ãowyns love for aragorn is depicted well  and the foundation is built for her role in part 3
May 26 2009,positive,the best of the three
May 26 2009,positive,brilliant story acting and sfx

May 22 2009,positive,the battle in helms deep definitely cool  i think all leaders should be like king theoden in war he stands in the front line and is the first to charge at the enemy he knows how to raise the spirit of his army he cares for them and they are willing to die for him  too bad that haldir dies in that battle    allow me to quote my favourite line here  i am on nobodys side because nobody is on my side  says treebeard the ent    the competition between gimli and legolas its so funny of course i cheer on legolas khehehe but they both really are skillful in fighting go slay the ugly orcs

May 10 2009,positive,lord of the rings the two towers
May 10 2009,positive,the lord of the rings  the two towers is by far the best film in the epic triology again we see the journey of frodo and sam to mordor on their mission to destroy the ring     peter jackson again manages to deliver perfection in the form of an amazing film not only do you feel the struggle of frodo and sams mission but we also witness links to the first film that make the attachments on certain characters like aragorn gimli and legolas much stronger  we are introduced to gollum in this second installment and see one of the most visually stunning battle scenes of all time i was lucky enough to see this at the cinema and was an experience ill never forget oh and i bloody well adore andy serkis
May 10 2009,positive,i was amazed at what they got on screen considering limitations
May 9 2009,positive,my must seen and collected movie

May 6 2009,positive, and the quest goes on   help is found where you less expect it hope is what drives us forward
May 5 2009,neutral,a little bit better than the first especially with smeagle but still a tad too long

Apr 29 2009,positive,love the move want to see it a agan
Apr 28 2009,negative,welll i suppose this movies is good
Apr 28 2009,positive,the lord of the ringsthe two towers can only be explained in one word beautifulthis film left me breathless i was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the fellowship of the ringand i must say that it has surpassed the film completelyi will have a hard time watching the fellowship and seeing the ending knowing there is so much more waitinglets start with gollum gollum gave an astonishing performancethe poor misunderstood beast or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the one ringthe performance given in cgi is at times very human the facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor gollums voice is still haunting even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of mordor for these reasons and more gollum has become my favorite character in the film this movie honestly moved me further than i thought any film couldi could see my face and the emotion i felt as i was watching this mammoth film peter jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent this story has captivated my heart and the film has taken my breath awaythere is no words that can express the greatness of this film
Apr 28 2009,positive,very very very good good good good yes yes yes
Apr 28 2009,positive,as epic fantasy this is unlikely ever to be topped
Apr 28 2009,positive,not as good as the first one but a decent movie nonetheless
Apr 27 2009,positive,super toate 3 is ff faine
Apr 27 2009,positive,loved it and the books too

Apr 26 2009,positive,the fellowship of  the ring the two towers  return of the king the best movie ever made
Apr 26 2009,positive,three wordsnot long enough
Apr 26 2009,positive,oh yeah the fx were great plus the actors are brilliant 
Apr 25 2009,negative,omg the lord of the rings is so boring i fell asleep
Apr 25 2009,positive,just when you thought the fellowship was magnificent two comes along and proves you wrong  the fights are better the character of gollum is explained and explored  although i think the trees were the best addition  loved them
Apr 25 2009,negative,ohi loved legales or whoever that wasorlando bloom loved the movie though but kind of creepy
Apr 25 2009,positive,not the best of the three but still incredible
Apr 25 2009,positive,i think as a transitional film this left much to be desiredbut i still fell in love with the new characters and anxiously anrticipated the next installment great job
Apr 25 2009,positive,the best of the three movies
Apr 25 2009,positive,cant stop watching them so captivating
Apr 24 2009,positive,epic well acted great story not the end all of epics that some make it out to be but worth a watch
Apr 24 2009,positive,the best of the series
Apr 24 2009,positive,part ii  frodo and sam split from the rest of their group to trek to mt doom alone  meanwhile aragorn the dwarf and the elf run to rescue the screwup and comedy relief whove been kidnapped and are being taken to saruman  gollum is introduced trees walk and talk gandalf is white and it all culminates in a siege of the mountain fortress of helms deep by an army of orcs numbering in the thousands    all the superlatives heaped upon the fellowship of the ring  also belong to this second chapter but with the addition of a few relatively insignificant quibbles  the two towers is slightly hindered by the divided nature of the story and doesnt quite have the drive of its predecessor but it still succeeds at being a vivid fully realized eyepopping entertainment
Apr 24 2009,positive,hanya  ini yg lebih sering ku nonton di banding the lord of the rings yg lain
Apr 24 2009,positive,love all of them
Apr 24 2009,positive,all three were great
Apr 24 2009,positive,nice team work  sacrifice
Apr 24 2009,positive,scary but courageous
Apr 23 2009,positive,it doesnt get that last 12 star because guess what people no last minute army of elves showed up at helms deep haldir did not die serious straying from the books there
Apr 23 2009,positive,theyre all spectacular
Apr 23 2009,positive,my favorite of the trilogy you learn more about relationships and character sin this one the most
Apr 23 2009,neutral,not really my thing
Apr 23 2009,positive,i like this part more than the others
Apr 23 2009,positive,the journeys full of adventure
Apr 23 2009,positive,what can i say that already hasn t been said best dam pix ever
Apr 23 2009,positive,cowriter and director peter jackson continues his oscarwinning boxoffice blockbuster adaptation of the classic fantasy novel from author jrr tolkien with a second installment that plunges the fictional setting of middleearth into a vicious war welcome additions to the action in the sophomore adventure include the cgcreated gollum moving front and center as a major character who is simply amazing in his ability to entertain and move the viewer emotionally the most pathetic creature in the trilogy hes a schizophrenic nightmare but heartbreakingly human and poignantly dazzlingly realized by a combination of actor andy serkiss physical skill and jacksons special effects experts gollum puts the similar jar jar binks character of the second star wars trilogy to shame also thrilling are a climactic battle between ents living trees and the evil wizard saruman christopher lee that brings to mind any number of breathtaking sequences from the wizard of oz 1939 and the final clash between humans and invading enemy forces at helms deep a lengthy but thrilling clash of bows and shields that recalls the superb fight sequences from braveheart 1995 less persuasive are some storytelling elements that fall victim to the filmmakers effort to condense the story into a threehour running time several gaps in the action occur and a few developments are left unexplained or vague such as how the forces of ãomer karl urban grow from a few dozen to thousands how the defenders of the realm of gondor manage to defeat their attackers why the ringwraiths have suddenly switched mounts from horses to dragons why did they use horses at all in the first film  and why tolkien felt the need to give every location character and object in his work at least three utterly confusing names those who havent read the books may be left wondering what the difference is between ãomer and faramir or gimli and grima however the simple fact that a novel as dense and detailed as this one hasnt been turned into a labored bore is a miracle that jackson has fashioned such a triumphant success is a real artistic achievement lord of the rings the two towers 2002 may be imperfect in its occasionally frustrated effort to squeeze every significant plot element into the mix but its a visual marvel and a definite raising of the artistic bar for its entire genre no filmmaker will ever be able to create a scifi or fantasy epic again without comparison against it
Apr 22 2009,positive,still funny but starting to become heartwarming
Apr 22 2009,positive,the second of the three movies is not so good than the others i think but it keeps its position in the trilogy
Apr 22 2009,positive,love this movie alot and the others are very good too  love those movies very much muhahaha
Apr 22 2009,positive,terrific battle scenes at helms deep and merry and pippin shine
Apr 22 2009,positive,not as good as 1 and 3
Apr 21 2009,negative,most boring movie i have ever seen
Apr 21 2009,positive,do i really need to rate this
Apr 21 2009,positive,if orlando were to miss it it cud be boring
Apr 21 2009,neutral,i was rooting for gollum is that bad
Apr 21 2009,positive,lord of the movies 
Apr 20 2009,positive,in my eyes this is the best of the trilogy a great movie
Apr 19 2009,positive,one of the only 3hr movies that i can sit all the way through
Apr 19 2009,positive,gollumsmeadel was the highpoint of this film and yes he does look like a pissedoff john mccain  as with the other lotr films it was very wellmade with great special effects and shit  still this film was too damn long especially the battle scene and unlike the others i found this one to be confusing and a bit inpenetrable  by no means a bad film but that said i couldnt wait for it to end
Apr 19 2009,positive,the best made movie of all times
Apr 18 2009,positive,by far the best film in the trilogy i love legolashe is quite amazing
Apr 18 2009,positive,lord of the rings is awesome
Apr 18 2009,positive,equally as good as the first
Apr 17 2009,positive,nice sequel of the first
Apr 17 2009,positive,not the best of the movies but is still great to watch
Apr 17 2009,positive,one of my favorite alltime epic movies
Apr 17 2009,positive,this is the greatest movie i have ever layed my eyes on  i mean the locations were perfect and the helms deep battle was just so amazing
Apr 17 2009,negative,worse of the trilogy movies not books directors split of the storyline is bad resulting in too much actions to be packed in return of the king
Apr 16 2009,positive,makes me proud to be a kiwi the whole trilogy could have gone so badly but it was totally awesome gollum scene is everything jaja binks is not
Apr 16 2009,positive,took me 6 different time to watch this all the way through
Apr 16 2009,positive,love those books and movies
Apr 16 2009,positive,awesome just like the rest fo lotr
Apr 16 2009,positive,lotr always stole my heart
Apr 16 2009,positive,these are just unbelievable movies
Apr 16 2009,positive,who cannot like the awesomness of the lord of the rings the mere creation of middle earth alone is outstanding
Apr 16 2009,positive,good movie but liked the first two better
Apr 15 2009,positive,amazing even better than the one before
Apr 15 2009,positive,the whole lord of the rings trilogy is amazing but the take on the battle of helms deep pushes the two towers ahead of the others plus the ents kick serious toches
Apr 15 2009,positive,i am a lord of the rings fan what a way to step up movie making when it seemed that a plateau had been reached truly epic a classic
Apr 15 2009,positive,the special effects on this movie are incredible  peter jackson is an amazing director
Apr 15 2009,positive,i preferred the extended edition makes much more sense than the theatrical release
Apr 15 2009,positive,duh once again i love these movies and this one is the greatest one
Apr 15 2009,positive,all of these were good
Apr 15 2009,positive,very good its best movies filmography
Apr 14 2009,positive,again brilliant to be able to maintain so many stories without any of them losing their impact is genius jackson also managed to keep 2 battles going as well those of isengard and helms deep the enormity of the battles are captured by the amazing work of the weta workshop and the passion drawn out of the actors by jackson all is now set up for the climax
Apr 14 2009,positive,one of my favorite of the trilogy
Apr 14 2009,positive,the high water mark of the entire lord of the rings series arrives at the battle for helms deep which has become the standard by which fantasy and scifi films will measure their sprawling epic scapes  even in the largest battle one could ever conceive jackson provides us with characters like theoden and aragorn deep welldefined and even in the midst of millionman frays articulate in motive and desire  two towers is all about transition from the small beginnings in fellowship to the grandscale wrapups of return two towers succeeds in the most ignoble pursuit for a midtrilogy film getting from point a to point b without losing momentum
Apr 14 2009,neutral,more walking yet entertainging lol
Apr 14 2009,positive,awesome entertainment
Apr 14 2009,positive,all parts are incredible i really like it the end final part is amazing
Apr 13 2009,positive,theyre still walking
Apr 13 2009,positive,the two towers has groundbreaking special effects most notably the motion capture technology used for gollumwhile keeping to the story and sense of awe that made its predecessor so magnificent the battles and music were sublime and the fact that it kept me on the edge of my seat for three full hours is an amazing feat i honestly felt this movie deserved as many oscar nods as its sequel
Apr 13 2009,positive,technically the effects are amazing in this movie and cgi technology is hands down amazing but this movie is something that only the exceptionally intellectual  ones can fully relate to
Apr 13 2009,neutral,borefest worst out of the three
Apr 13 2009,positive,i have read all and the hobbit the movies did do each justice
Apr 13 2009,positive,instant classic for our generation im not really that huge of a fan and i mustve seen it like 100 times already in my life between the teather video dvd and tv there is just no escape not that we want to anyway
Apr 13 2009,positive,good fight scenes but it dragged on a bit
Apr 13 2009,positive,the best part of this movie is the expanded editions deletedextended scenes
Apr 13 2009,positive,helms deep is going to go down in history like the battle of hoth in terms of innovation and sheer badassery but then there are the ents
Apr 13 2009,positive,i love the battle scene at helms deep
Apr 13 2009,positive,no comment needed 3
Apr 13 2009,positive,didnt like the first enjoyed the third loved the second
Apr 12 2009,positive,it was better than the first but not as good as the third
Apr 12 2009,positive,if this wasnt a book first i would say this epic series were modern classics but the books will always be better i think i just love orlando bloom
Apr 12 2009,positive,second of peter jacksons adaptations of tolkiens lord of the rings trilogy and another masterly use of cgi and special effects   the two towers sees frodo and sam pursuing their lonely quest    the intensity of their isolation and claustrophobia of their peril is handled with sensitivity and dramatic conviction   they will be joined by the tragic gollum  sméagol    an iconic piece of special effects given great humanity by andy serkis    the other members of the fellowship of the ring are left to go their own ways and fight their own battles   jackson balances the main plot with intense and gripping subplots his characters benefiting from a superb ensemble of actors   brad dourif gives us a loathsome manipulative wormtongue bernard hill a troubled theoden and miranda otto as eowyn is a woman surely any romantic hero would fall in love with   surely    its a blend of stories and characters which holds your imagination and emotions in a relentless grip    a tribute to tolkeins ability to write a story and jacksons skill in transferring this to film   the special effects are essential to the film    tolkein could rely on the readers mind to do the job   despite having read the books three times before the films were made i had no difficulty adapting my imagination to jacksons    it is a mark of his success as a visionary filmmaker that so many others have been able to suspend their own vision of tolkeins world and become fully absorbed by the film representation    jackson of course has adapted tolkien    his films are reasonably faithful to the books though there have been changes   the films in their own right become convincing portrayals of a mythical world consumed by the battle between good and evil   the combination of special effects and landscape make the three films visually stunning and amplify the drama    i have to say this is a film best experienced at the cinema    make sure you see it on the big screen at least once if you want to fully appreciate its epic power and drama   if you watch it on dvd go for the extended version with its outstanding addition of extras commentaries on the film interviews makingof documentaries and more    exceptional value
Apr 12 2009,positive,one of the best trilogy ever
Apr 12 2009,positive,it was great it establishes a lot of new characters and battle suspense not to mention all the acting was fa nominal the lord of the rings was a series made well

Apr 11 2009,positive,the cast the sound effect and the visual effect deserve to strike a 5 and yet i just cant rate it that high maybe my expectation maybe the lack of message or maybe its length
Apr 10 2009,positive,enjoyable and good translation of what is essentially a history book for a fantasy world
Apr 10 2009,positive,the battle at helms deep was phenomenalnot the best of the three movies inmy opinion but nevertheless an incredible film on its own
Apr 10 2009,positive,pj ups the ante for the second installment with the greatest battle and build up commited to film and gollum a sublime marrige of great chacacter acting and top notch effects
Apr 9 2009,positive,a little slow at times a lot of fighting scenes but still very good almost to the last movie
Apr 8 2009,positive,not my favorite lotr movie but helms deep is amazing peter jackson blew my mind
Apr 8 2009,positive,woe is me all of this visual geek porn is really frustrating and not my taste its difficult making an adaptation for these ring films but a straighttoscreen adaptation is all that i can see in other words go a step further the supposed escapism from these supremely long novels and films have ridiculous folklore drowned in world war references and people can see right through them when stagnant events offer too much realism when theres supposed to be fantasy
Apr 8 2009,positive,the lord of the rings movies were awesome great actors and scerency of new zealand
Apr 8 2009,positive,not too true to the book but still one of the greatest movies i have ever seen

Apr 2 2009,positive,possibly my favourite of the three though i love them all the drama in this one really builds up and the battle for helms deep is just awesome
Apr 2 2009,positive,we slowly enter the point where i start getting pissed at peter jackson
Apr 1 2009,neutral,it was better the second time the first time i thought it would never end
Apr 1 2009,positive,i find the direction annoying and cheesy but its hard not to be impressed by the magnitude of the whole thing
Apr 1 2009,positive,absolutely love lotr
Apr 1 2009,positive,the extended cut is superior to the theatrical version
Apr 1 2009,positive,much better then the first one it had more fighting scenes in which i love i absolutely loved the trees and how they destroyed the orks i enjoyed this one story was better just some reason i dont like the interaction of arwen and her family it bores me but the prettiest ive seen liv tyler good one
Apr 1 2009,positive,best sequel ever once agian jackson has brought us something to keep on loving and thats the journey he didnt finish yet 3 different plots now and all of them just bond together to create a real great story i must say its not easy to make an inbetween film its jsut not but its donethe additions to the film are rohan and its people the battle of helms deep which will make so many computer geeks of rpg games proud walking talking tree like ents and the revelation to mtion capture gollum who by andy serkis brings a creature whom weve never seen before with such emotion and depth its just great the return of ganadlaf the white now thats somethong to be excited about the sotry the actors the new sets the visual effects everything just keeps getting better and better i love it this is movie making at its best i really say though it was wise for peter jackson not to put all of the 2 towers in and put in return of the king reallys smart the end is jsut os heartfelt and the actor who i really think makes the journey from the beginning to the end in such a very bug way is sean astins character sam who at the end has a paragraph where he tells the audience of what those fairy tales and childrens stories really were about and gives us a new light into what the story really is about also not to mention gollum really sends a chill down our spine in the end a wonderful sequel and a really good follow up congrats peter also for those out there take a look at the extended cut i guarntee you its worth it so worth it more laughs from gimli and legolas
Mar 31 2009,positive,they all good but i dont really remember what happenes in each on of them
Mar 31 2009,positive,never finished it dont have the attention span
Mar 31 2009,positive,well yeah of course
Mar 31 2009,positive,looooooove it it is just wow
Mar 31 2009,positive,the best of the 3 films  forth eorlingas
Mar 31 2009,positive,i dont see why people think its the worst of the three
Mar 31 2009,positive,watvhable but a bit too lomg
Mar 30 2009,positive,one of my favorite movies along with the first and third
Mar 30 2009,positive,awesome again but those bloody trees
Mar 29 2009,negative,big waste of time  3 hours of my life that i will never get back
Mar 29 2009,positive,there arent words to describe these moviesall 3 of them
Mar 29 2009,positive,loved it  45 minute battle at the end was epic as shit
Mar 28 2009,positive,the next level of the great adventure
Mar 28 2009,positive,1 ring to rule them allthe 1st  3rd are the best
Mar 28 2009,positive,keeps you glued for third
Mar 28 2009,positive,it got hotter and more interesting
Mar 28 2009,positive,all seemed lost at helms deep until the arrival of the rohirrimm the best moment would have to be aragorn riding with the rohan king
Mar 27 2009,positive,the two towers surpasses fellowship of the ring in every way     thankfully the story did not suffer because of the elaborate special effects what was said in this film about war and about good being worth fighting for  especially resonated with me
Mar 27 2009,positive,good as the first one keeps you in the story great effects
Mar 27 2009,positive,frodo and sam continue on thier quest to mordor to destroy the one ring but without the help of gollum they are lost however can their new guide be trusted aragorn legolas gimli and a reborn gandalf head to rohan in an effort to gather the last remaining men lead by king theoden to battle as war prepares to break out on middle earth they head to the fortess helms deep where sarumans army of 10000 are heading to destroy the world of men the union of the two towers has begun an outstanding film that is actually better than the superb original with awesome special effects superb performances throughout and its a fantastic film that is terrific entertainment
Mar 27 2009,positive,soon to be classics
Mar 27 2009,positive,i like the wild rohirrim
Mar 27 2009,positive,the same with my first impression with the first lotr    a blockbuster hit
Mar 26 2009,positive,all the lord of the rings are excellent
Mar 26 2009,positive,a superior second part in the trilogy
Mar 26 2009,positive,you gotta watch all three during an insane weekend movie marathon
Mar 26 2009,positive,the two towers can only explained in one word beautiful i was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the fellowship of the ring and i must say that it has surpassed the film completely gollum gave an astonishing performance the poor misunderstood beast or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the one ring the performance given in cgi is at times very human the facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor the extended version is better than the original but does not need to make such a quantum leap as fellowship managed with its ee however it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema
Mar 25 2009,positive,lotr rules it may be a bloody big build up just to drop a ring into a fire pit but these movies are epic
Mar 25 2009,positive,i enjoyed this one more than fellowship but i still dont think i could watch it a second time production value is clearly the prime focus for jackson and thats good but if i cant relate or feel for any of the people in the movie it just doesnt seem solid
Mar 25 2009,positive,lord of the rings is beast
Mar 25 2009,positive,i own the 3 of them movies and books legolas ahh
Mar 25 2009,positive,of course legolas rules

Mar 25 2009,positive,the cinema is greatbut just not a good as the book
Mar 24 2009,positive,this 1 is bout rvenge wich is so cool
Mar 24 2009,positive,more running across the mountains
Mar 23 2009,positive,more hobbosexuality but action scenes are terrific
Mar 23 2009,positive,no empire but still a good ol romp
Mar 23 2009,positive,the back drops and gollum clinch this movie to be labeled the best fantasy movie ever in my book
Mar 23 2009,positive,awesome love the lord of the rings its so interesting to watch
Mar 23 2009,positive,the whole trilogy has been well done and is good entertainment
Mar 23 2009,positive,we love all the lord of the ring movieswe want them alll
Mar 23 2009,positive,hell yes i love the dwarfs
Mar 23 2009,positive,they all were so good except the last one which was too long
Mar 22 2009,positive,not the best of the trilogy but still an amazing movie and the giant battle near the end was fuckin legendary
Mar 22 2009,positive,eh pretty alright but fell short for me
Mar 22 2009,positive,an amazing movie just as good as the first
Mar 22 2009,positive,these were on tv over the weekend this is by far my favorite of the 3 much like the original star wars movies the middle one is dark and although there is no beginning or end this is a neat package as long as you are not looking for conclusion it has a great arc and the most exciting army battle ive seen the effects are great and rarely distracting which is all i really ask for from cg movies  when they actually look good as cg thats just extra even the trees which i thought looked really cheesy at first works out at the end it made me expect a lot of the last one
Mar 22 2009,positive,amazingthrilling i cant watch it over and over and over
Mar 22 2009,negative,i need a six pack of beer to get through this one even though it looked nice
Mar 22 2009,positive,it took about 15 years to get the hollywood to make this one for the early readers of of tolkiens books dervied from fairy fauna around the world
Mar 22 2009,positive,i have watch it and i realy it
Mar 22 2009,positive,first part of the move drags in a few places but the battle at helms deep alone was worth the cost of the tickets
Mar 22 2009,positive,was awsome on bluray
Mar 22 2009,positive,my least favorite of the 3
Mar 21 2009,positive,i actually slept though the middle of this one

Mar 21 2009,positive,i loooove lord of the rings
Mar 20 2009,positive,love alla the lotrs films get very lost in them every now and hten
Mar 20 2009,positive,the best of all 3 since rotk had lame battle scenes
Mar 20 2009,positive,as i said before love lord of the rings all
Mar 20 2009,positive,what to sayexpected alotfrom this filmstill worth watching once
Mar 20 2009,positive,good movie   the soundtrack even better
Mar 20 2009,positive,the middle of the film and apparently was the toughest to make according to the special features    the action is intensified and for the better the visual effects are friggin amazing possibly the best ive ever seen and increase the scope of the film a lot and for the better    despite all its visual greatness the characterization takes a slight fall a billion give or take a billion characters are introduced and youre watching three stories at once which is awesome that they pulled it off but i feel viggo orlando and rhysdavis plot line took a hit in characterization in the fact that they dont develop anymore than they were in the first film which isnt bad but is the negative point of the film     again like the first the extended edition adds more to the story and character backgrounds but sacrifices pacing thankfully the action and badassery makes up for it
Mar 19 2009,positive,used to hate the lotr movies when they first came out but now im a bit older i like them 
Mar 19 2009,negative,seen orlando bloom my fav in this movie
Mar 19 2009,positive,best of the bunch for me  lots of fun action
Mar 19 2009,positive,an excellent film very enjoyable all around even better than the first one though i dont think its fair to think of them as separate movies its a trilogy thats why the oscars waited for the third film to give em props
Mar 19 2009,negative,creatures too creepy for me
Mar 18 2009,positive,okay i have never read the lord of the rings all the way through there i said it it humbles me to admit but its the truth i didnt study it at high school nor was it a book that my parents pushed on me when i was younger  i knew very little about tolkiens epic books i have every intention of one day reading all three  but why do i feel compelled to tell you this     because that is exactly why peter jacksons cinematic masterpiece works  for me like many who were unfamiliar with the story of the journey to destroy the one ring i had my eyes pulled open from the first teaser trailer being released  something told you that this would be special in a time when very little falls into that category  it captured my imagination and opened my eyes to a story that i had little time for before peter jackson embarked on making these films    i dont regard lord of the rings as a trilogy i see it as one nine hour epic film a magnificent filmmaking achievement that i genuinly believe will never be replicated its superbly directed the acting is faultless the story compelling the new zealand scenary is breathtaking the films are simply  perfect
Mar 18 2009,positive,the 4 hour version is best
Mar 18 2009,positive,peter jackson always great
Mar 18 2009,negative,a bit long and occassionally really boring

Mar 17 2009,positive,just fabulously awesome
Mar 17 2009,positive,seen it and its a kick ass movie
Mar 17 2009,positive,this would be my third favorite of the trilogy  we meet so many new characters in this film and i am so proud of the way that treebread came out  gollum was a little disappointing because i depicted his voice to be completely different but andy serkis does a good job  this is where the graphics really pick up in the trilogy and i think they did a good job on the ending seeing as how in the book it left off with shelobs lair which i think would have thrown off the ending overall for the movie
Mar 17 2009,positive,lord of the rings the two towers
Mar 17 2009,neutral,ok i guess but too long
Mar 17 2009,positive,i want see this movie again
Mar 17 2009,positive,i debate constantly which film in the trilogy is my favorite in the end its best to view the three as a whole they are all fabulous however if i did have to pick one i like the least it might be this one mostly because of the change they made to faramirs character i understand why it was done and im not a huge purist that hates the change its just a little weird thats it
Mar 17 2009,positive,great sequel to the series
Mar 17 2009,positive,it is just as amazing as the other filmswould recommend all the films to anyone

Mar 12 2009,positive,brilliant amazing gorgeous everyone of those adjectives does not describe how this film is unbielevably good its perfect in every part of it   and the battle for the helms deep makes me excited every time i watch it also after 8 years from the release of the film and probably not less than 5 or 6 visions sometime the middle part of trilogies are the weakest but thats not the case wrote someone before me i can only add in this trilogy the second part is the strongest
Mar 12 2009,positive,alright if you like that sort of thing
Mar 11 2009,positive,i love this whole trilogy
Mar 11 2009,positive,good movie  great job basing it off the books  however i didnt like how there was no start or end to this movie  i understand its beceause of the first movie and the last have to start somewhere but its hard to get into the movie when you forgot what the last movie was about  good all in all
Mar 11 2009,positive,weakest of the three movies but really annoying and useless changes and additions from the book
Mar 11 2009,positive,my least favourite in the trilogy but an awesome movie experience nonetheless and leagues better than most fantasy films that are out there

Mar 9 2009,positive,excellent continuation of the series  marvelous acting direction music cinematography effects and so on  not entirely faithful to the book sometimes for the better interweaving the storylines and sometimes for the worse the cliff sequence added love story etc  the extended cut is a mustsee as is the hilarious easter egg  emilliana torrinis haunting closing song is massively underrated and should have gotten an oscar alongside enya and annie lennoxs closings

Mar 8 2009,positive,these movies arnt all that great honestly this is the only one out of the series that i would recomend anyone to see but youve got to see the others for any of it to make sense  so watch it if you havent and youll see this one is better1
Mar 8 2009,negative,see clerks ii inmovie reference
Mar 8 2009,positive,the film opens with beautiful scenery we see orcs attacking villages which illustrates the power saurman has against the breed of men in that scene we see two rohan children fleeting their village and have to leave their mum in the hope they will see her later which they do which is quite touching peter jackson the director makes us hate theodenâs aid as he plots to get the young king banished and it works while sam develops his disliking for gollum at the start frodo takes his side and is ultimately betrayed by him later on we see new creatures such as the trees and the full debut of gollum the introduction of the white wizard effectively gandalf was a timely one for people who were sad to see him they thought die when he fall of the bridge in the first film the music is epic once again for me there are two great standout quotes in this film gimli what do trees have to talk about except the consistency of squirrel droppings rivalled by sam potatoes boil âem mash âem stick âem in a stew iâve always liked samâs one but gimliâs one i only came across after watching the extended edition for the first time the scene with the wild riders bearwolflike animals but on all fours with orcs on their backs is epic when the men on horses come up over the top of the mound and the music starts and you hear legolassâs bow ping it gives you goose bumps itâs simply epic one of the favourite scenes of the film for me iâve watched the films many times over and never before had i found it so emotional and touching maybe itâs because of the experiences iâve been through since watching them the last time maybe itâs because i find deeper meaning in the sad moments as iâm older iâm not sure faramir is harshly treated by his father for unknown reasons and in the extended edition boromir defends his brother which faramir deserved watching boys being taken from the caves to fight was sad all the same the build up to the fight is exiting and the actual battle itself is very entertaining many moments to savour even though faramir says he will take the ring from frodo you never really believed it all in all a fantastic film the usual rule that the first film in a triliogy of films or whatever is the best does not apply here if anything these films get better which each one all are five star the film ends with another stage for everyone over and new ones about to begin
Mar 8 2009,negative,i fell asleep in this film once
Mar 7 2009,positive,a serious dip in the road which at least makes it consistent with the book
Mar 7 2009,positive,pretty good but a little too overhyped
Mar 7 2009,positive,this movie remake was well overdue  want more of them  one of my favorite books growing up

Mar 6 2009,positive,fantastic read the novel
Mar 6 2009,positive,one of the most beautifully directed written and acted epic adventure films i have ever seen
Mar 6 2009,positive,in my opinion the weakest of the three movies but its rather common that the beginning and the ending are the most memorable parts of the story so this isnt really that surprising and dont get me wrong the battle of helms deep is pure brilliance in motion but the movie has some parts that are just unnecessary like the supposed death of aragorn or the fact that gimli is hardly more than a comic relief moat of the time those two things for example are a bit distracting and make the overall movie weaker not by much because this is still a great movie but still
Mar 6 2009,positive,enjoyed this one also
Mar 6 2009,positive,not as good as the other twostill good though
Mar 6 2009,positive,best trilogy ever now go remake the hobbit please
Mar 6 2009,positive,the best then any lord of rings trilogy
Mar 6 2009,positive,really good but suffers alittle bit from being the middle film and the story naturally becoming more fragmented still loved it tho and helm deep was amazing
Mar 5 2009,positive,peter jacksons flawless direction the terrific acting and beautiful cinematography make this film a terrific second parter of the trilogy not only does it stand alone as an amazing fantasy film it is almost realistic way in its own kind of way
Mar 5 2009,positive,love these movies helms deep battle was epic
Mar 5 2009,positive,omg this movie is awesome love the hell out of the helms deep battle full price

Mar 5 2009,positive,just as brillaint as the first film
Mar 5 2009,negative,read the book for the second one  the film is poor 
Mar 5 2009,positive,long but worth every minute
Mar 4 2009,positive,i love this one quite possibly my fav in the trilogy its got the action with out bein too depressing and u have the introduction of gollum polayed incredibly by andy serkis not to mention you get some of the best bits of the storyline for merry and pip and then aragorn legolas and gimli
Mar 4 2009,positive,out of all three this is the one i liked the least  but i still liked it
Mar 4 2009,positive,i love the tollken trilogy all of the movies are fantastic great acting script stayed true to books and scenery and special effects are awesome

Mar 4 2009,neutral,if you cant be bothered to read the books what makes you think youll like this stuff  the making of documentary is really class
Mar 4 2009,positive,the geek comes to the surface
Mar 4 2009,positive,building upon the first this film does what nobody expected it goes further and harder showing the darkness at its blackest
Mar 3 2009,positive,great ive been waiting over 30 yrs for someone to make a good movie out of this trilogy peter jackson did a fine job great casting and cinematography too
Mar 3 2009,positive,awesome did see again on sunday still love this and all other lord of the rings 
Mar 3 2009,positive,the lord of the rings  the two towers is a phenomenal movie that provides a new meaning to the word epic  not only is the sheer scale of the movie impressive but all of the details involved in it    the visual effects are stunning and are the best of our time creating some intense battles that get your adrenaline pumping but to add to it howard shore provides a chilling score that adds another dimension to the movie  but with all movies like this one you would expect bad acting but no the lord of the rings has good not great acting and the villain saruman played by christopher lee is haunting and i love it   i also believe they organized the movie very well and some details were left out from the book but overall you get a pretty good jrr tolkien experience  my only comment would be for new comers who did not see the first one you will have trouble understanding it because there is no recap at the beginning of the movie   overall the lord of the rings movies in general are fantastic each a bit different  they have all the right elements to make some epic films and they have the greatest visual effects out there right now  i think looking back at this film 20 years from now it may look out dated but it isnt just the visuals that make the lord of the rings an awesome triliogy
Mar 3 2009,positive,i am a geek  i am in love with this trilogy
Mar 3 2009,positive,bit cheesey in places but overall its good
Mar 3 2009,positive,this is my fav lord of the rings so good
Mar 3 2009,positive,this is where the depression set in
Mar 3 2009,positive,one of the best movies ever made
Mar 3 2009,positive,trilogies dont get any better
Mar 3 2009,positive,once you get into these movies and past the spooky stuff they are amazing
Mar 2 2009,positive,following in the footsteps of the first film a remarkable work  peter jackson has done it again  the battle scenes are epic the acting topnotch and the messagetimelessit reminds us that in the bleakest hour in the darkest times there is good in this world and all of it is worth fighting for
Mar 2 2009,positive,loved the hole series the books are much better but so what
Mar 2 2009,positive,love them all think i like this a little better than the first one though because of no 30 minute introductions
Mar 2 2009,positive,part 2 in the trilogy and the toughest to put in film excellent movie
Mar 2 2009,positive,fantastic soundtrack
Mar 2 2009,positive,and again  aragorn 
Mar 1 2009,positive,great sequel hated waiting to see all 3 but worth the wait once i saw each of them
Mar 1 2009,negative,back to the books are better thing
Mar 1 2009,positive,greatest film ever sooo fin great
Mar 1 2009,positive,the weakest out of three films it didnt spoil my opinion about the trilogy though
Mar 1 2009,positive,my least favorite of the 3 but that still doesnt prevent it from getting a perfect rating because all 3 got a perfect rating peter jacksons directing in this movie especially made it what it was the battle that takes place at the end of this movie is just marvelous and i love the character developments that take place following the original
Mar 1 2009,positive,definitley much better than the first but not as epic as the third but great battle scenes
Mar 1 2009,positive,the books are good too
Mar 1 2009,negative,the crappest film invented
Mar 1 2009,positive,this is my least favourite out of the trilogy the thing which made me like it the least out of the trilogy was treebeard as them scences were slow the special effects and action sequences were more interesting and intense
Mar 1 2009,positive,lotr need i say more
Mar 1 2009,positive,my favourite of the trilogy
Feb 28 2009,negative,nice visual work gotta give them that but i fall asleep every time i watch it
Feb 28 2009,positive,i cant help loving this trilogy
Feb 28 2009,positive,my fav of the three  battle of helms deep freaked me out
Feb 28 2009,positive,the two towers 2002  the return of the king 2003 by peter jackson  starring elijah wood viggo mortensen ian mckellen etc     img     in a nutshell probably the weakest of the series but the same can be said of the book and both are still head and shoulders above almost anything else in their genre fresh fresh     quick synopsis at the risk of sounding like a toolaragorn gimli and legolas are pursuing merry and pippins captors while frodo and sam inch closer to mordor and pick up a very animated no pun intended guide along the way meanwhile the world is moving closer to all out war     content the lord of the rings trilogy was widely hailed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time during its release years of 20012003 does it hold up 6 years later     most people who know me know that i have been a fan of the books long before peter jackson was a household name tolkiens writing can drag on at times but he is so gifted at bringing his exotic landscapes to life with his prose he obviously had a very clear picture in his mind of what each and every one of his locales looked like what i would give to hear his opinion of jacksons work bringing his words to life honestly i think its 5050 whether or not he would have liked it     personally i was blown away watching fellowship of the ring for the first time in the theater and my experience with the following 2 films was similar there are very few movies that i have seen more than once in the theater richie rich comes to mind thanks to a school field trip after i had already seen it aladdin too im pretty sure of happy gilmore also but i went to see fellowship and the two towers twice each and return of the king three times the first time i saw each i think i spent so much time taking in the breathtaking scenery that i had to return to catch the details of the story which i already knew by heart anyway     i cant say enough about peter jacksons devotion to the fans he refused to make the series into one film when several studios indicated interest in doing so he pitched it as 2 movies for some reason only new line was able to recognize how big the series builtin fan base is and thankfully they exceeded jacksons hopes and offered him 3 films totalling about 7 hours but jackson did the fans one better he filmed hours of additional scenes never intended to be included in the theaterical cut and seemlessly added them to the final product on dvd in what has to be one of the most significant directors cuts ever     so this time through was the first time i sat through the extended editions of all three films actually that is a lie because i skipped the first one because i had seen it so many times but always tuckered out before making through the third after all the extended editions add up to about 105 hours and it had also been a while since i had watched anything but the first one a few years probably so heres what i found goinf back and watching these films after letting them sit for a while     fellowshipis my favorite of the three books and the same holds for the movie it has lost lamost none of its luster its heavy one adventure into the unknown and light on politics and war we meet new species at every turn unfortunately i cannot say quite the same for the second and third chapters i was able to see beyond their spectacle to a story that is terribly rushed at times even the epic 4 hour version of return of the king not that peter jackson had much a choice but while first film was shortened by cutting out an entire scene tom bombadil that has little impact on the rest of the story the other two were shortened mostly by rushing through sections     some scenes seemed a far too overwrought and subtlety was not a word in jacksons vocabularly apparently the casting choices which once seemed perfect at every turn showed their seams although i cant really come up with any suggestions for improvements but it says something to me that very few of the actors in the series has had much success afterwards it makes me wonder what other arguably more interesting character actors could have done with superearnest roles like faramir arwen eomer and even frodo     not being much of an action junkie rewatching the epic battle scenes didnt approach witnessing the spectacle for the first time and at times really frustrated me especially when legolas was doing things like sliding down a staircase on a shield while shooting arrows or climbing up the arrows stuck into a giant elephants hide as it stomps through a heated battle it was just showing off special effects and ill take my movie without it thank you very much if i wanted those kind of things id rent a jet li movie     im aware that im giving the impression that i didnt like the movies that is far from the truth they just werent quite as good as the 9 rating i had once given them and i am being extracritical since it is one of my favorite books but of course the things jackson  crew got right are too numerous to count probably his greatest victory was one of the easiest things to screw up gollum probably one of the most challenging characters to bring to life in the history of cinema the cg is not quite perfect but its damn close and 10 minutes into the second film you forget he is a cg creation and think of him as if he were flesh and bone like him companions and of course andy serkiss voice work was fantastic     im going to end this before i drone on too long but i just saying the second and third films arent as perfect as i once would have claimed its a very impressive interpretation of an expertly written book but im really not sure that it stands on its own too well a decade from now when i want to revisit the story i will want to pick up the book rather than the dvds     urolling top 10  u1 slumdog millionaire 127 fresh fresh  2 the two towers 135 fresh fresh  3 the 40 yearold virgin 129 fresh fresh  4 310

Feb 28 2009,positive,this movie really tells the personality of the characters in the trilogy
Feb 28 2009,positive,the excellence of the trilogy continues in this second installment the story progresses at a nice pace and peter jackson manages to juggle between three plot strands effortlessly the battle of helms deep is a visual juggernaut while the creature gollum is stunningly brought to life via andy serkis and some great special effects brilliant movie    second viewing and considering as the second installment in a three part story it has no definitive beginning or ending this is still quite excellent the battle for helms deep alone is masterful filmmaking
Feb 28 2009,positive,big fan of all three
Feb 27 2009,neutral,not a huge fan dont tell darren
Feb 27 2009,positive,youngsters act very well
Feb 27 2009,positive,with the others one of the great cinematic achievements
Feb 27 2009,positive,a beautiful film jacksons cinematic eye fully realized the most beloved fiction novel series of all time long live middle earth
Feb 27 2009,positive,da movie has orlando bloom in itmmmmmmmmmmmmmwhat else can i say
Feb 27 2009,positive,its the perfect link between the other two movies and just as brilliant
Feb 27 2009,positive,i know tolkien tends to neglect female characters but compensating for it by extending arwens role through her romance with aragorn bored me to tears other than that a good film
Feb 26 2009,negative,is this the one with frodos friends sitting on this huge tree that started talking and walking omg that was so boring  id walk out if i werent with my bf at the time  even the war has images resembled dalis elephant paintings i just couldnt get into this moive
Feb 26 2009,positive,probably the weakest of the three lotr films but please dont think that means im implying this film is anything less than brilliant
Feb 26 2009,positive,ive watched this movie probably a hundred times already ganda grabeh
Feb 26 2009,positive,very interesting especially the action part also the adventure of fighting the bad guys
Feb 25 2009,positive,but masters our friend
Feb 25 2009,neutral,boring the too much time in the battle scenerepetitive
Feb 25 2009,negative,i dont understand this entire trilogy haha
Feb 25 2009,positive,by far my favorite lord of the rings
Feb 25 2009,positive,absolutely love lotr
Feb 25 2009,positive,good movie loved the book liked the movies
Feb 25 2009,positive,my vote is for the extended directors cut subtract a star for the theatrical cut
Feb 25 2009,positive,two towers carries the burden of being the middle of a single story but in many ways it is the most satisfying chapter in the trilogy relationships are deepened while new characters are introduced and the battle sequences and visual effects are very impressive it also marks the true entrance of andy serkis in his unforgettable turn as gollum and the march of the ents will send chills down the spine seek out the superior extended cut
Feb 25 2009,positive,the directing is outstanding
Feb 24 2009,negative,too long and boring for me
Feb 24 2009,positive,might be my fav out of all of them still after it was over wanted to see that ring thrown into the valcano this one was so good though you had to go see the third one
Feb 24 2009,positive,love lotr its action packed good story pleny of characters to idolise plenty of magic fantastic
Feb 24 2009,positive,my favorite of the trilogy hours and hours come together for a great climatic battle
Feb 23 2009,positive,adapted brilliantly
Feb 23 2009,positive,liked this one the best  lots of great stuff
Feb 23 2009,positive,although this second installment of the lord of the ring trilogy lacks in action and with a slower pace it provides great continuity and anticipation buildup for the third and final installment
Feb 23 2009,positive,same as the others in my opinion
Feb 23 2009,positive,so hard to make a good second film in a trilogy but jackson achieved it
Feb 23 2009,positive,excellent middle episode of lotr well worth watching for a second time in 10 years
Feb 23 2009,positive,this one is by far my favorite they are all spectacular but this is the one i favor
Feb 23 2009,positive,got to be watched with surround sound on loud
Feb 23 2009,positive,a slight step down from fellowship the story is still fascinating as are the characters but the pacings a bit off here and you feel the length of the film more than you should
Feb 23 2009,positive,better than the fellowship
Feb 22 2009,positive,it may be the weakest of the trilogy but its still a hell of a film love the battle at helms deep
Feb 22 2009,positive,drags on a bit you wait for the battle for too long
Feb 22 2009,positive,better than fellowship but still far off the epic masterpiece status it is hailed to be
Feb 22 2009,positive,whats taters hobbitses whats taters precious
Feb 21 2009,positive,the most breathtaking scenes of the 3 episodes are herethe battle scenes its so realas if its happened way back
Feb 21 2009,negative,what george macdonalds phantastes was to cs lewis the lord of the rings has been to me my parents tried heroically to make a reader out of me but it was not until my fifthgrade english teacher began reading aloud from the hobbit at the end of her classes that a book genuinely ignited something inside me i persuaded my mother to buy me a copy which i devoured almost overnight then discovering it to be a prequel to a larger work i ploughed through jrr tolkiens threevolume masterpiece with more enthusiasm than true comprehension since those days i have read it at least a dozen times on my own or aloud to my wife i own cassette and cd copies of the bbc radio serial not to be confused with the appalling minds eye version i have read much of tolkiens other work both fiction and scholarship and despite the eventual blossoming of my interests in many subjects and a personal library of over 2000 books the great epic of the end of the third age of middleearth remains at the core of my literary world and has permanently and profoundly shaped my perspective on life and my understanding of joy sorrow hope sacrifice humility courage beauty loyalty devotion and the simple homely pleasures and gifts the modern world too easily throws away or ploughs under    like many i felt betrayed by peter jacksons cinematic version not because he inevitably adapted the story to perceived film requirements but because he completely changed the fundamental spirit and motivation of every major character save one patience was reinterpreted as lack of confidence loyal friendship as accidental encounter bold resolution as the product of trickery and manipulation and selfless wisdom and virtue as low selfesteem these were not the people i knew in tolkiens hands however their great hearts had baptized my imagination nurtured my soul for nearly half a century and set me on the path to becoming a devotee of books and of the english language
Feb 21 2009,positive,i love this movie except for the fact that it has liv tyler in it and she looks like a horse d
Feb 21 2009,positive,such a great moviethe three of them
Feb 21 2009,positive,absolutely love these movies
Feb 21 2009,positive,perhaps the weakest of the trilogy suffers slightly from the switches between different characters in different places nevertheless a superb film
Feb 21 2009,positive,one of the best film eve
Feb 21 2009,positive,effects are great acting is great but the pace is sooo damn slow i felt like it was a lot longer than the first one
Feb 21 2009,positive,9910  with the two towers peter jackson brings the lord of the rings trilogy into deeper and darker waters with impressively epic battles and depth
Feb 21 2009,positive,great mindblowing battle scenes and astonishingly beatifuly scenery still enchanting but takes a little bit more serious tone than the first part just as the book itself does smeagol is excellent they managed to portray the nature of his personality very well
Feb 20 2009,positive,excellent  watch the directors cut  a lot more footage
Feb 20 2009,negative,i dont remember much about this one these movies are so fucking long they start to run together
Feb 20 2009,positive,brilliant movie saruman gets blown up by a tree
Feb 20 2009,positive,the perfect continuation a movie that can really tell the story of middle earth
Feb 20 2009,positive,the scenery is marvelous the animations great and the story superb
Feb 20 2009,positive,this rating and ranking represents the entire saga
Feb 20 2009,positive,best film ever with the other 2 in the triology
Feb 20 2009,positive,most certainly the grittiest of the three films the two towers truly stands out the personal elements hit home the special effects are greatly improved and the interaction of the characters on a personal level are much deeper who doesnt feel the sadness and hurt that theodon does when he stands weeping over the grave of his son no parent should have to bury their child very real and sincere
Feb 19 2009,positive,like the other two simply outstanding
Feb 19 2009,positive,andy serkis my strange obsession emerges again ahaha

Feb 18 2009,positive,still disagree with the direction of the faramir business
Feb 18 2009,positive,the best of the trilogy
Feb 18 2009,positive,and the stories goes
Feb 18 2009,positive,one of the best movies ever made
Feb 18 2009,positive,the best from the trilogy
Feb 17 2009,positive,i love the lotr they are all in my top tenand i must say that the two towers was my fav out of the 3 you already know the characters theres more action and suspenseit was great i loved it
Feb 17 2009,positive,good stuff right here
Feb 17 2009,positive,not as good as the first better than the last
Feb 17 2009,positive,could have skipped this movie and not been confused watching the third one
Feb 17 2009,positive,great nerd flick i need to find these at the walmart 5 bin someday because i would watch them over and over if i could
Feb 17 2009,positive,1010 the fellowship was a great opening to a great trilogy but two towers is even better the cgi is fantastic and looks photo realistic i loved the gollum charecter very impressive
Feb 17 2009,positive,this is my personal favorite lotr film mostly because of the action this is an action film and because nothing reeks of cgi also the relationships are all great and the music is beautiful i am a huge lotr nerd and this movie just satisfies me every time
Feb 16 2009,positive,my babies love the whole sequel
Feb 16 2009,positive,i love lotr hahaand this one is def the best in the series

Feb 15 2009,positive,a magical and exciting film into the mind of tolkin
Feb 15 2009,positive,best of the series in my opinion
Feb 14 2009,positive,best of the trilogy i think this one should have captured best picture if any of the films were
Feb 14 2009,positive,excellent stuff drags a bit during the frodosam journey
Feb 14 2009,positive,ahhh frodo and the other hobbits
Feb 14 2009,positive,great movie the final battle was awesome
Feb 14 2009,positive,if u can get past the sacrilege of making a movie out of these books at all this is about as good as it gets
Feb 14 2009,negative,still cant stand frodo
Feb 13 2009,positive,the opening scene of the two towers provides an outstanding yet very brief taste of action cinematography and special effects only to be matched and far surpassed in the final hour of the film the stunning events of the third hour of the two towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film and while the first two hours serve finely as story development they primarily build anticipation for the final hour which mostly depicts the battle of helms deep more than anything else the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience its a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour but i take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while
Feb 13 2009,positive,yes a must have movie excellent
Feb 12 2009,positive,none of these films are badbut there is a loss of momentum as you move through them this film could really have been called killing time in middle earth because nothing much really happens to push the plot forward yeah sure big battles and orcs throwing themselves about however the magic that i felt in the first movie was lost to what appeard to be trying to make you feel like the plot was moving when nothing much was really happening
Feb 12 2009,positive,just as awesome as the novel
Feb 12 2009,positive,im not a huge tolkien fan but i loved the films
Feb 12 2009,positive,a tale with marvelous charactervery inspiring and captivate right into your soul cant resist the charming warriors and the only fantasy that seems real everytime you watch it
Feb 11 2009,positive,the 2nd of 3 amazing movies d
Feb 11 2009,positive,the second installment of the trilogy very well done if you have read the books the movie will not disappoint you
Feb 10 2009,positive,i like how she slew the dragon and killed the dark warlord
Feb 10 2009,positive,lived up to the expectation of the first film with epic action and great adventure
Feb 10 2009,positive,the best of the three
Feb 9 2009,positive,amazing films  the entire series
Feb 9 2009,negative,i hate this one the most they changed things that were totally unecessary and had nothing to do with time issues
Feb 9 2009,negative,orcs are my homies brup cough
Feb 9 2009,positive,not better nor worst than the first one still appreciate the quality of the artwork
Feb 8 2009,neutral,ill admit i was a fangirl at some point but after some serious thinkingyeah not that great

Feb 7 2009,positive,the first movie i watched with kc which he says sucked whatever
Feb 7 2009,positive,in my opinion this one outshines the other movies in the trilogy mostly because of the intense claustrophobic battle at helms deep which occupies nearly an hour of the movie  this movie just had the right feel to it because the first movie had to introduce all the characters and by the end of the last movie i was just looking for the series to come to a final resolution  this one solidified the series as a trilogy to be respected
Feb 7 2009,positive,the books are way better and the movies ruined the character of faramir
Feb 6 2009,negative,encore trop long 
Feb 6 2009,positive,gr8 adventure movie  but its 2 long

Feb 4 2009,positive,best of the movie trilogy
Feb 4 2009,positive,i think the difficulty in comprehending the plot is higher in this one than in fellowship of the ring but this is a good movie and the ending battle is massive and heroic
Feb 4 2009,positive,my least favorite of the lotr films its good but not great for one theres too much focus on story yeah i like the story but theres too much at one time theres only one major fight scene and its way to long the film is also to chopped up theres too much going on at one time but all in all its a good movie
Feb 4 2009,negative,out of script ideas  kill some more orcs
Feb 4 2009,positive,cool points for legolas at helms deep
Feb 4 2009,positive,gimli  legolas make a great team with aragorn

Feb 2 2009,positive,the battle scenes are so exciting to watch
Feb 2 2009,positive,loved the whole trilogy
Feb 2 2009,positive,better film by a hair than the last one due to the fact that it has one freaking resolution after the climactic battle of helms deep instead of the fifty million different denouements like rotk had
Feb 2 2009,positive,its hard to film a edit a movie with no beginning and ending but they were able to pull it off in this middle movie of an epic trilogy
Feb 1 2009,positive,i know it couldnt follow everything but i forgive that more than sayharry potter movies
Feb 1 2009,positive,this entire series is totally epic
Feb 1 2009,positive,i was wishing i was one of the cast

Jan 31 2009,positive,this movie like its former was also really well done i enjoyed the first one a little better but this definetely followed as an excellent second movie i must say i loved nordicbased rohirrim i also thought this film did a great job of showing the transition from the fantasy world of elves hobbits and dwarves in the fellowship to the more medievalstyle land of the men
Jan 31 2009,positive,loved every second of it
Jan 31 2009,positive,good movie but not my type of genre

Jan 30 2009,positive,not quite with the first one but fab still and without it the sotry wouldnt be complete
Jan 30 2009,positive,wow  harry potter is childs play compared to this stuff
Jan 30 2009,positive,the second installment on this mammoth epic works well as a second act following at least a couple of the greek tragedy elements the movie has a faster pace than the original peter jackson understands the sequence in the trilogy and creates a second act filled with plot development and character development he even inserts a new treacherous character with soliloquies delivered towards the audience    since the plot is stretching the characters some of the actors have the chance to stretch with it is in this second act that the audience is able to realize the completeness of his vision to shot the three films once and for all from the beginning of the movie jackson does not miss a bit from the previous movie he picks up the action immediately after without any preamble this provides seamless continuity for all the actors and for the audience to understand the arch of the story also we are able to expand on the visionary task for the movie as a whole    visually new zealand provides jackson with a marvelous backdrop for middle earth and although it relies on animation some of the old style movie making gargantuan sets up in the mountains give a greater scale to the movie jackson is impeccable at creating a world and visuals to match that world    recurring actors perform in front of the camera with continuity specially viggo mortesen orlando bloom and elijah wood in main role of frodo ian mckellen returns more powerful as gandalf new to the action are miranda otto as rohirrim and a digitized performance by andy serkis as gollumsmeagol who not only provides the voice for the characters but some of the basis for his digital movement
Jan 29 2009,positive,again amazing movie  loved it

Jan 27 2009,positive,i love this movie more

Jan 26 2009,negative,watched it fell asleep a few times during it not my type of movie and that gollum guy is scary
Jan 26 2009,positive,much better after i read the book
Jan 26 2009,positive,again simply great movie making
Jan 26 2009,positive,seriously i never thought a movie could get better than the fellowship of the ring but it did this movie should be 1 on the imdb top 250 this movie as long as it was captivated me from start to finish and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period    yes i have read the book any chapters cut out at the end of books iii and iv will probably themselves in the next installment if you havent noticed the beginning of the two towers was actually closed the fellowship of the ring on the big screen    gollum was a cg masterpiece he added some light to this incredibly dark movie at the same time there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy or just want to kill him smeagol was probably the most diverse character ive ever seen    elijah wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie as did sean astin ian mckellen who captivated us in the last movie captivated us even more in this one viggo mortensen john rhysdavies and orlando bloom made a great trio they laughed together cried together prospered together and suffered together this trio gave life to aragorn gimli and legolas eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through miranda otto    the music need not be discussed its greatness speaks for itself    favorite scene the battle of helms deep possibly the greatest scene in the book 50 of the trailer and action packed climax to this beautiful movie    the movie like its predecessor fails to bring us closure but thats ok closure will come next year i look forward to the return of the king    the two towers is now my favorite movie of all time    the scale is broken 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this movie my movie my precious
Jan 26 2009,positive,as we go deeper into the woods its epic and i love it so much  ps the extended versions takes the credits especially this one is miles better than the teater version
Jan 25 2009,positive,best out of the trilogy
Jan 25 2009,positive,they just keep getting bettera absolute must seerock on
Jan 25 2009,positive,good movie awesome special effects some great acting
Jan 25 2009,positive,everyone hates it when i saw this but i just never got into the series
Jan 25 2009,positive,awesome but definetly not as good as the other 2
Jan 25 2009,positive,set in a time of uncertainty in the land of middleearth a tale which charts a heroic quest which centers around an intrepid hobbit the future of civilization rests in the fate of the one ring whi read more   ch has been lost for centuries powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it but fate has placed it in the hands of a young hobbit named frodo baggins who inherits the ring and steps into legend a daunting task lies ahead for frodo when he becomes the ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the one ring in the fires of mount doom where it was forged but he cant accomplish this task alone a fellowship bands together to lend frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission the wisdom of gandalf the loyalty of his friends sam merry and pippin the courage of aragorn and boromir the precision of legolas and the strength of gimli they are aided in their quest by arwen galadriel and elrond whose knowledge of the ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey

Jan 24 2009,positive,arguably my favorite movie of all time fabulous consistent thrilling beautifully shotnever fails great movie great book great series
Jan 24 2009,positive,a nicelooking wellmade film adaptation of a bloated convoluted borderline inaccessible fantasy story  i feel about gollum dangerously close to how i feel about jar jar
Jan 24 2009,positive,this is the one that should have taken the oscars
Jan 24 2009,positive,maybe my favorite of the three i think it may be because of the lack of frodo in comparison to the others
Jan 23 2009,positive,got the whole entire boxed set with all the extras  loved all three movies
Jan 23 2009,positive,its long but when you watch all three you know it was worth the hours of your life youll never get back
Jan 23 2009,positive,has to be one of the best mad films of all time visually stunning superbly acted moving
Jan 23 2009,positive,not as good as the first but better than the third
Jan 23 2009,positive,this film rules them all
Jan 23 2009,positive,the film begins with a flashback set to the first film with gandalf battling the balrog on the bridge of khazaddûm but this time continues from gandalfs perspective with the scene continuing to follow both as they hurtle down below fighting while in freefall frodo awakens from his dream and continues his journey with his trusted and loyal friend sam they are then attacked by the ringpossessed gollum wishing to retrieve his precious from the ones he thinks stole it from him the hobbits subdue and bind him with sams elven rope given to him by the elven elder galadriel in lórien sam distrusts gollum and wishes to abandon him but frodo understands the burden of the creature and takes pity on him realizing they are lost in the emyn muil and in need of a guide frodo persuades gollum to lead them to the black gate of mordor    in rohan the pack of urukhai run across the grassy landscape with their captives merry and pippin aragorn legolas and gimli are in pursuit following three days of running legolas surmises the hobbits are being taken to isengard where saruman is marshalling his urukhai forces to do the bidding of sauron in the kingdom of rohan home of the horse lords king théoden is mentally and physically weak due to the enchantments of his steward gríma wormtongue who is secretly in the service of saruman orcs and wild men of dunland incited by saruman freely roam the land and kill the people including the kings only son théodred théodens nephew éomer interrogates gríma angrily realizing he has lustful eyes for éomers sister éowyn and that he is now an agent of saruman gríma banishes éomer for undermining his authority and éomer sets forth to gather the remaining loyal men of the rohirrim throughout the land    frodo and sam traverse the dead marshes passing the undead fallen warriors of the second age who haunt the marshes and evading a newly seated ringwraith on his flying fell beast later they reach the black gate finding it to be heavily guarded they observe a contingent of easterlings from rhûn arrive to reinforce the garrison only to have gollum reveal to them a less risky path sam remains distrustful but frodo gives him the benefit of the doubt meanwhile éomer and his rohirrim ambush and kill all of the orcs and urukhai holding the two hobbits captive at nightfall during the battle merry and pippin narrowly escape their captors by fleeing into the trees where they are aided by treebeard the oldest of the ents    éomer later encounters aragorn legolas and gimli and in turn tells aragorn there were no survivors of the orcurukhai slaughter upon arriving at the battle site aragorn uses his tracking skills and finds hobbit tracks that lead into nearby fangorn forest the three discover a wizard who is ultimately gandalf reborn now known as gandalf the white the quartet proceed to travel to edoras where they exorcise sarumans hold on king théoden and banish wormtongue théoden is confronted with his dead son and rather than risk open war decides to flee to a large fortress called helms deep which in times of trouble has saved the people of rohan gandalf leaves to find éomer and his rohirrim promising to return within five days as a strong attraction draws éowyn to aragorn during the journey to helms deep wormtongue flees to orthanc and tells saruman of rohan breaking from their grip saruman then decides to destroy rohan    in ithilien gollum battles his split personality in an attempt to befriend frodo and sam and ultimately banishes his evil half the two hobbits are witness to an ambush of southrons but are taken captive by soldiers of gondor meanwhile along the journey to helms deep the travelers are attacked by sarumans wargs and their orc riders during the battle aragorn is dragged by a warg and falls off a cliff into a raging river as the griefstricken survivors reluctantly move on to helms deep in rivendell elrond knows that the age of elves is ending and convinces arwen that it is hopeless to stay and should leave for the grey havens elrond shows her a prophetic vision if she waits for aragorn even if he succeeds in destroying sauron and becomes king of gondor he will still succumb to mortality arwen will suffer grievously once he is dead and she is left to wither away she reluctantly agrees to leave elsewhere frodo and sam are taken to henneth annûn and brought before faramir the younger brother of boromir gollum eluded capture and in order to save his life is lured into a trap unknowingly by frodo faramir learns of the one ring and seeking to prove his worth to his father decides the ring shall go to gondor in rohan aragorn washes up on the rivers edge and is nudged back to consciousness by his horse brego battered but undaunted he rides to helms deep passing sarumans army of urukhai which numbers at least 10000 strong his arrival is met with relief but is short lived with the news of only 300 men in the stronghold in the midst of despair a battalion of elves from lórien led by the elf haldir arrives to assist in the ensuing battle at fangorn forest merry pippin treebeard and other ents hold a council to decide on the roles of the ents in the war with saruman    in the pouring rain the battle of helms deep begins with a flurry of arrows from both human and elven archers cutting down dozens of urukhai scaling ladders are placed upon the deeping wall and the uruks swarm up to engage the defenders the defenses are slowly being breached and the enemy manages to destroy the wall through its sewer drain using a rudimentary explosive device created by saruman despite aragorn and gimlis best efforts the urukhai manage to penetrate the main door and soon the stronghold is overrun in the midst of battle haldir is slain and the few remaining elves fall back into the keep in the hornburg however the uruks have also scaled the walls and have breached the gate forcing the defenders to retreat into the keep in fangorn treebeard and the other ents have decided to not have any involvement in the war frustrated pippin cleverly takes him to the section of fangorn forest saruman has decimated near isengard treebeard is filled with rage at sarumans betrayal and commands all other ents to seek vengeance the ents gather and embark upon the last march of the ents    meanwhile as the keep is now under attack and realizing gandalfs words before he departed aragorn and the rest make one last gallant ride on horseback to attack the urukhai army in a desperate bid to allow the rohirrims women and children to escape as the riders are surrounded and all seems lost gandalf éomer and two thousand riders of the rohirrim arrive to push back the urukhai into the justarrived forest of huorns outside of helms deep elsewhere the ents also attack isengard tossing stones and rocks while collapsing a dam to flood its surroundings    at the ruins of osgiliath faramir and the hobbits are confronted by a ringwraith and its fell beast with the help of sam frodo narrowly escapes the ringwraiths efforts to capture him sam narrates how the story must go on and how they should keep pressing forward as faramir decides to free them to finish their quest gandalf and the others now know a full war is inevitable as sauron will surely seek retribution for the defeat of saruman and hope rests with frodo and sam who have resumed their journey to mordor with gollum accompanying them once again and having felt betrayed after his subsequent mistreatment by faramirs men gollums darker nature returns and decides to reclaim the ring by leading frodo and sam to her
Jan 22 2009,positive,makes far more sense if you watch the extended version spectacularly fulfilled vision of the book
Jan 22 2009,positive,do i really have to say that i love it
Jan 22 2009,positive,one of the most powerful films in history
Jan 22 2009,negative,yea  as with the first installment just not really my thing
Jan 22 2009,positive,lord of the rings is prolly the most epic movie in the world
Jan 21 2009,positive,great series not loyal to the books but really who expected 100 authenticity
Jan 21 2009,positive,wat more can i say if not wonder
Jan 20 2009,positive,even though this one didnt do as well as the other two i think i preferred this one
Jan 20 2009,positive,maybe the best of the trilogy
Jan 20 2009,positive,again awesome movie the battle of helms deep is spectacular
Jan 20 2009,positive,theyre taking the hobbits to isengard
Jan 20 2009,positive,oh handsome aragorn  to see you on your horse with a sword and long hair is so inspiring
Jan 20 2009,negative,i didnt get the whole lord of the rings thinghalf the time i didnt know what they were talking about
Jan 20 2009,positive,the battle of helms deep is perfect this is the middle film of lord of the rings in many ways
Jan 19 2009,negative,and the 22000 battle scenes
Jan 19 2009,positive,heartthumping  scary with the orcs and everything but awesome my fave out of the 3
Jan 19 2009,positive,big fan of these movies
Jan 19 2009,positive,this is the best movie of the trilogy the extended edition clocks in at just under three hours and it never stops the action moves briskly from scene to scene and the production and acting are very well done for the most part the only drawback is that in a film there is no space for interior dialogue or narrative as there would be in a book to further explain tolkiens characters and mythology as a result the uninitiated should follow the story very closely as all the characters especially similar looking longhaired bearded white men and quick editing back and forth make for some confusion still the two towers is one of the best fantasy films ever made and does a fine job of striking a balance between staying loyal to the source material while keeping itself accessible to a general audience
Jan 19 2009,positive,its tough being the middle one of a trilogy and i didnt have the privilege of seeing this one of the bigscreen but this remains beautiful and exciting for the most part
Jan 19 2009,positive,honestly this is my least favorite of the lord of the rings films  dont get me wrong its an awesome film  its just that it takes forever to get to the final battle scene  and until it gets there its all either scenes of walking talking trees and just very little action  what i mean by this is that the pace of the middle 2 fourths of the film is very slow  the final battle is very rewarding however so in the end it all works out however personally i feel the other 2 installments are better due to consistent pace
Jan 19 2009,positive,this was an awesome trilogy
Jan 19 2009,positive,very entertaining  i definitely like the two towers more than i liked the fellowship of the rings  the only problem with this movie was that it seemed like the middle chapter of a story which it was  unlike other big trilogies star wars for example there didnt seem to be any solid sense of closure  at least this movie didnt end as abrupt as the last although i held my breath as the final action sequence approached and hoped that the movie wouldnt stop right as it was about to get good  the final action sequence did come and it was pretty sweet  also the bulk of the cgi was pretty convincing especially the cgi gollum
Jan 19 2009,neutral,a good chance for a snooze before the excitement of lotr 3
Jan 19 2009,positive,these movies are soo awesome
Jan 19 2009,positive,not as good as 3 but all 3 are a masterpiece
Jan 19 2009,positive,this is the only one i saw i liked when the walking trees fell in the water
Jan 19 2009,positive,if im gonna sit there for three hours i need an ending i dont care if its how the book ends
Jan 19 2009,positive,my favorite lord of the rings which isnt saying much
Jan 19 2009,positive,my least favorite of the series
Jan 18 2009,positive,the war in this film is the most awesome than in any film i ever watched
Jan 18 2009,positive,excellent continuation of the lotr saga but it definitely works better when viewed in close proximity to the two surrounding entries which is no problem for me since i tend to view the whole thing as one film anyway
Jan 18 2009,positive,definitely my favorite of the series in the two towers we see a shift in the focus of the story we see the struggle of man and the evil that has vowed to vanquish it the battle of helms deep was one of the greatest screen battles of all time it was way more magnificent than anyone expected for being the middle of the series it was able to be its own movie and not just a follow up of fellowship or a precursor for return of the king
Jan 18 2009,positive,yep good film but gollum is annoying
Jan 18 2009,positive,a great sequel the whole series is amazing
Jan 18 2009,positive,the best in the trilogy
Jan 17 2009,positive,best movie ever again
Jan 17 2009,positive,i liked tlotr but the hobbits and the lack of special effects makes me wonder why they recorded so much instead of just making it shorter and better
Jan 17 2009,positive,perfect sequel peter jackson took the rescue to bring tolkiens work to the screen with one of the most complex film projects in recent years the two towers was the most difficult to do for two reasons  a for being the one in the middle it has neither a beginning nor an end so he must engage the audience from the start and motivate the public to see the return of the king the final  b the two towers is the weakest of three books and take it to the screen needed alot of skill and charm and visual impact to viewers  the three films were shot at the same time evidence of the great assembly the three tell the same story the three present and this no less than the rest impressive costumes especially the dresses of the rohirrim both natural scenery and by computer really impressive so faithful to the descriptions in the novel here stands the milieu of edoras and helms deep especially meduseld castle  drama war adventure fantasy all combine in this superproduction jackson once again demonstrated its capacity  soundtrack to a category admirable the rohan theme is beautiful and epic perfectly conveying the warrior heart of this people that tolkien translated so well in the novels and peter jackson in the movies
Jan 17 2009,positive,legalos is so fine
Jan 17 2009,positive,hey orlando you looks a lot better with ur elf ear maybe u should wear it more often u know
Jan 17 2009,positive,better than the first movie awesome
Jan 17 2009,positive,this one was soooo good by far my favorite of the trilogy  action packed hot actors and actually had some comedic relief good times
Jan 17 2009,positive,another tolkien wonders with the magic of peter jackson
Jan 17 2009,positive,the epic war was the greatest scene in the whole movie the  the elfprince legolas greenleaf is so incredible when fighting enemies he was almost indestructible
Jan 17 2009,positive,pretty good  but confusing
Jan 17 2009,positive,magnificent peter jackson did it once again
Jan 16 2009,positive,the weakest of the trilogy but in no way does that make it a bad movie fantastic direction cinematography acting and everything else just not my favorite
Jan 16 2009,positive,great movie but it drifts the most from the books
Jan 16 2009,positive,one of my best films of all time
Jan 16 2009,positive,i loved all the lord of the rings trilogys
Jan 16 2009,positive,magnificent lead up to the battle love the talking trees
Jan 15 2009,positive,fantastic amazing stunning mindblowing thrilling teriffic one of the best movies ever made
Jan 15 2009,negative,i lose brain cells watching these movies
Jan 15 2009,negative,just as boring as the first oneyay
Jan 15 2009,positive,the weaker of the three but still an amazing film
Jan 15 2009,positive,my favorite of the 3
Jan 15 2009,negative,the only reason i would see this is to see orlando bloom
Jan 15 2009,positive,even the trees walk
Jan 15 2009,positive,loved it and again i was right there w frodo
Jan 15 2009,positive,weakest of the trilogy but still great the dead marshes scene is  one of the greatest of the trilogy
Jan 15 2009,positive,this is the way to make a sequel i loooooove tolkiens work and jackson proves he read the books this is vintage adaptation and it set a trend of quality i doubt jackson will be this good again
Jan 14 2009,positive,better than the first it didnt feel as long and had more to the story good movie
Jan 14 2009,positive,nice the best lotr series ever
Jan 14 2009,positive,tree beard is amazing  love the film love them all  
Jan 14 2009,positive,smeagol steals the show in this one
Jan 14 2009,positive,same with this one i like all the lord of the rings
Jan 14 2009,positive,exceptional films i didnt even mind the length
Jan 14 2009,positive,despite the fact that gandalfs return was played off as a great surprise even though every trailer clearly showed it it is still an awesome scene  despite the fact a certain attack not existing in book it added to the tension and the stakes of the movie  despite a certain group showing up to give their aide again not in the books it totally makes me cheer inside  despite the crazy wild dreams i have the meeting of the ents looked exactly how i imagined it  but liberties were taken  parts of the movie do drag  characters are cut out the story is reworked and stuff happens that shouldnt happen or outright dont happen  but it all works
Jan 13 2009,positive,message of this movie if you want to stop the abominations of the military industrial complex from destroying the natural and beautiful world all the different races from the different regions of the world need to all cooperate with one another and destroy the allseeing illuminati eye watching over the world the lord of the rings is an ancient name for saturn which in astrology governs karma among other things you reap what you sow it also has something to do with a couple of twin towers as jordan maxwell often says wake up get a life its all right before your eyes hidden in plain sight    and oh yeah the acting costumes cgi and special effects were flawless very well done
Jan 13 2009,positive,although its the weakest of the three films in my opinion its still a mustsee
Jan 13 2009,positive,excellent for its genre which is one i generally cant be bothered with beautiful cinematography i am alas completely bored with all the adulation for the actors and the films in this series by now and was never a big tolkein fan
Jan 13 2009,positive,this is a good one i like it becase they show a lot of orlando bloom and i know his brithday witch is january 31977
Jan 13 2009,positive,a modern masterpiece this retelling of tolkiens vision falls short mostly in that it glosses over many important details and subplots
Jan 13 2009,positive,my favorite triology
Jan 13 2009,positive,the best out of them all but still nothing like the original but meh you cant win them all
Jan 13 2009,positive,the less faithful to the book but even as a lotr book fan i still find myself enthralled the opening sequence is beautiful
Jan 12 2009,positive,lord of the ring trilogy is the first movie to convince me that hollywood is not just about sex bond bond girl or star wars
Jan 12 2009,positive,best one out of the trilogy
Jan 12 2009,positive,i think i have already put out a report on the lord of the rings movies but let me tell you again perfect
Jan 12 2009,positive,perfect fight scenes and a decent story
Jan 12 2009,positive,mr carlson my film comp teacher in high school said that he thought each lord of the rings film was better than the last because peter jackson had more time to work on them as you go down the line i agree i think each part in the story gets more intense the battles are more perfected the stakes higher and im not going to pretend it doesnt have its slow moments but for as slow as those moments are the battle scenes are as actionpacked and just as fellowship did you are more than ready to watch the next installment upon the films end
Jan 11 2009,positive,very awesome movie i love the whole middle earth thing
Jan 11 2009,positive,a great adaptation of a great book series
Jan 11 2009,positive,of the three my least favorite  but i still loved it  
Jan 11 2009,positive,too much killing not enough adventure and intirgue and magic but even if it is just an action movie something the book its supposedly based on never was its at least a good one
Jan 11 2009,positive,its only worth comparing it to the other lor movies and for me its better than return of the king as good as fellowship  because all the lor movies are better than almost anything else in history
Jan 11 2009,positive,the two towers continues the second chapter of this epic story and it contines to come back with excellence thank god for peter jackson
Jan 11 2009,positive,in the trilogy the least attractive but not less beautyfully filmed on the vast planes of new zealand
Jan 11 2009,negative,musik effects costumes filming is all great most of the acting is also superb the only problem the screen play wirters have absolutely no idea about the lord of the rings battles people or really anything as a matter of fact its just a shame to see what potential they had and how badly it was wasted this is by far the worst movie of the trilogy
Jan 11 2009,positive,arwsome loved every minute of all three films
Jan 11 2009,positive,ay no  star wars rules
Jan 11 2009,positive,lotr is one of the best series ever made
Jan 11 2009,positive,for imaginationbest film at all
Jan 10 2009,positive,theres just too much detail about the movie that its hard to summarize its excellency into one paragraph let me just say that although it did rearrange how the story goes in the book in movie terms it still did the book justice there are just certain things you have to do from changing book to movie to keep it entertaining on the screen with that said everything else about the movie just works the actors the battles the visuals andy serkis has definitely redefined the muchcriticized animated character and made him as real as other actors in the film i am truly drooling for the next and final trilogy
Jan 10 2009,positive,its really very hard for a real tolkien fan like me to rate this with a smashing five star too many details have been left out details that wouldve majestically fit the silverscreen and miraculously made every tween quasifan seek out and actually read the entire series but jackson though a fan is but mortal and has to finish the film sometime within the century if he was to keep the production cashflow flowing being a geek means you have to be made of sterner stuff to be able to hold back the rage when literary masterpieces that you so dearly lust are adapted into another medium something is always lost in translation
Jan 10 2009,positive,the best installment of the trilogy in my view
Jan 10 2009,positive,great i love all of the fighting  it was so awesome
Jan 10 2009,positive,my least favorite but has an epic finale
Jan 10 2009,positive,a great epic fantasy film
Jan 10 2009,positive,if you have read these books how could you not love the moviesi think they did an excellent job at bringing that amazing story to life
Jan 10 2009,positive,overlooked as the middle child in peter jacksons film trilogy  this may be the best film of the group if not for the open ending that keeps you craving for the wrapup
Jan 10 2009,positive,the name of god the merciful   after greeting and peace   written characters and words are published and ojml tabro read   days come and go and years do not recognize the meaning in all this is one of the only moments of remembrance   but how do we build this anniversary if we are friends and members of the forum   visit baazavitk happy   you will find the latest games and programs and ideas films songs and pictures and mahatp instant chat and many find it on the site

Jan 8 2009,positive,the best middle movie of any sequel
Jan 8 2009,positive,the least of the three but it is beyond crticism  it gets us from point a to point c and we want to go on the journey
Jan 8 2009,positive,my least favorite after seeing it i thought thefellowship may have been a fluke it lacked the character of fellowship and rotk treebeard part was very very very overdone and dull i must say  this movie nearly ruined the series for me
Jan 8 2009,positive,very good like the first and third avoids the sophomoresequel slump  anything you can say for any of these you can say for all good for all ages
Jan 8 2009,positive,very good war of the ents helms deep

Jan 5 2009,positive,orlando bloom is the hottest great movie
Jan 5 2009,negative,tom watches this movie way too much im sick of it
Jan 5 2009,negative,run fight run fight run fight boring
Jan 5 2009,positive,i thought it would be impossible for peer jackson to improve on the first film but he does gripping
Jan 5 2009,positive,the best sctript direction conceptual design miniture work cgi acting stunt team battle scenes color grading makeup and costume i think that might cover it lol

Jan 5 2009,positive,i watch these movies every time im sick bad
Jan 4 2009,positive,the fellowship has been broken boromir is dead frodo baggins and samwise gamgee have gone to mordor alone to destroy the one ring merry and pippin have been captured by the urukhai and aragorn legolas and gimli have made friends of the rohan a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war led by its aging king théoden the two towers between mordor and isengard baraddúr and orthanc have united in their lust for destruction the corrupt wizard saruman under the power of the dark lord sauron and his slimy assistant gríma wormtongue have created a grand urukhai army bent on the destruction of man and middleearth the rebellion against sauron is building up and will be led by gandalf the white who was thought to be dead after the balrog captured him one of the rings original bearers the creature gollum has tracked frodo and sam down in search of his precious but is captured by the hobbits and used as a way to lead them to mt doom the war of the ring has now begun
Jan 4 2009,positive,is it me or are gimli and legolas flirting with each other this entire film frankly their banter gets a little annoying and took away from the near perfect aragorn character  however the three remaining members of the fellowship carry this flick as sam and frodo are a little slow especially pregollum encounter once gollum shows upwell take that jar jarcgi character with bad grammar and hops around like hes on speed yet no one hates him see it was just that lucas is a fucking tool  gollum is actually even more perfect than aragorn yeah more perfect thats a measurement gollum gains our empathy he is harmless in appearance even at his angriest and hes always sneaking with unsure intentionsa little bit of brilliance here by jackson the cgi department and serkas  viggo looks like jim morrison at times  war is a really big risk for elves if youre gonna live forever what would make you risk that i would never go to war because i want a better chance at living for another 50 years or so if i had like 500 years on the line i wouldnt fight anyone for anything fuck that
Jan 4 2009,positive,excellentthe war is just fantastic
Jan 4 2009,positive,less hobbitsbetter movie
Jan 4 2009,positive,this one is hugemut see
Jan 4 2009,positive,cinematography is outstanding  if you havent seen it yet where have you been
Jan 4 2009,positive,love it love it love it loved the book and all three of the movies
Jan 4 2009,positive,picking up where the first film left off peter jacksons the two towers throws the remaining members of the fellowship into the scattered chaos of middleearth now fully under siege by the forces                    picking up where the first film left off peter jacksons the two towers throws the remaining members of the fellowship into the scattered chaos of middleearth now fully under siege by the forces of sauron while frodo and sam journey to the dreaded mordor merry and pippin are held captive by orcs and aragorn legolas and gimli search for their abducted companions an intense epic that features one jawdropping sequence after another the two towers more than carries its weight as the crucial centerpiece of the lord of the rings bstarring bsean astin cate blanchett orlando bloom billy boyd bernard hill christopher lee ian mckellen dominic monaghan viggo mortensen miranda otto john rhysdavies liv tyler karl urban hugo weaving david wenham elijah wood    img
Jan 4 2009,positive,when i broke my back i watched all three of these movies back to back i soon became addicted to it lol
Jan 3 2009,positive,long and meandering all the better to take in the awesome visuals
Jan 3 2009,positive,i loved all of the lord of the ring movies
Jan 3 2009,positive,my favorite of the three the battle at helms deep is on par with the opening scenes of saving private ryan
Jan 3 2009,positive,the best of the trilogyloved it
Jan 3 2009,positive,okay    thought that the characters and acting was great the only problem i had was all of a sudden gollum appears out of nowhere 
Jan 3 2009,positive,the middle section of most trilogies is usually the hardest film to successfully keep of track being set the problem of transitioning events from the beginng to the set up at the end middle sections are usually composed of the aftermath of part one and the suiting up for part three and as a result can be bland expository affairs that leave out the fire and brimestone of either bookend film while the two towers suffers a little from the fragmentation of the storys focus it is no less an accomplishment than its predessorsuccessor  jacksons warmhearted direction still infuses every shot with a glowing otherworldliness the mystical energy of tolkiens world now flowing freely and effortlessly in this fabricated universe the ensemble grows like a family coping with itself as it gets older each performance adding or unearthing layers as new events add tiny amounts of information into the immense and dense literary world the real showstealer is andy serkis revelatory turn as the slimy gollum arguably the most memorable and iconic element of the entire film series personalising everything from facial tics to that famous scratchy voice its a fantastic piece of acting not overshadowed even by the impressive digital effects though king kong was a bigger even more astonishing effort its gollum whos the foul heart of tolkiens fantasy canon and the biggest sleeping threat to any of the main characters  though it mostly sets the stage for the final push in return of the king two towers helms deep battle sequence is the one everyone remembers exhausting visceral and overwhelming its a classic david and goliath struggle set to a thunderous beat and blinding tension and its final conclusion is almost as satisfying and emotionally rewarding as saurons defeat in part three  on its own its not much without its brother efforts but two towers is more than just a simple bridge in this epic series its a continuation of the lush extraordinary craft that makes the trilogy so damn brilliant
Jan 3 2009,neutral,liked the bad guys good fx
Jan 3 2009,positive,middle stories are usually tough  just like the book this second installment is usually the weakest of the three
Jan 3 2009,positive,keeping the storyline in check it is a wonderful addition to the first movie and it kept me waiting do keenly for the third
Jan 3 2009,positive,wonderful and terrific actors
Jan 3 2009,negative,i get so confused with these movies
Jan 2 2009,positive,u can see it over and over again

Jan 2 2009,positive,all time favorie movies could watch over and over again
Jan 2 2009,positive,i liked this one better than the other two
Jan 2 2009,positive,all three were wonderful beautiful and amazing
Jan 2 2009,positive,weakest of the trilogy but still gosh darn awesome
Jan 2 2009,positive,i watched it once its not an over and over film for me
Jan 2 2009,positive,the epic story continues without loosing momentum or power i love this film just as much as the last
Jan 2 2009,positive,another second film in a trilogy that made you go when the hell is the third one coming    great battle scenes and special effects  gollum andy serkis really stole the show in this one
Jan 2 2009,positive,not my favortie lord of the rings movies but still good
Jan 2 2009,positive,one of the best films ever made i eaven think that it is the best of the three and that is really well done by peter jacksson since its often the middlefilm that fails
Jan 2 2009,positive,so glad i didnt let my dungeons and dragons prejudice stop me from seeing this
Jan 1 2009,positive,my least favourite of the three but important to the whole trilogy the battle at helms deeps is amazing in its size and intensity
Jan 1 2009,positive,very good movie what else to say
Dec 31 2008,positive,definitely the best epic series of all time jrr tolkien is unparalleled to this kind of literature i wish he is still alive to continue the story the way the movie was created was amazing i admire those who became part in the making of this film
Dec 31 2008,positive,how could some1 nt wana watch dis movie lol
Dec 31 2008,positive,not as good as fellowship or king but a great bridge film
Dec 31 2008,positive,excellent  especially the long version
Dec 31 2008,positive,watched with friends and it wuz hilarious that the only reason i think its good
Dec 31 2008,positive,excellent endthey really did tolkien proud
Dec 31 2008,positive,for the usually difficult middle movie this does pretty well yes peter jackson changes things and yes the editings a little off but consider the plusses gollum in possibly the best scene of the year his argument with himself and the stupendous battle at helms deep and may i add the tension building up to that battle has not been seen since zulu
Dec 31 2008,positive,best one of the trilogy  the battle of helms deep will always be a remarkable and memorable scene in film history
Dec 30 2008,positive,the adventure continues with more action and creatures  this sequel matched the original the fellowship of the ring if you loved the first one you will surely enjoy this one packed with more characters and more battles and the triumphant return of gandalf this will bore no one im ready for the final chapter of this lively adventure
Dec 30 2008,positive,cinematic perfection part 2
Dec 30 2008,positive,ku movieliked the whole movie
Dec 30 2008,positive,i liked that everyone gets separated and theyre all fighting their own wars and the journey each character goes through the battle sequences were phenomenal as always the acting was topnotch peter jackson was again shows why hes the king of epic movies
Dec 30 2008,positive,the turning of the tide
Dec 30 2008,positive,i want to see it again and again simply timeless
Dec 30 2008,positive,meh  lotr is a good movie go watch it the soundtrack is great i may have watched the trilogy to much so 3½ might be low
Dec 29 2008,positive,all of the rings movies are 5s to me so difficult to even think of them as three separate films probably the best trilogy ever
Dec 29 2008,positive,okay even though the story takes some serious departures from tolkiens text the screenplay is superb and the acting is topnotch  andy serkis gollum is nothing short of amazing
Dec 29 2008,positive,helms deep is just made of awesome
Dec 29 2008,neutral,not as good as the other two
Dec 29 2008,positive,let the battles begin
Dec 29 2008,positive,the final battle piece makes up for some of the annoying story telling better than the first not as good as the last watch this
Dec 29 2008,neutral,sooo  thats not bad
Dec 29 2008,positive,i love these movies
Dec 29 2008,negative,fell asleep literally
Dec 29 2008,positive,solid as the other two installments if maybe the worst still one of the finest films of the decade
Dec 29 2008,negative,i am more beautiful then galadriel and arwen and ewyoen tt
Dec 29 2008,positive,also very good helms deep baby
Dec 28 2008,positive,the two towers continues the lotr trilogy with few missteps
Dec 28 2008,positive,i am a huge lotr fan this movie was awesome i love this movie trilogy
Dec 28 2008,positive,it seems slow however it still amazes me great storytelling
Dec 28 2008,positive,you can never go wrong with any of the lord of the rings movies  fantastic acting beautiful locations and filming and a timeless story of friendship and determination to see something through no matter the cost make this movie series a classic and a masterpiece
Dec 28 2008,positive,the fist movie was better that the second
Dec 28 2008,positive,another great movie which you shouldnt miss
Dec 27 2008,positive,really nothing can bet this
Dec 27 2008,positive,i cant keep track of this st  im sure it was great
Dec 27 2008,negative,its okay but im lost throught the whole thing
Dec 27 2008,positive,in the two towers peter jackson takes some notable departures from the book most of them in order to build tension and create a definite climax for the middle movie in his trilogy  by now it is very clear that we are seeing peter jacksons vision of the lord of the rings  action and spectacle come first and he certainly delivers the battle of helms deep is amazing  at times though jackson seems overly preoccupied with the malevolence and disgusting mouths of the orcs and urukhai
Dec 27 2008,positive,fresh centera brilliant continue of the storycenter
Dec 27 2008,positive,the best of alllove the battles
Dec 27 2008,positive,this is a surprisingly strong second movie trilogies usually have a weak second movie and the book is the weakest its the middle you dont read it alone you read it with the other books but the movie is surprisingly strong  i love rohan and the battle sequences keep a lot of running around the countryside focused and moving forward even when theyre cutting to frodo and sam
Dec 26 2008,positive,yeah its a good story and although not really my taste i recommend it
Dec 26 2008,positive,wonderful movie including the other two
Dec 26 2008,positive,not as good as the others
Dec 26 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy
Dec 25 2008,positive,the lord of all movies 
Dec 24 2008,positive,possible better than the book
Dec 24 2008,positive,nothing to say except amazing
Dec 24 2008,positive,great movie though more centered on action like every sequel is it is also an instant classic
Dec 24 2008,positive,i own all 3 they are classics on the 2nd one now must watch the 3rd again
Dec 23 2008,positive,great works from peter jackson
Dec 23 2008,positive,the battle scenes were intense rockin
Dec 23 2008,positive,good movie just a bit convoluted
Dec 23 2008,positive,return of the king is the best
Dec 22 2008,neutral,another series i just didnt get
Dec 22 2008,positive,fav lord of the rings movie
Dec 22 2008,positive,my least favorite of the three but still great
Dec 22 2008,positive,this one would have been better if i had seen the first one unless this is the first oneidk ive seen the 2nd and it was good lol
Dec 21 2008,positive,do people actually judge this trilogy based on the individual component films that seems dubious now that theyre all out on dvd neverless this one is better than the first because it really introduces gollum and the horse people and the epic siege
Dec 21 2008,positive,my favourite of the 3 films
Dec 21 2008,positive,have you noticed this second installment has been materially influenced by 911 there is even a suicide bomber when orcs attacked the hams heed the plot is a little thin in fact the most attractive part is the interactions between frodo sam and gullum
Dec 21 2008,positive,this one was better than the first
Dec 21 2008,positive,the extra footage is fantastic excluding every new scene involving the ents which bogs the film down slower
Dec 21 2008,positive,very good if you like fantasy adventure
Dec 20 2008,positive,best bit is in the battle at the end lasts so long
Dec 20 2008,positive,such a good movie i love all three of them elijah wood and all the rest of the actors and actresses in this movie did a fantastic job
Dec 20 2008,positive,the only lotr movie that the directors cut hardly improved at all  time was mismanaged characters ruined and plot courses devices mishandled  nevertheless the details were so good and certain scenes so wondrous that the movie still has to be respected and liked
Dec 20 2008,positive,my fave of the 3 probably the helms deep sequence alone makes it awesome
Dec 19 2008,positive,loved the fight sences
Dec 19 2008,positive,the best one maybe
Dec 19 2008,positive,silly to talk about this movie separately from the others but the rohan story is the best part of the novel and the film
Dec 19 2008,positive,arguably the best of the trilogy middle acts usually are but marred by being the least moving of the three and by a few overly stupid untolkien moments of the 3 this is also the least faithful to the book although i usually judge books and their adaptations by different criteria watch the extended version for a fuller and richer experience in fact of the 3 movies this is the one that is the most improved by its extended version
Dec 18 2008,positive,lord of the rings is fantastic
Dec 18 2008,positive,i own it and i love it
Dec 18 2008,positive,set in a time of uncertainty in the land of middleearth a tale which charts a heroic quest which centers around an intrepid hobbit the future of civilization rests in the fate of the one ring
Dec 17 2008,positive,this movie should have been better
Dec 17 2008,positive,just when you think that it couldnt get better it does
Dec 17 2008,positive,a magical entertainment along the lines of the wizard of oz and singin in the rain the trilogy should be seen as one great masterpiece a trilogy sure to be considered one of the great classics in the years to come these films will be studied in film schools so young filmmakers can see how to make a real movie
Dec 17 2008,negative,i felt like i was playing a video game
Dec 17 2008,positive,better than the first
Dec 17 2008,positive,my favorite of the three films introduces eowyn who is my favorite character except for boromir
Dec 17 2008,positive,essential to connect fellowship of the ring to return of the king this particular movie becomes a little tedious in comparison even with the first movie  it definitely is worth watching and certainly worth owning and far from a bad movie but not the best of the trilogy by any means  ironically as far as the books are concerned i preferred this installment to fellowship of the rings
Dec 17 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy the dvd cut is immense these films cant really be faulted
Dec 16 2008,positive,i like the last one betterbut this one still rockin
Dec 16 2008,positive,this was an awsum movie probly the best
Dec 16 2008,positive,a good movie to fall asleep to  way too long
Dec 16 2008,positive,pretty good but loooooong
Dec 16 2008,positive,loved the books thought the film a pretty fair tribute
Dec 15 2008,neutral,i prefer the books and my imagination but these films are visually amazing
Dec 15 2008,positive,these movies r rly good and kewl 2 watch but again they r so incredibly long
Dec 15 2008,positive,longest movie ive been able to sit through best part is when orly goes down the wall with his arrows hotness
Dec 15 2008,positive,  not rated yet
Dec 15 2008,positive,i like it very much              fantastic
Dec 14 2008,positive,a fine film yet not as fine as numbers one and three in this epic trilogy
Dec 14 2008,positive,almost as good as the first
Dec 14 2008,positive,the second installment of the lord of the rings series is a very good movie i recommend everyone to watch it
Dec 14 2008,positive,two towers is better than fellowship in my opinion and it is possibly the best in the whole trilogy it is tied with return of the king but that could just be because the battles in this film are breathtaking and the whole thing is completely compelling
Dec 14 2008,neutral,i dunno i watched all ofthem and i never really got into lotr
Dec 14 2008,positive,the movie follows frodo and sam on their quest to destroy the ring it also has many subplots the problem for the film makers or so i read was that the story in the book jumps from many groups of characters to another in fast succession for instance first the viewer is shown gandalf then he thinks what happens to merri and pippin then he is suddenly taken to gondor to see aragorn and co and then saruman and the ents then frodo and sam then he is whisked to rohan and so on this was done surprisingly well in the movie so that it is not at all messed up in my opinion   like in the first movie the effects screenplay casting music and action are topnotch in the two towers extended collectors edition many new scenes have been added and some have been extended   the scene where treebeard the ent comes to save the two hobbits merri and pippin from a tree which tries to eat them looks like a modification of the books event where tom bombadil saves the hobbits from the same kind of fate in the book fellowship of the ring there was also the scene where frodo was attacked by a wraith in a catacomb of kings soon after leaving for the town of bree that scene was left out entirely but in this movie the two towers there was a scene at the marshes with sam and gollum where he fell into the marsh and was attacked by wraiths it also resembled that scene which had been left out from the first movie my favorite scene is the one where elrond foresees arwens fate in rivendell while he attempts to persuade her to accompany him to valinor on the last of the white ships the other of my favorites is the battle at helms deep where when all hope seems to be lost aragorn and theoden decide to ride to meet their enemies the film has many such great lines and moments like the rest of the movies it gets better the more its watched a great movie
Dec 13 2008,neutral,the entire lord of the rings series is fundamentally flawed unfortunately my true beef with the story goes back to the books but the movies actually make this flaw even more obvious than the book does   what is this flaw the main plot of the story is boring you know the plot to destroy the ring can you honestly say thats why you enjoy the moviebook   not at all everyone gets so sick of sam and frodo that the only reason the movie is any good is that the rest of the characters are entertaining and the big war scenes are great so we have a main plotline that takes a backseat to what would have otherwise been secondary or tertiary characters that are way cooler and more interesting than your main ringbearers    now to be fair to this episode it is probably the more entertaining of the 3
Dec 13 2008,positive,i remembered being over excited and with maybe too high expectations when i went to the cinema to watch this film sure worth watching twice
Dec 13 2008,positive,love all lotr movies one of the best long but worth watching never a dull or boring moment

Dec 13 2008,positive,my favorite of the three i particularly liked watching gollum the orcs were also cool and christopher lee always makes for a great villian
Dec 13 2008,positive,i love this movie i think its the best film of the best trilogy in the world peter jackson is truly a master in the art of film making its soundtrack is beautiful beyond words and it adds a level of emotion not often found in any movie let alone fantasy the characters are dynamic there is humour but there isnt so much that it overwhelms the serious tone of the story
Dec 13 2008,positive,in the book this was my favorite part of talethe movie didnt disappointthe landscape of new zealand almost stole the show
Dec 13 2008,positive,then i shall die as one of them

Dec 7 2008,positive,everything that a sequel should be it picks up immediately after the first and just like fellowship the feel  of watching it surpasses entertainment and makes it as if you are reading the classic book great acting with great lines intense action with stunning visuals make this my 2nd favorite movie of all time

Dec 5 2008,positive,one of the best trilogies i have seen yet
Dec 5 2008,negative,what can u do i am a hobbit fan and pj positively raped the hobbits character
Dec 5 2008,positive,just as good as the original and still contains the heartaching beauty of the film the battle scenes were more massive than the first one and the peril of the story adds to the excitement and awe the performances was topnotch but i think orlando blooms legolas is a little bit flat and lacked something that characters like aragorn have one of the films main reason for its creation is the boxoffice gain but the greatness and sheer perfection of the film made director peter jackson far from sellingout very far from it the story has been modified a little to fit the tastes of filmgoers who watch movies for its entertainment value but it still contains the quality that film critics are looking for the last hour of the film is breathtaking as the story came to a startling almost biblical confrontation between good and evil the two towers maintains the greatness of its predecessor and only few films like the godfather can do that unbelievable
Dec 5 2008,positive,loved it the extended version is a must have in blueray
Dec 4 2008,positive,the mummy daddy and extended family of epic films

Dec 1 2008,positive,well done movie but i found it very slow paced compared to the other two its very well done and the acting is wonderful but it just felt like a very long movie the other two didnt feel like four hour movies
Nov 30 2008,positive,less close to the book than the fellowship of the ring but still good
Nov 30 2008,positive,i unabashedly love everything about lotr this was no exception
Nov 30 2008,positive,excellent adaptation but many things from the book are left out
Nov 30 2008,positive,all of these were excelently made spelled wrong i know  
Nov 30 2008,positive,probably the slowest of the 3 movies this is still a masterpiece
Nov 30 2008,positive,why is there an option other than five stars for these movies
Nov 30 2008,positive,slightly darker than the first one but still as big as ever d huge amounts of action and adventure top class plot and acting thi striology is the best ever such an amazing film with great cgi
Nov 30 2008,positive,anytime theres a movie with talking trees that kill goblins and orcs im for it

Nov 28 2008,positive,beyond worth it bye the extended 3 disk sets money well spent trust me
Nov 28 2008,positive,the second film in the series althought it is infact tied with the first it still is a massive success in terms of storyline development and the visual effects lord of the rings keeps you interested in the movie from the start to end wondering where the characters will end up and how things will go down
Nov 28 2008,positive,one of the very few movies that keeps on entertaining no matter how many times youve seen it
Nov 28 2008,negative,got it on dvd its boring

Nov 27 2008,positive,number two of the lotr trilogy this one is not bad however return of the kings was better
Nov 27 2008,negative,slightly better than the 1st one boring as hell though
Nov 27 2008,positive,if you have read the book you will be surprized very close too the book
Nov 27 2008,positive,best of the trilogy more action than the first and far more compact than the long winded finalethere is a much bigger sense of urgency in the depiction of frodos quest and the battle for helms deep is cinematic gold the problem i have always had with the third movie is all of saurons army is destroyed by a shipful of ghosts in about 15 seconds so what was the fuss about the battle for helms deep is dark and with very little cgi used you really believe the people of rohan could be destroyedthe last march of the ents is also sublime to watch as they attack saruman gollums character continues to improve and the motion capture by serkis is really specialone of the best fantasy movies of all time
Nov 27 2008,positive,my favorite of the three  the battle for helms deep was like the alamobut with a happier ending  the fight seemed more personal than the battle for the white city in iii which made it better for me
Nov 26 2008,positive,one of the very few movies that were true to the books they can from
Nov 26 2008,positive,the battle of helms deep was truly awesome and helped this movie avoid the sophomore slump trilogies often experience
Nov 26 2008,positive,all this movie is best
Nov 26 2008,positive,worthy sequel with a fantastic finale
Nov 26 2008,positive,close ups galore still marvelous
Nov 26 2008,positive,again what can i say another brilliant movie i am a really big fan of all 3 movies my favorite is the return of the king but i also thought the battle at helms deep in the two towers was magical to watch the battle in return of king was superb and a little sad but loved it
Nov 25 2008,positive,alot of people say he two towers is the worst movie of the lord of the rings trilogy i disagree the war scene at helms deep is one of the strongest battle sequences in the trilogy
Nov 25 2008,positive,follows the book worse than fellowship of the ring but a great movie in its own right see the extended version
Nov 25 2008,positive,enjoyable enough but soooo loooong
Nov 24 2008,positive,never read the book but after seeing the movie i didnt have to haha
Nov 24 2008,positive,love to watch this movie  so amazing

Nov 23 2008,positive,orlando cate viggo david wenham liv all please step up for a thorough licking
Nov 23 2008,positive,another good movie i like
Nov 22 2008,positive,they screwed up the ents  too cartoony  and i still have problems with the general pacing of the three films  beautifully done though and this film has the best climactic battle of the three helms deep though mildly marred by a dwarftossing joke and legolas using a shield as a skateboard and waaay too many slomo shots of people gazing at others faces
Nov 22 2008,positive,best final battle of the series helms deep was amazing
Nov 22 2008,positive,watch the extended version of this one  it better aligns with the book still stellar filmmaking
Nov 21 2008,positive,smeeeeeagol why does it cry smeagol  wicked men hurts us master tricked us  yes precious we told you he was tricksy we told you he was false
Nov 21 2008,negative,i only give it half a star because theres no zero star option total bastardization of the original work

Nov 21 2008,positive,least favorite out of the series movies and book nothing much happens int his one except for gollum
Nov 20 2008,positive,this would have been a better movie if they would have cut down pun intended some of the ents footage

Nov 20 2008,positive,another masterpiece
Nov 19 2008,positive,this is a great trilogy i dont suggest you try reading it though

Nov 19 2008,positive,if you never read the books this movie is awesome
Nov 19 2008,positive,its hard to find fault with any of the trilogy
Nov 18 2008,negative,i liked the first movie but when i saw this one i thought it was very boring and i fell asleep in the theatre
Nov 18 2008,neutral,another movie about walking
Nov 18 2008,positive,the fact that this moves so far from the book really lowered the rating for me the butchery of faramir the mythical arwen subplot just a lot of wasted time on a love interest that never appears in the books at all eowyn was never a temptation for aragorn only a source of grief for her cold loneliness
Nov 18 2008,positive,my favourite of the three one of my favourite films ever
Nov 17 2008,positive,loved everything about it the plot characters the scenes it was just a really good movie
Nov 17 2008,negative,gollum is awesome but the rest of it didnt do much for me

Nov 17 2008,positive,cant really review this as a separate film because by itself its a bit boring considering the whole story it works as a nice contrast
Nov 17 2008,neutral,i wasnt that fussed with the lord of the rings trilogy
Nov 16 2008,positive,the greatest movie ever made
Nov 16 2008,positive,some excellent sequences parctularly good in the extended cut the ents are cool a slightly long intro before the real interest though
Nov 16 2008,positive,lots of walking through fields
Nov 16 2008,positive,i do see why the had to put the battle of pellenor in the third film but i still feel they cheated a little bit in doing so  as it is the battle for helms deep easily makes up for that
Nov 15 2008,positive,peter jackson did a fantastic job of these movies what a huge undertaking there were a lot of things that were different from the book which werent necessary to change overall the effects were great the characters superb the scenery fantastic and generally great storytelling the battle of helms deep is absolutely the high point of the film
Nov 15 2008,positive,the best one due to gollum
Nov 15 2008,positive,worth seeing if only for the first 5 minutes with gandalf and the balrog some superb acting compared to the book the helms deep scene gets a little overdone but overall very good  but the worst of the trilogy

Nov 13 2008,negative,the first 10 minutes or so involves running through a bunch of samey landscapes hire an editor alreadyhire an editor already
Nov 12 2008,positive,it was a great idea to shoot all three movies in one time frame it ensured that the story was exactly a continuation of the previous one i love how ian mckellen portrayed gandalf that was a perfect fit
Nov 12 2008,positive,this was my favorite lor movie never read the book
Nov 12 2008,positive,review will be written whenif rewatched probability high    first viewing 26122002

Nov 10 2008,positive,loved this series of films
Nov 10 2008,positive,a great sequal with enough comedy to balance out the gravity of the situation
Nov 9 2008,positive,two towers is as good as fellowship of the ringwith a few minor flaws
Nov 9 2008,positive,another typical one where the book was sooo much better
Nov 9 2008,positive,even though the elves turn up to fight at helms deep i still have to give this film full marks
Nov 8 2008,positive,great film and the triology was great but the books are so much better
Nov 8 2008,positive,i love the opening scene
Nov 8 2008,positive,the battlefield scene in the night with heavy rains is the best ever

Nov 4 2008,positive,i have all of these   i like these better than harry potter
Nov 3 2008,positive,extended version was well worth it here i thought  hey you dont really care how old aragorn is  or why  well i do  besides that the battle at helms deep watching the trees go ape shit on saruman everyone with their own little reason for doing what they do regardless of what you might think of the occasional overkill on the noble and brave virtues this is great cinematic storytelling
Nov 3 2008,positive,yes its good but its trying to damn hard to be a worthy film whats wrong with making a good old fantasy like hawk the slayer
Nov 3 2008,positive,goes without saying the second masterpiece from peter jackson
Nov 3 2008,positive,good first time around but couldnt watch it again
Nov 3 2008,positive,my favorite out of the three the journey has already begun so there is so slow down exposition our heroes are all seperated on their own mission sam and frodo meet up with gollum a great character and one of the most interesting things about these movies sauron and saruman closes in and you have an awesome brad douriff as wormtongue who takes over a diseased kings mind and kingdom i really liked how this one unfolded the orcs were cool the battles were well done i just think this is the best one the first took too much time to setup and the third didnt know when to quit there are so many good scenes in this how about frodo and sam outside the castle with the parade of orcs who smell them return of the king wound up getting all the rewards which i dont understand aside from lame oscar politics but two towers is the most suspenseful and emotionally engaging one out of the three
Nov 3 2008,positive,one of the best movies ever

Nov 2 2008,positive,he is the embodiment of what aragorn should be
Nov 2 2008,positive,not the popular choice from lotr but it is my favorite
Nov 2 2008,positive,could not wait for this sequel to began as the adventure continues with frodo and sam and aragorn legolas and gimley not that much action as the first but the fight scenes were cool towards the end of the movie classic gandolf entrance as he rides into battle  awesome
Nov 2 2008,positive,excellent excellentexcellent  my favorite of the 3 films a masterpiece of fil making

Oct 28 2008,positive,loved it what an amazing story and characters
Oct 28 2008,positive,not as good as fellowship but the riders of rohan and gollum are great
Oct 27 2008,positive,the second installment on one of the greatest trilogies of all time
Oct 27 2008,positive,quick note i am reviewing the theatrical releases of the lotr trilogy and not the special extended dvd editions for an explanation as to why please visit my myspace blog for the uncut rendition of this review    two towers marks the beginning of the splitup of the fellowship gathered to destroy the evil ring the humanelfdwarf combo of aragorn legolas and gimli go in search of their trailing hobbit friends pippin and merry who were captured by the orcs fortunately the two prisoner hobbits manage to escape the orcs themselves into the forest of fangorn where they are acquainted with the treecreatures known as the ents when their search party enters the forest they come across an old friend but i wont spoil how the mystery friend got there meanwhile throughout the film the carrier of the ring frodo and his loyal associate sam are continuing their quest to dispose of the ring once and for all the ring is still taking a toll on frodo but not so much as it is with gollum a creature formally known as smeagol who once possessed the ring and has been following frodo and sam waiting for his chance to strike the gollumsmeagol splitpersonality debate scene is not only some of the best visual cgi in recent memory but also can be noted as andy serkis debatably academyoverlooked performance i can understand the snub but i dont agree with it the two towers is a vital piece of the trilogy and fits it as well as the others do however of the three it gets the metaphorical bronze medal my main beef with the film is the ents and their incredibly slow ways sure they add variety and character to the series and do their part in providing an awesome actionpacked ending for this film but long and literally drawnout dialogue is about the last thing a damnnear 3hour film needs still this is a small bicker and the entire trilogy is still a mustwatch
Oct 27 2008,positive,the second instalment of the great trilogy
Oct 27 2008,positive,way to go jackson
Oct 27 2008,negative,i really love the book but it just doesnt work in film form for me i just got tired of watching astin cry throughout the entire film it has some nice eye candy but it gets boring watching frodo sam and gollum walking around for almost 3 hours fellowship worked great on the big screen but they should have ended it there
Oct 27 2008,positive,the second one of the great trilogy
Oct 27 2008,positive,not as good as first and third of the trilogy but still enjoyable  i feel they could have made two brilliant movies from the three
Oct 27 2008,positive,my favourite of the books  they even moved the beginning of it to the end of fellowship and its end to the beginning of return
Oct 26 2008,positive,the second chapter of the lord of the rings continues the nowsplit story threads of the members of the fellowship frodo sam and gollum are trekking toward mordor viggo orlando and indys friend sallah involve themselves in horsecountry politics and battles and the other two hobbits meet and enjoy getting to know a tree i liked the first of these tremendously thought the second had some good and some bad and thought the third was just agonizingly retarded  even if its in the book that way seriously a fucking tree this movie had some of what made the first great but began sliding toward some of what made the third such a disappointment     the battle scenes toward the end became painfully long redundant and boring gandalf the white never reclaimed the wonderful personality of gandalf the grey and the giant talking philosophizing tree ugh this movie misses badly sean beans boromir and while the character of his brother does give the story some of the qualities he had thats a loss that cannot be made up perhaps part of what bothered me about the direction this movie takes is that it no longer has the intimacy of the first movie from the beginning of the fellowship the fate of all hung in the hands of these people but their journey their struggles felt much more close to each other it was about these nine individuals trying to move through the world now its become about some of these nine leading armies saving nations riding to the rescue in some cases becoming almost cartoonish in the superheroness in one of the battles our heros seem to understand their own invincibility that theyre needed for movie 3 so they cant possibly die now i recognize that the filmmakers were following the sourcematerial and that most of my complaints are for tolkien but that doesnt change the fact that these things bothered me     all that said the film is still overall a success due almost entirely to story of sam frodo and gollum while andy serkis got all kinds of weird with the character including doing the cast audiocommentary track for the dvd in both characters creepy gollum was fascinating as a tortured soul who desperately craving both the ring and the friendship of the hobbits he intends to steal it from the tension between sam and frodo over the issue of gollum is nicely played and elijah wood is very good in showing the weight that the ring is beginning to have on him i had higher hopes for the second and third installments in this series and was somewhat disappointed by both but this movie left open the possibility of good things to come and had enough quality to stand on its own
Oct 26 2008,positive,loved the story and acting  my favorite of the three  excellent job  whoever did the costume and makeup for this one  lighting and camera angleseverything
Oct 26 2008,positive,the story continues as two small hobbits frodo  sam realize that the task they have taken on is an adventure more extraordinary and perilous than they ever couldve imagined  virtually perfect a fantastic brillantly directed epic with breathtaking scenery and score  the best film of the trilogy
Oct 26 2008,positive,another awesome 3hour epic
Oct 26 2008,neutral,one ring to rule them all  hah lame
Oct 26 2008,positive,brilliant trilogy watch all 3
Oct 26 2008,positive,love the battle of helms deep
Oct 26 2008,positive,the weakest of the trilogy but still a mighty fine way to spend your day
Oct 26 2008,negative,the entire trilogy sux ass
Oct 25 2008,positive,love these movies i read all the books and they did an awesome job putting them on the big screen
Oct 25 2008,positive,the best thing about all of these three movies is that they kept the same casewriters and the quality of each of them stayed high see them all
Oct 25 2008,positive,great film had some awesome gimli moments
Oct 25 2008,positive,the best series of movies ever
Oct 25 2008,positive,121422  45  watched it again after reading the book and being stuck in the hospital  it is entertaining and does follow the book reasonably well despite plot changes to move the story  good build up to the final film  it was on vudu      102508  35  1001 movies to see before you die
Oct 25 2008,positive,a masterpiece the scale and scope of the action is massive and pretty much leaves the first installment in the dust
Oct 25 2008,positive,this movie is awesome
Oct 24 2008,positive,the worst of the three but still a great movie  them orcs fucking get it
Oct 24 2008,positive,you shall not pass gandelf
Oct 24 2008,positive,this installment happens to be the more darker of the threehowever i still enjoyed it especailly gollum my precious
Oct 24 2008,positive,all these movies are worth seeing at least oncebut opt for the extended editionstotally worth it
Oct 24 2008,positive,in the middle of the lord of the rings trilogy we see a lot of great depth and range in people i would have never expected to see it from some of the best performances came from this film alone we really get to see andy serkis shine as the digital character of gollum whose obsession with the ring is so powerful that his maddening is astonishingly effective and chilling christopher lee is back again as the evil count dookuwait i meant to say saruman and he is accompanied by the treacherous lord wormtongue played astonishingly well by brad dourif i was very happy to see him play this role and do such a great job with it lets see a lot more characters are introduced theres more battles between good and evil over the ring not to mention one of the best battle sequences that ive ever seen this second entry definitely kicks it up a notch from the first film and leaves you dying to watch the final one at the time of watching this we all had to wait a full year for the next one causing murders and riots to skyrocket which were mostly done by me
Oct 24 2008,positive,directed by peter jackson   genres action  adventure drama   released december 12 2002     october 24 2008  all will be sacrificed all will be lost unless all unite against evil      the lord of the rings  the two towers is by far the best film in the epic triology again we see the journey of frodo and sam to mordor in their mission to destroy the ring      peter jackson again manages to deliver perfection in the form of an amazing movie      not only do you feel the struggle of frodo and sams mission but we also witness links to the first film that make the attachments on certain characters like aragorn gimli and legolas much stronger      we are introduced to gollum in this second installment and see one of the most visually stunning battle scenes of all time      i unlike seeing the first film was lucky enough to see this at the cinema it was an experience ill never forget
Oct 24 2008,positive,beautiful cinematography and a cgi first  kevin jackson loves his location and makes the most of the new zealand countryside while the entirely computer generated gollum is an amazing creation  motioncaptured and voiced by andy serkis the lotrs crew show george lucas how its done  gollum has personality and while he never looks completely real the performance ensures you soon forget that hes made of pixels  engaging and exciting stuff
Oct 23 2008,positive,if you dont like these you are insane
Oct 23 2008,positive,my favorite of the three movies
Oct 23 2008,positive,a bit more hollywoodize then the first but still an epic masterpiece
Oct 23 2008,positive,one of the three greatest movies of all time
Oct 23 2008,neutral,cant really remember it well
Oct 23 2008,positive,personally i didnt dig this one as much as the other two but that happes a lot with the middle movie
Oct 23 2008,neutral,aargh    ditto as with the harry potters
Oct 23 2008,positive,the movie is amazing helm deeps battle scene a movie in the movie itself is one og the greatest movie moment of all time
Oct 22 2008,positive,ultimate in all trilogies ever made tolken would be proud
Oct 22 2008,positive,i love this trilogy
Oct 22 2008,positive,better than the first part and has more action
Oct 22 2008,positive,best lotr movie not return this is the one to watch helms deep is the best battle of the series
Oct 22 2008,positive,see my review for fellowship of the ring  its the exact same in its greatness
Oct 22 2008,positive,not as good as the first but still great
Oct 22 2008,positive,not as good as no3 but helms deep scenes amazing
Oct 22 2008,positive,great sequel better than the first not as good as the last
Oct 21 2008,positive,best of the three lord of the rings movies
Oct 21 2008,positive,first time i watched this i was blown away by the battles brilliant
Oct 20 2008,positive,the only downside is that the number of things peter jackson had to cut out but overall its up there but not quite epic enough
Oct 20 2008,positive,fitting continuation of fotr in ttt i particularly love the ents and galadhrim elves oh and gollum
Oct 20 2008,positive,who doesnt love lord of the rings
Oct 20 2008,positive,i thought this film had the best action scenes out of the trilogy
Oct 20 2008,positive,the epic battle sequences alone are worth the price of admission or the price of the dvd
Oct 20 2008,positive,not a good as part one but a good sequel
Oct 20 2008,positive,this trilogy was superbly done by director peter jackson watch the extended version for a more faithful adaptation of the books
Oct 20 2008,positive,and so the saga continues with the lord of the rings the two towers and while i would argue that this is the weakest of the trilogy it is still an incredible achievement and an awesome piece of  cinema picking up directly where the first film ended the two towers is able to follow three different plotlines frodo and sam merry and pippin aragorn legolas and gimli while avoiding becoming muddled and convoluted peter jackson using the natural beauty of new zealand lets his camera swoop and dance across battlefields and forests giving the film a real epic scale and feel that is so rare in modern cinema just the perfect combination of superb writing directing acting music effects both practical and digital and every other area of film production the final hour  of this film the battle at helms deep is one of the most impressive astounding audacious and fantastic pieces of celluloid ever made brutal bloody and brilliant  filmmaking of epic grandeur
Oct 20 2008,positive,as my partner says a magnificent movie i love the trees too all the movies are first class
Oct 19 2008,positive,orlandoneed i say more
Oct 19 2008,positive,great movie although not my favourite of 3 the ending battle at helms deep is fantastic
Oct 19 2008,positive,this was my favorite of the three the battle makes me wanna pee my pants in excitement
Oct 18 2008,negative,i finally understand why i dont like these movies   with the books it was like entering a private world but with the movies its like look its the kid from goonies and isnt that steven tylers daughter  anyway ron paul was good as gandalf though he did a better job as magneto in the xmen flicks
Oct 18 2008,neutral,two towers gets a two and half its the best lor movie by farkeep moving tree people
Oct 18 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy let down a little by the ending imo
Oct 18 2008,positive,the best film from the best film trilogy so far  goes beyond mere action into meditations on bravery the nature of war environmentalism and true friendship
Oct 17 2008,positive,the art direction is great
Oct 17 2008,positive,one of the best cinematic experiences of my life
Oct 17 2008,negative,jake the dorks that like this movie
Oct 17 2008,positive,an incredibly beautiful adaptation of the first installment of the legendary book series the special effects are outstanding and the musical score is amazingly appropriate for this 21st century epic  the acting is give and take cate blanchetts small appearance in this movie is attractive but leaves the only academy award winner2004s the aviator of the cast unimpressive overall elijah woods performance is rather weak as he plays within a very small range of emotion sean bean sean astin and viggo mortensen give solid supporting performances while two of the films cinematic legends stand out  sir ian mckellen and ian holmes use their classically and shakespearean trained acting styles to add wisdom and majesty to their characters gandolf the grey and bilbo baggins these two deserving senior thespians earn their places as strong stars in a film certainly not lacking in respected actors
Oct 17 2008,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
Oct 17 2008,positive,again the extended version made the already powerful theatrical version even better lots more visual effects that should have been on the theatrical version and the battle of helms deep was crazy
Oct 17 2008,positive,as frodo baggins contiues into the realm of mordor on a mission to destroy the one ring the fellowship give chase to a group of urukhai from isendgard intent on saving the hobbits merry and pippin from the clutches of the white wizard      as frodo draws ever nearer the enemys land his friends must travel through fangorn forest to the rohirrim city of edoras and finally fight off the forces of the wizard saruman at the fortress of the hornburg helms deep    the second movie of the epic film trilogy is amazing pick it up if you love fantasy  it will keep you captivated to the very end
Oct 17 2008,positive,loved the tolkien books  movies were good
Oct 17 2008,positive,great film  might be my favorite because of the riders
Oct 17 2008,positive,this transcends the usual bridging role of the middle episode of a trilogy funnier darker and more actionpacked than the fellowship of the ring it grows on you upon second viewing and is a vital part of what has to be considered one of the greatest movie franchises ever
Oct 17 2008,positive,dont hesitate just watch and feel and well see what this movie is saying
Oct 17 2008,positive,sweet i love allt he lotr movies
Oct 17 2008,positive,improves on the first and helms deep is a fantastic sequence but how did wormtongue get such influence dudes name is wormtongue only way it could be more obvious was if his name was lando judas backstabbington
Oct 16 2008,positive,better than the last one
Oct 16 2008,positive,the second best movie of all time
Oct 16 2008,neutral,goes on waaaay too long cant watch it all in one sitting
Oct 16 2008,positive,weakest of the three films but of course a necessary part of the trilogy
Oct 16 2008,positive,wonderful bridge to the third film
Oct 16 2008,positive,brilliant i dont need to say any more
Oct 16 2008,positive,exellent sequel to the fellowship of the ring is way better and much more fun i love the battle scenes and everything in this movie peter jackson is a genius and this movie is perfect

Oct 15 2008,positive,weakest of the books and movies
Oct 15 2008,positive,this was good the first time  but as it was explained in clerks ii its 3 hours of walking
Oct 15 2008,positive,i was the other two before this one and it was really good im not really sure why i waited so long to see it
Oct 15 2008,neutral,dont like these kind of movies except for hp
Oct 15 2008,positive,epic brilliant and tear worthy in particular the expanded versions
Oct 15 2008,positive,so coherent with jrr tolkiens creation   but youve got to see the trilogy or nothing
Oct 15 2008,positive,my favorite trilogy of all times
Oct 14 2008,neutral,at this point i wanted the movie to end
Oct 14 2008,positive,awsome movie book  extended version better tho dressed up as an ent 4 this movie lol
Oct 14 2008,positive,another entry into my all time top 5 collectivly as one whole story
Oct 14 2008,positive,a great seaqual this is the best lord of the rings movie ever
Oct 14 2008,positive,it is interesting to come back to this film after a few years gap and compare the special effects then to now despite being relatively cgi heavy they are subtlety incorporated where as now they trend to be obtrusive and overbearing even with a well made film such as the dark knight it is a pity that in order to maximise revenue sci fi and fantasy films are being made to appeal to the lowest common denominator
Oct 14 2008,positive,a great two hour battle
Oct 14 2008,positive,glued to the cinema chair till end title
Oct 14 2008,positive,part of the greatest trilogy ever made
Oct 14 2008,positive,right up there with star wars
Oct 13 2008,positive,best of the books but slightly disappointing in the theater  still a very good movie and a very vivid treatment of the tolkien work
Oct 13 2008,positive,the most wonderful trilogy i hope watch it daily
Oct 13 2008,negative,the most beautiful benny hill scetch ever and the 2nd longest
Oct 13 2008,positive,the strongest book but the weakest of the films  still wonderfully enjoyable and a must see for sure  dont be put off if it doesnt feel as solid as the first because the third is one of the best movies ive ever seen
Oct 13 2008,positive,love the whole series the twotowers is  adventurousstuning and the actors are all very  good especially the fellowship of the ring
Oct 12 2008,negative,several hours of my life i will never get back sad
Oct 12 2008,positive,a new power is rising darkness is growing the journey to destroy the ring continues but the evil is growing stronger and more towns are being slayed at its will the second installment delves deeper into the mystery of the ring and the battles takes full throttle watch middle earth come alive in an epic battle to destroy one ring that rules them all
Oct 12 2008,positive,should have kept with cannon  this movie suffers from deviation
Oct 12 2008,positive,what can i say awsome movie trillogy
Oct 12 2008,positive,i just loooove this trilogy
Oct 12 2008,positive,love the lord of the rings movies
Oct 12 2008,positive,was good least favorite of the 3 just because of all the changes from the book if you watched it without reading the books it was good
Oct 12 2008,positive,this is my favorite out of the trilogythe battle at helems deep was one of the best bits of cinema ive ever seenlegendary film
Oct 12 2008,neutral,all of these movies just keep going and going and going and just drag on forever they really cant hold my attetion long enough
Oct 11 2008,positive,actually better paced than its predecessor with the introduction of the terrifically animated and voiced smiegel and the series best action set piece involving the defense of a castle  like harrison ford in the 2nd chapter of star wars viggo mortensen became the star of this saga with his turn in the 2nd chapter as the future king  not quite as fresh as fellowship but just as well crafted by director peter jackson
Oct 11 2008,positive,loved the whole trilogy
Oct 11 2008,positive,adventure movie turned war movie
Oct 11 2008,positive,it is a great film    i like the characters
Oct 11 2008,positive,following up fellowship is a mammoth task but two towers manages to keep pace continuing the story of the one ring frodo and sam are joined by gollum on their journey to mordo legolas aragorn and gimli head to th troubled land of rohan and merry and pippin travel with the living tree treebeard all of the stories are linked together incredibly well acting is a gain amazing and i believe the battle of helms deep is the best action sequence ever put to film a classic movie my top 10 1
Oct 11 2008,positive,i found this the most well made and best film out of the three films of the lord of the rings
Oct 11 2008,positive,the sequel is not pale in comparison to the first movie thrilling and heartpounding battle scenes outstanding in all aspect

Oct 9 2008,negative,i didnt care fo this one too much untel the final battle at the end i found it to be really boring
Oct 9 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy although a overall excellent film the set pieces of the gandalf the white reveal and the battle of helms deep really make this one
Oct 9 2008,positive,the awesomeness continues d
Oct 9 2008,positive,i preferred the stuff in the shire but this is still extraordinary
Oct 9 2008,positive,loved it loved it loved
Oct 9 2008,positive,omgi must off watched these films a million timesi love dem
Oct 8 2008,positive,luv gollum in it hes creepy but hes cool
Oct 8 2008,negative,the ents were cool it was also very obvious they put great amounts of work into making the movie visually powerful im just not into lotr ive only seen this because my husband likes it
Oct 8 2008,positive,best of the three less hobbit more action
Oct 8 2008,positive,continuing where the first one left off this film continues in the same grand vein exhibiting phenomenal eye for detail the  director takes us to grand battles and the continuation of frodos journey special effects are eye popping and the filmmaking exquisite
Oct 8 2008,negative,must see film if you liked the first installment
Oct 8 2008,positive,oh man talk about the best movies ever did you know they won an academy award for best movies ever made and to think that the decedents of jrr tolkien didnt like them and made someone else do the hobbit what those people are lame i love these movies

Oct 7 2008,positive,this is my fave out of the three
Oct 7 2008,positive,the trilogy just rocks

Oct 6 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy
Oct 6 2008,positive,not the strongest of the three films it lacked flow and seemed stretched out in some areas overall though still a fantastic film kudos to peter jackson and all of the actors
Oct 6 2008,neutral,i like lord of the rings it jst a bit hard to follow
Oct 5 2008,positive,still a great epic but i couldnt help but feel that there was something missing about it  though im told the extended edition covers that
Oct 5 2008,negative,lame of the rings  pluses nothing comes to mind  minuses cate blanchett looks kind of bland as galadriel the books focus on the wonder of the hobbits at all they see is reduced in favor of focus on macho humans flashing flamboyantly intense stares and sucking their cheeks in the orcs look like the goblins from legend the time spent on fight scenes is all out of proportion to what they were in the book and anything that isnt fight scenes is cut way back when i read the book saruman was seductively wicked here hes cookie cutter bad guy im surprised he doesnt twirl his mustache
Oct 5 2008,positive,my favourite of the 3
Oct 5 2008,positive,this is my favourite of the three i love the battle at helms deep
Oct 5 2008,positive,the 3 hrs just vanishes

Oct 4 2008,positive,absolutley brilliant definitly best of the trilogy there could have been many variations and the films could have turned out completly different with the additional charectors in the book that have been missed undeveloped then again that probably would have made the films several hours longer anyway i know i sat there and thoroughly eenjoyed it so did you otherwise you wouldnt be here talking about it
Oct 4 2008,positive,good film quite long but it does the book proud
Oct 4 2008,positive,gotta love trees that can walk and talk and help the causes of good

Sep 28 2008,positive,this is the movie of the trilogy that i felt broke ground and should have won more awards
Sep 28 2008,positive,one of the best ever movies
Sep 27 2008,positive,on of the best movies of this century  i think if you fell in love with the books then you had to love the movies
Sep 27 2008,positive,its great all there is too it second best of series great great movie
Sep 27 2008,positive,still good even after 40 of themhaha
Sep 27 2008,positive,the entire trilogy is a master piece
Sep 27 2008,positive,the more times i watch this the more the complaints i had to begin with seem less and less important its still part of an incredible translation and although this instalment has my least favourite bits including controversially the splitgollum conversation im over most of them now cos aragorns dream doesnât last long and on reflection its actually nice to get some glimpses of osgiliath plus we get to meet eowyn see the black gate  and in helms deep one of the greatest ever battle sequences on film two towers youre back in
Sep 27 2008,positive,probably the best of the three lord of the rings movies  of all of them it was the only one to hold its pacing so well that even the extended edition was watchable  though it is tolkeins fault in a way the giant climax held in this film makes the third installment feel like almost unnecessary  of course well go back to see how it all wraps up but this film held the true emotional highs and lows in the trilogy
Sep 27 2008,positive,this movie still had a bunch of walking i mean even the trees were walking
Sep 27 2008,positive,my least favorite of the lotr series but still awesome
Sep 27 2008,positive,well made but feels like the middle movie that it is  need to have watched the 1st
Sep 26 2008,positive,incredible cast breathtaking cinematographynot quite my cup of tea as far as plot goes but still entertaining and impressive to watch
Sep 25 2008,positive,my favorite series of all time
Sep 25 2008,neutral,this was actually my favourite in the series
Sep 25 2008,positive,though this is my least favorite of the trilogy i adore lord of the rings  tolkien was a genius
Sep 25 2008,positive,superb trilogy love it
Sep 25 2008,positive,love all of the lord of the rings movies a beautiful story
Sep 24 2008,positive,awesome  get the directors cut
Sep 24 2008,positive,amazing the best movie ever
Sep 24 2008,positive,ehh it gets kinda boring in the middle
Sep 24 2008,positive,quite different from the book in a number of scenes but jackson has turned it into a wonderful movie
Sep 24 2008,positive,very epic but sometimes book adaptions to movies could consider cutting down on the dialogue seriously
Sep 24 2008,positive,the curse of the middle chapter  still pretty damned good
Sep 24 2008,positive,was a great movie just is not my thing
Sep 24 2008,positive,much better if you see the deleted scenes in the extended version
Sep 24 2008,positive,was good i enjoyed this one the best
Sep 24 2008,positive,i luv this film its the best out of the three if u havnt seen it give me ur address so i can kill u 
Sep 24 2008,positive,i enjoyed the second lord of the rings movie but not as much as the first one the director has taken a lot of liberties with the novel some for the best but mostly for the worse the arrival of the elves at helm deep the revival of aragorn by arwen and the personality switch of faramir the battle of helm deep is very impressive and ian mckellen as gandalf is always unforgettable
Sep 24 2008,positive,most variant from the books of the movies still rockin
Sep 24 2008,negative,rather have harry potter
Sep 24 2008,positive,this second part of the trilogy was the ungrateful task in hands how to keep the tension up between the opening act and the grande finale also as we know from the novel therere also several parallel stories ongoing and it does not make it any easier but im happy that peter jackson and the crew of his nicely pulled it off the two towers is a really good movie and it manages to keep up the intensity against all odds and obviously the battle of the helm deep is one of the greatest battle scenes ever but of course this second installment is meant to be making a way for the third and the final part and this work it does in an awesome way
Sep 23 2008,positive,has no ending as i recall but its a great film
Sep 23 2008,positive,yeah lots of folks hate the pacing  im totally biased here  but the quality of the cinematography the envelope pushing cgi and the terrific performances here are undeniable
Sep 23 2008,positive,good filmbut too long for my taste
Sep 23 2008,negative,i liked the first but lost intrest fast
Sep 23 2008,neutral,same as the others cool cgi drawn out story  books were better
Sep 23 2008,positive,speech at the end makes this movie
Sep 23 2008,positive,every body needs to see this movie
Sep 23 2008,positive,not as good as the other two but still amazing
Sep 23 2008,positive,not as good as the other two but still amazing
Sep 23 2008,positive,superb visuals  as true to the books as one can expect
Sep 22 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy
Sep 22 2008,positive,the least of the book trilogy is actually the best of the movie trilogy  why  more drama more peril less arwen no knock on liv tyler though and most decisively more great characters theodin eowyn wormtongue faramir treebeard and of course gollum  plus everyone from the first film including boromir if you watch the dvd special extended edition and why would you watch it any other way  helms deep remains a stunning breathtaking landmark battle sequence in the history of cinema  the final war on pellinor fields in return of the king almost felt anticlimactic a rehash unsuccessfully trying to top what helms deep achieved first
Sep 22 2008,positive,story line is blah but cute guys
Sep 22 2008,positive,my least favourite out of the three but still amazing
Sep 22 2008,positive,favorite lord of the rings
Sep 22 2008,positive,great movie this and the thrid one will be a tough battle to win my vote for the best lotr
Sep 22 2008,negative,so i fell asleep during this when it came out i just really wasnt into it if it wasnt for orlando i think wouldnt of see it again
Sep 22 2008,positive,yet again such a great movie
Sep 22 2008,positive,youuuu shhaaalll noooott passss  good old epic lord of the rings
Sep 22 2008,positive,the second film in an outstanding trilogy  as is per usual the second act ups the danger and puts our heros in some serious predicaments  outstanding performances by everyone especially by newly introduced protagonist king theoden bernard hill  i have double good feeling for this movie since i was stationed overseas in korea without my family and not alot to do so seeing this twice in the theater wasnt a surprise to me at all  money very well spent  this movie also introduces hollywoods first viable computer generated character in gollum  it has been done before but usually with zero success  that changed with gollum who is as believable as any one of his real hobbit counterparts  exceptional
Sep 21 2008,positive,i love this movie it is probably the least liked by fans of the trilogy however i absolutely loved it i love them all so much and treat them as a single filmstory but when pressed to separate i choose this one helms deep is one of the most amazing battles in film history period
Sep 21 2008,positive,a very good film in its own right but being the middle child of a series it is rather dull a times dont get me wrong jackson did all of these movies brilliantly
Sep 21 2008,negative,if this were the hk bootleg copy itd get five stars
Sep 21 2008,positive,mystical fantasy adventure packed with action you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen
Sep 21 2008,positive,out of the trilogy this is by far my favorite filmhas such a good storyline too bad that it finished to early the film didnt finish in comparison the book it is a good film to watch watch it bitches
Sep 21 2008,positive,yeah this film is class aswell
Sep 21 2008,positive,brilliant  epic adventure with a wonderful cast and fantastic scenery  need i say more
Sep 21 2008,positive,im a big fan of these films 
Sep 21 2008,positive,respect worst of the three though
Sep 20 2008,positive,great the extended edition is even better while i think that the return of the king is the best of the theatrical releases the two towers is my favorite of the longer cuts this is the only movie my father and i ever agreed on thats saying something
Sep 20 2008,positive,really solid and great build up
Sep 20 2008,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
Sep 20 2008,negative,couldnt understand the dialog in so many places these films do not do it for me
Sep 20 2008,positive,the best of the 3 films
Sep 20 2008,positive,ahhh i love this movie
Sep 20 2008,positive,my favorite series movies

Sep 19 2008,negative,hm not so crazy for lord of the rings
Sep 19 2008,positive,weakest of the 3 kinda tedious and god pleas ekill orlando bloom
Sep 19 2008,negative,still the worst series ever
Sep 19 2008,positive,it may lack the firstviewthrill and natural dramatic shape of fellowship but this is both funnier and darker than the first film and certainly more actionpacked an essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time
Sep 19 2008,positive,very slow  but so worth it
Sep 19 2008,positive,the best of the 3 highly recommend this would make you want to watch the other 2
Sep 19 2008,positive,drags a bit throughout although i do love the sequences set in rohan
Sep 19 2008,neutral,not being a fan of the series i have to respect the production value of these movies the effects are fantastic and the portrayal of gollum is fantastic however i get bothered by the overlength and the ridiculously sparkly eyes of all of the characters i feel stupid using these reasons to dislike a movie but overall i just have no interest
Sep 19 2008,positive,lotr is the most creative movie ever made
Sep 18 2008,positive,the best of of the three movies totally in love with legolas
Sep 18 2008,positive,probably my alltime favorite movie all three of them
Sep 18 2008,positive,probably my least favourite of the three but still a truly amazing film

Sep 17 2008,positive,dude i still listen to the soundtrack like every day
Sep 17 2008,positive,my problem is in having read the four part trilogy so many times that the pages have fallen out  any attempt at making a movie is going to fall so far short for me  that said its watchable
Sep 17 2008,positive,yay enter faramir the best book and the best movie too

Sep 16 2008,positive,not a big fan of the trilogy
Sep 16 2008,positive,i like this one than the first movie
Sep 15 2008,positive,the battle at helms deep is amazing i wish i was fighting in it
Sep 15 2008,positive,i didnt think theyd ever be able to do it but they did great job youve gotta se them all
Sep 15 2008,positive,again super  not sure if i had seen it or not before as i reocgnised bits of it might have been from when i had read it very enjoyable

Sep 14 2008,positive,the best one in the trilogy
Sep 14 2008,neutral,not a fan one does not simply rock into mordor
Sep 14 2008,positive,the best movie ever
Sep 14 2008,positive,a fantasy epic conveyed in 3 hours
Sep 14 2008,positive,very good and unlike most sequells it was just as good the first
Sep 14 2008,positive,love love love this movie
Sep 14 2008,positive,the middle movies are almost always the worse
Sep 14 2008,positive,books were better but it was still good  least they did keep the contest between legolas and gimli 
Sep 14 2008,positive,its ok it drags on a bit
Sep 13 2008,positive,a story not worthy of 10 hours of screen time  basic story should have been trimmed down to 3 12 hour film
Sep 13 2008,positive,again the battle sequence
Sep 13 2008,positive,suffers only from being the middlechild in a three film saga but because it was all filmed at the same time no worries
Sep 13 2008,positive,another awesome movie
Sep 13 2008,positive,loads better than the first one the beginning was kinda slow but it picked up in the middle with a good war scene and manages to keep the side stories interestingpippin and merry frodo and sametc this one even has good hunor in it and made me laugh several times but the reason for the 4 12 star rating is the freaking hobbits i mean dont get me worng i like the side story of pippin and merry but frodo and sam are sooooo winny about every little thing and half of thier adventure each of them cry wine about how they have to take the ring back and the beggining hour is kinda slow
Sep 12 2008,positive,my favourite out of the trilogy
Sep 12 2008,neutral,i could have done without this movie
Sep 12 2008,neutral,i fell asleep during the final fight sceneliterally
Sep 12 2008,positive,a large technical step forward for the series jackson and his cast are much more comfortable in their roles however the two towers gets alot more hate than it deserves from the movie going public considering how much better put together it is the segmentation of the story is most evident in this film as it is the middle point where nothing is begun or resolved one more thing that disrupted opinions was the art direction took a sharp dive the setpieces were much less interesting and the broad colour palette was sharpened to shades of brown and grey it does its best job leading the plot into the third and final installment
Sep 12 2008,positive,orlando is such a sexy elf
Sep 12 2008,positive,all of the lotr movies are amazing
Sep 12 2008,positive,the closer we are to danger the farther away we are from harm i love this movie so much i can quote it 5 star
Sep 12 2008,positive,equally compelling as its prequel and perhaps more technically awesome and the masterpiece continues
Sep 11 2008,positive,jrr tolkien knew how to write a story  at least they did try to stay true to the original book but the book is definitely better
Sep 11 2008,positive,just as good in pt 2
Sep 11 2008,positive,my personal favorite of the trilogy and largely because of the battle of helms deep  thats my favorite action sequence of any movie alltime
Sep 11 2008,positive,great second movie in a great trilogy
Sep 11 2008,positive,all lord of the rings movie are perfect  its that simple
Sep 11 2008,positive,the rebirth of gandolf the ents giving the white wizard what he deserves gandolf and shadowfax flying to the rescue are just a couple of the emotional climaxes of this reputation upholding masterpiece
Sep 11 2008,positive,im so sick of these movies
Sep 11 2008,positive,this movie was a bit slow in the middle for me the production values and effect remained perfect though
Sep 11 2008,positive,the greatest movies of all time
Sep 11 2008,positive,the opening alone sets this movie far beyond any action adventure of our time wasnt a fan before but after seeing that amazing opening i loved every second
Sep 11 2008,positive,this second part is less good than the first one but still entertaining
Sep 11 2008,positive,best second chapter you could ever make secondbest film ever
Sep 11 2008,positive,cannot recall much but an overall impression
Sep 11 2008,positive,saw this one with my entire family a first for my birthdaymom dad sister aunt uncle cousins whew  my uncle was thoroughly confused as he thought we were seeing harry potter
Sep 10 2008,positive,moderately enthralling midsection that is both anticlimactic and inconclusive in correspondence with the limitations for continuous storytelling
Sep 10 2008,positive,sam gamgee manages to fag up another movie
Sep 10 2008,positive,the second time i saw it it was a lot better  not bad not bad at all still long
Sep 10 2008,positive,probably the best out of all three  an epic film
Sep 10 2008,positive,better than the 1st one
Sep 9 2008,positive,if you dont like them then dont talk to me

Sep 9 2008,positive,incredible  helms deep is one of the best battles in film history
Sep 9 2008,positive,a superb pt 2 i love the structure of society in this the particular sects and races adapt to english society even now its slightly disguised but still there it sets the scene for the penulitimate return of the king
Sep 9 2008,positive,lord of the ring what can i say amazing great cast and great battle scenes
Sep 9 2008,positive,many a people including to my disapointment faramir are drawn to the magical vibrating ring
Sep 9 2008,positive,1010 the fellowship was a great opening to a great trilogy but two towers is even better the cgi is fantastic and looks photo realistic i loved the gollum charecter very impressive
Sep 9 2008,positive,the lord of the rings ppl we r talking hobbits for gods sake next
Sep 9 2008,positive,awsome if i had enough time i would read the books i think sams so noble and needs more credit its a epic adventure cant wait untill the hobbit 1 and 2 comes out since guillermo del torro is the most awsome person making movies out there
Sep 9 2008,positive,great sequel packed with great action special effects and some great battle scenes again the cinemagography is spectacular and it can be forgiven for lacking depth as its bacically just a stop gap between the first and third
Sep 8 2008,positive,never a fan of the books or seen any other lotr movies but the scenery was beautiful and this movie captured my attention which is saying a lot
Sep 8 2008,positive,phenomenal performances directing special effects damn near everything is impeccable in this lord of the rings sequel

Sep 7 2008,positive,use treebeard as toilet breaks
Sep 7 2008,positive,best of the three to me
Sep 7 2008,negative,hobbits are so stupid
Sep 7 2008,negative,was this movie shorter than the first one which was 12 hours long
Sep 7 2008,positive,the second movie in the lord of the rings trilogy is awesome it continues to show peter jacksons exceptional ability to bring tolkiens middle earth to the big screen this movie is second only to the fellowship of the ring and the return of the king
Sep 7 2008,positive,i often find the middle film of all great trilogies the best  lotrttt was no different  love the battle of helms deep
Sep 7 2008,positive,not the best lotr but still awesome
Sep 6 2008,positive,no words can do it justice

Sep 6 2008,positive,great movie  best screen play adaptation
Sep 6 2008,positive,again love legolus awesome sweet
Sep 6 2008,positive,better than the first
Sep 6 2008,positive,my feelings remain the same from the first installment  this is the movie experience people have been waiting for in case you havent gathered this movie is visually stunning literally breathtaking i mean that some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks shocked at the pure enveloping beauty of the shot peter jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had    the acting is as always superb kudos for hiring actors not stars specific mention goes to both john rhysdavies in his well enjoyed comic turn and very largely to andy serkis who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly wellperformed cgi character ive ever seen gollum    for the most part and as a fan of the books i take no offense to the slight plot modifications my understanding is that tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of lotr would require a somewhat different take on his work and was apparently open to such minute changes there are also a few tiny bits and pieces i was disappointed to see not make the final cut however the extended dvd made up for that     in short if you found the continual enjoyment i did with the first movie of lotr this movie will in no way let you down
Sep 5 2008,positive,part two of three my favorites continuation
Sep 5 2008,positive,best of the trilogy in my opinion

Sep 3 2008,negative,the lotr films are good qualitywise but just not my thing

Sep 3 2008,positive,always the best ever
Sep 3 2008,positive,the last battle made this the only one worth watching in the series
Sep 3 2008,positive,started to go off the rails a bit at this point
Sep 3 2008,positive,love lord of the rings
Sep 3 2008,positive,with the two towers peter jackson faced the structural challenge of fitting three separate storylines with no beginnings and no ends into a digestible cinematic narrative but he builds the tension equally through all the subplots balancing suspense and exposition right up to the hairraising battle of helms deep the two towers also features one of the best performances of the decade from motioncapture and voice actor andy serkis as gollum serkis embodiment and vocalization of the simultaneously despicable and pitiable creature is so astonishing and authentic that we soon forget gollum is a cg character
Sep 2 2008,positive,i love all the lord of the rings
Sep 2 2008,positive,worst of the three straight up action missing the depth of the first one  still good
Sep 2 2008,positive,the very best theyre taking the hobbits to isengard

Sep 1 2008,negative,felt the same way w this one as did w the 1st one
Sep 1 2008,positive,excellently made though inaccurate and not as good as the first and third movies
Sep 1 2008,positive,the film is a stunning technological achievement and andy serkis impresses in a remarkable firstofitskind motion capture performance however this film seems the most disjointed of the trilogy and the wolves of isengard sequence always pissed me off i also think i heard tolkien roll over in his grave when legolas surfed down a staircase
Sep 1 2008,neutral,still prefere the book
Sep 1 2008,positive,this is my favorite of the lotr trilogy the battle at helms deep is so awesome to watch
Sep 1 2008,positive,the third best in the trilogy it sometimes has pacing issues but that is all i can say on the negative side  this is perhaps the best set of movies adapted from books ever  this entire trilogy is in my top 8 favorite movies of all time
Sep 1 2008,positive,its about as long and epic as its novel conterpart worth seeing
Sep 1 2008,positive,brilliant eventhough it wasnt my favourite of the series but still it was quite spectacular props to peter jackson for in my opinion the best book to movie job ever

Aug 31 2008,positive,a good adaptation but not as amazing as i thought it was at first
Aug 31 2008,positive,not as good as fellowship or return of the king
Aug 31 2008,positive,action with action with arwin
Aug 31 2008,positive,the whole trilogy gets a 5 for me for so deftly handling the enormity of the project and it is enormous  the thesis i never wrote was bogged down in this saga  particularly for the two towers the was the soundtrack
Aug 31 2008,positive,one of the best movies ever made period
Aug 31 2008,positive,best of the three the characters really develop in this one whereas i feel the other two movies hurry the story along to an extent

Aug 24 2008,positive,great castgreat movieif your into this genre of fantasy films then this one has to be in your collection
Aug 24 2008,positive,this has one of the best battles in the entire trilogy nest to minas tirith and was packed full of action all the way though two thumbs up
Aug 24 2008,positive,directors cut fixes gaping plot holes but also makes film more tedious this tells me the whole affair gorgeous as it is was busted still a good fantasy romp even as it deviates from the novel in ways it really didnt need to
Aug 24 2008,positive,just as amazing as the first movie better actionwise
Aug 24 2008,positive,this is my favourite lord of the rings movie dont know why it just is
Aug 24 2008,positive,good moviegood action scenes amazing cinematographybut no one was particularly interesting at least in my opinion i didnt connect with anybody they were all overly dramatic to the point of well boredom its so epic that it fails to show more regular life interactions relationships and dialogue i dont expect any epic movie to be about much else than spectacular action scenes scenery and atmosphere but when the people are just soso not really interesting its hard to get into it i liked this movie for all the reasons ive already listed but fantasy characters from distant lands arent particularly fascinating to me theres literally no supposedly serious scene in this movie that i couldnt mock the hobbits were all cheesy lame and just unbelievably pointless not to mention cluelessand how do they not have beards like everyone else their civilization must have had razors and shaving cream back in the day i guess the whole ring possession concept is pretty unamazing to me toothat some little ring is so preciiousss to all the most evil diabolical deranged creatures on earth is pretty childish to me but this is all my opinioni am being very critical of this movie obviously
Aug 24 2008,positive,this film is my favourite film ever it is in my opinion the best of all 3 films the battle at the end is more intense as they nearly lose and you actually believe they would
Aug 24 2008,positive,my favourite out of the trilogy

Aug 22 2008,positive,i didnt think it was a good as the first
Aug 22 2008,positive,again books are much better  hype of the movie overshadowed the actual movie
Aug 22 2008,positive,my most favorite part of the book became unfortunately the least favorite of the films due to the huge quite unnecessary departures from the original still all else was better than most films ive ever seen
Aug 21 2008,positive,not as good as the fellowship of the ring
Aug 21 2008,positive,the ultimate fantasy novel made into a film this for me was perfection in a film esacpism love action and fantasic cinematography i loved this and the entire trilogy

Aug 15 2008,positive,hmmnot quite as good as the first but still quite good  all the characters are there with the fantastic acting visuals and action the plot however is not quite as good as the first  things become more complex here  still its a good sequel and a great segue into the final chapter of the series

Aug 15 2008,positive,15 endings are you serious
Aug 15 2008,positive,the lord of the rings was a massive achievement in filmmaking and the second chapter in the trilogy improves on all the short comings of the first film
Aug 15 2008,positive,such a great movie it has what it all takes to be a movie worth watching couple of times
Aug 14 2008,positive,extended version is the best
Aug 14 2008,positive,im not sure how you could pick one of these movies over the each other so i just listed them in order  i had a hard time keeping them out of the top 10 too but the other ranked just above them for me  just great story telling and movie making  classics forever
Aug 14 2008,positive,it really really really long
Aug 14 2008,positive,i am going just to just a single review for all the trilogy fortunately i think that the whole means sometimes more than the sum of its parts because of that each of the movies is just 3 stars too much battles and not a much original argument by the way it can be the first time of epic fantasy but doesnt differ much from medieval legends or basic goodvsevil stories but the whole trilogy is 35stars rated why because of some spectacular scenes visual effects yeah but also good points in story the character of gollum incredible some strong characters and moments and the effect that the ring provoked in people around it these are the strongest points of a movie that one way or another should be done probably the result is the best you can take from tolkien even people said that gollum character was magnified so perfect
Aug 14 2008,positive,my fav of the three
Aug 14 2008,positive,there are not enough stars to indicate how i feel about the lotr trilogy  breathtaking is one wordsuperb is anotheryou get the idea  flawless casting  bear in mind ive read all the books more than once but less than christopher lee love this movie  brilliantly done
Aug 14 2008,positive,a great sequel to the fellowship
Aug 14 2008,negative,the opening is fantastic  its all down hill from there for the film and the series
Aug 14 2008,positive,awsome movie its not the best lotr movie but its still good
Aug 14 2008,positive,probably the best of the three  the acting by  viggo mortensen is excellent   it is  a very dark and brooding film and the battle scenes are amazing
Aug 14 2008,positive,i love this one too
Aug 14 2008,positive,been a fan ever since i read the trilogy 30 years ago
Aug 14 2008,positive,second in the lotr trilogy  love it
Aug 14 2008,negative,is there any point to this part of the story other than filler between books i and iii
Aug 13 2008,positive,urukhais are great so does gollum
Aug 13 2008,positive,i think this one was good
Aug 13 2008,positive,i love lord of the rings the movies were released right after i started reading them and i love them two towers has some awesome things going for it
Aug 13 2008,positive,easily my favourite of the series though i cant put my finger on why maybe it was because aragons awesomeness shone through whilst still retaining his im a ranger coolness that sadly left when he accepted his birthright it also introduced us to one of the harshes drinking game ever uruk dies take a shot and was just an all round epic movie still the warg scenes gave up some of the ropeyness of cgi
Aug 13 2008,negative,sucks i hate hobbits
Aug 13 2008,positive,the trees are cool so lifelike
Aug 13 2008,positive,all 3 were worth watching
Aug 13 2008,positive,amazingamazingamazing love these filmsmaybe this one dips a bit from the 1st but still so much in heregollum and  smeagol talking is for me the best scene
Aug 13 2008,positive,all the better when you can watch it over and over and see something you missed and can watch over and over
Aug 12 2008,positive,these movies are all amazing
Aug 12 2008,negative,im sorry i really was just never into this series 
Aug 12 2008,positive,always a lord of the rings fan
Aug 12 2008,positive,what an amazing movie true to the book and great for the whole familydefinently a must see for everyone
Aug 12 2008,positive,this one was my least favorite because it revolves more around the battles the majority of it is a lot of fighting so it has its dull parts its still completely vital to the series and one of the best fantasy movies ever made
Aug 12 2008,positive,awesome battles great cinematography and fantastic artistic design  the acting is unbalanced  still wouldve been a great great film if not for two things faramir and osgiliath  screw you jackson
Aug 12 2008,positive,the cast has done it again in the second movie our friends are in a battle between good and evil here we find our heros have been seperated from their friends frodo and sam have left aragon and the others they are on their own quest to destroy the ring here is where we meet golum he wants his precious back and will stop at nothing to get it back
Aug 12 2008,positive,very dull in the middle but pretty good
Aug 12 2008,positive,after i saw these movies and tried to read lotr again i realized i am not a big fantasy fan  the movie is pretty good though
Aug 12 2008,negative,jacksons lotr films perfectly evoked the visual aspect of tolkiens work while completely failing to capture the spirit two towers is the worst offender completely revising major characters and padding itself out with some unneccessary additional scenes  jacksons tendency to draw things out is very apparent here
Aug 12 2008,positive,this turns out to be one of the greatest movie series that i have watched so far it was much more intense in battle sequences than the first one they also introduce a lot of new characters that strengthen the performance of this movie so far this is the best one in the series and it is even better if you watch the extended version which adds more than 30 minutes to this outstanding movie
Aug 12 2008,positive,not as good as the other two as they didnt do much storyline
Aug 12 2008,positive,this movie was great to
Aug 12 2008,positive,definitely the best of the three movies
Aug 12 2008,positive,set in a time of uncertainty in the land of middleearth a tale which charts a heroic quest which centers around an intrepid hobbit the future of civilization rests in the fate of the one ring which has been lost for centuries powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it but fate has placed it in the hands of a young hobbit named frodo baggins who inherits the ring and steps into legend a daunting task lies ahead for frodo when he becomes the ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the one ring in the fires of mount doom where it was forged but he cant accomplish this task alone a fellowship bands together to lend frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission the wisdom of gandalf the loyalty of his friends sam merry and pippin the courage of aragorn and boromir the precision of legolas and the strength of gimli they are aided in their quest by arwen galadriel and elrond whose knowledge of the ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey firstly this has to be one of the best sequal to any film this film was amazing everything about this film was perfect it was very exciting to watch one of the best films of 2002
Aug 12 2008,positive,good better than the third but it didnt really wow me like the first
Aug 11 2008,positive,lots of fighting lots of elves lots of dwarves hmmm
Aug 11 2008,positive,awesome adaption of one of my favorite books go see my review for return of the kingeverything i said there applies here these are fantastic movies
Aug 11 2008,positive,my favorite lord of the rings movie
Aug 11 2008,positive,love to watch the trilogy of this filmwatch it over and over again even though it took so long but worth an satisfying in the end
Aug 11 2008,positive,i loved this trilogy  extended version is brilliant
Aug 11 2008,positive,this is the best film out of the whole three films especially the big fight that if close to the end 
Aug 11 2008,positive,there is graet effects and lots of awesome battle sequences
Aug 11 2008,positive,the second film of  the lord of the rings based on the books by jrr tolkien          the lord of the rings  the two towers is the second part of the greatest film   trilogy ever and it comes once again under the direction of  peter jackson
Aug 11 2008,positive,all will be sacrificed all will be lost unless all unite against evil    the lord of the rings  the two towers is by far the best film in the epic triology again we see the journeyf frodo and sam to mordor in their mission to destroy the ring    peter jackson again manages to deliver perfection in the form of an amazing movie    not only do you feel the struggle of frodo and sams mission but we also witness links to the first film that make the attachments on certain characters like aragorn gimli and legolas much stronger    we are introduced to gollum in this second installment and see one of the most visually stunning battle scenes of all time    i unlike seeing the first film was lucky enough to see this at the cinema it was an experience ill never forget
Aug 11 2008,positive,picking a favourite amongst the lotr films is like choosing which of your children you like best the middle film is great if only for the heartpumpingly exciting battle at the endbut theres so much more to it than that
Aug 11 2008,positive,it was great but sucked at the same time because it was in the middle and you wanted to get to the end already
Aug 11 2008,positive,the middle part of the trilogy is more complex and dark than the first installment in my mind it is the most satisfying with saruman being a fantastic antagonist for this installment
Aug 11 2008,positive,the lord of the rings  the two towers frodo baggins and samwise gamgee continue their quest to return the ring to mount doom and cast it into the lava from whence it came but they still have a long way to go the two towers has one of the most epic battles i ever seen the movie is incredible
Aug 11 2008,positive,very good battle scenes
Aug 10 2008,positive,my favorite of the three lor films epic battle scenes  great love story  wonderful acting  the trees slowed down the action though
Aug 10 2008,positive,extended version is the best battle scenes are great
Aug 10 2008,positive,all 3 really need to be rated as one movieand if you know me you know i love them
Aug 10 2008,neutral,the great trilogy starts to lose ita lack of focus on the characters  too much on key battle scenes the gollumsmeagol conversation scene was a stroke of genius though
Aug 10 2008,positive,the action is just getting started good in this movie
Aug 10 2008,positive,good artworkhighly potential movie with stunning ending
Aug 10 2008,positive,i love the lord of the rings triology but i would have to say the two towers is my favorite the storyline is unforgettable and you get whisked away to middle earth and engrossed in the lives and trials of all the characters this is definately one of my favorites
Aug 10 2008,positive,great movie as long as your into the trilogy
Aug 10 2008,positive,another one i love d

Aug 10 2008,positive,this one was my favorite
Aug 10 2008,positive,i felt that they did a wonderful job interpreting the books for these movies while the plot lines are off from the books and several of my favorite characterslinesscenes are not used i can still appreciate how well this was done its not my favorite of the three and it loses major points for some things that i will refrain from mentioning spoilers

Aug 4 2008,positive,the extended edition version is great
Aug 3 2008,positive,impossible movie to make as written does an excellent job in the final execution but the film is still the low point in the outstanding series  the film is ever so slightly overlong but has so many brilliant moments such as smegols scitzo scene the treebeard plot  and the whole battle at the end  a great film
Aug 3 2008,negative,cant the old man just turn off the tractor beam so they can fly out of the deathstar and we can go home this movie goes on forever

Aug 2 2008,positive,this trilogy is the reason we go to the movies the second is the weakest of the three not that that means much
Aug 2 2008,positive,this series did not disappoint in either of its three chapters  forgiving the elements that were altered from novel to book these movies did perfectly what a movie adaptation of the lord of the rings should do and did it well to boot  most impressive effort by all involved

Aug 2 2008,positive,the weakest of the three lotr films and yet still a tremendous achievement in its own right
Aug 2 2008,positive,dvd this second lord of the rings movie is the one that brings in the crowd its the movie of the year deservingly as it is the leader in cinematography of battle scenes and makes it a must to see in theatres or widescreen a classic with oscar guarantee

Aug 1 2008,neutral,the ending was cool but the rest sorta slow
Jul 31 2008,neutral,the sequel enters darker territories with its faster pacing and larger than life battle sequences but lost is the wonder and aweinspiring magic of its predecessor with it being reduced to nothing more than bravado and special effects

Jul 31 2008,positive,loved the extended versions of the trilogy
Jul 31 2008,positive,even though return of the king was the big oscar winner it was the second film in the series much like in the original star wars trilogy that was the true gem  the film is epic throughout with great acting all around but its helms deep that really puts this film over the top  the panning shots of all the families preparing for battle almost moved me to tears and the battle itself was the most epic event in cinema that year  i cant praise this film enough
Jul 30 2008,positive,still pretty awesome this is the movie of the 3 that strings the whole plot together but it does drag on at points but its incredible nonetheless
Jul 30 2008,positive,i love the lord of the rings they are at the top of my list

Jul 30 2008,positive,best movie ever in all of eternity
Jul 30 2008,positive,even better than the first film  the second part digs deeper into the themes of friendship love and fighting for what you believe in
Jul 30 2008,positive,all i can say is that these are great movies with great actors
Jul 30 2008,positive,my favourite of the trilogy the battle scenes are awesome and it didnt go on too long like its sequel

Jul 30 2008,positive,i wish i could give it more stars
Jul 30 2008,negative,ok peter jackson cgi does not equal a good film what happend the frighteners was good you get lost at some point  i mean ur losing ur edge did u like decide oh rather than stay true to lotr im just going to create massive battles arwin is not nearly as important as u make her seem
Jul 30 2008,positive,good times the scene with the rohirrim descending on helms deep is stunning
Jul 30 2008,positive,an incredible sequal to an incredible movie heart breaking moments followed by laugh out loud moments breathtaking
Jul 30 2008,positive,this goes for all the lord of the rings films we will never have a trilogy of films like this for a very long time a truly great cinema experience with the added bonus that they can not be ruined by dodgy prequels like a certain other trilogy thank you again george you are because we all know the hobbit is great
Jul 30 2008,positive,respect the short people
Jul 30 2008,positive,amazing peter jackson is the man
Jul 30 2008,positive,as a second act it can drag a little in places but its just so perfect and gorgeous that you dont want it to end

Jul 29 2008,positive,lord of the rings rapes
Jul 29 2008,positive,feels more like two separate unconnected movies
Jul 29 2008,positive,it may be my least favorite out of both the books and movies but the film is still practically flawless its still aweinspiring featuring much more action and fantasy war and much less sentimental monologues than the first film
Jul 29 2008,negative,too long boring fell asleep

Jul 27 2008,positive,again as it falls short of the book i was still greatly entertained
Jul 27 2008,positive,didnt blow my brain apart like fellowship but i think that was mostly because fellowship was the first and a dream come true for me two towers was wonderful in its own right especially viggo mortensen

Jul 26 2008,positive,probably the tightest one of the three 1 bothered me especially with the ending visually stunning but lacks effective heart too many aerial shots too many froto bouts with the ring meant for the family so these little picky things dont really mean anything
Jul 26 2008,positive,the best among the 3
Jul 26 2008,positive,for someone who is not really into fantasy these movies are impressive they are thought through and you can see the commitment from the cast and crew

Jul 25 2008,positive,this was my favorite of the series i would have liked to see more of the battle of helms deep i thought the high elven warriors were the shit and then the white wizard came down and pwnd an inspiring speech of hope given by sam and trees teaching orcs a thing or two about the being kind to your environment it was awesome i watched the battle scenes over and over again
Jul 25 2008,positive,they did a good job in this movie very will done but i still like the book better
Jul 25 2008,positive,owsome love lotr loooved it soooo awsome
Jul 25 2008,positive,not my scene but good for wat it is
Jul 25 2008,positive,this is actually my favorite in the trilogy  i loved the action scenes and even the humor  all around excellent movie
Jul 25 2008,positive,this film should just be named like the king of all filmsgive it like a throne and acrown and junk and like name the other 2 kings alsoand we should bow to thier greatness
Jul 25 2008,positive,not as good as the 3rd one but still a good movie
Jul 25 2008,positive,the story continues
Jul 25 2008,positive,gollum had probably been the greatest achievement in digital cinema history at the time of the release of the two towers  andy serkis lent his amazing talent to this character both with his voice and his acting  i think that is definitely what stood out the most to me in two towers but it is hard to point to any one thing because it is such a masterpiece
Jul 25 2008,positive,not as good as the first one
Jul 25 2008,positive,not all stars given because of the gap between script and book
Jul 25 2008,positive,dont really remember the events of the second one or rather where the first one ends and the last one starts but its probably still great
Jul 25 2008,positive,part two to this epic movie  fantastic
Jul 24 2008,positive,like the rest of this series excellent flick good script good cast good effects good cinematography good editing just plain good see it
Jul 24 2008,positive,i loved this movie peter jackson is an amazinggg director great cast
Jul 24 2008,positive,an improvement over the first film  much more action and more things are happening  unfortunately there are a few brief moments where the story seems to get lost in the action  that being said still a wonderful wonderful film
Jul 24 2008,positive,as good as the first and better than the third
Jul 24 2008,positive,probably the best of the trilogy definitely better than return of the crap
Jul 24 2008,negative,all of these are just too dark for me
Jul 24 2008,positive,great movie again but long
Jul 24 2008,positive,the epic battle of helms deep is enough unto itself to be excited about this film
Jul 24 2008,positive,i think ive already mentioned what i think of these movies great epic movies which means long and boring at bits with amazing action scenes to make up for it all
Jul 24 2008,positive,one of the great works of john ronald reuel tolkien made into a theatrical legend by the renowned director peter jackson the movie was amazing in cinematography characters story revisions from book to movie musical background computer graphical effects filming locations its almost ingenius perfect  the characters were well portrayed despite that 90 of people think mr wood and mr astin are having some homosexual moments in the film the role of viggo mortensen as aragorn was the best role of all the characters and all the actors did very well in portraying their characters  the movie overall was breathtaking some of the revisions were great and better than the book although there is  one thing i have in mind to criticize it a lot of important characters from the books were missing such as tom bombadil gwahir windlord should be talking to gandalf he is the large eagle that rescued him twice in the fellowship and return of the king prince imrahil of dol amroth was not there as well  i think these missing characters were a good part of the movie but they were crossed out for some reason  so if you read the books first before watching the movie youll be quite disappointed in some way or you wont find the movie surprising anymore because you know whats going to happen already
Jul 24 2008,positive,i liked sams little monologue at the end
Jul 24 2008,positive,i love all of these movies
Jul 24 2008,positive,lesser of the trilogy but necessary and gets on my favorites list by being combined with the other 2
Jul 24 2008,positive,it as hard to understand but the acting was good the special effects were good
Jul 24 2008,positive,the only thing i have to say that kept me from giving this a 10 was the beginning of the film which i found was a little slow to start
Jul 24 2008,positive,really good but strays a bit too much from the book for me
Jul 24 2008,positive,one of the best book series of all time made into some of the best movies

Jul 23 2008,positive,not the best of the trilogy the pacing sucks and there is no intensity what so ever in the film unlike the other twoclearly jacksons least fav of the 3
Jul 23 2008,positive,probably the best lotr
Jul 23 2008,positive,the uncut version of this was way better then the the one released in cinemas still fantastic
Jul 23 2008,positive,awesome movie and great special effects especially the final war scene
Jul 23 2008,positive,excellent continuation to the story more action and adventure leaves you shaking in anticipation for the finale
Jul 23 2008,positive,orlando bloomis still sexxy as hell people
Jul 23 2008,positive,the middle child of the 3 as good as the others but maybe a little too much story and not enough action that is its only fault
Jul 23 2008,positive,love it seen it a hundred times
Jul 23 2008,positive,itz truly awesone i think the battle scene in this movie is better than in the third or first one

Jul 22 2008,positive,the best trilogy ever
Jul 22 2008,positive,love all there movies
Jul 22 2008,neutral,i fell asleep so yeah
Jul 22 2008,positive,even though its the weakest of the three movies its still great the battle for helms deep is awesome and the design for gollum is perfect andy serkis kicks ass
Jul 22 2008,positive,now who said sequels cant be better than the original this might even be better than the 3rd
Jul 22 2008,positive,two words  helms deep  this movie is amazing and based off of easily the best book in the series they stuck true enough to the story and were presented with an awesome result
Jul 22 2008,negative,i treated my first viewing of the first lord of the rings film the fellowship of the ring as an obligation as a movie buff if a movie hits it big i feel obligated to see it because if you have a reputation as such a connoisseur of cinema people dont trust your opinion once they find that youve seen so many movies so you claim but you havent seen lord of the rings before i saw the second time i saw the first lord of the rings film i would say that fantasy and scifi hardly ever slay me much less those grand epic battle films but after awhile ive really grown to like them a lot i liked very much the fellowship of the ring and have cleaned my palette since then with roman epics fantasy films and others in that vein especially the ones the extensive running times because those feel bigger and more grandiose so i decided to very very late in the game complete the already classic trilogy and upon watching this second one with my newfound optimism with its placements in genres and subject matter i somehow felt a mixture of my feelings upon watching the first film the first time with great cynicism and obligation and the way i felt the second time    i wrote in my review way back when i rewatched this films predecessor despite having never read a syllable of any of jrr tolkiens work and knowing jack about elves halflings hobbits and orcs i was perfectly able to appreciate jacksons passionate adaptation it is an epic with effective moments of suspense atmosphere and action no i am not a fan of the dialogue that to me plagues the majority of fantasy and scifi films you know the pseudo medieval artificially dramatic semantics that can very easily tune me out of a film because of how wooden even the finest actor cant help but be when speaking that way and no the wardrobe of these films dont do much for me either however these components come with the territory and i can tell that recollection of the movie will carry on and taper off in a span of days which is a good sign i shouldve felt that way about its sequel but unfortunately i did not the same old cynicism and anticipation for the final credits returned from all that time ago when i first saw the first film    the dialects and rhetoric did aggravate me this time i could not get past them this time around i simply couldnt reach a logical conclusion as to why people in these films speak in such ridiculous ways that ive never heard of anyone from any culture speaking before for instance no one uses contractions never once saying didnt or cant this is a small example when things like this come to mind when listening to these characters i only begin to wonder why they speak this way why do some characters speak in variations of english accents and others speak in american ones is this a question answered in the books perhaps i shouldve read them before seeing these films but many fans have yet to read them so i figured i would be fine does one have to go through such an effort to enjoy a film an adaptation is not meant to be delivered in a way where the audience is expected to reference the book but for the sake of the films logic i hope that there is reason given in the books for middle earth being so ambiguous in its dialect and rhetoric uses the biggest and perhaps most legitimate complaint of mine is the completely unrealistic way ive spoken of but havent yet explained you know what they do they begin speaking very loudly then come very close to the listeners face and begins speaking in a whisper then walks away as if its not natural to expect a response from them and the listener simply stands studious and greatly effected by their words i could go on and on but in the interest of time ill move on    the battle sequences were surprisingly unimpressive to me there was no intensity the camerawork had a very pointandshoot style the dwarfs moments during the climactic battle his heroic comic relief is very corny and unneeded as i watch i see how everything is a soundstage mechanism i felt that the violence in the first film was much better portrayed    what i liked about this film was the plot strand involving gollum frodo and sam i felt compassion for gollum an uneasy not entirely entrusted compassion and enjoyed his development as a point of mystery between sympathetic character and antagonist i also liked the cinematography outside of the battle sequences just as i did in the first movie i love the atmosphere depicted in the fictitious villages and locales and i love the gothic and extravagant use of lighting during the climax even though i was disappointed in how unriveted i was in the battle i enjoyed the concept of all the culminations of all joined characters from all plot strands progressed over the course of three hours finally clashing together    i did not dislike this film but i could add the fellowship of the ring to my movie collection and would refuse to allow this sequel to be apart of it i simply dont think i could watch it again i hope the third one is the astonishing achievement its cracked up to be
Jul 22 2008,positive,they messed with faramir and other very important plot points way too much for me to really enjoy it i mean they almost completely destroyed faramirs character by making that change 
Jul 22 2008,positive,my favourite of the three movies  just thought it contained everything it needed to
Jul 22 2008,positive,11 stars 13rd of the best movie of all time

Jul 21 2008,positive,good continuation of trilogy
Jul 21 2008,positive,i knocked this one down a bit only because the fight scenes became repetative
Jul 21 2008,positive,sam    what we need is a few good taters   gollum    whats taters precious whats taters eh   sam    potaytoes boil em mash em stick em in a stew

Jul 20 2008,positive,i didnt think the series could get better after the fellowship but i was wrong this movie rocked
Jul 20 2008,positive,the movie deviates from the book but still the battle scene at helms deep was nicely done
Jul 20 2008,positive,the movie as such would probably deserve five stars but it is supposed to be the the lord of the rings and i read the book way to often not to be annoyed by the changes in the plot  that goes for all three movies
Jul 20 2008,positive,the slower of the three movies i still loved this movie lots of action at the end and i love the continuing dialogue between the dwarf and the elf 
Jul 20 2008,positive,who does not love this movie

Jul 19 2008,positive,darker than fellowship more action sets up the third movie perfectly
Jul 19 2008,positive,not as good as the first and last one but is still good to watch
Jul 19 2008,positive,a good story awesome effects and an all around good movie
Jul 19 2008,negative,i hate lord of the rings
Jul 19 2008,positive,this film was a thrilling sequel to the brilliance that was fellowship of the ring however it lacked a certain spark that the original had i cant put my finger on it but this one wasnt as enjoyable for me    the direction was very good once again props to peter jackson for a job well done the acting was again brilliant with elijah woods big eyes revealing every emotion and of course this film saw us introduced to gollum which is one of the best characters ive seen in a long time the effects were very good overall but i could see through the scenes with merry and pippin travelling with the trees    i think the screenplay was the only thing that let it down either that or there was a naturally weaker storyline compared to that of fotr i found the overlong fight scenes were there purely to make up for the lacking plot i also wasnt a fan of the somewhat cheesy shots of light coming from behind various characters i also didnt like the new gandalf that much i liked him better when he wasnt portrayed as a living god    overall a fairly apt sequel but not up to the originals reputation    710    moogirl
Jul 19 2008,negative,dire dire dire if youre going to make a movie of such a wellknown story dont change the plot  faramir is reduced to a pointless character and the battle of helms deep is about 20min too long bah unwatchable now due to the plot mangling

Jul 18 2008,positive,my fav of all the lotrs but i think they should cut all frodosamsmegul parts out
Jul 18 2008,negative,weakest of the three
Jul 18 2008,positive,better than the first
Jul 18 2008,positive,equally good as the first film but different bit darker and bigger in scale with the action sequences looks as it was harder to adapt than it was with the first film but still manages to make a great sequel the cast again make great performances and the visuals look dazzling

Jul 17 2008,positive,a new character emerges which made me fall in love with it smeagol  preciousssssss the battle scene in the end is simply the best i have ever seen apart from private ryan omaha beach scene that was bad ass too
Jul 17 2008,positive,my fave in the series
Jul 17 2008,positive,worst of the trilogy still great  top 100
Jul 17 2008,positive,i was not as fond of this adaptation as either of the two  the changes to the ents quite annoyed me  mind you this didnt stop me from loving it anyway it just wasnt 5 stars for me
Jul 17 2008,positive,a good midtrilogy film on par with empire strikes back the extended version is much better
Jul 17 2008,positive,great sequal to andgreat saga

Jul 15 2008,positive,we have paid for it with many lives
Jul 15 2008,positive,it seems in every trilogy there is one film that drops the ball compared to the rest and two towers was definately that film for lotr but considering how great all the movies are even this one it doesnt really matter the actors are still in top form and jackson still brings his agame but it seems as if after the success of fellowship new line was struck by the success of this series and started trying to make it appeal to a younger more modern audience which was just stupid considering it already did that perfectly if you dont call legolas skateboarding down a flight of stairs on a shield appealing to the younger generations i dont know what is still a fantastic movie above any other just below the other two lotr
Jul 15 2008,positive,watched it about 20 times
Jul 15 2008,positive,yes  awesome movies
Jul 15 2008,positive,another solid installment in the lord of the rings series the action is good and the direction is fantastic but the movie seems to be longer then needed with little artistic value to compensate

Jul 14 2008,positive,loved it but it was kind of long
Jul 14 2008,positive,even if you dont like the way tolkien writes but still do love fantasy stories then this is the ultimate fantasy saga look for the special extended edition and the other two parts of the trilogy

Jul 14 2008,positive,oh my gosh the best movie ever
Jul 14 2008,positive,full marks for every film in this trilogy
Jul 14 2008,positive,debatably the weakest film of the trilogy this doesnt stop it from being ballbouncingly awesome
Jul 14 2008,positive,i thought this part would end up as my favorite then rotk blew me away
Jul 13 2008,negative,boring boring boring did i forget to yawn
Jul 13 2008,positive,not my favorite episode of the trio
Jul 13 2008,positive,im your sam mr frodo this movie had a great battle scene and story
Jul 13 2008,positive,this magical movie helps lead you on to the third this movie also helps to conclude all of your questions and wonders love the graphic battle scenes
Jul 13 2008,positive,such a great movie i absolutely loved it every bit the lotr films are best viewed in theaters though i think itd be wise to rerelease the trilogy every ten years
Jul 13 2008,positive,as with all 3 of these films the extended versions are the best to watch  love the battle at helms deep
Jul 13 2008,positive,good but not the best became too much of an effects movie
Jul 13 2008,positive,this is truly a marvel piece of artthere may one day be greater movies than these rings movies and i pray for it but until then i will gladly watch gandelf ride down that hill with the sun at his back blinding the orcs and the ultimate speech by samwise over and over againthis is also the proud owner of the greatest directors cut ever it is a crime what they cut out of this film for money ie ticket salesbut it is sort of ok cause you can now watch the extended versions of these films and the stuff added in towers is unfrickingbelievable
Jul 13 2008,positive,the epic countinues in this epic sequal
Jul 13 2008,positive,i think tolkien would have been happy with his vision brought to life with these three movies  i just wish more of the book had made it onto the screen  this would have made a grand miniseries but this way it made oodles more money
Jul 13 2008,negative,boring i actually fell asleep during this movie i never do that
Jul 13 2008,positive,the best of the three
Jul 13 2008,positive,part 2 of trilogy finally got to be familiar with the names and plot the fighting scenes were good and all
Jul 13 2008,positive,all lord of the rings are great
Jul 12 2008,positive,great but not as good as the first
Jul 12 2008,positive,not the best of the trilogy but its still an awsome adittion thats well acted and mezmerizing
Jul 12 2008,negative,despite a lot of action i still managed to fall asleep in this3 hour movie
Jul 12 2008,positive,it just sums up what happened in the first and leads on to the third still very good cant wait for the hobbit to come out
Jul 12 2008,positive,love that fantasy world
Jul 12 2008,positive,disappointing sequel that made me realize what happens when you have all the scenes of three movies being filmed out of order it was almost painfully obvious at times that the cast in some scenes that temporally happen half through the series are just working with each other for the first time and i think the special effects were not exactly finished for the screen some things looked very sloppy then in the dvd they looked remarkably cleaned up and tighter anyway still fun to watch but only to see christopher lee do it to ian mckellen
Jul 12 2008,positive,tolkiens words along with peter jacksons faithful adaptation  inspired vision have created something no one man could equal in a very long time does the same to the fantasy genre that star wars did to adventurous scifi
Jul 12 2008,positive,ive watched them all but i just dont get it but find the filming  special offects incredable hence my rating
Jul 12 2008,positive,double the fantasytastic fun
Jul 12 2008,positive,aragorn ride out with me ride out and meet them  theoden for death and glory  za vreme ove scene redovno placem
Jul 11 2008,positive,probably my favorite of the trilogy or a very close second rotk peter jackson has done a phenomonal job and i cant wait until the hobbit is released and im confident it will be amazing with peter producing  taking us closer to mordor frodo sam and a new companion escape danger just in time in quite a few places  see it
Jul 11 2008,positive,i loved all three movies well done
Jul 11 2008,positive,better then the first thats all i can say
Jul 11 2008,positive,best trilogy of all time
Jul 11 2008,positive,probably my favorite movie out of the trilogy the movie continues from the first and leads up to the last installment the war scenes and adventure are truely breath taking
Jul 11 2008,negative,another couple hours of walking
Jul 11 2008,positive,saw all 3 in a row in german cinema was numb after all those what nearly 9 hours  but well worth it
Jul 11 2008,positive,the best book as well as the best film full of actionthe battle of helms deep which was considered unfilmablethe march of the entsjust an all action fantasy of the highest order read the bookits even bettershelob is in it the best
Jul 11 2008,positive,the two towers gets bogged down by some extraneous dialogue sequences and some really bad deusexmachina moments that aside its still a necessary component to a great trilogy
Jul 11 2008,positive,i watched this movie like a 100 times but i still cant stop watching it
Jul 11 2008,positive,great stuff but im a fan from the golden age of these things called books
Jul 11 2008,positive,huge lotr fan this movie pretty darn good just not a perfect all my thoughts are the same as the review for the first film id wish they didnt change up some much with the plot i dont care if they leave things completely out though but it wasnt enough to make me hate peter jackson over i just started to hate him when i saw king kong
Jul 11 2008,positive,hmmive been a tolkien fan since 87 so im biased  but i hate to rate it high like all these neotolkienites who have never read the books  fuck it
Jul 11 2008,positive,lord of the rings was great
Jul 11 2008,positive,part of that triology
Jul 11 2008,positive,awesome purely amazing
Jul 11 2008,positive,awesome film amazing battle sequences helms deep is breathtaking
Jul 11 2008,positive,the middle film of the trilogy  the intense chase by the remainder of the fellowship and the brutal battle of helms deep are balanced by the gentle poetic gravity of treebeard and the ents  the difficulty of adapting a middle chapter is mitigated by more assured direction by director peter jackson
Jul 11 2008,positive,i absolutly love this film and the first filmit has a balance of some of the most greatest actors and actresses and i will never tire of watching the trilogy
Jul 10 2008,positive,the least powerful of the 3  but thats true to the books themselves  still a superior film
Jul 10 2008,positive,this was a great film and trilogy
Jul 10 2008,positive,for me ranks close to star wars seriously

Jul 10 2008,positive,my personal fav of the trilogydef a masterpiece
Jul 10 2008,positive,dramatic action packed film
Jul 10 2008,positive,worst out of the three
Jul 10 2008,positive,this is the best of the trilogy for three reasons gollums schizophrenia the rohan family drama and helms deep it has more substance than fellowship and less fat than return of the king making it the greatest film of the last ten years
Jul 10 2008,positive,great but to long to get to the end
Jul 10 2008,positive,simply amazing epic
Jul 10 2008,positive,lol think everyones seen this  decent film im not much of an lotr fan though

Jul 10 2008,positive,real magic best movie i have ever seenlord of the ring rocks
Jul 10 2008,positive,in my mind the greatest film ever made
Jul 10 2008,positive,ummm best movies ever 10 years in the making and probably one of the only movies to rival production qaulity with star wars acting is great and the storyline is so deep you could make over a dozen movies from sideplots alone never will i love another movie more ever    1010
Jul 9 2008,positive,i love this movie it has awesome battle scenes and symblolizes a lot from the bible
Jul 9 2008,positive,these are all beautifully done

Jul 8 2008,negative,this trilogy was the worst nine hours of my life
Jul 8 2008,positive,picks up from the first and really gets going well big screen extravaganza that i couldnt wait to see
Jul 8 2008,positive,in truth the lotr series should be seen as one loong movie but if one were to be forced to make a choice between them this ones the best of the lot
Jul 8 2008,positive,least favorite of the lotr movies theres a big chunk of the movie that is just kind of ponderous dont get me wrong though its still a lotr movie
Jul 8 2008,positive,this one was amazing until i read the books and realized it could have been much better however still great visuals for the book and great special effects
Jul 8 2008,positive,all these movie are amazing
Jul 8 2008,negative,again my rating of the lord of the rings movies are based on what i felt when i watched them for all the undeniable genius and effort that peter jackson poured into these expansive and good looking movies over the best part of 10 years will i be bothered if i never see this again no not likely
Jul 8 2008,positive,set in a time of uncertainty in the land of middleearth a tale which charts a heroic quest which centers around an intrepid hobbit the future of civilization rests in the fate of the one ring whi read more read more ch has been lost for centuries powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it but fate has placed it in the hands of a young hobbit named frodo baggins who inherits the ring and steps into legend   a fellowship bands together to lend frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission in this movie the fellowship gets divided and all of fate lies in frodo and sams hands    
Jul 8 2008,positive,all of this movie was awesome and peter jackson did a great job
Jul 8 2008,positive,the worst of the three but that just means it kicks the least amount of ass
Jul 8 2008,positive,in my view the best of the trilogy gollum is wicked great effects great story
Jul 8 2008,positive,great great and great
Jul 8 2008,positive,brilliantly dark  great film  my second favorite of the three  king is the best one but all are among the best films ever made  ever

Jul 7 2008,positive,evil can seduce anyone
Jul 7 2008,positive,not as interesting as the first and the lastwill do tho
Jul 7 2008,neutral,the ents and golem almost made the movie watchable  this movie is boring and the love story between liv tylers and viggo mortensen is just about the worst love story ever put to film almost as bad as the notebook

Jul 6 2008,positive,loved it fav of all time
Jul 6 2008,positive,this movie keeps up the high quality begun by the first movie carries it all the way through and sets up the great third and final movie perfectly
Jul 6 2008,positive,even for being the middle film of the trilogy the two towers holds its own  continues the amazing quality that fellowship laid the groundwork for
Jul 6 2008,positive,ive never watched the entire thing of these movies they are so loooong

Jul 5 2008,positive,great sequel continues the saga of a great trilogy
Jul 5 2008,positive,not as good as the first or third but still a very good movie with amazing effects and since it was shot in new zealand its gorgeous see all 3
Jul 5 2008,positive,this is the only movie version i liked better than the book
Jul 5 2008,positive,while this movie is the middle act of a threepart story with no clear beginning and ending it never drags and neither does it feel unnecessary  it managed to bring gollum to life in a way i never thought possible  and to do the ents in a way that wasnt completely boring or cheesy was also quite an accomplishment  the battle of helms deep was staggering capturing the desperation in the hearts of the rohirim
Jul 5 2008,positive,one of the best sequels ever
Jul 5 2008,neutral,even though im not a fan of this trilogy this one was pretty decent

Jul 4 2008,positive,i love it i always have
Jul 4 2008,positive,peter jackson did it again  great movie  stuck to the novel
Jul 4 2008,positive,i love all of these movies
Jul 4 2008,positive,good movie extended rules
Jul 4 2008,positive,apparently a good adaption of the book this one i enjoyed because of the battle at helms deep gollum will drive you crazy in this flick the soundtrack is very melancholy and hauting go howard shore
Jul 4 2008,positive,too much action compared to the first one which some people may like but not me i also lost the connection to the characters as well which was part of the reason why i liked the first one so much
Jul 4 2008,positive,all 3 movies togeather would have to be my current alltime favorite movie
Jul 4 2008,positive,freaking effects are awesome
Jul 3 2008,positive,a good film i think all three films really show a struggle so fantastic that its hard not to be amazed
Jul 3 2008,positive,somethings done in the film made me go hmmm to  but i figured must have been a hollywood thing  helms deep battle was impressive

Jul 3 2008,positive,this is my favorite of the 3
Jul 3 2008,positive,which one was this i dont think i saw the last onethis isnt it is it
Jul 3 2008,positive,this gets four stars only because that flashback scene with faramir and boromir which is included in the extended version should never have been cut
Jul 3 2008,positive,helms deep enough said
Jul 3 2008,positive,this one was the farthest from the books and as such was the least of the 3 movies but it was still good especially the extended edition
Jul 3 2008,neutral,only descent lotr movie thats because the actors dont talk much so you dont get to realize how much they suck and how idiotic the dialogues and the plot are
Jul 3 2008,positive,honestly i thought it was the best of the three  and that comment about the box
Jul 3 2008,positive,loved it im a tolkien fan  and jackson did a super job of filming the lord of the rings trilogy
Jul 3 2008,positive,golum still scares the hell outta me
Jul 3 2008,positive,this was the worst of the trilogy  it dragged in a lot of places  i didnt enjoy this one much

Jul 2 2008,positive,the best of the lotr films
Jul 2 2008,positive,was the weakest of the three but compared to all the other crap thats out there this blows it out of the water  helms deep scene was great
Jul 2 2008,positive,love love love this movie the battle of helms deep is one of the most epic battles in a movie ever i love the story line and the movie never seems to drag which is good for a 2½ hour long movie the acting is amazing
Jul 2 2008,positive,a masterpiece an epic tale of good versus evil faithful to the books too
Jul 2 2008,positive,i like the 3 movies but  this is my favorite
Jul 2 2008,positive,i enjoyed all of these movies but they really arent my bag
Jul 2 2008,positive,theres some good in this world mr frodoand its worth fighting for
Jul 2 2008,positive,instant classic for the whole family
Jul 2 2008,positive,i really enjoyed the series of these movies
Jul 2 2008,positive,great second installment
Jul 2 2008,positive,despite containing some of the trilogys best scenes its probably all told the weakest of the three   but not by much  its still a spectacular epic
Jul 2 2008,positive,more nerdporn but at least its pretty wellwritten nerdporn
Jul 1 2008,positive,fingers tired to much rating
Jul 1 2008,negative,not bad but not a fan
Jul 1 2008,positive,the whole trilogy is amazing
Jul 1 2008,positive,its ok not the best ever made though
Jul 1 2008,positive,this one had a lot of war in it but the beauty of the way it was filmed was that a lot was left to the imagination  the mind can create for itself what it thinks is happening when an ax falls but you dont actually have to look at what happens  they dont show it  it is very clever  very well done      i love the way humor is infused throughoutfor example the count between the elf and the dwarf after the big battle  and how frodos character has developed
Jul 1 2008,positive,a good epic as good as epics are of course
Jul 1 2008,positive,talk about epic  the siege at the end of the film is extraordinary but you really have the watch the film in the context of the others to understand what is going on
Jul 1 2008,positive,a new power is rising
Jul 1 2008,negative,a movie for little boys and grown men who like elf feet
Jul 1 2008,positive,the bridge of the two movies that takes us further on the journey and drives us deeper into the story making us care for the characters even more i love the return of gandalf if only dumbledore could do the same again the special effects are pretty much amazing and of course the shots the scenes with near perfection a nice well done movie without being overcooked
Jul 1 2008,neutral,the story got complicating from the first installment of the moviei gave up
Jul 1 2008,positive,not as good as the first one but awesome anyway
Jul 1 2008,positive,you would think the series could not possibly get better from here
Jul 1 2008,positive,you would think the series could not possibly get better from here
Jul 1 2008,positive,these movies got really lame after the awesome kick off that was the first
Jun 30 2008,positive,probably my favorite of the three just because of the welldone battle at helms deep  still some flaws though
Jun 30 2008,positive,a fitting continuation of the fellowship was not disappointed in the least
Jun 30 2008,positive,it all somewhat relied on a half hour sequence what about the rest
Jun 30 2008,positive,the lotr series were some of the best book to movie adaptations ever made i mean to be honest the book sucked the movie was so engaging and entertaining whereas i read half of the first book and quit from the sheer amount of drinking and merrymaking
Jun 30 2008,neutral,walk walk walk walk walk thats all this movie is one big frickin troll walk to a volcano with a lil ring toss at the end
Jun 30 2008,positive,dont even get me started on lord of the rings
Jun 30 2008,positive,best of the 3 however still maintain that it is an overrated series
Jun 30 2008,positive,best scifi movie everexcept harry potter sorry frodo
Jun 30 2008,positive,the only negative about this movie is gollum how he was potrayed besides that great visuals and great acting
Jun 30 2008,positive,this is my favorite one in the lord of the rings trilogy mostly because it has a lot of action in it
Jun 30 2008,negative,i just dont like lord of the rings
Jun 30 2008,positive,i do have distict preferances between these movies but i love them all and know that they are all masterpieces  this one is probably the most influential with every shitty epic coming out trying to wow us with the scope of their sprawlingly huge battle scenes  but none of them even touch on the brilliance of helms deep
Jun 30 2008,positive,the better of the 3 films if i had 2 choosebattle of helms deep was immense
Jun 30 2008,positive,wait gandolf is alive
Jun 30 2008,positive,what can i say excellent deepsuperb
Jun 30 2008,positive,the greatest film trilogy ever imo
Jun 30 2008,positive,if they just hadnt screwed up helms deep so much
Jun 30 2008,positive,i think this was the best one
Jun 29 2008,positive,i just love this trilogy
Jun 29 2008,negative,booooring i never understood the story too long
Jun 29 2008,positive,the worst of the three lord of the rings films but still an awesome movie

Jun 29 2008,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
Jun 29 2008,positive,the anti for the phrase sequels suck usually i find that the middle film in a trilogy is the worst which is very understandable its gonna feel rushed and like not much got done you feel none of that in two towers i can place all three of the lotr films together as one because to me not one is better than any other two

Jun 27 2008,positive,a new kind of people is introduced with its culture and different kind of music ofcourse the story continues and becomes variated with the different chronological living of sam and frodo at the one hand and the others at the other hand in this film you can expect a first great battle wich needs to been seen with surround

Jun 24 2008,positive,makes for a good transition with some dragging spots
Jun 24 2008,positive,pretty well done  a step up from the first in that it contains more epic scenes and of course the ents were cool  a step back in that i always thought the idea of the fellowship and that quest was a much better storyline than when everyone went their own way  better than the third in that it doesnt ever feel like its hopelessly dragging  good sequel

Jun 23 2008,positive,not my favorite of the three but really good anyway
Jun 23 2008,positive,usually the 2nd movie is any trilogy is the worst one but peter jackson made this into one of the most engaging movies of any trilogies out there
Jun 23 2008,positive,to me it was just slightly a step backwards from the first there is a lot of action going on but i dont think it was quite as perfect of a package as the first
Jun 23 2008,positive,2nd installment in peter jacksons epic adaptation of tolkeins ring trilogy
Jun 22 2008,positive,sequel 2 itjust as g00devery0ne l0ves the battle at helms deepii cried like a babii when they killed haldir

Jun 22 2008,positive,helms deep is pretty sweet was that this one i dont remember they all kinda mesh together
Jun 22 2008,positive,peter jackson strikes yet another target with the two towers this movie had nothing missing and is great entertainment this had way more action sequences and much more crazy looking visuals that will make you ooh and awe for the entire movie this movie was a huge improvement from the fellowship of the ring i know that the first book doesnt have that much fighting and more adventuring but there was something missing of the entire outcome of it this movie does not it is fully polished for perfection and is great eye candy the battle at helms deep will make you sit on the edge of your seat and stare at the crazy looking visuals and explosions the raid of isengard will do the same both will make you smile at how good peter jackson has brought this great book to the big screen this movie is one of the greatest movies ever made
Jun 22 2008,positive,my favorite saw it  3 or 4 times in theaters the first one is my second favorite
Jun 22 2008,positive,another movie of just walking the tress started walking in this one

Jun 20 2008,positive,great opening for gollums descent this is how you make movies if you have to use liv plenty of story comedy asskicking battles  proper use of cgi to let you enjoy the fantasy without deviating too much from the text i didnt think they could top the battles in the 1st one but i was happy to be wrong great climax for the 2nd part of a 12hour epic

Jun 19 2008,positive,battle for helms deep was awesometruely awesome
Jun 18 2008,positive,if one watches the extended version of this movie one does not simply walk into mordor because ones legs have atrophied from disuse this film is long
Jun 18 2008,negative,it might have been a bit better if i had seen the 1st one first  it was way to long
Jun 18 2008,positive,this is a great addition to an awesome series
Jun 18 2008,positive,still great along with its companions not quite as strong and magical as the first and third but still has its greatness

Jun 17 2008,negative,i can not stand lord of the rings movies
Jun 17 2008,positive,once again perfect  they should have noticed however that legolas was missing his blue eyes and pointy ears in a few scenes      this movie was the best in regards to skirmishes
Jun 17 2008,positive,weakest of the three movies but its still fantastic filmmaking  this is where they make the transition from adventure film to war film  they changed a lot more stuff this time around and while i can see why they did it it still bugged me mostly faramir  anyway after some time ive learned to deal with it    considering they had to make a movie with no beginning or resolution this is a vrey good film
Jun 17 2008,positive,a decent followup to fellowship it tends to meander a bit as does the novel and jackson invents pieces of stories solely to keep liv tyler on screen not as good as the first but still darn good
Jun 17 2008,positive,3 hours of my life wasted oh well
Jun 17 2008,positive,my favorite lotr of the trilogy

Jun 16 2008,positive,i remember being initially put off by the changes from the book  but gradually i grew to respect the more naturally cinematic plot of the screenplay  and now well i just love it    two things make this pieceit is not its own film it is the middle of one ten or twelve hour movieremarkable on its own terms  the creation of gollum by an overachieving visual effects team and the incomparable andy serkis and the clawedout devastating battle of helms deep  there really is nothing else like it on film
Jun 16 2008,positive,i like these movies aloti just dont watch em alot
Jun 16 2008,positive,underrated the second part was always going to be the diffcult one being a proper ie nonconstructed trilogy but i prefer it to its brethren pacing effects acting and mostimportantly monsters all better in this film

Jun 16 2008,positive,great cinematography and special effects  battle scenes are also a must see  best of the lord of the rings series
Jun 16 2008,positive,orcs elves urukai swords arrows and a ring good versus evil it doesnt get any better than this the battle for helms deep is some of the best cinematography ever

Jun 16 2008,positive,great film watched it twice  great effects great actors 
Jun 16 2008,positive,like a 700 hour movie good sound effects and scenery filmed in new zealand
Jun 16 2008,positive,though these movies are all waaaaay too long imo this superior sequel does what the first didnt do for me once again you marvel at the sense of awe jacksons dazzling visuals inspire but this time the characters are more threedimensional and i cared a little more for them this time and lets face it gollum is quite likely one of the 20 greatest characters in film history
Jun 16 2008,positive,nicedifficult to follow and understand though
Jun 16 2008,positive,this one was my favorite out of all three of them

Jun 15 2008,positive,i found this one of the best movies ever made in my life time but i have watched movies that are older then i am

Jun 15 2008,positive,awesome awesome i like the clerks 2 connection too
Jun 15 2008,positive,the movie is loaded with epic battles scenes but i never thought for once it sacrificed story for action tough call to pick between this and the fellowship for my favorite one of the series but if you put a gun to my head id probably pick this one

Jun 15 2008,neutral,after the great start with fellowship i really looked forward to this what i got was peter jackson hacking the crap out of the book it was too long too boring he added bits he didnt need to cut bits he shouldnt of nearly killed the series for me
Jun 15 2008,positive,good movie brillaint effects and good story
Jun 15 2008,positive,the pace really picked up with this film and that was a welcome relief from the boredom of most of the fellowship of the ring helms deep one of my favourite chapters was a masterstroke and will be remembered for a long while

Jun 14 2008,positive,it was a very well contructed film though i am not a fan of actions movies
Jun 14 2008,positive,the funny thing is this is the weak link in the series
Jun 14 2008,positive,haha symbolic i like the music
Jun 14 2008,positive,probably the weakest of the three films which isnt really saying much
Jun 14 2008,negative,the emphasis on the climatic battle was too similar to the return of the king but with less story
Jun 14 2008,positive,amazingwhat film was meant to capture
Jun 14 2008,positive,the worst of the trilogy still ridiculously good though
Jun 14 2008,negative,dont like trilogy of lord of the ring
Jun 14 2008,positive,an intriguing and beautiful trilogy
Jun 14 2008,positive,perfect overflow between 3 amazing partsseen 4 times
Jun 14 2008,neutral,geek fest but interesting to watch
Jun 14 2008,positive,possibly my favorite movie of all time  the battle scene at the end had me on the edge of my seat

Jun 13 2008,positive,good movie too long not a big fan of lotr
Jun 13 2008,positive,my least favorite of the 3 but still amazing
Jun 13 2008,negative,when they talk about doing violence to the text they mean this movie a terrible unfaithful adaptation of tolkiens brilliant tremendously beautiful magnum opus skip the movie and read the book instead
Jun 13 2008,positive,i think i saw this wasnt it really long
Jun 13 2008,positive,hehe frodo sexy when he gets all possessed
Jun 13 2008,positive,i enjoyed this movie
Jun 13 2008,positive,good but not as good as the other two mind you this is great but you know what i mean this is the one with the endless talking trees and that senile king ohhh boy oh yeah and lots and lots of gollum  rewatch notes i either was too harsh on this or i liked this a lot better the second time around  was a fun rewatch thats for sure
Jun 13 2008,positive,this movie is pretty cool
Jun 13 2008,positive,in my opinion the weakest of the 3 but it does have the best battle scene of the trilogy helms deep
Jun 13 2008,positive,i wanted to love this movie as much as i loved fellowship but they just botched this one horribly  even if i hadnt fallen in love with the books 25 years before the movie was released i would have been disappointed in this one  despite that ill still give it 45 stars just because its the lord of the rings
Jun 13 2008,positive,excellent and the sound track even better
Jun 13 2008,positive,best movie of the trilogy only they kind of forgot the spider haha

Jun 12 2008,positive,orlando bloom is incredible in this one
Jun 12 2008,positive,the fellowship has split and towers takes you on all the different journeys going on we are finally really introduced to gollum and we learn how he is very much two personalities wrapped into one helms deep battle is epic and the ending is quite a cliffhanger its hard to believe i could actually wait a whole year to see the conclusion
Jun 12 2008,negative,tripe if you actually like tolkien
Jun 12 2008,positive,the best of the three
Jun 12 2008,positive,they did a great job on the second part of the movie
Jun 12 2008,positive,this movie is coooooooooooooool
Jun 12 2008,positive,not as good as the book really pj dumbed down legolas and gimlis relationship and made it too modern when it should have been encompassed in its own medieval fantastic world legolas as captain obvious irritated me and only served to fuel thousands of screaming fan girls excitement otherwise it is a beautiful adaptation of the story
Jun 12 2008,positive,love all these none batter
Jun 12 2008,positive,godly work of tolkein coming to life
Jun 12 2008,negative,decent but definitely my leaast favorite of the 3  changing the ents and faramir is inexcusable
Jun 12 2008,neutral,um which one was this  they all kinda blurred together
Jun 12 2008,positive,one of the best movies made of all time
Jun 11 2008,positive,great book great film adaptation
Jun 11 2008,positive,more of what i loved about the first

Jun 11 2008,positive,least favorite of the 3 but still good
Jun 11 2008,positive,this is the movie where peter jackson mastered the art of the slow motion woman crying scene while the men go off to battle  makes me cringe everytime but still a great movie
Jun 11 2008,positive,good but the third one rules
Jun 11 2008,positive,lotr rocks my socks best movies ever made
Jun 11 2008,neutral,a good film for any one who likes the lord of the rings set
Jun 11 2008,positive,perfect build up for the big finale
Jun 11 2008,positive,i dont understand why people were so unhappy with this film  the battle sequences were amazing  i liked it just as much as the first one
Jun 11 2008,positive,in junior high i must have watched this 10 times
Jun 10 2008,positive,another fantastic epic with fantastic effects the story continues with the same characters we know and love
Jun 10 2008,positive,the greatest movie of all time i im a huge lotr fan i have watched them dozens of times heck i could resite the whole 1st movie
Jun 10 2008,positive,my favorite one of the three that little frodo gets me going in a hetero kinda way
Jun 10 2008,positive,peeerfect and what a soundtrack the score breathless
Jun 10 2008,positive,not as good as the first but was really well done  i was glued to the screen during the last battle at helms deep
Jun 10 2008,positive,seriously my favorite of the series
Jun 10 2008,positive,the version released in the theaters is a mess the extended version is better
Jun 10 2008,positive,the second film in a trilogy is often the weakest but this holds up to scrutiny the directors cuts of these films are definitely the best versions by the way an outstanding achievement
Jun 10 2008,positive,i like all these movies
Jun 10 2008,positive,a huge success of a movie the producers apparently did something right
Jun 10 2008,positive,i call this the president of the lotr trilogy wonderfully directed and acted with a plot that keeps the audience in suspense more than its predecessor and successor   this is the main course amongst the trilogy and the two towers evidently deserved the record tying 11academy awards and not the return of the king
Jun 10 2008,positive,a great sequel for lotr gollums dialogue is fantastic great special effects
Jun 10 2008,positive,a very very good trilogy
Jun 10 2008,positive,gotta like the tall trees
Jun 10 2008,positive,this is a lesson in how to make sequels better than the originals
Jun 10 2008,positive,this is better than the first one but i liked the third one better than this one fav scene was when gollum was talking to himself in a split personality
Jun 10 2008,positive,how much do i love any lord of the rings
Jun 10 2008,positive,love this fucking trilogy
Jun 10 2008,positive,i used to not like this one but then i watched it again and its really good
Jun 10 2008,negative,havent seen any of them and dont want to
Jun 10 2008,positive,a difficultbook to recreate with such a divergence of plotlines but for those who loved the book a brilliant experience  peter jackson proved his stuff in making this
Jun 10 2008,positive,in terms of general visual affects cinematography art direction make up and so on the film is absoloutely faultless and the director has done a brilliant job in keeping the film as close to the storyline and as relevant as possible however the fact that the storyline from the book itself does require a high amount of patience and understanding makes this film difficult to watch for the average audience
Jun 10 2008,positive,everything except the battle of helms deep is rubbish but the battle of helms deep is brilliant
Jun 10 2008,positive,youll laugh youll cry youll hurl  no wait wrong film  just the first two
Jun 10 2008,neutral,going back and watching these movies i i got that feeling you get when you watch a movie as a child and its the best thing ever then re watch it as an adult and its embarrassing  yeah i got that with these movies sadly
Jun 10 2008,positive,this one dragged on a bit
Jun 10 2008,negative,it just went on and on and on
Jun 9 2008,positive,the books were better i say
Jun 9 2008,positive,i would sit through the extended version any day
Jun 9 2008,positive,superb  i cant find words to describe it a must see
Jun 9 2008,positive,the lesser installment
Jun 9 2008,positive,second part of probably the best trilogy to this day absolutely fantastic
Jun 9 2008,positive,never read the books would luv to
Jun 9 2008,positive,i believe that this is tha best of tha 3 movies
Jun 9 2008,positive,follow up on all the others this is just as good
Jun 9 2008,positive,i have all of them
Jun 9 2008,positive,5 stars means excellencein all 3 of these outstandin filmsmy  favourites
Jun 9 2008,positive,gaah a difficult movie to rate actually but because i view the trilogy as a whole i say its a good break or tensionbuilder for the previous and next films i just dunno  but i like it of course
Jun 9 2008,positive,i love how they made a great movie out of a great book
Jun 9 2008,positive,more action and relationship issues loved it a great middle piece
Jun 9 2008,positive,great epic movies 
Jun 9 2008,positive,worst of the lotr movies but still dope as hell they dont nominate a movie for best picture if it sucks  exception being titanic
Jun 9 2008,positive,i would argue that this film is greater than the academy award best picture the return of the king because it navigates to different levels of vulnerability and survival when you get down to this film you realize that there is so much more at risk in this one as a wasting country of rohan finds the strength to defend itself against an unstoppable force known as the urukhai
Jun 8 2008,negative,is a good saga but this is the worst film
Jun 8 2008,positive,my favorite of the lotr trilogy
Jun 8 2008,positive,i saw this one at the movies theater and i have the movie 2
Jun 8 2008,neutral,i have seen this movie wayyy too many times for my own liking it was pretty good the first time around though
Jun 8 2008,positive,the action really starts in the middle movie of the trilogy  and we get introduced to the great characters of rohan and gondor  the battle of helms deep is amazing and just a hint of whats to come in the final movie
Jun 8 2008,positive,better than the first not as good as the third so wonderful
Jun 8 2008,positive,i am probably the only person that did not get excited about this movie ill give it a 3 for graphics
Jun 8 2008,positive,this is one of my favorites
Jun 8 2008,positive,the second film in the trilogy epic movie with one of the best battle scene
Jun 8 2008,positive,i cant sing praises enough brilliant captures the imagination good storytelling interesting characters enchanting world a very tempting reality all in all a very very good follow up of the first movie and fore runner to the third
Jun 8 2008,positive,awsome love it the best
Jun 8 2008,positive,i love this movie
Jun 8 2008,positive,i loved this one this would have to be my favorite out of all them
Jun 8 2008,positive,a little bit slow in some places cough frodo sam and gollum cough but otherwise brilliant
Jun 8 2008,negative,3 hours of people walking even the trees walked in those movies
Jun 8 2008,positive,better than the 1st but not by much
Jun 8 2008,positive,middle of the new trilogy hobbit man has done good
Jun 8 2008,positive,my least fave of the trilogy
Jun 8 2008,positive,not quite the book but unmissable anyway  lots of action fantastic scenery and hot guys running around full of testosterone
Jun 7 2008,negative,ughhh it just went on and on and on too many trees not enough exciting
Jun 7 2008,positive,i think this is the second best of the three  gollum is amazing and the final battle scene is tremendous  it gets a little bogged down at times and doesnt have the novelty element of the fellowship but otherwise is very strong
Jun 7 2008,positive,the best trilogy ever
Jun 7 2008,positive,i love these bookslove these movies
Jun 7 2008,positive,see review of the fellowship
Jun 7 2008,positive,best of the bunch probably
Jun 7 2008,positive,loved the whole trilogy
Jun 7 2008,positive,best movie trilogy now and forever d51
Jun 7 2008,positive,the part of the trees is great
Jun 7 2008,positive,i love movie like this and i think it was very good it keep me on my toes wondering what is going to happen if you have not seen it you should
Jun 7 2008,positive,absolutely fantastic
Jun 7 2008,negative,i didnt enjoy any of these
Jun 7 2008,positive,amazing film with great action scenes a wonderful story and  great cinematography
Jun 7 2008,positive,better than the 1st great story acting and cinematography
Jun 7 2008,positive,theres a limitless number of ways one can say fuck you  i dont think there is a better one than at the introduction of this movie when gandalf bellows you shall not pass  this followed up by fighting that balrog while falling to his inevitable doomdude its awesome  geronimo mother fucker is probably still my favorite however    sams speech at the end of this i never noticed until now is really good  i guess i was distracted by the weird dialogue between frodo and sam since fellowship that everyone always notices above any other aspect of these films  we always have to throw in some homosexual controversy over a damn good movie    now im not one of those assholes that says oh lord of the rings is the best star wars has been defeated  no i recognize that they are both great films  now i know many morons that say star wars can kick lord of the rings ass any day  yes in many parts yes perhaps star wars is better but these people also need to recognize that these movies give hope to the rest that movie makers today can still make great movies  lord of the rings is a great movie
Jun 7 2008,positive,the secont of the lord of the rings
Jun 7 2008,positive,very cool peter jackson has got it
Jun 7 2008,positive,love all the lord of the rings  i have all of them
Jun 6 2008,positive,the battle of helms deepif tolkien could see that pivotal epic point brought to the screeni have no doubt he would spout praises  in elvish of course  the likes of which the world had never seen  much like the battle itself peter jackson would most likely accumulate several nicknames in the process like aragornelessar estel wingfoot strider heir of isildur son of arathorn etc anyway most excellent film
Jun 6 2008,positive,this sequel to the fellowship was a great great follow up to it i just hated how it left you wanting more the ent attack is one to watch
Jun 6 2008,positive,my other favorite movie  i love the whole trilogy and the books are my favorite books in the entire world  peter jackson and jrr tolkien are geniuses
Jun 6 2008,positive,good battle at the end
Jun 6 2008,positive,love every one hello orlando
Jun 6 2008,positive,not my favorite but another accurate depiction of the original bookjrrt would have been proud
Jun 6 2008,positive,love all of these  when the army arrives at dawn on the 5th day i still get goose bumps
Jun 6 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy
Jun 6 2008,positive,the second even more epic installment of the trilogy  lots of plot in this one and did i mention a few grand battle scenes  tolkein couldnt have asked for better
Jun 6 2008,negative,boring
Jun 6 2008,positive,loved all of these movies
Jun 6 2008,positive,omg i love this  and orlando bloom 
Jun 6 2008,positive,loved it all the way
Jun 6 2008,positive,the two towers does suprisingly well is continuing this epic trilogy  the script perfectly integrates 4 different stories with ease and most importantly created gollum being next to jack sparrow and the joker as the most memorable characters of the 21st century    the soundtrack does well boasting the might of rohan and the malevolence of isengard but fails on treebeard    acting  oustanding  the battle of helms deep is brilliantly epic and utterly unforgetable  not better than the other two but in no way worse  brilliant  93
Jun 5 2008,positive,unfrigginbelievable  one of hte greatest films ever
Jun 5 2008,positive,one of the greatest books of all time its a great movie for anyone who enjoys readin the books
Jun 5 2008,positive,great movie tons of cool stuff
Jun 5 2008,positive,i had to cry most of the time throughout the film great movie
Jun 5 2008,positive,the lotr trilogy is one of the great cinematic achievements of our time theyre nothing extraordinarily complex but just plain excellently crafted epics theres really no discernible nonbiased reasoning that could knock these movies
Jun 5 2008,positive,what happened what why change the story there was no need none still its middle earth and some cool visuals and 
Jun 5 2008,positive,this was a visually stunning adaptation of the second volume of the lotr trilogy  although i wasnt fond of the random appearance of elves at helms deep the overall package was enough to make me forget about such bold departures from the source text
Jun 5 2008,positive,this moive is a great magic moive with witchs worlocks wizzers  elfs and other magic people in it donald 
Jun 5 2008,positive,lots of walking like walking from the 1st movie to the 3rd movie  what was the point of this movie  couldnt they have made the first one longer and the third one the same size
Jun 5 2008,positive,amazing cgipretty good acting
Jun 5 2008,positive,weakest of the trilogy but an important part of the story of course
Jun 5 2008,positive,my favourite of the three
Jun 5 2008,positive,this one had the best music of all three lotr films and the battle of helms deep is breathtaking  a great middle section to a more than complete story and its even better in the extended cut
Jun 5 2008,positive,the best one of the 3
Jun 5 2008,positive,better than first one more action books still better but both book and movie 2 beat book and movie 1
Jun 5 2008,positive,another good family movie
Jun 5 2008,positive,i was blown away with the special effects
Jun 4 2008,positive,while its still a masterpiece and i consider all of the lord of the rings as one film i think that this may be the least satisfying of them all simply because there really is no natural beginning or end i stand by in saying however that helms deep is the greatest action scene i think i have seen in any movie at all
Jun 4 2008,neutral,this movie bored me for some reason i love the first and third ones but it sufferers from middle movie syndrome
Jun 4 2008,negative,three more hours of my life i want back
Jun 4 2008,positive,awesome these films do everything right that narnia does wrong best action sequence in any fantasy movie ever
Jun 4 2008,positive,the final chapter in the lotr trilogy is a bit of a letdown from the previous installment all the elements from the first two movies are thereepic size epic battles tons of characters and their various stories everything comes to a head as the one ring is brought to the only place it can be destroyed by the hobbit frodo baggins there are those who want to help him those who want to stop him and those who will betray him the armies of good and evil battle all around him yet the fate of all middle earth rests in his hands will he be able to resist the evil power of the ring to do what must be done what do you think the problem with the movie and the series as a whole is there never once feels like theres anything human at stake the characters are full and well rounded but we have nothing to identify with nothing that draws into their struggle and to really make us care so it lacks any kind of emotional attachment that would have really made this series something unforgettable also the biggest problem with this film is that it never knows when to end its no joke that there are at several false endings to the movie it continues on long after the conflict is over and really makes you want to say enough already still its another movie that should have been seen on the big screen to truly appreciate the skill and detail peter jackson put in to it
Jun 4 2008,positive,enjoyed as the best of the three
Jun 4 2008,positive,it was different but long
Jun 4 2008,positive,a have to say that this one might actually be my fav out of the three so good
Jun 4 2008,positive,part two of my biennial slog through the extended cuts of this amazing trilogy and still no time to get bored and lots of scenes i had forgotten about  absolutely amazing from start to finish  just wondering whether i could recruit the riders of rohan for personal use good sideburn rating 910 aragorn and the riders of rohan  no more need be said  presence of sartorially elegant men 810 aragorn legolas and the riders of rohan  miaaoo
Jun 4 2008,positive,i didnt like this one as much as the other two
Jun 4 2008,positive,worth seeing good tie in for the third movie
Jun 4 2008,positive,my fave one of the three films because of the fight scene
Jun 4 2008,neutral,i fell asleep during this
Jun 4 2008,positive,too much build up to the final battle scene i do not need to see people preparing for battle for 20 minutes
Jun 4 2008,positive,what can i say about this film filmmaking at its best hands down
Jun 3 2008,positive,nice movie toothe acting was good
Jun 3 2008,positive,there are so many spectacular scenes and themes in this film that it embodies the greatness of the entire seriesa summation of the most tragic and inspiring qualities of tolkiens work it doesnt need a happy ending to create hope
Jun 3 2008,positive,left you wanting more
Jun 3 2008,positive,the bad one of the trio but still good nonetheless
Jun 3 2008,positive,lots of violence but not enough cruel orcs
Jun 3 2008,positive,my favorite out of all 3
Jun 3 2008,positive,love lord of the rings
Jun 3 2008,positive,for a fantasy movie it was cool plus anything with viggo is a plus anywayeh
Jun 3 2008,positive,this is definitely my least favourite of the three and im still not a fan of a lot of the plot and character changes they made but in the context of the trilogy as a whole it works and the extended edition has definitely brought me round to a much more positive view of its strengths i cant quite forgive the character assassination of faramir though even as i understand its purpose
Jun 3 2008,negative,i hate these movies sorry
Jun 3 2008,positive,my fave of the three stand your ground and fight like hell i love theoden
Jun 3 2008,positive,love the books love the movies

Jun 2 2008,positive,keeping up with the series again great movie  i will always prize sams phrase at the end
Jun 2 2008,positive,thrilling to behold but the shine has lost some some of its luster
Jun 2 2008,positive,a great movie with a great soundstrack  most people prefer the first and third movie out of the lord of the rings trilogy but i liked this one the most  great action sequences and acting plus orlando bloom was really great to look at in this one
Jun 2 2008,positive,ifirst thoughtthis movie would be awful but if you appreciate good writing of adventure and good scenery effects then you will like this movie the story line was good
Jun 2 2008,positive,as one reviewer said the three hours seem to pass quickly as you are swept away by this unforgettable epic  i heartily agree  thrills suspense magnificent scenery and a tremendous musical score highlight this middle installment in the lord of the rings trilogy  the acting is topnotch and the storys epic power keeps you nailed to your seat  if you cant appreciate this one you just dont like movies
Jun 2 2008,positive,i love the lord of the rings
Jun 2 2008,positive,better than the 1st very entertaining
Jun 2 2008,positive,brilliant film and so is 1  3

May 28 2008,positive,the best in the triology imo
May 28 2008,positive,img pg13 for epic battle sequences and scary images    179 min theatrical  223 min extended edition    indenthe wants the precious always he is looking for it and the precious is wanting to go back to him  but we mustnt let him have it gollum    indentbsynopsisb    the two towers picks up right where the fellowship left off gandalf and boromir having died merry and pippin taken by the urkhai with aragorn gimili and legolas in pursuit and with frodo and sam making their way to the darkness of mordor together  where the previous film had a continuity that followed frodo and the ring this film splits into three tales with some new additions to the cast  frodo and sam are being pursued by a vile creature that is known only as gollum  he was once the keeper of the ring until bilbo won it from him years ago  though gollum had lost the ring he still had a connection to it and had been following the fellowship since they entered moria  now with the two hobbits alone he has his chance to take it back     merry and pippin escape when a bounty of rohirrim riders attack their captors the urkhai and orcs in a desperate attempt to flee they slip into fangorn forrest only to meet a strange creature that goes by the name of treebeard  he is an ent a tree that thinks breathes and speaks  he vows to take care of merry and pippin who are attempting to pursuade treebeard and the other ents to join the war and help save their friends but treebeards timeline is a little less pressing than the two hobbits    in pursuit of the two other hobbits the trio of legolas aragorn and gimili run into their own adventure  gandalf is alive and resurrected into an even greater yet colder wizard  he is now gandalf the white  he leads the trio to the gap of rohan and the great city of edoras where king theoden has been under the spell and influence of saruman and the traitor grima wormtongue  gandalf knows saruman is ready to launch an attack on edoras and all the people of rohan  gandalf releases king theoden from his spell and the people of rohan flee to helms deep to face a battle that is overwhelming in the favor of the enemy  it may be the end for mankind    breviewb    the two towers has a very different feel to it than the fellowship which focused around developing characters relationships and plotlines  the two towers was essentially the action climax that never fully happened in the fellowship  with new characters entering our already complicated story and with the plot diverting into three different directions it seems like a lot to digest but it moves so quickly the viewer moves on to the next event without having time to reflect on what happened  when the film ends it feels like half the length of its predecessor yet it is the same length  this middle portion of the epic tale is more entertainment based than story or plot building which felt necessary after the fellowship    this film is just as extraordinary to look at as the first but on a much larger scale  enormous landscapes and battle sequences take this movie to the next level of special effects and visuals  while the art is still inspired by alan lees work there is an added vastness to this films physical boundries  with the characters spred all across middle earth this film feels much larger and much more hopeless    the battle of helms deep is one of the most intense and technically challenging battle scenes ever on film  the degree of emotoinal points countered with some of the most hardcore action sequences to date makes this fortyfive minute battle go by quickly but at the same time tortuously slow  the time it takes for dawn to come and the circumstances it takes to get there is entirely authentic  by the time this film is over a feeling of complete mental exhaustion will sesttle over you    bcastb    listelijah wood as frodo bagginssean astin as samwise gamgeeviggo mortensen as aragorn son of arathornian mckellen as gandalfmithrandirsean bean as

denethorliv tyler as arwenhugo weaving as elrondmarton csokas as celebornlistimg additional characters in this story really shook things up  miranda otts as eowyn creating the conflict of interest with aragorn and arwen was a beautiful personal conflict  it really makes her interact with the rest of the cast and while you may be screaming homewrecker at her who could deny her affection for aragorn  any woman in their right mind would and that makes her role even more realistic besides the fact that she played it brilliantly  bernard hill as king theoden is one of my favorite fictional characters ever  the tortured and conflicted yet strong man was interpreted so well by hill  he was not just a pawn in the story but one of the most astounding performances ever  his subtle way of exploiting his own self doubt and inner conflict without detracting from the story is pure genuis in the acting category  also along for the ride was the most amazing cgi character ever evolved gollumsmeagal  never before has a computer generated character come across the screen as so three dimensional  there is never a moment where you ask yourself if gollum is cgi because he is so realistic  played by andy serkis this interpretation of a character that is so twisted and demented would be difficult to pull off by your most talented actor and yet combined with technology and the amazing voice over and physicality of andy serkis gollum becomes one of the greatest goodevil characters of all time    bratings and suggestionsb    by the end of this film you are either completely hooked and enthralled by this trilogy or you plain and simply cant stand it  its also rated pg13 though is a bit more violent and even its implications more absolute than the fellowship  in each lord of the rings movie you will get at least one hardcore decapitation from aragorn  peter jackson must have just liked the idea of viggo offing with peoples heads  by this time these characters are no longer just entertaining vessels telling a story onscreen they are in your heart and mind and you really care about what happens to all of them which is what makes return of the king so powerful  our heroes have in one way or another touched us in some very real or profound way and that is the essence of an amazing story  the two towers was the deciding factor and the result was my heart stolen by one of the greatest stories ever told  four out of four stars    centerimg

May 27 2008,positive,the best one out of the 3
May 27 2008,negative,here is where the series really starts going sour this film is just as drawn out and long as the firstthe only difference is that anything good that the first film had going for it are gone this one is more dark than fellowship resulting in a bleak feeling overallnot a good thing when the movie is 3 hours long the battle scenes in this movie are also considerably worse im not impressed by seeing hundreds of orcs being slayed its just the same thing over and over
May 27 2008,positive,my favorite movies of all time

May 27 2008,positive,superb trilogy amazing story superb effects does the book justice
May 26 2008,positive,the best movie remake in the trilogy
May 26 2008,positive,it continues the story
May 26 2008,positive,really truely great and amazingly well done portrayed the clothing was quite accurate and the screen ligthing was impeccable
May 26 2008,positive,my favorite in the series by far the fight scenes are impeccable the romance kept to a minimum and gollums amazingness abounds in the second installment of the lord of the rings series this movie keeps it comical while retaining the serious nature of war and destruction the treants are wonderful the sets marvelous and the storyline obviously is amazing my only frustration is the lack of acting ability demonstrated by elijah wood and orlando bloom still this movie is epic definatly worth a third or fourth viewing ps liv tyler is hot and talented pss try the extended version

May 26 2008,negative,hate this movie soo weird
May 26 2008,positive,much much better than film one and the battle of helms deep is amazing
May 26 2008,negative,allright cinematography but is elijah wood supposed to be on heroin or something its like the moviemakers thought that having that ring on would be like shooting heroin i really didnt get that out of the bookmaybe like being on pcp also why not use dwarfs as hobbits what are they racist or something
May 26 2008,positive,those ones are better then the harry potter ones
May 26 2008,positive,the lotr are the best love them all
May 26 2008,positive,although the least emotional of the three movies two towers had the benefit of being the best paced  skipping between three different ongoing storylines gave this movie a whole different feel from fellowship  the epic battle at helms deep was also the most grandiose spectacle i had ever seen in a film at least until return of the king came out next year  what makes helms deep work so well is that jackson spends the better part of an hour building up the suspense and doom of the approaching battle so that by the time it finally happens you are fully invested and amped up  its the little things like that how jackson spends so much time on the characters and plot that separate this from the other big action movies
May 26 2008,positive,loved this whole series
May 26 2008,positive,the book was way better
May 25 2008,positive,ooo i liked this movie
May 25 2008,positive,a worthy sequal to the first the battle scenes in this are fantastic this section of the trilogy delves more deeply into redemption perdition despair and hope i will never forget aragorns answer to the question what can men do against such reckless hate ride out ride out and meet them
May 25 2008,negative,by far the worst of the three  soooo much was changed left out or altered from the original story  as though pj felt he could be a better story teller than tolkien
May 25 2008,positive,not as good as fellowship or return of the king but awesome all the same
May 25 2008,positive,fantastic  epic scenery great story

May 25 2008,positive,the brilliant series continues epic doesnt quite sum up this trilogy it is one book to movie adaptation that i did feel did justice to the book epic fantasy landscapes and numerous otherworldly races swarm around the place like bees around a hive truly inspired me to read the books again fantastically entertaining what fantasy films should be like but rarely are

May 23 2008,positive,this one was filler between the first and last one
May 22 2008,positive,very well balanced emotional story telling with surprises packed within  the action drags a little bit but the film is intense it is well written well acted and very visual  heartfelt or heartwarming it is a great film  i enjoyed this one very much
May 22 2008,positive,even better than the first
May 22 2008,positive,amazing start to end the battle scenes in this movie hands down are the best out there

May 22 2008,positive,no commentjuz watch

May 21 2008,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen
May 21 2008,positive,a bit of a letdown after fellowship but still highly recommended
May 21 2008,positive,i think that this was my favorite of the three movies no it wasnt a perfect translation but it was pretty darn close i really enjoyed the battle of helms deep and the chemistry between legolas and gimley was fantastic again i think the casting was perfect
May 21 2008,positive,so long  not enough ents  too much hobbits
May 21 2008,positive,fabulous movie in every sense of the word
May 21 2008,positive,excellent movie peter jackson is a hero
May 21 2008,positive,great movie have to love fantasy to enjoy
May 21 2008,positive,where did this film fall short of the fellowship  i am trying to recall my emotions when i left the cinema in 2002  my favourite scene in the book was the first encounter between aragorn and eomer  and i felt it was seriously underplayed in the film  it was one of those rare moments in the trilogy when i really wished that daniel day lewis hadnt turned down the role  viggos low key portrayal of aragorn was perfect for the fellowship but in this film i wanted to see a bit more of the king  perhaps there wasnt enough dialogue  i wanted more  also the omission of the moving forest at the battle of helms deep which admitedly he made up for in the extended dvd did not make me happy  whilst as for faramir  what did they do there  ive listened to their jackson walsh and boyens justification for it but it really didnt wash with me  having pondered all this im thinking of taking off that half star  but then i still love the film  the extended dvd made up for alot  i am still waiting for a chance to see all three extended in a cinema marathon
May 21 2008,positive,yep one of the greatest movies of all time
May 21 2008,positive,the story wouldnt be complete without this one  love it  the characters are great  the story is wonderful
May 21 2008,positive,great movie loved it
May 21 2008,positive,this trilogy has to be the best or one of the best ever
May 21 2008,positive,this one was ok the second was dumb and the third i never saw
May 20 2008,positive,good movie but the book was much better  the final battle scene was something to behold but they could have done the ents better i think
May 20 2008,negative,i think i actually paid money to stare at a screen and watch walking trees take a shit in the forest for about 4 hours  also theres a battle at the end
May 20 2008,positive,my fav of the trilogy
May 20 2008,positive,the best series of movies that will last a very long time into other generations as the books have

May 20 2008,positive,throw a rock at saurons eye
May 20 2008,positive,imho the best battle scene out of the three the return of the kings battles were too grand scale and then to be finished by supernatural means
May 20 2008,positive,the third best of the best ever movie trilogy out of all 3 this one had the most deviations from the book but still an excellent film i wish the running time on here would also reflect the farsuperior extended edition instead of just the theatrical version
May 20 2008,negative,this is the most stupidest movie ever made
May 20 2008,positive,i liked this one better than the first one  more bloom
May 20 2008,positive,loved it  the best of the series
May 20 2008,positive,the movie like the previous one takes you off your feet and presents to you a perfect continuity into the life of the most popular fantasy world and proves that a sequel can be better than its predecessor and was worth the wait you had to and have to
May 20 2008,positive,not as good as number 1
May 20 2008,positive,sweet moviei didnt want to have to wait for the third
May 20 2008,positive,great continuation of the classic epic the battle for helms deep was simply superb
May 20 2008,positive,peter jackson did such an incredible job on this trilogy that i doubt anyone could ever remake this again the action sequences in the two towers are the best of all the movies particularly the battle at helms deep     now i hear peter jackson is involved with the production of the hobbit that will be out in theaters soon i cant wait
May 20 2008,positive,still brilliant but not the most fun i had in the trilogy
May 20 2008,negative,this film was good but too long just loke the rest

May 19 2008,positive,perfect bridge movie with one of the best battle scenes ever seen in a film
May 19 2008,neutral,deserving to be blockbusters great movie
May 19 2008,positive,if you dont love these you might be blind i could watch these with no sound because they are so visually stunning
May 19 2008,positive,dont give up on it take in the dialogue and enjoy the fight scenes
May 19 2008,positive,like the others in this trilogyabsolutely amazing
May 19 2008,positive,very good special effects but the storyline and the movie in general is boring
May 18 2008,positive,i absolutely love the battle of helms deep
May 18 2008,positive,the weakest of the three  the only one where i felt like they were trying to bash us over the head with morals no war all life is sacred etc
May 18 2008,positive,favorite of the three its worth watching just to see the huge epic battle at the end
May 18 2008,positive,it was great just like the other ones
May 18 2008,positive,epic and tolkien win win
May 18 2008,positive,quick review  the two towers continues the lord of the rings saga  director peter jackson executes in this followup perfectly  this film is just as memorable and breathtaking as the first one  with the first film setting the stage for the story the two towers was able to open up and was a little more deeper and darker than its predecessor      one of the many highlights in this film was the comedic but strong bond of friendship between gimli the dwarf and legolas the elf    the greatest achievement in this film was the epic battle at helms deep  this is hands down the greatest fantasy battle scene in cinematic history  it was dark and gritty you could literally feel the fear those brave fighters felt  it was inspiring and one of the most heroic moments in the entire saga    this spectacular sequel is a great installment to the greatest trilogy ever made
May 18 2008,positive,a buffet of fantasy which just takes you away glueing you to the screen capturing all of you this was just so much better than the first extended edition it had so much more content that wasnt released in cinemas i really loved the whole section on where faramir flashbacks to when gondor won a battle and boromir was asked by his father to go on the quest to destroy the ring it tied everything together we got to find out why boromir was like that in the first movie apart from that the extended parts just kept me saying whoa now it all makes so much sense
May 18 2008,positive,i thought this one was a whole lot better than the first one  i loved treebeard in this movie  to me it brought more of the storyline to life
May 18 2008,neutral,meh you can do without the 2nd one same as the matrix trilogy
May 18 2008,positive,all of these were phenominal and only better as a three and a half hour special edition
May 18 2008,positive,i love this trilogy this was the best one
May 18 2008,positive,these films reek of effort
May 18 2008,positive,the weakest of the three but still better than most movies
May 18 2008,positive,this one probably has the most  poignant message due to the battle probably connected to the dilemmas of the industrial age going on during the time when tolkien wrote the books between nature and machines sams speech near the end is probably one of the most memorable and touching moments as well
May 18 2008,positive,brilliant battle scenesthis may be my favorite of the trilogy
May 18 2008,positive,one of the best  ska faj qe i ka marr 12 oscara

May 16 2008,positive,i like the lotr series but the scenes are too dramatic so im givin this 3 and a half

May 13 2008,positive,a better made film version of this can scarcely be conceived  the extended version is even better if you can believe that  sets you up for the stunning failure of return of the king in a big big way

May 12 2008,positive,loved but not my fav out of the 3
May 12 2008,positive,all of the lord of the rings movies are awesome
May 12 2008,neutral,mixed feelings on this one  its the least well done of the three movies imho
May 12 2008,positive,this one could be boring in the middle partbut the war in hemlment deep shock us
May 12 2008,neutral,bad bad bad bad    totally messed up treebeard faramir arwen hama eowyn saruman frodo and everything
May 12 2008,positive,as the second movie in this now hallowed trilogy this is my favorite as its faster paced than both the other movies in the trilogy and the addition of faramir capturing frodo is a plot point that pissed off many lotr fans but i actually thought it helped the movie flow better also the battle of helms deep scene is probably one of the best epic battle scenes ever only surpassed by the battle scene in the third installment gollum is also an awesome cgi chaqracter
May 12 2008,positive,the lord of the rings are the best films ever
May 12 2008,positive,great movie i love the trilogy
May 12 2008,positive,great movie lord of the rings episodes are all good

May 12 2008,positive,helms deep battle is awsome
May 12 2008,positive,one of my favorites
May 12 2008,positive,as with a lot of trilogies the minddle movie simply transitions you from the first to the last this one actually did justice in its own right and considering it needed to reorder the book chronologically and switch one of the towers steve jackson did a great job
May 12 2008,positive,lotr is my all time favourite
May 11 2008,negative,take out legolas and this movie is garbage
May 11 2008,negative,i have seen it too many times
May 11 2008,positive,frankly and i risk blasphemy here i know i think this part of the trilogy is better than the book  in the book aragorn gets to be a bit of a prick and i think that the faramir here is more believable  im not sure why they changed the fangorn story the way they did  in that at least the book was far superior
May 11 2008,positive,awsome loved it  love the battle fights
May 11 2008,positive,i like this one the best

May 11 2008,positive,amazing series this was my second favorite of the three return of the kin being my favorite this was kind of just a filler flick
May 11 2008,positive,umdecent movie its in one of the biggest trilogies ever made too much walking
May 11 2008,positive,this whole triolgy deserves like 10 stars each

May 7 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy
May 7 2008,positive,great but they keep getting better
May 6 2008,positive,dark imagery fantastic battles and great new characters flourish in this sequel the extended cut unfortunately adds more detail than necessary and unlike fellowships sadly slows the movie down    theatrical cut   extended edition 
May 6 2008,positive,the second book was a little boring so they did a good job at keeping the excitment going

May 6 2008,positive,my favorite of the triolgoy  i love the ents1
May 6 2008,positive,must watch the fight at helms deep is amazing in its completness
May 6 2008,positive,totally an awesome movie by director peter jackson just like the book in extended versions
May 6 2008,positive,director peter jacksons achievement with the lord of the rings lotr trilogy is nothing short of historic it does everything to assure him of a place in the history of cinema for the next century winning seventeen oscars in total with almost twothirds coming from the third installment the lotr series is arguably the most successful trilogy ever produced often compared with george lucas 1980s star wars trilogy and francis ford coppolas the godfather trilogy lotr is in my opinion the better package because theres no weak link ala return of the jedi and the godfather part iii respectively    jackson made the wise choice of filming three separate threehour pictures the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king instead of cramming tolkiens middleearth into one longdrawn epic the monetary benefits are obvious in fact the trilogy has made more than a billion dollars since its first theatrical release in 2001 and through the millions of dvds sold year after year furthermore a trilogy will mean more space for the story and characters to develop this is very important as giving the right treatment to tolkiens masterwork is essential not only in terms of reproducing accurately his stunning vision of middleearth but also to do so out of respect to a great literary giant    when the fellowship of the ring was released in 2001 it set new standards in cinematography and visual effects filmed on location in new zealand fellowship features unbelievable scenes of snowcapped mountains and rocky terrain that are mostly shot with a moving camera at varying angles and heights that captures what jackson wants  an epiclike feel that complements the grandeur of the story because all three films are shot backtobacktoback in less than three years the photography and lighting remain fairly consistent throughout the trilogy though fellowship is undeniably the most beautifullyfilmed picture of the trio    im running out of superlatives to describe the incredible visual effects by weta finally a worthy competitor to lucas industrial light  magic its important to note that the accomplishments of weta are central to the success of lotr peter jacksons vision of middleearth and its inhabitants owe a great debt to it the cgi is till today the best ever created the return of the king features the most aweinspiring effects of the lot though the cgi in the final hour when frodo and sam make the tortuous journey up mount doom to destroy the one ring appear to be too indulgent and at times lacking in visual quality    the battle sequences are expertlystaged and are one for the senses sound mixing and editing are extraordinary from the frightening stomping march of tens of thousands of orcs to the spinetingling clashes of sharp blades during the much furious swordplay that punctuates the three films nothing as huge and largescale as the battle of helms deep in the two towers or the battle of minas tirith in the return of the king have ever been committed to screen apart from zack snyders 300 there are few movies out there that are able to live up to the standards of lotr let alone surpass it    lotr establishes the careers of viggo mortensen eastern promises a history of violence orlando bloom kingdom of heaven troy and elijah wood eternal sunshine of the spotless mind sin city while rejuvenating that of ian mackellans gods and monsters xmen and christopher lees revenge of the sith hamlet honestly theres nothing to boast about the acting quality of the cast it is at best above average though its far better that what the stars of star wars can offer if theres anyone worthy of an oscar for an acting performance in lotr it would be andy serkis who also plays the title role in peter jacksons king kong for his chilling yet humanistic portrayal of gollum on of the most memorable villains of 21st century cinema    howard shores original score is nothing spectacular though its main theme is instantly recognizable and is used with better effect in fellowship than its sequels even though he wins two oscars for lotr shore lays the musical groundwork firmly and most impressively in fellowship the sequels offer new themes but less musical creativity shore shows his weakness for scoring huge action setpieces since his roots as a film composer lie in suspense and horror eg silence of the lambs the fly    the twentyplus minutes ending in return of the king is sure to divide viewers in the same way steven spielbergs ai artificial intelligence did why would peter jackson wish to end the lotr series in such an anticlimatic mood he could have concluded the series on a high note just after frodo destroys the one ring but he chooses to put in lengthy celebratory and farewell scenes because he wants to stay true to tolkiens story its a fitting closure to one of the greatest screen adaptations of all time the lord of the rings is not only cinema at its most entertaining it also features filmmakers artists writers special effects wizards and sound engineers working at the height of their powers    score 1010      all rights reserved

May 1 2008,positive,again strong as the last one but the only part i really like was the battle at helms deep
May 1 2008,positive,an immense film only let down by the various ommissions from the original book a little too much fighting and too little storytellng but a great 3 hours or so of action
May 1 2008,positive,i love this filmm

Apr 30 2008,positive,epic as epic can be
Apr 30 2008,positive,the linkpin of two amazing films yet still briliant in its own right
Apr 30 2008,positive,some of the camera work made me feel giddy so that ruined it form me
Apr 30 2008,positive,probably my favourite of the trilogy simply because the ending of return was too long for my liking the helms deep sequences are just amazing though i love the riders of the mark and everything about them
Apr 30 2008,positive,brilliant love the plotssound effectstwo thumbs up for the two towers
Apr 30 2008,positive,amazing my fave films i can watch them over and over again

Apr 30 2008,positive,what can i say that hasnt already been told about this once in a lifetime experience
Apr 29 2008,positive,lord of the rings is the lord of all lords of movies
Apr 29 2008,positive,boring the only good thing about this trilogy is orlando bloom

Apr 29 2008,positive,when the ints kicked ass  amazing
Apr 29 2008,positive,reference my lotr fellowship of the ring review for why you should watch this  after doing so admire the battle scene at the end and if you are like me you will get chills  that series of scenes makes this edition better than the original
Apr 28 2008,positive,best of the three movies
Apr 28 2008,positive,i could watch this over and over
Apr 28 2008,positive,i fell asleep during this
Apr 28 2008,positive,a fan of any lotr this is by far my favorite of the 3 perhaps my favorite movie on the planet
Apr 28 2008,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
Apr 28 2008,positive,very good effects
Apr 28 2008,positive,fantastic middle movies are aways tough but this excels
Apr 28 2008,positive,probably didnt watch all of this one
Apr 28 2008,positive,great movie but the first and the third are the best
Apr 28 2008,positive,this film is the more the best of the best no doubt
Apr 28 2008,positive,i love this one as well
Apr 28 2008,positive,ah the difficult second album this was probably the trickiest film to make as it has to create the bridge from fellowship to king whilst in itself being a whole entity towers actually contains two books which each followed a different timeline the first book deals with frodo  co after they split from the rest of the group only and then the second switches to the rest of the fellowship leaving frodo alone for the whole second book whilst it jumps back in time to amon hen again and this would not have worked in a film format personally i was keenly waiting for this film as it introduces the rohan for he first time and was in no way disappointed the siege of helms deep is epic and wonderful and the story of frodo sam and gollum is captivating personal highlight for me are the ents superb work
Apr 28 2008,positive,i watched the extended version  it was long of course but the extra things added more to the story for those of us who are lotr nerds
Apr 28 2008,positive,very mythical and magic quite near to whats in the book
Apr 28 2008,positive,i love lotr  i like this one less than the other two  but i love it still  of course after reading the books i let my imagination take over  the battle scenes were great  i did get a bit bored with the ents but once they got going no way  and for the sad sad moment i sayhaldir
Apr 28 2008,positive,gone off these films
Apr 28 2008,positive,rohirrim to the king
Apr 28 2008,positive,the movie is little away from the bull eyewhen compared to the other twobut would get a four star for high excitement ratio p
Apr 28 2008,positive,weakest in the series but thats not much of a penalty
Apr 27 2008,positive,great production value rushed roto work though   
Apr 27 2008,positive,i refuse to rate the lord of the rings movies higher than 3 stars and i only give them that because of the sheer magnitude of the movies    but this one was the best
Apr 27 2008,positive,doesnt get the whole five just because its the middle
Apr 27 2008,positive,best part of the lotr trilogy mostly just because rohan is the shit
Apr 27 2008,positive,lotr is one of the best fantasy trilogies ever
Apr 27 2008,positive,the best lord of the rings because they dont just focus on frodo and aarogon legolas and gimli are used quite frequently
Apr 27 2008,positive,the lord of the rings trilogy is of course the second best trilogy ever made  this was the worst of the three which is to say it is slightly less classic than the other two  still a fantastic movie the best siege ever filmed
Apr 27 2008,positive,as i mentioned before in my first review  this trillogy is so far beyond other films of any genera that it deserves another 5 stars on a five star rating system a definate 10 stars     peter jackson broke movie tradition and did something that has never been done before in the history of film making by shooting all three movies at one time he left a continuety and consistancey in this series that is unrivalled the deviations from the book while they do occur are minor and the special affects have clearly placed this movie in a whole new evolution above the rest     the three lord of the rings movies stand out as unique and well made and will endure the test of time as one of the greatest movies ever made and in my opinion the greatest film ever produced to date outstanding and entertaining hats off to everyone who made and was involved in this production
Apr 27 2008,positive,a triumph even over the first lotr even if it still could be shorter
Apr 27 2008,positive,its not as goo das the 3rd but better than the 1st it really leaves you desperate to see the next one this movie is like the build up to the climax of the third
Apr 27 2008,positive,the best battle scene in history
Apr 26 2008,positive,like ive said before they all mix together but they are all great
Apr 26 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy    if best means worst and also if it means the book was so boring i never finished it
Apr 26 2008,positive,being the middle movie made this a little different its a middle piece so all the stories are just continuing but the things in it were stunning and i loved it the lotr movies are really some of the very best
Apr 26 2008,positive,as always magnificent  as the middle part of a trilogy it somehow foreseen that ttt will be the most questionable part of the three but my doubt was swept away once i saw the movie and even more when the extended version came into my possession awesome cast story effect and landscape 
Apr 26 2008,positive,i guess these movies were pretty good
Apr 26 2008,positive,one of the best of 00s
Apr 26 2008,positive,i am a lotr fan it is one of my weak points
Apr 26 2008,positive,my fav out of the three
Apr 26 2008,positive,love the lot of them
Apr 26 2008,positive,some truely spectacuar special effects and great acting all round not as gd as the first tho
Apr 26 2008,positive,this is my personal favorite out of the 3
Apr 26 2008,neutral,i really did not enjoy this one in the theaters however after watching it on bluray i must say it was quite a bit more enjoyable i still think the character gollum  is right up there with jar jar binks as one of the most annoying characters of all time
Apr 25 2008,positive,better technology will come but it will take many years to the day this movie will be overcome it could be shorter though
Apr 25 2008,negative,i hate these movies they are so borring
Apr 25 2008,positive,sweet awesome cool
Apr 25 2008,positive,this was the best lord of the rings movie and probably one of the best epic movies of all time
Apr 25 2008,positive,a great trilogy  two towers feels very much like the middle of the story but its entertaining nonetheless
Apr 25 2008,positive,one of my favorite series
Apr 25 2008,positive,new zealand hobbits i cant rate this anything but a 5
Apr 25 2008,positive,just rewatched this and its still good

Apr 25 2008,positive,my favourite of the trilogy
Apr 25 2008,positive,this is my 3rd fave out of the 3
Apr 25 2008,positive,i liked it very much in the theater
Apr 25 2008,positive,excellent story and fantastic use of visual effects
Apr 25 2008,positive,the most difficult movie to make in the trilogyexceeds expectationsbut the only negative point is that it wont make any sense to a newcomerbut 100 entertainment for hardcore lotr fans like medefinitely one of the movies to see before you die
Apr 25 2008,negative,ugh i hate the lord of the rings its so boring but i do love elija wood orlando bloom and sean astin
Apr 25 2008,positive,good but probably the most overatedfilm of all time
Apr 25 2008,positive,nice suspenseful 2nd part of a trilogy
Apr 24 2008,positive,excellent followup to fellowship of the ring the excellence of the series continues unabated the ents could have used some livening up though but i guess it is hard to make talking trees all that interesting still part of the film classic of this decade
Apr 24 2008,positive,my favorite of the lotr series
Apr 24 2008,positive,my least favorite of the trilogy but still great
Apr 24 2008,positive,bring your pretty face to my axe  it has a more dreary atmosphere than the first installment which makes it a lil more stale at times  the battle for helms deep and when the ents go to war with isengard are some intense scenes  gollum is fuckin hilarious and he really lightens the mood because of it
Apr 24 2008,positive,the best part of trylogy and trilogy itself is the best fantazy movie ever
Apr 24 2008,positive,i love lord of the rings1
Apr 24 2008,positive,the last march of the ents alone makes it worthwhile  as if the good acting and the fact that it is as faithful as possible to tokiens masterwork were not enough
Apr 24 2008,positive,i love lord of the rings stunning movie
Apr 24 2008,positive,he can try to be as cool as he wants
Apr 24 2008,positive,it touches perfection like few movies have done

Apr 23 2008,positive,loved it battle scenes were phenomenal highly recommended
Apr 23 2008,positive,impressive as expected
Apr 23 2008,positive,even better than the first i still cant believe that studio heads put jackson at the helm of such a huge project
Apr 23 2008,positive,beautiful people and awesome story
Apr 23 2008,positive,the extended version is the only one worth watching
Apr 23 2008,positive,the best part of the trilogy
Apr 23 2008,negative,i still havent gotten through the whole movie wo falling asleep
Apr 23 2008,positive,no one should ever have to walk into mordor
Apr 23 2008,positive,not as good as the other two but brilliant all the same
Apr 23 2008,positive,my favorite of the lotr movies the battle sequence is likely the best ever filmed or maybe that was the video game hard to remember
Apr 23 2008,negative,is this the first one i cant remember if i saw this but im sure that it was bbbbboring
Apr 23 2008,positive,treebeard that dude is awesome

Apr 23 2008,negative,probably gay with harry potter
Apr 23 2008,positive,i again love lord of the rings
Apr 23 2008,negative,hate them and i was amazed at how bad i thought each one was the next would always be worse
Apr 22 2008,positive,very good but maybe just a bit to long
Apr 22 2008,positive,the best of the bunch  i cant remember the first one and the third one had a cop out ending  this was the best one by a long shot
Apr 22 2008,positive,amazingly good best one of the 3
Apr 22 2008,positive,best of the 3 i think
Apr 22 2008,positive,the hobbit was an awesome cartoon i was ecstatic to see the story come to real life
Apr 22 2008,positive,great visuals but way too fricken long  visuals of the village and landscapes are not the only thing that is going to keep me glued for hours at a time
Apr 22 2008,positive,loved all three movies all good all the way
Apr 22 2008,positive,the second movie in the trilogy an tons of connective tissue to make the trilogy work  good film again well made great effects beautiful artful photography but i dont buy pete jacksons godhood
Apr 22 2008,positive,for a whole movie that consists of nothing but 3 hours of fighting i was pretty bored
Apr 22 2008,positive,only the extended edition is worthy of 4 12 stars the regular is not but the extended is to me better than the first and almost equal with the third extended editions of course theres no reason to watch the originals in this case because the exteneded ones are all superior
Apr 22 2008,negative,where did the story go
Apr 22 2008,positive,incredible film making peter jackson makes what can be a very difficult story to read very accessible
Apr 22 2008,positive,aint bad not as good as the rest
Apr 22 2008,positive,awesome movie 3                              yess
Apr 22 2008,negative,worth a watch after a heavy night on the gravy train  nothing more
Apr 21 2008,positive,i will always watch it if its shown on tv
Apr 21 2008,positive,gah these movies are so good i think they define what epics will be for generations to come theres hardly a 3 hour movie thats better
Apr 21 2008,positive,my least favorite of all the 3 but still light years ahead of most modern fantasy films of course i havent even read any of the books so sorry to anybody upset with this film
Apr 21 2008,positive,it needed more hobbits
Apr 21 2008,positive,reallllly long but good
Apr 21 2008,negative,i saw like 12 hour of thisits boringi fell asleeep
Apr 21 2008,positive,tehy all are like the best
Apr 21 2008,positive,honestly my favorite of the three
Apr 21 2008,positive,ok not as good as the third one
Apr 21 2008,positive,helms deep to my opinion best seige in the film they didnt have catapults just fuck loads of elves 
Apr 21 2008,positive,you must see all the lord of the rings
Apr 21 2008,positive,awsome movie with the best plot ending terrifically with the endings of both the battle of helms deep and the battle at isengard
Apr 21 2008,positive,not as good as the first solid 810 though wish there was more action the scene at helms deep was seriously well done the cinematography is amazing jackson is a great director loved the development of frodo
Apr 21 2008,positive,yeah its got talking trees
Apr 21 2008,positive,all three of these lotr movies are great really high on my list of fave movies or at least i should make it so   the performances by all actors especially viggo mortensen dominic monaghan hugo weaving orlando bloom and billy boyd   though everyone else is awesome too i just cant write every person here p
Apr 21 2008,positive,dont talk to it merry dont encourage it
Apr 21 2008,positive,omfg i luv it hehehe legolas orlando bloom is so hott
Apr 21 2008,positive,ok some good battle scenes still the book was better things were quite different from what i imagined them
Apr 21 2008,positive,the least interesting one of the trilogy wasnt impressed at all
Apr 21 2008,positive,my favorite of the three
Apr 21 2008,positive,the lord of the rings  the two towers
Apr 21 2008,positive,once again its just as long as the first actually it is one minute longer i love fight scenes and such
Apr 21 2008,positive,ok i am a proud owner of the dvds of this series and have seen them over and over again more than a 100 times literally i mean     i had read the book before this movie was released and i loved it anyways my first thoughts at that time were ok how could they ever make this into a movie  but jackson put up a real miracle this is perhaps the only trilogy that is tiring long but i am ready to sit through it every time over and over again
Apr 20 2008,negative,best of the three but still it is all over the place it has also embarrasing acting by everyone and plain corny moments the most interesting character in this movie and the whole series is actually gollum and for christ sake he is almost completely computer generated that tells something
Apr 20 2008,positive,great fighting sequence
Apr 20 2008,positive,not sure if this is my favorite of the threebut it just might be
Apr 20 2008,positive,even better than the first
Apr 20 2008,positive,not as good as fellowship of the rings and return of the king but very good
Apr 20 2008,positive,peter jackson digs his heels in deep with the second installment of the lord of the rings cycle this movie is dark tense humorless and full of spellbinding shots  the storylines become separate as the fellowship goes about their impossible tasks in different journeys and as frodo sam and gollum head off toward mordor aragorn and his clan have to prepare for one of the first great battles between man and orcs  this middle piece only suffers from jacksons ambition as all of these threads dont fit as seamlessly but the commitment of the cast and technical crew makes this a great bridge from fellowship to return of the king
Apr 20 2008,positive,its the slower one of the trilogy but its still pretty good
Apr 20 2008,positive,two towers is great in the fact that it weaves the first and third films together without being totally boring
Apr 20 2008,positive,greatest not really a trilogy ever peter jackson made an amazing piece amazing special effects and even better music the cast was picked beautifully all together a masterpiece
Apr 20 2008,positive,classic story well made movie eat your heart out mrsrowling
Apr 20 2008,positive,i guess now that i think about it these movies were close enough to the books that if you liked the books you liked the movies the books were entertaining and sometimes frustrating and tedious and so were the movies
Apr 20 2008,positive,the weakest of the three but still fivestars marvelous
Apr 20 2008,positive,fantastic and fairly faithful recreation of tolkiens second novel
Apr 20 2008,positive,best of the triolgy really
Apr 20 2008,positive,had high hopes for this film after fellowship and it did not disappoint
Apr 20 2008,positive,breathtaking war scenes i could barely sit still watching it even more enjoyable to watch than the first instalment
Apr 20 2008,positive,its a great movie with good photography and special effects
Apr 20 2008,positive,way to fuck up the ending
Apr 20 2008,positive,drags on a bit at some points but still very good
Apr 20 2008,positive,tlotr is one of the best triologies ever made
Apr 20 2008,positive,if you want to understand the meaning of the word epic just see the battle at helms deep in this movie
Apr 20 2008,neutral,so the whole movie is him walking stumbling a little bit but then continuing to walk wtf
Apr 20 2008,positive,my favourite brilliant film
Apr 19 2008,positive,great movie the trilogy just gets better and better
Apr 19 2008,negative,these movies ruined the books as they always do
Apr 19 2008,positive,definitely love the final fight scene its just an excellent movie of course i wish it wasnt so long though
Apr 19 2008,positive,excellent movie part of an exceptional trilogy
Apr 19 2008,positive,really good great special effects
Apr 19 2008,positive,one of the best trilogy of all times
Apr 19 2008,positive,another tolkien masterpiecehe would be very proud
Apr 19 2008,positive,they r all fantastic films
Apr 19 2008,positive,of the trilogy this was the worst
Apr 19 2008,positive,great middle act  intense action on a grand scale and gollum is perfectly done
Apr 19 2008,positive,better than first one but not as good as 3rd one
Apr 19 2008,positive,visual effects are extremely well done especially gollum scenesmy least favourite of the trilogy but still a very good film worth seeing
Apr 19 2008,positive,i dont remember it much
Apr 19 2008,positive,ok sue me  the second of the trilogy probably had the most tension and best battle sequences though it is obviously unwatchable without the other two
Apr 19 2008,positive,a lot slower than 1
Apr 19 2008,positive,a rather disappointing adaptation and the weakest of the trilogy as the book was far more vivid and captivating
Apr 19 2008,positive,lotr always gets 5 stars from jackie
Apr 19 2008,positive,worth the yearlong wait after fellowship of the ring absolute epic and as far as the book goes its a pretty good abridged version nothing too important was missed
Apr 19 2008,negative,meh never realy watched all of these haha but i did see parts
Apr 18 2008,positive,the second film of the trilogy is often the weakest simply because its the middle  you cant completely resolve it because theres more to come but you cant leave it untied either  jackson does a decent compromise and thats one heck of a battle he creates at helms deep  and what a soundtrack howard shore has written  they are quite a team
Apr 18 2008,positive,this was an amazing trilogy
Apr 18 2008,positive,i loved this oneits awesomebut the 3rd is the best
Apr 18 2008,positive,it has necessarily to be the special editon version to watch

Apr 18 2008,positive,exactly as i would have imagined middle earth
Apr 18 2008,positive,over emphasis on the battles but incredible attention to detail
Apr 18 2008,positive,you always have to have a middle movie  to get from ac necessary but not the best
Apr 18 2008,positive,pretty sweet pretty precious
Apr 18 2008,positive,its the better movie i love legolas the movie has good esenarios and actors realy i dont have much to say there isnt  words
Apr 18 2008,positive,my 3rd fav or the trilogy  but still one of a kind
Apr 18 2008,positive,i friggin heart this movie even though this one suffers from middle movie syndrome and has the most substantial changes from the books i love bernard hill and every moment hes onscreen makes me happy this installment also features the brilliantlydirected sequences leading up to the battle for helms deep which are probably jacksons bestassembled scenes in his whole career
Apr 18 2008,positive,not as much action as was promised
Apr 18 2008,positive,i thought it was the best of the triology all in all the best movies ive ever seen  thank you peter jackson  and i have ordered a smeagol doll cause he was my favorite
Apr 18 2008,positive,what andy serkis does in this and the following film is absolutely amazing as gollum  this one kind of slows down the trilogy a bit but again very good special effects and battle scenes
Apr 18 2008,positive,this show was awsome but not as good as the third one
Apr 18 2008,positive,hard to rate the lord of the rings trilogy as three seperate films as i dont consider them as such also very hard to fault them at all but if i had to come down to it though excellent this one in a lot of ways is the weekest of the three mostly in my eyes due to a lot of the changes that were made    other than that pretty faultless
Apr 18 2008,positive,fantastic continuation in a fantastic series
Apr 18 2008,positive,quality as with all films it differs slightly from the book but without loosing any of the quality that is tolkien
Apr 17 2008,positive,love ther whole trilogy and this one is where it all starts to get interesting
Apr 17 2008,negative,i hate lord of the rings
Apr 17 2008,positive,a disappointment to those who have read the books but amazing to those who have just been introduced to the story
Apr 17 2008,positive,loli like tha third bettermy aunt loves tha blonde guys hair p
Apr 17 2008,positive,what can i say  im a dork
Apr 17 2008,positive,i prefer the first one
Apr 17 2008,positive,not as good as the first but still a very well made film andy serkis steals the film as gollum
Apr 17 2008,positive,i think the 2nd one actually may be my favoriteits sooo hard to choose thoughlol
Apr 17 2008,positive,i love all of the lotr movies all of them were very well done
Apr 17 2008,positive,the best trilogy till now
Apr 17 2008,positive,a major disappointment because peter jackson took his own road other than that the magic was wonderful
Apr 17 2008,positive,great follow on to the first movie acting was good as well as scenes and costumage loses a star as it doesnt quite follow the book but is still a brilliant movie
Apr 17 2008,positive,the lotr series filmwise and bookwise is amazing

Apr 16 2008,negative,ive made my feelings clear about these movies
Apr 16 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy that was brilliant if only because it made one of the most unreadable books in my lifetime one of the greatest movies in my lifetime i went to see two towers 5 times while it was in the theater and the battle of helms deep was the only time i have ever gone to the movies stopped to look around me to wonder if everyone else was having the same mind blowing experience i was having i needed to have some sort of grounding at the moment because of how intense the scene was brilliant would have been the 1st 2nd or 3rd best movie ever made if not for lane meyers marty mcfly and princess grace
Apr 16 2008,positive,involuntary bowel movement
Apr 16 2008,positive,wanna do something cool on the weekend watch all threeextended edition
Apr 16 2008,positive,i just had to see this in the theater and loved this one too
Apr 16 2008,positive,i am sucker for a good battle scene
Apr 16 2008,positive,the battle for middleearth begins    great film fantastic story epic battles were just amazing this fantasy magical story keeps getting better and better highly recommended    the film begins with a flashback set to the first film with gandalf battling the balrog on the bridge of khazaddûm but this time continues from gandalfs perspective with the scene continuing to follow both as they hurtle down below fighting while in freefall frodo awakens from his dream and continues his journey with his trusted and loyal friend sam they are then attacked by the ringobsessed gollum wishing to retrieve his precious from the ones he thinks stole it from him the hobbits subdue and bind him with sams elven rope given to him by the elven elder galadriel in lórien sam distrusts gollum and wishes to abandon him but frodo understands the burden of the creature and takes pity on him realizing they are lost in the emyn muil and in need of a guide frodo persuades gollum to lead them to the black gate of mordor    in rohan the pack of urukhai run across the grassy landscape with their captives merry and pippin aragorn legolas and gimli are in pursuit following three days of running legolas surmises the hobbits are being taken to isengard where saruman is marshalling his urukhai forces to do the bidding of sauron in the kingdom of rohan home of the horse lords king théoden is mentally and physically weak due to the enchantments of his steward gríma wormtongue who is secretly in the service of saruman orcs and wild men of dunland incited by saruman freely roam the land and kill the people including the kings only son théodred théodens nephew éomer interrogates gríma angrily realizing he has lustful eyes for éomers sister éowyn and that he is now an agent of saruman gríma banishes éomer for undermining his authority and éomer sets forth to gather the remaining loyal men of the rohirrim throughout the land    frodo and sam traverse the dead marshes passing the undead fallen warriors of the second age who haunt the marshes and evading a newly seated ringwraith on his flying fell beast later they reach the black gate finding it to be heavily guarded they observe a contingent of easterlings from rhûn arrive to reinforce the garrison only to have gollum reveal to them a less risky path sam remains distrustful but frodo gives him the benefit of the doubt meanwhile éomer and his rohirrim ambush and kill all of the orcs and urukhai holding the two hobbits captive at nightfall during the battle merry and pippin narrowly escape their captors by fleeing into the trees where they are aided by treebeard the oldest of the ents    éomer later encounters aragorn legolas and gimli and in turn tells aragorn there were no survivors of the orcurukhai slaughter upon arriving at the battle site aragorn uses his tracking skills and finds hobbit tracks that lead into nearby fangorn forest the three discover a wizard who is ultimately gandalf reborn now known as gandalf the white the quartet proceed to travel to edoras where they exorcise sarumans hold on king théoden and banish wormtongue théoden is confronted with his dead son and rather than risk open war decides to flee to a large fortress called helms deep which in times of trouble has saved the people of rohan gandalf leaves to find éomer and his rohirrim promising to return within five days as a strong attraction draws éowyn to aragorn during the journey to helms deep wormtongue flees to orthanc and tells saruman of rohan breaking from their grip saruman then decides to destroy rohan    in ithilien gollum battles his split personality in an attempt to befriend frodo and sam and ultimately banishes his evil half the two hobbits are witness to an ambush of southrons but are taken captive by soldiers of gondor meanwhile along the journey to helms deep the travelers are attacked by sarumans wargs and their orc riders during the battle aragorn is dragged by a warg and falls off a cliff into a raging river as the griefstricken survivors reluctantly move on to helms deep in rivendell elrond knows that the age of elves is ending and convinces arwen that it is hopeless to stay and should leave for the grey havens elrond shows her a prophetic vision if she waits for aragorn even if he succeeds in destroying sauron and becomes king of gondor he will still succumb to mortality arwen will suffer grievously once he is dead and she is left to wither away she reluctantly agrees to leave elsewhere frodo and sam are taken to henneth annûn and brought before faramir the younger brother of boromir gollum eluded capture and in order to save his life is lured into a trap unknowingly by frodo faramir learns of the one ring and seeking to prove his worth to his father decides the ring shall go to gondor in rohan aragorn washes up on the rivers edge and is nudged back to consciousness by his horse brego battered but undaunted he rides to helms deep passing sarumans army of urukhai which numbers at least 10000 strong his arrival is met with relief but is short lived with the news of only 300 men in the stronghold in the midst of despair a battalion of elves from lórien led by the elf haldir arrives to assist in the ensuing battle at fangorn forest merry pippin treebeard and other ents hold a council to decide on the roles of the ents in the war with saruman    in the pouring rain the battle of helms deep begins with a flurry of arrows from both human and elven archers cutting down dozens of urukhai scaling ladders are placed upon the deeping wall and the uruks swarm up to engage the defenders the defenses are slowly being breached and the enemy manages to destroy the wall through its sewer drain using a rudimentary explosive device created by saruman despite aragorn and gimlis best efforts the urukhai manage to penetrate the main door and soon the stronghold is overrun in the midst of battle haldir is slain and the few remaining elves fall back into the keep in the hornburg however the uruks have also scaled the walls and have breached the gate forcing the defenders to retreat into the keep in fangorn treebeard and the other ents have decided to not have any involvement in the war frustrated pippin cleverly takes him to the section of fangorn forest saruman has decimated near isengard treebeard is filled with rage at sarumans betrayal and commands all other ents to seek vengeance the ents gather and embark upon the last march of the ents    meanwhile as the keep is now under attack and realizing gandalfs words before he departed aragorn and the rest make one last gallant ride on horseback to attack the urukhai army in a desperate bid to allow the rohirrims women and children to escape as the riders are surrounded and all seems lost gandalf éomer and two thousand riders of the rohirrim arrive to push back the urukhai into the justarrived forest of huorns outside of helms deep elsewhere the ents also attack isengard tossing stones and rocks while collapsing a dam to flood its surroundings    at the ruins of osgiliath faramir and the hobbits are confronted by a ringwraith and its fell beast with the help of sam frodo narrowly escapes the ringwraiths efforts to capture him sam narrates how the story must go on and how they should keep pressing forward as faramir decides to free them to finish their quest gandalf and the others now know a full war is inevitable as sauron will surely seek retribution for the defeat of saruman and hope rests with frodo and sam who have resumed their journey to mordor with gollum accompanying them once again and having felt betrayed after his subsequent mistreatment by faramirs men gollums darker nature returns and decides to reclaim the ring by leading frodo and sam to her
Apr 16 2008,positive,my favorite one of the serie

Apr 15 2008,positive,i would have liked this one better if they hadnt pulled out all the good parts from the book in order to insert new inconsequential stuff  elves at helms deep  please
Apr 15 2008,positive,i love the whole triology
Apr 15 2008,positive,better if it was shorter but there is to much important in the books to cut it down more
Apr 15 2008,negative,wouldnt have a clue  i never get beyond the first 5 minutes  bored of the rings
Apr 15 2008,positive,i thought all of these three movies was great but that the lack of closure understandaly absent left me a little disappointed  i like them more since they have come out on video
Apr 15 2008,positive,the awesomeness continues i sentence anyone who has not watched this film to an eternity in mordor until they finally beg for mercy and watch it
Apr 15 2008,positive,i watched this movie at some point in my life peter jackson does a great job everything is so epic and yet i feel its missing its soul not that the books had a soul either
Apr 15 2008,positive,middle pic from middle earth and middle score
Apr 15 2008,positive,good in a lot of ways but id have preferred less arwen and they really screwed up faramir thats easily my least favorite part of the movies
Apr 14 2008,positive,the lord of the rings the two towers 2002  90  the middle movie is slightly less satisfying on its own mired in tangled plotting and uneven in its distribution of action and spectacle  unless youre a real fan of the story the first twothirds can be difficult to get through but the last hour more than makes up for it  the battle of helms deep and the ents march on isengard are as spectacular as anything else in the trilogy  the acting ensemble grows to accommodate new characters  most notable are bernard hill as kingtheoden miranda otto as eowyn david wenham as faramir and brad dourif as grima wormtongue  outshining them all however is gollum  middle earths favorite splitpersonality is achieved through the onset performance and voice of andy serkis and the animating prowess of weta digital  the result is a cgi character more compelling than any that have come before it
Apr 14 2008,positive,best movie out of the triology epsecially the battle scenes at helms deep highly recommended
Apr 14 2008,positive,love these movies  they are very good
Apr 14 2008,positive,the most boring of the trilogyjust the last hour is goodwith great battles and actions scenespeter jackson improved a lot since the first movie in the war scenes    stillgolum steals the scene as the greatest character of this moviehe is very well made and is the most developed character  of all
Apr 14 2008,positive,bogs down in the middle but has so much fantasy and action and it has some excellent characters and scenes
Apr 14 2008,positive,this is such a great movie from all standpoints
Apr 14 2008,negative,i hate these movies
Apr 14 2008,positive,these are great films i like them all
Apr 14 2008,positive,the battle scene at the end is worth watching
Apr 14 2008,positive,the best in the trilogy  it had more human elements to it than the first and the third
Apr 14 2008,positive,this movie was so amazing the battle scenes the costumes everything was just spectacular
Apr 14 2008,positive,faramir shows his quality and that is good for the race of men
Apr 14 2008,negative,nice looking film dull drawn out story midgits and monsters just arent my cupotea definately worth a look if magic and beards are what you expect in an adventure movie
Apr 14 2008,positive,the battle scenes at helms deep were spectacular
Apr 14 2008,positive,this is where things really take off the battles are bigger the bad guys are badder and a cgi creature that talks to itself in the 2nd person wins the award for best actor of the bunch
Apr 14 2008,positive,its lotr it cannot be bad not possible
Apr 14 2008,neutral,same opinion as the 1st one not a fan but well made
Apr 14 2008,positive,certainly some excellent graphics and music and acting here

Apr 13 2008,positive,amazing trilogy incredible
Apr 13 2008,positive,easily the best in the trilogy introduces us to gollum and boasts that fantastically made battle at helms deep
Apr 13 2008,positive,love it love it love it
Apr 13 2008,positive,who doesnt like the lord of the rings  i think the first movie was the best but this was very good
Apr 13 2008,positive,as a movie movie by itself i thought it was great  however i really think they butchered tolkiens work in this  they made changes that were really unnecessary that made for a weaker story
Apr 13 2008,positive,as a movie movie by itself i thought it was great  however i really think they butchered tolkiens work in this  they made changes that were really unnecessary that made for a weaker story
Apr 13 2008,negative,i just saw this on tv and omg i cant believe i used to take this seriously this is so cheesy its unreal simply put the acting and film style have been already surpassed by much better quality epic films like troy and kingdom of heaven and those only came out 2 years after this
Apr 13 2008,positive,adding to the legendarium 
Apr 13 2008,positive,an intriguing and beautiful trilogy
Apr 13 2008,positive,excellent as always
Apr 13 2008,positive,the  best of the three
Apr 13 2008,positive,really good movie especially the war part
Apr 13 2008,positive,not as good as the first one
Apr 13 2008,neutral,not my type of thing lol
Apr 13 2008,positive,man what do you say about the rings trilogy
Apr 12 2008,positive,this had one of the longest most intense battle scenes ive ever seen but thats certainly not the only thing to love about this  just as good if not better than the first
Apr 12 2008,negative,i seriously can not stand the lord of the ring movies ill watch it with my friends as long as they can put up with all my jokes about how crappy this movie is or me sleeping through the whole thing i quoye randal graves here those fkin hobbit movies were boring as hell all it was was a bunch of people walking three movies of people walking to a fking volcano i love randal
Apr 12 2008,positive,again i have nothing to say about the series other than it is fantastic
Apr 12 2008,positive,halidir had to die i dont think so i wish he lived
Apr 12 2008,positive,my one problem with this movie  when merry and pippin are dropped off in the forest by treebeard they look up and we see the over the shoulder of either gandalf or saruman  but then the rest of the movie goes on an encounter with either one of them never happened  what the heck
Apr 12 2008,positive,do i really have to say something  of course my ranking is for all 3 of them  but this one is the best  i know ill never see anything like this again
Apr 12 2008,positive,i absolutely love lotr and this movie was my favorite of the three i love rohans theme music and gimli and legolas were so comical together shall i describe it to you or would you like me to get you a box xd i love it all this movie was phenomenal i cant wait to see the extended version
Apr 12 2008,positive,my fav lotr im not a big fan of the books but the helms deep scene was crazy  reviewed by brad and taylor

Apr 11 2008,positive,aside from everything else that ive already said about the good things about the lotr trilogy in my review of the fellowship of the rings this movies definately abover average
Apr 11 2008,positive,is this the extended version  if so then im all for itthe trilogy is amazing
Apr 11 2008,positive,middle movies in trilogies are always hard to judge on their own merits  since the ending isnt really an ending that tends to also drag it down  however this is more than a bridge film  while the hearty little band is separated there is enough story and action that it keeps moving  in some respects the best of the three  less time for jacksons indulgences
Apr 11 2008,positive,i loved it  one of my favourite films ever
Apr 11 2008,positive,my least favorite of the trilogy but its still fantastic  i kind of felt like i was watching filler for most of the film but at least its good filler  the extended edition gets 4 stars from me
Apr 11 2008,negative,there is a certain ambivalence in my feelings for lotr film trilogy
Apr 11 2008,positive,the lord of the rings movies are just wonderful  there is not much else to say other than you couldnt have made these movies much better
Apr 11 2008,neutral,better than harry fucking potter
Apr 11 2008,positive,an excellent adaptation of tolkiens classic book the details in everything are so perfect it looks like real events taking place not a fictional story
Apr 11 2008,positive,better than the third though make sure you have a good seat
Apr 10 2008,positive,like the empire strikes back this middle movie is the darkest of the series
Apr 10 2008,negative,i recognize these films are good and the story is good i just cant get into it
Apr 10 2008,positive,out of this world amazing
Apr 10 2008,positive,best triolgy of my generation

Apr 10 2008,positive,i just like it allways been fascinated about this monumental movie
Apr 10 2008,positive,one of the best ive seen
Apr 10 2008,positive,as i said on my review for the fellowship of the ring all three of these films are epic and brilliant and i love them all equally so but to name a few key things that i really love about the two towers specifically the introduction of gollum we briefly see him in the fellowship but its in this movie that we really come to know him and see him play a key role in the story its strange how you form an odd bond with gollum you cant help but love and hate him all at the same time and dont deny the fact that youve personally used the phrase my precioussssss because cmon you know you have in fact gollum provides us with a lot of great memorable lines in these movies and thats one of the reasons why youve got to love him something else that i really love about the two towers installment are the ents i completely adore them especially seeing as i already have an extreme affinity for trees theyre a magical addition to these films and treebeard is such a fantastic character their appearance is something that really stands out to me in this second movie of the trilogy and then of course the battle at helms deep is a long and tiring one but is definitely a highlight of the movie especially when the elves of lothlorien come to fight alongside man in the end two towers you didnt disappoint
Apr 10 2008,positive,better than the first i really liked this one
Apr 10 2008,positive,the best of the three
Apr 10 2008,positive,excellent movie awesome scenes a little humor makes for a nice epic  the extended version is even better
Apr 10 2008,positive,i find it hard to comment on these films individually as they are so tangled together it is hard to understand how they ever managed to separate them that said this is a fantastic film and bridges the first and third wellotherwise we wouldve given up by the third
Apr 9 2008,positive,those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something even if you were too small to understand why but i think mr frodo i do understand i know now folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt they kept going because they were holding on to something
Apr 9 2008,positive,very good moviesets the stage for the epic finalcute copy not really of the battle of vienna
Apr 9 2008,positive,omg i love the classics when i was younger i read the books and saw the movies    lol
Apr 9 2008,positive,hands down the best in the trilogy it was the film that made me actually enjoy lord of the rings the first time i saw it i was literally so caught up in the story that i jumped up onto my couch cheering on aragorn during the battle of helms deep it is my favorite of the films because it was the first to capture my heart and make me enjoy the story

Apr 8 2008,positive,though this movie does not live up to the first one it is still great in this one you meet more characters and see one of the most epic battles in movie history watch this movie as soon as you get a chance it is exciting and breath takingly extrordinary
Apr 8 2008,positive,so good  the characters are all amazing each one played by a truly gifted actor  gollum especially is an incredible feat in both effects and acting  this movie is just amazing  the visuals are breathtaking the music is awesome the story is inspiring and the attention to detail is unbelievable  even as the middle of the whole story it still manages to be emotionally dramatic and compelling  such a fantastically beautiful film
Apr 8 2008,positive,the middle lord of the rings didnt go over as well as the first one or the last one but it was still amazing
Apr 8 2008,positive,cool fights really really cool fights

Apr 8 2008,positive,what can i say just amazing
Apr 8 2008,positive,nice plot good transfer from the books to the screen good actors good director excellent sfx
Apr 8 2008,neutral,they were good when i saw them in theatersbut once you get them homeyou dont watch them againthey dont have the staying power that harry potter has

Apr 7 2008,positive,what can i say it is part of the lord of the rings trilogy
Apr 7 2008,positive,my favorite one  treebeard is the best character in all of the books and movies  also helmsdeep and the ents battle
Apr 7 2008,positive,this film is a bit slow sometimes but hey it is the middle of a saga things slow down  also watch the fellowship of the ring first
Apr 7 2008,negative,aside from the incredible action sequencesi am not a myths and magic movie fan i didnt like it sue me
Apr 7 2008,positive,of all the rings movies i like this the least  i found the main battle sequence was far too long  it was still a really entertaining movie though and the extended version was much better than the theatrical release
Apr 7 2008,positive,my favorite of the three
Apr 7 2008,positive,not quite as good as first character building began in the first film and is continued but not to the same level the battle of helms deep is superb and the ents are majestic and well handled a great film and a great continuation of the epic trilogy
Apr 7 2008,positive,fabulous just like the ther 2 ringos
Apr 6 2008,positive,in my mindthe best movie series in the history of cinema
Apr 6 2008,positive,best trilogy ever especially this second part

Apr 6 2008,positive,i love lotr cant put it any clearer
Apr 6 2008,positive,ok    i get another nice opportunity to talk up my favorite trilogy    this movie is very strong but very transitory as it sets up lots of things for the final installment     andy serkis breakout performance as gollum was amazing something that was onyl built upoj the final movie    it also built upon the action with the battle of helms deep probably the most epic ive seen in a movie    although this movie is strong i do think it is the weakest of the trilogy     casting choices were upped with the addition of theoden eomer and eowyn they really meshed with the other actors well    it only gets up from here   
Apr 6 2008,positive,its not amusing and has no sense of literacy
Apr 6 2008,positive,its a good show but im just not a huge fantasy fan
Apr 6 2008,positive,better than the first
Apr 6 2008,positive,lotrthe awesomeness

Apr 5 2008,positive,i like this movie a lot  but i hate where it ends  i wanted to see epic battle
Apr 5 2008,positive,a great sequel to a great trilogy a darker look into the adventure of frodo and sam and the encounter of gollumsmegal who was awesomely portrayed by andy serkis
Apr 5 2008,positive,more plot then the first less scrolling hills and valleys still no songs a pretty good adaptation of the book
Apr 5 2008,positive,the best film in the world
Apr 5 2008,positive,the lord of the rings movies are my favorite movies of timeand to change the lord of the rings to my second favorite is like changing the ramshaws to not my best friends they both will never change
Apr 5 2008,positive,best of an amazing trilogy
Apr 5 2008,positive,another great film that always deserves more respect for its coolness

Apr 4 2008,negative,rly upset on the gayness of these moviesoh theres so many battle scences and its crazylick my ballsit was like 20 min of battle and it was okif archer man wasnt in the movie the battles would suck too
Apr 4 2008,positive,number 2 of the best film ever
Apr 4 2008,positive,a good follow up to the fellowship peter jackson continues to increase the suspense and he still follows the book except that the ring of isengard is 1 mile diameter and the elves never came to help at helms deep you get the point overall impressive
Apr 4 2008,positive,best out of the three loved the trees
Apr 4 2008,positive,i wish i were a hobbit    or an elf    heck id settle for being a dwarf
Apr 4 2008,positive,long movie but then again so was the book  well made  this director should have made the harry potter movies
Apr 4 2008,positive,shit this movie was awesome
Apr 4 2008,positive,epic i want a talking tree
Apr 4 2008,positive,each movie in this trilogy was better  than the previous  an epic

Apr 3 2008,positive,excellent the first time but i dont think i need to see any of the lotr movies again
Apr 3 2008,positive,my personal preferance for the best lord on the rings fil as helms deep and the build up to it are far more effective than that of the final battle in the return of the king
Apr 3 2008,positive,i dont really like these type of movies but it was well made
Apr 3 2008,neutral,i liked the fellowship the best they left out a hobbit though tt

Apr 3 2008,positive,its okay if you get really stoned otherwise its too much thinkin
Apr 3 2008,positive,when i saw this movie and saw the great battle scenesi fell in love with this trilogy i also applaud peter jacksons vision he deserved the academy award for the third movie but he should have gotten a special award for creating the best fantasy movies of all time shutup about labyrinth
Apr 3 2008,positive,not the best out of the 3 but still good
Apr 3 2008,positive,the whole lotr series lived up to and beyond expectations all three are excellent
Apr 3 2008,positive,love this story and it was fairly well done
Apr 2 2008,positive,who wants to read a book when you can finish a movie in 10 hours
Apr 2 2008,positive,viggo was in it but he does better with real life roles i think
Apr 2 2008,positive,the two towers is the second movie in the trilogy of lotr and is probably the most action packed one and for me the most interesting if you liked the first youll like this one just as much
Apr 2 2008,positive,not as obsessed with this one but still very good i have this extended edition too
Apr 2 2008,positive,one of the three greatest movies ive ever seen

Apr 2 2008,positive,get paid by doing what you do on facebook or myspace      my site for great tips on how to make some  online 
Apr 2 2008,positive,this is definitely the most entertaining film in the series but the talking trees was too much i understand it was in the book it wasnt necessary to go to the depths they did in the film
Apr 2 2008,positive,this one was only ok i liked the last one the best because that meant the series was done
Apr 2 2008,neutral,oo orlando  whhattt a guy cant say hes hot too im sure theres alot of gaybi guys out there that might say it

Apr 1 2008,positive,my least fav of the three
Apr 1 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy in my opinion where it diverged from the book it added depth rather than taking it away
Apr 1 2008,positive,great movie beautiful setting stellar acting and a great plot  cant beat it
Apr 1 2008,positive,the 2nd part of the trilogy cranks it up  there is so much more heroics  storytelling than the 1st the action is unbelievable
Apr 1 2008,positive,i love the lord of the rings
Apr 1 2008,positive,amazing series although this is my least favorite of the three
Apr 1 2008,positive,the least successful of the three movies in that its not the setup or the grand finale but there are some wonderful moments nonetheless and it stands as one of the better war films ever made fantasy or not for depicting crushing anxiety and terror before combat  the forces assembled at the wall awaiting the orc hordes and it begins to rainabsolutely bleak and miserable

Mar 30 2008,positive,best one in this trilogy

Mar 30 2008,positive,the books were better but the director was fantastic at getting most of it perfect to what i thought it would be
Mar 30 2008,positive,enjoyed it better than the first but return is the best
Mar 30 2008,neutral,colorblackfar more boring than its predecessor and takes the adventure out of lotr is it a wonder that this is the only one of the trilogy not up for the oscar for best picturecolor

Mar 30 2008,positive,ahhhh but peter jacksons an ass so
Mar 29 2008,positive,i smell manflesh and i think its that rohan guy
Mar 29 2008,positive,the lord of the rings all 3 films as one  peter jacksons brilliant homage to tolkiens fantasy it wasnt just the screen adaptation that was brilliant but it showed his deep respect passion and reverence for the original book an unforgettable score set and costume designs that literally brought the feel of the book directly to the screen only a devoted fan could have accomplished such a huge undertaking jackson found the balance between those who never read the books with those who had he identified specific memorable scenes from the original material book then accurately reconstructed them onto the screen connecting them like pearls on a string while adapting the story to fit the medium my only regret was it didnt win the twelfth oscar to make it the most oscared film in motion picture history and yet all three films did win a total of 17 oscars which puts it in a category all its own
Mar 29 2008,positive,cheers whens the hobit coming out
Mar 29 2008,positive,good all around movie here folks
Mar 29 2008,positive,meanders at parts but the battles score and epic scope of this character driven fantasy more than make up for any shortcomings and the ents rock
Mar 29 2008,positive,this is the movie that made me fall deeply in love with the lord of the rings this is the movie that made me realize how cool the work of a director is the two towers changed me it made me see the world with different eyes took me on a mindblowing trip that im still travelling on this is one of those movies ill never get tired of no matter how many times ive seen it already     the best part about it is that it maintained all those good elements that made me like and appreciate the fellowship of the ring but got rid of all those slow complicated things that made the first movie so heavy and long the details are still there though and theres some character developement and some beautiul words are spoken toward the end of the movie the battle at helms deep and the words spoken by samwise the brave  and the visual effect of having gandalf with eomer and his army following him  that scene gets more and more astonishing the more you watch it its just stunning     as a matter of fact the extended version of the two towers flows by like really soon like a very light entertaining action packed movie i love every scene and the storyline is just so much more interesting if compared to the first movie well the way i see it the fellowship was just an introducion to tolkiens universe then it come the battle of helm followed by the greates battle for middle earth      when i first saw the lord of the rings the two towers i hostestly thought it was the best movie ive ever seen that was before i saw the return of the king thats the crazy thing it just keeps on getting better and better
Mar 29 2008,positive,the books were better i felt the movies were more violent than need be there is not much detail on the wars in the books thats peter jacksons style though so i think he did well

Mar 23 2008,positive,i wish the harry potter movies were as well made as the lotr movies

Mar 21 2008,positive,i found this to be better than the original the gollum character looks so real personally i think the visual effects in this are some of the best ive seen its a bit drawn out but it needs to be since it is a loooooong story i heard that the studio planned to just fit all of this series into just one movie lol this gets 45 from me
Mar 21 2008,positive,awesome film peter jackson is a genius
Mar 21 2008,neutral,the first is the best and i dont really like this movie any way but it had good cgi
Mar 21 2008,positive,to long but really good
Mar 21 2008,positive,brilliant my favorite film in the trilogy i think it was the battle scenes that i thought were particularly well done

Mar 21 2008,positive,my fave of all three fab movie amazing fight scenes
Mar 21 2008,positive,lord of the rings is awesome i think the third movies the best though
Mar 21 2008,positive,great i loved that they stayed as true to the book as they did
Mar 21 2008,positive,more orcs the fighting urukhai the coolest geek movie ever

Mar 21 2008,positive,spectacular best mass fight scene eva expected the 3rd to be better but was sorely disappointed
Mar 21 2008,positive,yup top 5 movies of all time id say this is 3rd out of the trilogy as it is slow in partsbut hey so is the book but still a fantastic movie overall
Mar 20 2008,positive,i would call this movie the calm before the storm in the lotr trilogy once youve watched the last of the movies you cannot watch this one and not find the portrayal of helms deep as nothing than at least a bit disappointing
Mar 20 2008,positive,idk y but i think the lord of the rings is really good
Mar 20 2008,positive,i love lord of the rings
Mar 20 2008,positive,seen this movie too many times

Mar 20 2008,positive,in general just a good movie
Mar 20 2008,negative,bt far the weakest of the jackson lotr trilogy excels in unrequired and silly additions and changes to tolkiens great story still a must see of course
Mar 20 2008,positive,great actors exquisite directing interesting plotsimply the whole package
Mar 20 2008,positive,it made up for the unconvincing first installment  which to be fair was 3 hours of introducing characters  this takes off from the middle right on until the explosive battle at the end awesome
Mar 20 2008,positive,follows on perfectly from the first movie even orlando bloom is good
Mar 20 2008,positive,first one was better but this is very good too and better at this second time whitout fever 
Mar 20 2008,positive,better than the first one the plot is quite predicate but the detail is worth watching it is medieval style the inpersonalization of the orcs reminds me of the dark history of the medieval age
Mar 20 2008,positive,must watch d all three chapters otherwise might be lost
Mar 20 2008,positive,seen itnicebut confusing

Mar 19 2008,positive,many imagination made true
Mar 19 2008,positive,this is one of the most enthralling movies i have seen in a long time since the fellowship of the ring probably  the actor selection is unbeatable  viggo mortensen lives aragorn john davies is the best gimli i can immagine orlando bloom and elijah wood and karl urban and ian mckellen and sean astin are extraordinary  if the storyline didnt deserve five stars by itself then the actors perfected it
Mar 19 2008,positive,love it again and again
Mar 19 2008,negative,my least fav of the three but still very good
Mar 19 2008,positive,story filler but what a ride

Mar 18 2008,positive,probably the second best in the trilogy of movies preceded by fellowship
Mar 18 2008,positive,powerful second chapter
Mar 18 2008,positive,yet again we continue the story as gollum is shown to us this movie seems more like a story of survival the survival of humans against the dark forces a true story of the battle waged between dark and light good and evil in a world of fantasy

Mar 17 2008,neutral,i just cant seem ta get into the hobbit stuff

Mar 17 2008,positive,the best one i have ever seen  from the trilogy
Mar 16 2008,positive,i considered the fellowship of the ring to be one of the greatest movies ever this one is better    the scenery is marvelous the animations great and the story superb this episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events but i feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism the nazgûls are now the fearinspiring creatures they should be gollum excellently implemented even becomes more realistic then i remember him from the books not to mention other attempts to portray him his schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie    the major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the darkside creatures aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt while the urukhai fall in large numbers just for being nearby though i enjoy many of the jokes made at gimlis expense this still is another thing i partly dislike gimli sure is no clown in the books
Mar 16 2008,positive,more graphic in its violence so much so that i feel jackson took away from the epic splendor he had on his hands
Mar 16 2008,negative,hate lord of the rings bad experiences and theyre too damn long
Mar 16 2008,positive,fantastic i wish it had followed story better but great movie
Mar 16 2008,positive,haldir actually isnt dead you see i was there and i found him on the battle field almost dead so i healed him he shouldnt have even had the choice of dying and when galadriel sailed away haldir did not let the golden wood die but helped it live on and ive always wondered why celeborn didnt go with galadriel no he stayed behind with elrohir and elladan and helped to rule rivendell and it is unknown what path the twin sons of elrond chose for their destiny is hidden from the eyes of mortals
Mar 16 2008,positive,movie that amazed me
Mar 16 2008,positive,sweet continuation from part 1 with an end that urges one to look forward eagerly for more the final battle for middleearth
Mar 16 2008,positive,ahhh i love lord of the rings
Mar 16 2008,positive,it needs to be happier
Mar 16 2008,positive,there are not enough words to say how much i love this movie and the entire trilogy the acting the costumes the story the sets the directingabsolutely incredible and the best trilogy ever made in my mind this trilogy will not be surpassed for a long time the story told in these movies and the books should be read by everyone as there are innumerable morals ethics and life lessons taught through lotr
Mar 16 2008,positive,my fave of the three yayayayayay
Mar 16 2008,positive,over rated effects extravaganza  sorry to make so many enemies at once  i love jacksons early movies and hope he quits relying upon effects rather than story  remember  effects are a tool to tell a story
Mar 15 2008,negative,loved the books  fell asleep with the movies sad but true
Mar 15 2008,positive,oh god i hate this series it was good really good but the goddam smegel thingy the thing that said my precious scared me soooooooooo much that i hate lord of the rings
Mar 15 2008,positive,ahhhhhhhhhhthis belongs sooooooooooooooooooooo much higher
Mar 15 2008,positive,gets enough done to set up for the third not quite as good as the other two though
Mar 15 2008,positive,a terrific sequel its so captivating you gotta see the first one though or it wont make sense
Mar 15 2008,positive,a brilliant continuation in the series  that all three films were filmed simultaneously is a logistical miracle the battle for helms deep dwarf throwing shield surfing and some repitiion of digital effects aside is one of the best set pieces ever an achievement beyond measure
Mar 15 2008,positive,follows teh book nicely
Mar 15 2008,positive,this is one of the best movies of all time based on one of the best works of literature of all time
Mar 15 2008,positive,dont try to tell me that those main two little guys arent totally gay for each other
Mar 15 2008,neutral,i just dont really like the lord of the rings trilogy i think its boring

Mar 15 2008,positive,all of the lord of the ring movies are great
Mar 15 2008,positive,oh lord of the rings how i love you i loved the elf plots in two towers
Mar 15 2008,positive,not my sort of thing
Mar 15 2008,positive,found it better than the first  d loved the battle of helms deep
Mar 15 2008,positive,all time fave trilogy
Mar 14 2008,positive,best battle sences in all the lord of rings
Mar 14 2008,positive,perfect no more words
Mar 14 2008,positive,good movie i usually dont like a lot of bookbased movies but this one was pretty good i love the other two lotr movies of course but the extende version of the two towers is the best it made me appreceate boromir so much more even though hes still a total dork
Mar 14 2008,positive,great 2nd movie in this trilogy
Mar 14 2008,positive,my least favorite of the trilogy
Mar 14 2008,positive,we finally get to see gollum and are not even vaguely disappointed  it ends on the wrong note which is forgivable given the medium of translating an epic book series to film
Mar 14 2008,positive,went to see the midnight show with a friend when i worked in florida fell asleep we woke up the movie was over and most people were gone took a while to decide to see what i missed
Mar 14 2008,positive,great trilogy love them all
Mar 14 2008,positive,the second chapter of the trilogy the two towers is by far and foremost the empire strikes back of star wars    this chapter is darker more intense action sequence and the introduction of golem cg at its best
Mar 14 2008,positive,not my cup of tea as a movie but you cant ignore the genious of peter jackson and how he makes his films although it seems like a gamble to hand him the franchise it makes more sense if you know his early work
Mar 14 2008,positive,my lovely princes iwen and u arwen is the beuty princeses ever
Mar 14 2008,neutral,technically just a film about a very long walk
Mar 14 2008,positive,love lord of the rings movies
Mar 14 2008,positive,master betrayed us wicked tricksy false we ought to wring his filthy little neck kill him kill him kill them both and then we take the precious and we be the master
Mar 14 2008,positive,awesome all the lotr movies are just pure brilliance when i read the books this is exactly how i pictured it my head
Mar 14 2008,positive,i love all the movies so this one falls on that list
Mar 14 2008,positive,review i will respect tolkiens wishes and treat the trilogy as one movie as which he entended when he wrote the book it is an epic adventure for the ages
Mar 14 2008,positive,all of the lord of the rings movies were great
Mar 13 2008,positive,my favorite of the series mainly due to the ents actually fighting even though they needed to fight more great merry and pippen humor and a fantastic battle scene at helms deep
Mar 13 2008,positive,words arent necessary
Mar 13 2008,positive,very nice especially in a funny translation in russian 
Mar 13 2008,positive,this movie demonstrated how evil can be defeated by unity although it is at war there are still hope and friendship it was a heartpounding moment when all races are united to fight sarumans army and when the evil is losing   personally the elves are the coolest characters in the movies their image and bow make different and intelligent  this is indeed an exciting and insightful film
Mar 13 2008,positive,oddly enough like star wars the second installment of this trilogy was the best for me  separated from the hobbits the three real heroes must continue to do their part in some way to aid frodos quest  opening with smeagol and deagol was a brilliant move as gollum is such a key character in this film and the stories as a whole  perfect
Mar 13 2008,positive,love the battle of helms deep awesome
Mar 13 2008,positive,andy serkis really outdid himself acting all schizo and the rest of the cast was simply marvelous
Mar 13 2008,negative,borin gave me arse ache fell asleep after the 9th hour watch the cartoonlive action one instead
Mar 13 2008,positive,the second installment of the trilogy sends the hobbits in different directions in this film we can see each character develop from the opening film and sets us up for a grandstand finale which was to be the battle at helms deep
Mar 13 2008,positive,the uncut edition is so much better than what oringinally hit the big screen but it was amazing
Mar 13 2008,positive,this movie was very good for a sequel i loved every minute of it especially the tree warriors
Mar 13 2008,positive,there are not many films which produce superior sequels this is one of the few which do if you thought the first film was great wait till you see this once    the story is a lot more exciting with it continuing straight after the last film the actors which brought this world to life they all gave outstanding performances again brad dourif created a sinister wormtongue and andy serkis really brought gollum to life i feel that if serkis didnt portray him to character wouldnt seem as real    all the special effects were superb the use of bigatures really improved the environment if peter jackson and his team used cgi instead i feel they wouldnt have captured it right the cgi which was used was also very impressing trying to figure out which orcs and soldiers are actors and which are cgi can be a real challenge the character of gollum was also a cgi masterpiece andy serkis together which the characters looks really brought him to life     the music was a wonderful treat again and howard shore did another great job again he really added to the characters and moved the story along     if you havent seen any of the film before i would highly suggest you catch them as they are really a huge part of cinema history
Mar 13 2008,positive,andy serkis deserved the oscar pretty great movie for having no beginning or end i remember sitting in the theater completely engrossed in the scene where treebeard calls the ents to warmy mouth was literally open and i just couldnt drink it all in the horses in this movie deserve props as well even they are superior actors
Mar 13 2008,positive,breath stopping clever
Mar 13 2008,positive,top ten movies of all time
Mar 13 2008,negative,the ents were actually well done  unfortunately it suffers from the same problems as its predecessor  too many movie inventions and a nonstop soundtrack
Mar 13 2008,positive,a bit of a boys flick ive repetedly said u can split the trilogy into 3 categories
Mar 13 2008,positive,the battle of helms deep is one of the finest battle sequences in science fiction film history further development in the plot the separtion of the fellowship  the return of some familiar faces make towers a must see
Mar 13 2008,positive,see review for fellowship
Mar 13 2008,positive,these are good but long watch at home so you can take breaks
Mar 13 2008,positive,theyre all great  loses half a star for not having anything in it that makes it stand out above the rest
Mar 13 2008,positive,the worst of the trilogy though
Mar 13 2008,positive,not as magical as the first but essential filmmaking
Mar 13 2008,positive,was it this film or the third one that had the absolutely classic potatoes conversation whats taters precious lawlz  hobbitses
Mar 13 2008,positive,read the books and watch the movies  the lord of the rings empire demands it  my precious
Mar 13 2008,positive,a good escape for a frustrated mind
Mar 12 2008,positive,my favorite of the trilogy helms deep kicked ass
Mar 12 2008,positive,so great awesome battle sequences good plot that perfectly sets up the final installment

Mar 12 2008,positive,i love legolas  orlando bloom again
Mar 12 2008,positive,absolute immense u cannot knock these fims
Mar 12 2008,positive,the second best movie ever made
Mar 12 2008,neutral,a shaky middlepiece to the trilogy fellowship and rotk fair much better from the adaptating
Mar 12 2008,positive,battle at the end was amazing
Mar 12 2008,positive,great second act to a major motion picture achievement
Mar 12 2008,positive,not my fave of the lord of the rings trilogy but it was still awesome
Mar 12 2008,positive,for some reason i think this was the least of the triliogy though i love the ents and the helms deep fight sequence
Mar 12 2008,positive,my favorite of the trilogy
Mar 12 2008,positive,what can i say orlando bloon even tho he has less apprearance in this ojne 
Mar 12 2008,positive,didnt think i would like these movies until i saw this one in the theater it got me
Mar 12 2008,positive,fantastic films  all of them
Mar 12 2008,positive,love the rings movies
Mar 12 2008,positive,good battles less walking fx are dodgy on the ents though
Mar 12 2008,positive,a real epic never bores massive battles good character development as there friendship builds the most in this one and a comedy element comes through gollum is such a great character aswell and his split personality and use of camera angles for him are done so so well amazing
Mar 12 2008,positive,a good adaptation of the book despite some slight moments of cheese
Mar 12 2008,positive,fontgaramondsize3the rt anniversary trilogy viewing continues with this excellent film i prefer the two towers to the first film because the story moves along better and the music visual effects and emotional impact are perfectly united in the climactic final scenes of helms deep and isengard    we pick up our story with aragorn legolas and gimli tracking a band of urukhai who have taken merry and pippin as captives back to saruman at isengard  instead our three heroes run into eomer karl urban and his band of rohirrim and he relates that the urukhai were destroyed aragorn tracks the hobbits into fangorn forest and there gandalf greets them reborn as the white wizard together the four now return to restore king theoden bernard hill to his throne and release him from the spell of saruman and grima wormtongue brad dourif aragorn also has a brief flirtation with theodens niece eowyn miranda otto firm in his belief that arwen has left for the undying shores with her kin faced with war the people of rohan  follow their king and withdraw to the safety of helms deep and there aragorn legolas gimli and a band of elves help theoden and the people of rohan fight the full might unleashed from isengard meanwhile sam and frodo begin their long journey into mordor guided through the rocks of the emyn muil and the dead marshes by the creature gollum andy serkis who is still bound to the ring he leads them straight to the black gate of mordor but then implores them to go by a back way he knows of instead when they change their route they are captured by captain faramir david wenham and his men faramir quickly discovers that frodo is a ringbearer and he decides to take him and the ring back to gondor faramirs mind is finally changed when he sees the power of the ring over frodo as he stands face to face with a nazgul and he lets sam frodo and gollum continue on their way while all this is occurring merry and pippin have run into the ent treebeard john rhysdavies and they wait impatiently for the ents to be stirred to war finally receiving their wish when treebeard sees all the destruction saruman has wreaked on the forest in order to build up his army isengard is sacked while gandalf and eomer return to turn the tide of victory at helms deep and we all expectantly await the return of the king    this film has all the benefits of the first film and more the story moves faster thanks to cuts back and forth between multiple storylines the visual effects are simply stunning and howard shores musical score packs even more punch than in the first film two towers also introduces my two favorite characters and favorite storyline eowyn and faramir and  petty as this seems  two towers only gets nine tomatoes because no matter how many times i see this film ill never get over how badly butchered the character of faramir is compared to the book yes i understand that undermining faramirs character prolongs the tension of frodos storyline but that still doesnt make it acceptable    overall lord of the rings is the worlds most amazing film trilogy and this middle entry is an inspiring continuationsizefont    fontgaramondsize3img    sizefont
Mar 12 2008,positive,this was the shortest of the books but probably the best of the films battle sequences were amazing and the whole thing was extremely well done
Mar 12 2008,positive,the entire trilogy is fantastic set up and the parts are acted out perfectly but my personal favorites the 2 towers though
Mar 12 2008,positive,entertaining but almost impossible to watch twice

Mar 11 2008,positive,the second installment in the longest movies in the world
Mar 11 2008,positive,2nd greatest movie of all time
Mar 11 2008,positive,its hard to separate this movies into three parts  i think the second movie is often the most overlooked in any trilogy and takes a special bit of extra work to impact viewers  this succeeds in doing just that
Mar 11 2008,positive,yeah if i could read the book in three hours id do that but damn is this good
Mar 11 2008,neutral,wasnt that good imo
Mar 11 2008,positive,the almost perfect second installment to a perfect trilogy nuff said

Mar 11 2008,positive,the lord of the rings triolgy is quite possibly one of the best trilogies every created  every movie is better than the one prior to it and the fellowship of the ring was an excellent film anyway  i love lord of the rings
Mar 11 2008,positive,blonde elf wig 15000  time in makeup chair 3 hours  dramatic death scene hair flinging priceless

Mar 10 2008,positive,very good again too much missing from the book but well acted and compelling story even the elves work
Mar 10 2008,positive,shittiest out of the three but still good just for the war scenes
Mar 10 2008,positive,i like the lord of the rings deals but geez stop making em out to be some kind of life force holy crap
Mar 10 2008,positive,gets lost in the shuffle  great in its own right
Mar 10 2008,positive,the standout installment of an otherwise dry trilogy
Mar 10 2008,positive,tolkien brought to life its not a book true but they did great
Mar 10 2008,positive,plus one for amazing acting of serkisplus two for viggo running with a broken toe
Mar 10 2008,positive,thsi is the best movie i love trilogy
Mar 10 2008,positive,my least favorite of the 3 great battle at helms deep though

Mar 10 2008,positive,one of the top three trilogies out thereepicin the true sense of the word
Mar 10 2008,positive,the weakest of the trilogy but still far better than most of the crap that is released year to year  the march of the ents is probably the high point of this film while helms deep was a bit of a let down  jackson made up for it in return of the king though
Mar 10 2008,positive,this one i only saw once
Mar 10 2008,positive,one of the greatest films ever
Mar 10 2008,neutral,the acting in this is superb  i love the emotion and struggle of every character  the story line i did not like that much though

Mar 9 2008,positive,weakest of the series but still good
Mar 9 2008,positive,the extended edition is my favourite of the trilogy  peter jackson is dialed in telling a fantastic story getting the most out the actors and the production as a whole
Mar 9 2008,positive,love this movie and the entire franchise a really good movie yay
Mar 9 2008,positive,the best of the three
Mar 9 2008,positive,very good movie full of action could have done without the noneexistant romance but was a good movie

Mar 9 2008,positive,there was an audible gasp from every woman in the theater when viggo made his onscreen entrance
Mar 9 2008,positive,see the extended version
Mar 9 2008,positive,possibly the best of the rings trilogy
Mar 9 2008,positive,better than the first keeps your attention nailed to it
Mar 8 2008,positive,again see review for the return of the king
Mar 8 2008,positive,like strikes back a perfect 2nd to a trilogy i read the books at a very early age and this is what it looked like in my head but you must only watch the extendeds all others are a waste of time
Mar 8 2008,positive,the best in lotr series
Mar 8 2008,positive,this was my favourite of the books and to see it come to life was awesome
Mar 8 2008,positive,better than the fellowship
Mar 8 2008,positive,like the whole series
Mar 8 2008,positive,amazing introduction with gandalf once again the soundtrack was brilliant adding more mood to the scenes helms deep was brilliantly shot in some ways its not as good as the first possibly because of the new characters were not introduced as well and also because theres theres the need to run 3 storylines in parallel there were scenes in the trailer that were cut out which would have worked really well in the film also the extended edition had some background information but also had some unnecessary scenes added just for humour gollums song isnt as strong as the previous song
Mar 8 2008,positive,my least favorite of the trilogy
Mar 8 2008,positive,dido on what i said bout the browness but i like the story alot go arwen

Mar 8 2008,positive,worst of the three but still a really good movie
Mar 8 2008,positive,peter jackson and jrr tolkien are geniuses this is a great film and perhaps the best of the triology
Mar 8 2008,negative,books were wayyy bettereff these movies
Mar 8 2008,positive,yeah that was fun its actually amazing since i dont like gory battles and the second half of the movie was almost exclusively about a battle but i was way to impressed with the animation to be grossed out by the battle actually i can hardly recall any blood the second thing that was impressive was of course gollum looks like a new chapter in motion capture technology i still havent read any of the books so i guess i am missing a lot the whole story and background of the main characters but that doesnt really matter cinematographically there is enough there to make this an entertaining 3hour movie
Mar 8 2008,positive,3rd best movie of all timeafter the other 2 its completely different from the first one i mean did u see helms deap  but i will agree frodo is so gay sam is bi though cause he has kids
Mar 8 2008,positive,amazing the last battle sequence is just breath taking and completley epic
Mar 8 2008,positive,the battle at helms deep was outstanding
Mar 8 2008,positive,after i have watched the fellowship of the ring i knew there was a second part in which i was expecting for a part three
Mar 8 2008,positive,so my fave scene is in the extended version after the battle at helms deep and legolas and gimli are arguing about who had the most kills and legolas shoots an arrow into the orc that gimli was sitting on bc it was twitching lol
Mar 8 2008,positive,just as good as the first but mora fast  paced
Mar 8 2008,positive,nice and great movie i like it as there are lot of fairies i like the actor orlando bloom hes cute
Mar 8 2008,positive,it was good but the third was better
Mar 8 2008,positive,very nice feel but a bit boring while the big battle takes place
Mar 8 2008,positive,the last stand great battle
Mar 8 2008,positive,helms deep is really the highlight of this movie each film carries its own weight for me at least
Mar 7 2008,positive,probably the best stand alone movie in the triloggy  it was very entertaining exciting and fun
Mar 7 2008,positive,ditto even though ive never seen it
Mar 7 2008,positive,jrrtokien was a genious
Mar 7 2008,positive,a third movie that is actually good quite rare  the plot dissapeard and is mostly just war fighting  but done in a good way  abused the cg again though
Mar 7 2008,positive,best of the lord of the ring series i simply just love the way they fight   farmers ferriers stable boys these are no soldiers   most have seen too many winters    or too few
Mar 7 2008,neutral,while still holding my attention the series starts to wane
Mar 7 2008,positive,i luv all 3 of these
Mar 7 2008,positive,fantastic again on a same level as the first installment and the battle at helms deep is the true meaning of epic
Mar 7 2008,positive,not as good as the first and the third but still good
Mar 7 2008,positive,not as good as the first or star wars but still fukin awesome
Mar 7 2008,positive,time magazine said it best on their cover  good lord  the second installment is even better than the first classic
Mar 7 2008,positive,i guess i was ok but my least favorite of the trilogy
Mar 7 2008,positive,and the series just kept getting better with this film theres just so much candy for the eyes that it defies belief
Mar 7 2008,positive,awesome im still asking myself witch one was the best of the trilogy and i think a lot about this one
Mar 7 2008,negative,boring i only watched it because my brother was an extraish he was one of the many who made the sound of thr army monsters possible
Mar 7 2008,negative,it failed to live up to its fantasy status
Mar 7 2008,neutral,visually stunning but like tolkien went on and on and on
Mar 7 2008,positive,great story line but must see the first movie
Mar 7 2008,positive,once again what else can i add except that this movie just builds to what is the climax of amazing proportions

Mar 4 2008,positive,gotta love lord of the rings 
Mar 4 2008,positive,might have taken a tinsy tiny step back from the fellowhip but still a wonderful film people may not see it because its a bridge movie but dont do that youll be missing out on some trully awesome battle sequences and even more great acting from no name actors and even more beautifully shot landscapes of new zealend with the fellowhip i was unsure how the action was going to go becasue the fellowhip doesnt have much action and the two towers is an action movie any doubts were quickly dashed the battle of helms deep to this point in the trilogy is some of the coolest in any movie the movie also does a good job of detailing some more character relationships that were unclear in the book or not so detailed in the fellowship if youre a fan of the lord of ther rings or like action movies this is a great moive for you but this is a beautiful set up for one of probably the greatest finale to a trilogy ever
Mar 4 2008,positive,all of the lord of the rings are very well developed with great acting and graphics

Mar 3 2008,positive,impossibly good film
Mar 3 2008,positive,awesome adaptation of the book i think they did an awesome job interpreting  the extended versions are awesome and it gives you some insite into how they made the movies if you up to actually sitting through hours and hours of how we did it but it was very educational for me
Mar 3 2008,positive,great books made into great movies  some of the best movies ever made  watch all 3 as one story not 3 individual movies  all you can say is wow
Mar 3 2008,positive,not bad but the book was better

Mar 3 2008,positive,ok considerin i dnt normally watch this type of film 
Mar 3 2008,positive,liked this one the least out of the three 
Mar 3 2008,positive,i have read the books so many times and practically live to worship tolkien which is quite sad really but when you see the films you get engrossed in his fantasy world and you forget how pathetic it really is  it is almost impossible for a film to beat a book but i think that this loyal film with fab acting and direction and just an overwhelming sense of passion behind it comes very close  the trilogy are my three favourite films ever
Mar 3 2008,positive,and were still walking
Mar 3 2008,positive,the 2nd best film ever
Mar 3 2008,positive,best of the three  action all the way the 35 hours seem to zoom away quickly

Mar 2 2008,positive,didnt stray as much from the book as fellowship but still not as good as return
Mar 2 2008,positive,not that i ever managed to read the books but peter jackson pimped this movie like it paid him in quarters a masterful trilogy but froto was a bitch
Mar 2 2008,positive,of a fivestar trilogy this one is the best
Mar 2 2008,positive,awesome movie plus its got great actors and actresses some very very cute actors too orlando bloom  elijah wood

Mar 2 2008,negative,boring could hardly stay awake
Mar 2 2008,positive,more duvetsofa viewing owing to illness  worth it for the battle scenes though its hard not to shout get on with it whenever enya comes on the soundtrack and liv tyler starts snivelling again

Mar 1 2008,positive,most amazing film on the planet ever
Mar 1 2008,positive,awesome world outside the shire

Feb 29 2008,positive,awesome series i think it is very adventurous
Feb 29 2008,positive,spectacular never does once even for a minute second does the special effects or the multistar cast overshadow the story and thats the power of an exceptional screenplay
Feb 29 2008,positive,i love all of the movies and all of the booksi just love it
Feb 29 2008,positive,this has the sexiest entrance ever by an actor  all hail viggo mortensen

Feb 29 2008,positive,just read part 1 and 3 reviewbest movie of all time yes even better than matrix and star wars
Feb 29 2008,positive,im probably alone in enjoying this one the most of the movie trilogy
Feb 29 2008,positive,despite the story alterations still pretty good helms deep scenes are awesome
Feb 29 2008,positive,greater than the first in every way even though its not really a sequel this one is part of the seen more than once in the theatre club very few movies hold that privilege not much to say about this film can be said that hasnt been said about the fellowship or return of the king  regardless is this is my favourite of the series
Feb 29 2008,positive,love all 3 films
Feb 29 2008,positive,the best of the three slightly better than return of the king
Feb 29 2008,positive,two words ent combat
Feb 29 2008,positive,this is my favorite of the three and of course when i talk about lotr movies i talk about the extended ones gollum is amazing
Feb 29 2008,positive,weakest of the 3 i think but still ace
Feb 29 2008,positive,one of the best openings on movies ever first half is fun and the sense of great adventure is present theatrical release suffers from too much material left out to speed things up thanks for the extended edition still the end part gets tedious at this movie i got the feeling the third is gonna be too big for my taste
Feb 29 2008,positive,it gives insite to the previous show  a little too long for me
Feb 29 2008,positive,all three of these movies is great they honor the books
Feb 29 2008,negative,strayed way too far from the book which wasnt very interesting to start with
Feb 29 2008,positive,same as the 1st movie just as good as the book another great film made even better by viggo mortensen and orlando bloom

Feb 28 2008,positive,this trilogy is well i love it peter jackson work the battle  oposed the bads guys its wonderfull
Feb 28 2008,positive,i like the three different stories that this movie became and i think it was edited in a way that kept me interested in all three   the ents are cool but are so slow talking that it made me a little angry but they were supposed to be that way so i guess its good great followup
Feb 28 2008,positive,slower and not as good as 1 and 3
Feb 28 2008,positive,dette er den beste filmen jeg noen sinne har sett forfatteren av boka er helt genial    this is the best movie i have ever seen the writer of the book is genius
Feb 28 2008,positive,a beautiful film it did its purpose which was to get you all hyped for  the final film which you knew in your heart was going to be  the best movie ever made battle scenes are revolutionary everybody is copying from peter jackson
Feb 28 2008,positive,awesome storytelling in the movies at its best
Feb 28 2008,negative,i found this film to be pretty disappointing  i loved the books so obviously a bit of a let down is in order but the rediculous action sequences get to be a bit much  turning aragorn and legolas into almost superhuman fighters overshadows any interesting qualities they might have  and again turning gimli into nothing more than comic relief is really frustrating
Feb 28 2008,positive,this movie was awsome
Feb 28 2008,positive,brilliant film with stunning action and amazing effects andy serkis as gollum is incredible not quite as good as the fellowship but not too far away gimli emerges as a great comedic character while still retaining his badass dwarf persona
Feb 28 2008,positive,pity frodo and sam didnt masterbate each other but you cant have everything
Feb 28 2008,positive,good movie although a bit depressing as its right in the middle of the other two still cracking though
Feb 28 2008,positive,the towers is also a very wonderful movie and especially he two hobbitspippin and merry encourage the ents to go to war in isengard
Feb 28 2008,positive,this trilogy rocked

Feb 27 2008,positive,the best of the three andy serkis steals the act for all the human actors a great achievement in cgi
Feb 27 2008,positive,a brilliant trilogy but takes a lot out of you when you watch the special editions back to back
Feb 27 2008,neutral,i am a bit of a purist so this movie aggravated me because of the liberties that were taken with the story elves at helms deep lame
Feb 27 2008,positive,2nof the lord of the rings trilogy its good on the big screen but in my opinion loses its charms after multiple viewings still impressive though

Feb 27 2008,positive,this was the second best lotr movie i liked it 
Feb 27 2008,positive,i still thought hobbits were gay but these movies were still good
Feb 27 2008,positive,the most action packed of the three
Feb 27 2008,positive,the biggest movie ever
Feb 27 2008,negative,i remember the time when i first watched this in the cinema i was so furious with all the atrocious alterations to the characters ie faramir  treebeard i felt like screaming at the top of my lungs tear off my hair and strangle peter jackson my hatred for the director still lives until this day nevertheless i have to admit that the siege of helms deep is very welldone if overemphasized

Feb 26 2008,neutral,just way too long i see this as the boring middle bit
Feb 26 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy
Feb 25 2008,positive,the only thing stopping this thing from getting five stars is the strange inconsistensies with the book elves jackson really
Feb 25 2008,positive,caveat im only referring to the extended version of this movie  the theatrical release was less than ideal

Feb 24 2008,positive,the visual effect is stuning
Feb 24 2008,positive,i hate the changes which were made from the book though i know it must be difficult for the director to make the middle part
Feb 24 2008,positive,though not quite as strong as the first that doesnt take anything away from its excellence the introduction of rohan and resurrection of gandalf are handled incredibly well and the battle of helms deep is spectacular extended version is even better most notably because of a great extended flashback featuring boromir
Feb 24 2008,negative,lord of the rings created a nationalist fervour in wellington and new zealand not seen since the nuremberg rallies of nazi germany and for this reason and many others i refused to watch it
Feb 24 2008,positive,i loved this trilogy peter jackson did a very good job with the monumental task of boiling this trilogy down to something consumable to a broad audience and even though i would have given anything to see the books translated to film without anything left out or anything added i still have to say that i enjoyed the ride and would have enjoyed the movies without having read the books first
Feb 23 2008,positive,clearly the best adventure trilogy to date if you watch the directors cut
Feb 23 2008,positive,mmmmm yeah like it the acting is intense the filming is well done and the music is incredible special effects dont even get me started haha its all in all great

Feb 23 2008,positive,my least favorite of this trilogy but still its enjoyable
Feb 23 2008,positive,merry makes my life
Feb 23 2008,positive,love the battle scenes but the fact that i have to skip over the frodo sam scenes makes it a little tedious since they are horrible
Feb 23 2008,positive,memories of yelling at the screen but it was good nonetheless
Feb 23 2008,positive,epic best of the trilogy but all three were great
Feb 23 2008,positive,aragon he is the best of this film
Feb 23 2008,negative,blah i thought this was the boring one out of the three

Feb 23 2008,positive,still yes i missed sean bean though 
Feb 23 2008,positive,just like its predecessor this movie is amazing and i absolutely love gollum  i dont love that wants to kill frodo and sam buti dont know i just love him hes one of the coolest characters in my opinion
Feb 22 2008,positive,great movie gollum was done beautifully the cgi guys did an awesome job but more importantly andy serkis gave an oscarworthy performance in this one and in the final film

Feb 22 2008,positive,no one tosses a dwarf
Feb 22 2008,positive,even the trees walked
Feb 22 2008,positive,first huge action sequence of the trilogy and like the other two meets and exceeds the huge expectation of a fan of the book expanded dvd version is far superior to the shorter theatrical version
Feb 22 2008,positive,the lotr films finally proved that americans could enjoy a film based closely on a book something every other countries cinema had known for years
Feb 22 2008,positive,the best of the trilogy
Feb 22 2008,positive,this is my favorite on of the three battle of helms deep is epic
Feb 22 2008,positive,i dont like how they made the ents to be such pacifists

Feb 22 2008,positive,good to watch it at least oncethen no more
Feb 22 2008,positive,lord of the rings is pretty cool
Feb 22 2008,neutral,long pointless overdrawn middle entry in a trilogy that stole my imagination the bad way
Feb 22 2008,positive,i never read the book so i really cant complain with this visual feast of a movie  theres some really great character development and the plot continues to gets more interesting but its probably the weakest of the trilogy

Feb 21 2008,positive,well written story action mixed well
Feb 21 2008,positive,better than the 1st one
Feb 21 2008,positive,as good as the others
Feb 21 2008,positive,the slowest of all three films despite not being the longest focuses entirely too much on militarism which for tolkien was the focus of maybe one or two pages on paper and not nearly enough for us to play with besides
Feb 21 2008,positive,brilliant in every way
Feb 21 2008,positive,i think its my favorite of the three its just so good you can tell they were getting into the groove only to be broken by how to end this epic tale
Feb 21 2008,positive,the least of the trilogy but by no means a bad movie the battle for helms deep is amazing the rest just feels like filler until we get to return of the king
Feb 21 2008,positive,love the battle scenes
Feb 21 2008,positive,i like these movies i sat in my room for 9 hours straight because these movies were on a marathon
Feb 21 2008,positive,lots of shit goes down  gollum is a total jerk  up yours orcs

Feb 21 2008,positive,i think is the best of trilogy
Feb 21 2008,positive,love it especially the action scenes like the battle of helms deep its funny how legolas and gimli bet to see who can kill the most orcs

Feb 21 2008,positive,my fav of the trilogy hail the rohanians
Feb 21 2008,positive,fantastic best out of them all
Feb 21 2008,positive,as with the other two films the extended versions should be the only ones watched
Feb 21 2008,positive,the final hour of the two towers is grand terrifying and epic on a biblical level    without a doubt the lord of the rings trilogy is one of the greatest achievements in the art of filmmaking the two towers is perhaps even more enjoyable than the fellowship of the ring especially for viewers who prefer action over adventure epic battle sequences loaded with special effects are the highlight of the film the story centers on sarumans invasion of the human settlements of rohan with an army of unfathomable force driving the people to seek refuge in the fortress of helms deep one truly feels the loss suffered by these people and their desperation which leads them to enlist children to fight against the deadly and brutal army one of the greatest achievements of this war film is in delivering the horrors of battle and pathos for the fallen within the context of myth and fantasy    another spectacular achievement is the creation of gollum this is the most lifelike cgi character yet to be seen on film through a brilliant combination of acting animation and effects gollums interaction with frodo and others is completely convincing the character is so richly developed that he is at times frightening disgusting pitiful funny and even cute gollums role is central to the story and suggests that battles within ourselves may be just as formidable as any other    one could write seemingly to no end about the level of detail in the sets and costumes and the wonderful performances of each member of the cast if there are any flaws in this film they are truly small i was somewhat disappointed with the awkward depiction of the entsthe animated trees they were clumsy and lethargic and seemed to express senility more often than wisdom i am not sure what words tolkien used to describe these creatures but i hope to find out soon as i embark on my first reading of the trilogy this film has inspired me to return to tolkiens world i read the hobbit when i was young but never made it on to the lord of the rings    i eagerly await the third film in the series and should probably withhold judgement until the trilogy is complete but i cannot help imagining that upon viewing the completed work as a whole the lord of the rings will be considered one of the greatest films ever producedquite surpassing star wars the wizard of oz or anything else in my memory
Feb 21 2008,negative,i am sure it is a great film and does the book justice yadda yadda yaddabut i am not a fan of fantasy and never will be
