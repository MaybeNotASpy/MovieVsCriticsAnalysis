"Jul 24, 2023",positive," Synopsis: Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) peaceful and solitary existence gets upended when he encounters Rey (Daisy Ridley), a young woman who shows strong signs of the Force. Her desire to learn the ways of the Jedi forces Luke to make a decision that changes their lives forever. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) lead the First Order in an all-out assault against Leia (Carrie Fisher) and the Resistance for supremacy of the galaxy. I am an authentic fanboy of the Star Wars saga and I loved its return two years ago when The Force Awakens was released. Everything looked better, sounded better and the story certainly didn't disappoint me. So, obviously, I was extremely looking forward to The Last Jedi. Apparently, critics love Episode VIII but fans not so much. Me, well... I don't LOVE it, but I do enjoy it very much. I do think it is a bit below the previous film's overall quality since it definitely has some issues the first one did not. I am also confident that I know why the fans are not loving this movie and I will explain that after a few paragraphs. This time, I am going to start at the other side of the spectrum. I will begin my review with the film's problems because I do need to get them out of my mind, especially this one... The subplot involving Finn (John Boyega), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), and DJ (Benicio Del Toro), some of the few new characters added to the franchise, completely ruins the movie's pacing and its narrative is such a tremendous deviation from the main story. It is, by far, the worst issue I have with the screenplay because it does not work as one single problem... it creates a whole other set of them. The first act's pacing is really fast since it starts with tons of action sequences. However, the second act decreases the rhythm and it is more story-driven, full of mystery-unlocking and character-development scenes. Finn and Rose's nonsensical adventure just turns everything slower and even strange. It ends up needlessly extending the runtime (the film could have easily been 15min shorter) and worse... Possibly creating a love triangle with Rey (I am not even going to discuss this). Apart from this major issue(s), I have some minor problems. General Hux is a strong candidate to become the most annoying character in this new-generation trilogy. Gleeson is fine, he actually achieves a good over-the-top performance, but his character is just tumbling off the rails. Also, on a more technical aspect, the writing does not flow as well as it did on J.J. Abrams' screenplay. There are a lot more exposition scenes which also does not help the pacing at all. I wrote earlier about the fans' reasons for them to be disappointed and well, the marketing for the movie did not lie: they do take a lot of chances with this one.  Rian Johnson delivers a lot of twists and shocks throughout the whole runtime and it is impossible to assume that every single one of them is going to be mind-blowing and unanimously accepted. I do not want to give anything away from the plot, so I am just going to write that most of the choices and paths they choose for each character, I either simply accept them or I truly love them. As for the rest, I am, at most, underwhelmed (yet, I trust and understand the decisions they went with). People need to learn how to deal with their own expectations. If you expect something utterly absurd and nonsensical to occur and then it does not, you can't blame the film for not following your crazy idea. So, please, don't start blabbing any movie is bad or disappointing because it didn't fulfill your ridiculously high expectations. Even if they are grounded and thoughtful, you have to embrace the production's approach to the character/story. If it makes sense, then it is as valid as any other theory. It might be underwhelming if you have high expectations, but it is still a serious take on whatever you are thinking.  This is why I think fans are not loving The Last Jedi. The production takes a lot of risks and some of them don't work with everyone, mostly due to fans' radical theories that don't have a place in the film. I think most people might change their initial opinion after a second viewing, myself included. Some things just need more time to process or even a whole rewatch. Since I do not have time to do it before the year's end, I am going with what I have. Switching to the light side, I do enjoy this movie a lot. Every cast member that was great in Episode VII, transcends themselves in this one. Daisy Ridley is superb as Rey. She has such a massive range of expressions and I am sure her successful future as an actress is surely guaranteed. From the most emotional and somber moments to the most epic action scenes, she is awesome. Her character's mysterious backstory reaches a whole new extent and her interactions with Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker inflict chills all over my body. Mark Hamill's comeback can't be any more amazing than it is. He delivers a fantastic, emotion-full and very compelling performance. It is even more unbelievable knowing that Hamill had strong personal arguments against the director's interpretation of what was better for Luke. If he is this astounding working against his own idea of who his character really is, then I must praise his exemplary working principles. Luke and Rey spend a big chunk of the runtime training on an unknown island and I love every single second filmed on that piece of land. I have to admit that I am a bit frustrated because I think the film should have more time with these two, but due to the issues mentioned at the beginning of my review, the runtime can't be much more stretched. I love what they did with Luke, even if some fans are going to go insane with his journey. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren... The undoubtful star of the whole show. Driver is becoming a menace to every actor working today because he is flawless. He has a powerful, dark, mysterious, compelling, and commanding display as one of the most complex and multi-layered characters of the Star Wars saga. Ren's conflict inside his mind and heart is the most captivating feature of his story and his interactions with Rey are so jaw-dropping spectacular that I can't even describe them properly. John Boyega is once again great as Finn, even though he is part of that horrible subplot. Boyega delivers a convincing performance and Finn shines through some awesome action set pieces. Kelly Marie Tran is actually good as Rose, it is just a pity that her character suffers from the narrative, even though her backstory is pretty touching. Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and the Porgs, the new cute animals implemented in the Star Wars universe, have all the funny scenes plus some action here and there. Oscar Isaac is quite lucky because Poe Dameron unquestionably has the best subplot of the movie. Isaac offers a very passionate display as Poe goes through some significant character development. His impulsive instincts to attack the bad guys always have consequences and he is put in check by Leia during the whole time. It is a very interesting and twistful story that elevates the film's main plot. Carrie Fisher is elegant and beautiful as Leia, a character that has a lot more screentime than what I expected. I always love seeing Fisher on the screen and she makes everything a bit more realistic to me. Andy Serkis is remarkable as Supreme Leader Snoke, but his character is yet another plot's detail that fans are not going to appreciate so much. I still feel underwhelmed by Snoke in this movie for several reasons, but after some thinking, I do understand his role in the film and his moments are indeed intimidating and dominant. Rian Johnson's work as the director is better than his as the writer. The visuals effects continue to be wonderful and the practical settings are beautiful, once again, there is a lot less CGI than you probably think. Excellent cinematography and John Williams' score induces enormous levels of nostalgia and excitement. The action sequences are mind-blowing, the stunt work is phenomenal and there are tons of pure epic and awesome scenes. The main plot includes a very dark and mysterious side to it that I thoroughly love. A lot of unexpected twists and turns make The Last Jedi more original than The Force Awakens, even if one or two plot points might be underwhelming, and it also has a very well-balanced tone. Finally, a thrilling, breathtaking, action-heavy third act ends the film with magnificent glory and with many heartfelt moments. All in all, Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers something that I can be proud of experiencing. Terrific performances from the cast, but a flawlessly powerful display from Adam Driver as Kylo Ren steals the spotlight. Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while I find most of them truly jaw-dropping, a few left me underwhelmed. The main story keeps its obscure mystery while packing some jaw-dropping, epic action sequences, and excellent character-development scenes. Nevertheless, it departs from J.J.’s visual storytelling, delivering a more exposition-heavy screenplay and some pacing issues bring the movie down, largely due to the unnecessary detour of the subplot involving Finn and Rose. In the end, it still belongs to my top half of the saga, fighting for the 4th spot with Return Of The Jedi and Rogue One."
"Jan 9, 2023",positive," Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an emotionally-driven culmination of all that came before it and an adoring love letter to George Lucas.  In 2015, after a decade of lying dormant, the Star Wars franchise came roaring back to the cinema screens with Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It was a massive success upon release, breaking numerous box office records and getting met with nigh universal acclaim from fans and critics alike. And with that under their belt, Lucasfilm creatives turned their attention to its sequel, Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi. A bolder and infinitely more unique film that capitalized on the solid groundwork laid in the previous movie in massive ways, Johnson's The Last Jedi is a genuine masterpiece.   If The Force Awakens was the result of Abrams' professed love for 1977's A New Hope, then The Last Jedi is the result of Johnson's professed love for George Lucas as a filmmaker. The Force Awakens made a concentrated effort to keep the memories of Lucas' controversially received prequels at bay, deliberately harkening back to the aesthetic and narrative sensibilities of the original trilogy. Conversely, The Last Jedi embraces the entirety of Lucas' saga, Prequels very much included, as well as the films that inspired Lucas in the first place. Films like Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane and Michael Curtiz's Casablanca are just as much a part of the movie's visual grammar as Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers are, with Johnson finding the meaningful ties to these stories present in Lucas' work and elevating them to the forefront.   That is very much a recurring theme in Johnson's work. Despite what some particularly rabid corners of the internet might have viewers believe, The Last Jedi is actually a sublime sequel to The Force Awakens. It takes every development of The Force Awakens' story, from the introduction of new characters to the establishment of core beats like Luke's exile, in earnest and builds organically upon them. Characters like Hux and Snoke, who were little more than Abrams' surrogate Tarkin or Palpatine, respectively, are fleshed out into fully formed characters of their own. The previously plot-driving factor of Luke's exile on Ahch-To is also authentically interrogated and given character motivation and emotional resonance. None of this is Johnson rewriting or trampling over developments from The Force Awakens but rather the opposite, with The Last Jedi elevating these elements with startling clarity and retroactively strengthening Abrams' film.   And it is with this same adoration and articulate eye Johnson approaches the story of the Star Wars saga at large. The Last Jedi builds beautifully upon threads from previous films in a deeply affecting fashion. As Lucas famously said of Star Wars storytelling, ""it's like poetry, it rhymes,"" and Johnson demonstrates a profound understanding of this rhyming stanza. Luke's exile on Ahch-To is deliberately reminiscent of Yoda's exile on Dagobah, with both characters disappearing from the fight entirely in the aftermath of their own perceived failures. In Revenge of the Sith, one of Yoda's final lines is ""Into exile, I must go. Failed, I have"" after he lost his duel with Palpatine. Yoda feels his own hubris led to this destructive result, with nearly all of his students dying and the Jedi Order he oversaw crumbling before him. Luke's arc in The Last Jedi is a rhyme of all of this, down to blaming the death of his students on his own hubris.   But wonderfully, Johnson doesn't stop there. The stanza culminates with Yoda and Luke's conversation, in which Yoda says, ""the greatest teacher, failure is"" and ""we are what they grow beyond."" That moment brings 40-years-worth of storytelling to a head -- bringing Yoda's story from the Prequels full circle, providing an emotional epitaph to Luke and Yoda's relationship in the Original Trilogy and serving as a resolution of Luke's internal conflict across Force Awakens and Last Jedi, all in pure Lucas cinematic storytelling fashion.   The Last Jedi is full of meticulously constructed thematic threads like this that are immensely emotionally satisfying. Rey and Kylo Ren's relationship is a rhyme of Anakin and Padmé's, with Johnson and editor Bob Ducsay cutting their Force connection scenes to invoke both Anakin and Padmé's connection in Revenge of the Sith and Luke and Vader's Force connections at the end of The Empire Strikes Back. Finn, Rose and DJ donning First Order garb to infiltrate the Supremacy is also a rhyme of the original trio's infiltration of the Death Star in A New Hope, used to emotional effect in pointedly challenging Finn's beliefs by reimmersing him into the system of corrupt power. Even Kylo Ren revealing Rey's parentage to her is a rhyme of Vader doing the same to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back, and the reveal itself directly taps into the core thesis of the Joseph Campbell-penned works, which so heavily inspired Lucas.   One of the most impactful instances of this thematic rhyming scheme comes with Luke's final stand at the Battle of Crait. The entire theme of Lucas' A New Hope is that of technology versus spirituality. Luke is put squarely in the middle of this theological conflict, with Obi-Wan on one shoulder preaching the spirituality of the Force and Han Solo on the other telling him that ""hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster."" It culminates with the Death Star trench run, as Luke lets go of his conscious self and embraces spirituality, turning off the targeting computer and saving the Rebellion.   In The Last Jedi, the Battle of Crait comes down to the First Order's latest technological terror -- a siege cannon -- and the literal spirituality of Luke Skywalker. By Force projecting himself to Crait, Luke's spirituality saves the Resistance in an entirely pacifistic fashion. That not only sees Johnson bringing Luke's franchise-long arc full circle in an unexpected way, but it also sees Luke laying down his life to become an embodiment of the very ideology that the Jedi have sought across the entire saga: a true guardian of peace and justice.   Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is a miracle. It's a big-budget franchise movie that feels like a profoundly personal passion project. Lucas' mentor, Francis Ford Coppola, often spoke of making his ""one for them"" films be ""one for you"" by imbuing them with immense personal stakes, and that is a lesson Johnson has taken to heart. The Last Jedi is a deeply personal love letter to not just Star Wars but to George Lucas as a filmmaker, which internalizes the thematic works of all that came before it in the name of delivering an immensely satisfying culmination that builds upon all of it.  The biggest Jingle All the Way fan you know, Will Jones came onboard with CBR in 2022, after having previously worked at sites such as WhatCulture and BigShinyRobot. Parasyte: The Grey Season 1 has a war-ridden ending that focuses on Heidi, Su-in and Kang-woo trying to fend off aliens and Choi's pack of hunters."
"Aug 25, 2022",positive," The mammoth success of 2015’s “The Force Awakens” shouldn’t have surprised anyone. Star Wars fans had ten years of anticipation built up since the last movie and when Disney purchased the property from George Lucas they immediately began touting a new installment. Now just two years later (not counting last year’s stand-alone film) an incredible $450 million for the latest episode’s opening weekend indicates the fire hasn’t died down one bit. “The Last Jedi” is the eighth film in the series proper, the ninth Star Wars film overall. And while it has been intensely popular and profitable, the reactions have been all over the map. Some have heralded it “the best Star Wars film since Empire” while others are petitioning Disney to have it removed from canon. Regardless of where you land, everyone has to agree that “The Last Jedi” continues the franchise trend of epitomizing the ‘space opera’ concept. J.J. Abrams hands over the reins to Rian Johnson who both writes and directs episode VIII. Johnson has shown himself to be an intriguing filmmaker as evident by his movies “Brick” and the sci-fi mindbender “Looper”. But a Star Wars film is an entirely different animal, heavy with high expectations and an extremely passionate (and vocal) fanbase. Johnson’s story offers franchise fans plenty to smile at and just as much to chew on. Several scenes call back to the original trilogy and the inspiration is undeniable. “The Force Awakens” not so subtly but effectively followed the blueprint of 1977’s “A New Hope”. You could say Johnson’s film is a melding of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “The Return of the Jedi”. The structure of some scenes are so similar you can’t help but recognize it. But fear not, this is no ‘copy and paste’ rehash. Johnson has numerous fresh strokes and narrative angles that makes “The Last Jedi” feel completely of its own. Some of Johnson’s decisions have stoked the ire of certain fans, but he’s clearly trying to develop his own take on the universe. Because of this a couple of characters handed off by Abrams don’t quite get the attention. Is it because they don’t completely fit within Johnson’s vision? I’m not sure. “The Force Awakens” ends with Rey (Daisy Ridley) finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a remote island. Johnson drops his anchor and spends a lot of time on the island with Rey trying to convince Luke the Rebel Alliance needs him. She also seeks his help in understanding the Force and the powers she has discovered. But Luke has become a disillusioned hermit conflicted about his own legend and convinced the time of the Jedi has passed. Hamill’s performance may be his best yet and Ridley is such an asset. The two share several good scenes – some funny and some emotional. Elsewhere in the galaxy the young rebellion led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher) is forced to evacuate their base after Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the menacing First Order arrive. The pursuit that follows takes a big chunk of the film and includes the return of impetuous hot-shot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), former stormtrooper turned resistance superstar Finn (John Boyega), and droid-of-all-trades BB-8. Fisher brings out a whole new layer of humanity to Leia that’s hinted at in the previous film but truly realized in this performance (sadly her last following her recent passing). Speaking of new layers, Kylo Ren has several of them and Johnson has made him into the most intriguing character of the new series. “The Last Jedi” is the longest Star Wars film by a good 15 minutes and unfortunately you can tell. The first half has some big moments but it’s also a bit slow getting its footing. Johnson spends a tad too much time on the island only giving us baby steps of progression with Luke and Rey until finally getting in gear in the second half. The pursuit segment also has some stumbles particularly involving a side mission with Finn and a new character Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Aside from some pretty obvious logistical issues, their mission lacks energy and only exists because of a pointless story angle involving another new face Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern). She is without question the most poorly conceived character of the new trilogy. This mission also features a pretty bad CGI-heavy chase sequence that felt completely out of sync with the rest of the movie. At the same time there are many more things Johnson gets right especially in the second half where the intensity really amps up. I especially love the stress on characters and the personal bonds many of them share. And there is also the connections between the old and the new. I’ll be intentionally vague but this can be tricky ground for a filmmaker. Johnson nails it and none of these moments feel contrived or meaningless. Some had me wanting to cheer. Others brought tears to my eyes. The film also ends with an exhilarating final sequence that leaves the story in an interesting place, ready to be picked up in Episode IX. I can certainly understand fans having a lot of questions. I do myself. But that’s a big part of the fun when it comes to a Star Wars movie – wondering and speculating. “The Last Jedi” has some early pacing issues and a few things that simply don’t make sense. But it’s still a fantastic Star Wars experience filled with excitement, emotion and nostalgia. It also features a few of those truly great moments that franchise fans will forever link with this film. I know I won’t forget them and my inner fanboy is getting a bit giddy just thinking about them. This one will keep people talking for two years until the next episode.  I’m pretty sure not all the talk will be supportive.  Obviously the crazies will be out en masse,  with resentment and ridiculous demands.  I thought almost everything with Luke, Rey and Kilo Ren worked, everything else was hit or miss. I’ll need a to see it again to help me process. I am a diehard Star Wars fan but don’t agree with a lot of the outrage. Lots of the anger seems to be centered around the handling of Luke. I actually liked it and thought it added an interesting dynamic to that character. Almost tragic in a sense. And Mark Hamill really dives into it. My only gripes deal more with holes in logic and some early pacing issues. Otherwise it’s a fun installment. Seeing it again tonight, this time with the family. Interesting take on it. I never found any of the heroes to be cowards. I think the film does a good job relating genuine conflict within them. Thanks Brittani! Seeing it again in a few hours. Really anxious to see if my handful of gripes hold up. Because, like you, I like it more just thinking about it. I’m in the camp that really liked it as I don’t understand why people complain about the length.  I found it a bit refreshing as it wanted to take some risks in exploring themes and having characters embark on different adventures to see that there is so much about the galaxy that is complicated.  Especially as there’s an air of cynicism about war.  The casino sequence is excessive but I think that’s the point because it is this decadent world full of people who don’t really care about who wins or loses just as long as they make money out of this conflict.  I think this will be the most polarizing film for now as I’m sure the third will get fans more riled up.  At least it’s not the fucking prequels which insults you with a lot of heavy-handed ideas about politics and other kinds of bullshit. I have no issue with it being long. My issue was that I could tell it was. For me Luke and Rey spend too much time on the island. Several of their interactions in the first half do little to move their story forward. And I don’t mind stories branching out. I kinda like that. But aside from some logical gaps, I felt the whole Casino world mission was the weakest part of the film and it did no favors to the Finn character. And the excess of the ‘haves’ is a nice touch, but the glaringly obvious CGI space horses were too much for me.  Nice review Keith.  I really enjoyed The Last Jedi.  I liked The Force Awakens, but that film was essentially a remake of the original.  Although Last Jedi does cobble some parts from both Empire and Return of the Jedi, its plot feels more original than TFA and its ending more deserved.  I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment. Just got back from seeing it a second time. I still by my criticisms but I found them to be less of an issue. There are a couple of story questions I simply can’t reconcile (plotholes perhaps), but overall it is even better a second time through. I don’t hate it but I was a bit disappointed . I was not completely on board with the story of Luke at all . Having said that , Hamill acts with relish and saves it for me . I was frustrated with the Snoke story and the mystery we were led to believe from Awakens and then just tossed aside . Then Rey’s parents were just a bunch of addicts more or less . Ok , I can live with that but once again , I think there is clear continuity issues from Awakens . But it also appears that there really was no mapping out a basic 3 stage story arc and it’s flying by the seat of its pants .
Then the introduction of Rose was like why ? I didn’t find her compelling at all and the whole Casino scene seemed pointless and was cringeworthy during the stupid chase scene . I also was not pleased with the new Admiral justing showing up and I found her annoying. Her sacrifice meant nothing to me , it should have been Admiral Ackbar and would have given fans a hero we knew and felt something for , instead of just killing him off screen . Another scene I was like what , was Mary Poppins in space with Leia . Where I was sitting there were a few other fans that chuckled as well . Then that General Hux , was he like comic relief or what.
It was too long , some of the humor was dumb and poor Finn and Poe . Poe came across as an idiot and Finn was underused. Plus another irritant, could we not have had at least a memorial of some kind for Hans . I would have preferred that instead of the casino scene .
What saved the movie for me was Hamill , Driver and Ridley . All stellar performances. So my score runs like this 6 for the movie, 9 for the performances mentioned with an average of 7.5 . Thanks for the thoughts. TLJ definitely has a lot to unpack. Just a few things: I liked the Luke angle simply because it showed a deep scarred humanity to him. I like how it subverted expectations of him as legendary THE Jedi master. The Snoke story is a puzzling one. I’m not sure if Snoke simply doesn’t fit into Johnson’s vision. I do like how it propelled Kylo (who I think is the most compelling character in the new series). Also, I really like that Rey isn’t linked to Han, Luke, or Leia. I think having her parents who they are could have some serious impact. I liked Rose better the second time I saw the film. Not an exciting character though. And I absolutely agree about the Casino world chase scene. Ugh. Also agree about Laura Dern’s character just popping up and suddenly given command. It seemed completely out of the blue. I did appreciate her sacrifice, but 100% agree about Akhbar. Hasn’t he done enough to deserve command??? And How about this: Why didn’t the Admiral tell Poe about their plan? She kept it hidden from him which led to a mutiny. Think about it. If she had told Poe when he repeatedly asked about a plan Finn and Rose wouldn’t have sought a codebreaker, wouldn’t have met DJ, and wouldn’t have been betrayed. The transport ships could have made it to the planet. Also the mutiny slowed down the transport launch enabling the First Order to get the information and blow several transports out of the air. Anyway…I actually like Hux. I find him a punching bag but also a bit maniacal. I like the struggle between his militaristic vision and the Sith’s. Also as a Han guy I would have loved to see a little more of a tribute. The dice were a nice touch though. I think at the end of the day , this movie will leave many hardcore fans very unsatisfied . My problem with Hux is he felt like almost a different character than compared to Awakens  . The dice were a nice subtle touch but man , one of most iconics Star Wars and sci-fi characters and no a proper salute still gnaws at me . I really wanted to love  this movie but I really think Johnson could have introduced some new twist without deconstructing much of the mythology of Star Wars. I think this movie will end up tied with Revenge of the Sith in my Star Wars list  , the best of the prequels . I will say my excitement for  the next one has been dampened but wait and see JJ correct some of what I think were misfires by Johnson . It’s definitely been interesting watching the range of opinions. I did think about something. Wasn’t Akhbar killed in the incident that incapacitated Leia? That would explain why he wasn’t given command. It was a bummer that he was basically killed off-screen. I definitely agree that the movie was slow getting its footing. The A, B, and C plots were totally obvious and the C plot (Finn & Rose at the casino) was kindof pointless. Although I did think the film was remarkably shot and I truly appreciated the story. I enjoyed TFA more, but I think TLJ is a better film for its originality among other things. Great review! Thanks for the comments. I watched it a second time last night and found myself more impressed with what Johnson does. It does look incredible and those big moments are just fantastic. I still have the same frustrations after a second viewing but they aren’t quite as pronounced as before. Really like this installment. Oh that’s great. I need to watch it a second time before I write my review. You’re right about those big moments. The opening sequence was remarkable. I can’t wait to see what Abrams does for the last one.  Ohh I didn’t notice that. But that makes a lot of sense why that would be. I’ll look out for that in my second viewing.  Awesome review Keith, I feel you pretty much nail the head on ‘The Last Jedi’.  I’m supportive of some of the creative risks Johnson took (and that’s certainly needed in any long-running franchise) but part of me does feel that ‘The Force Awakens’ was stronger overall. There were some incredible visual treats but I’m with you on the pacing, it felt like there at times momentum was gathering only to be lost in the next moment – the Finn/Rose side mission didn’t help (glad someone else thought the CGI chase was a bit off).  Also, some of the humour felt forced and unnecessary (could this be the Disney effect? The same thing seems to bother me with the Marvel films), in the original trilogy those moments were actually funny and never felt out of place but not so much here. Thanks Chris! Definitely some pacing issues and some logic problems that I just couldn’t reconcile. Still a good installment. And I’ll give it credit, I did seem to enjoy it even more during my second viewing. I’ve heard that quite a lot, I likely won’t catch it again until the blu-ray release but it’s always encouraging to hear that a movie improves with subsequent viewings. What were your thoughts on the Luke treatment. It seems many people were upset at how he was written. Personally I liked it. It showed the humanity of Luke. And since Jedi are taught to suppress emotion, it makes sense for him to cut himself off from the force considering the deep emotional impact of what he faced. I too was fine with it Keith, we’d already had Luke’s journey as a hero in the original trilogy and I felt it was right to do something surprising and unexpected with him.  As you point out the way he was depicted in TLJ made him more human and relatable…even a Jedi can be fallible and have regrets. Much has been written concerning Lukes journey in this movie but the only thing that saves this whole thing for me was the force of Hamill’s performance. He comes across as coward, selfish and woe is me at the beginning. By cutting himself off from his sister , friends etc… more or less by running from the mess he made . Now Johnson has every right to take him there , its his story but for me it doesn’t fit right with the Luke of the past . I have zero issue with him being conflicted , guilt ridden etc.. but that whole story felt off . Hamill even felt so , although he has back tracked . But I will attempt going forward to stop thinking about it because the more I do sit around with other Star Wars fans , the more we begin to really pick it apart lol . But that is the passion of fans concerning anything I guess . That’s interesting. I never saw him as a coward or selfish. I saw as broken and disillusioned. I saw him as someone who was overwhelmed by the emotions of the situation he endured. And since the archaic Jedi system he had been taught in failed him, he cuts himself off from the force. I really liked the mental and emotional complexity he’s fighting.  I noticed one or two possible issues with the story when thinking about it later (one of which – Finn’s and Rose’s mission turning out to be pointless – I actually thought rather clever).  And I didn’t get why Admiral Holdo looked like someone out of The Hunger Games.  On the whole, though, I had very few issues with the film. For me the the entire Finn and Rose mission was completely pointless. It didn’t need to even happen. One reason it did happen (and another major issue I had) was Holdo. Her character made no sense to me whatsoever. Of all the times to suddenly feel you needed to teach Poe a lesson. Why on earth wouldn’t she tell him of their plan? I also wasn’t crazy about Leia pulling a Mary Poppins in space. Something about that didn’t click. The “Mary Poppins” bit didn’t entirely “click” with me either, although I didn’t really mind it too much.
I LOVED the Luke-Kylo Ren confrontation (Mark Hamill really threw himself into his role), and the direct the film shifts the franchise in."
"Mar 16, 2022",positive," Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi arrives with a measure of freedom, being disencumbered from the responsibility to restart the franchise that beset (and some would argue hampered) its breezy predecessor, director J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens. Rather than dwelling on nostalgia or trying to recreate our fond memories of the original trilogy with blatant parallels to George Lucas’ 1977 original, the new film carves out its own identity. In fact, that very notion finds a thematic strain in the narrative as several of the film’s characters place a distance between themselves and their earlier counterparts. In a key scene, the temperamental Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) destroys his helmet, which he crafted to echo that of Darth Vader, vowing to uncouple from the lingering associations between himself and those who came before him. A similar act of symbolic detachment is carried out by Rey (Daisy Ridley) after finally learning the truth about Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Indeed, while The Last Jedi is brimming with adventure and the spectacle of its swashbuckler-in-space roots, more importantly, it’s a sweeping melodrama that contains no end of deconstructionist ideas about what makes a hero, The Force, and the Jedi religion. For all of its revisionist thinking, inevitable comparisons will be made between The Last Jedi and The Empire Strikes Back, since this second entry in Disney’s new trilogy contains many of the same story elements that defined the second chapter of Lucas’ original trilogy: it expands on the mythology of the series in theatrical ways; the story breaks up the main characters for smaller, individual missions; the central hero trains on a far-away planet, under the tutelage of an old master; the young trainee sees herself in a quite literal dream; secondary characters engage in a more militaristic mission; a few shocking turns and double-crosses occur; and some familial revelations will surprise viewers. (Perhaps it goes without saying at this point, but many of the film’s most significant developments will be discussed in detail throughout this review. Consider yourself warned.) Regardless of The Last Jedi‘s structural similarities to The Empire Strikes Back, Rian Johnson—the first solitary writer-director to tackle a Star Wars film since Lucas was credited as the original’s sole writer-director—delivers a different kind of Star Wars film on purely formal and narrative terms. Having tested his hand in emotional, complex science-fiction with 2012’s superb time-travel mind-bender Looper, Johnson has gradually developed from a low-budget filmmaker (his breakthrough Brick, an inventive high-school noir from 2005, began a career that has continued to advance with every project) into a key player in Disney’s future Star Wars films (he has been commissioned to start an entirely new trilogy in this universe, independent from the tales involving Luke, Leia, Rey, and Kylo). Teaming with his longtime cinematographer Steve Yedlin, The Last Jedi looks like one of Johnson’s films, but it also looks like a Star Wars film, and perhaps that says something about his passion for the franchise. The film opens just after the events of The Force Awakens, as the Resistance, led by General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher), attempts to escape the clutches of the evil First Order. During the escape, hotheaded pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) goes against his orders by launching a small-scale attack that, when backed by the few remaining Resistance bombers, gets a lot of “rebel scum” killed. The Last Jedi alternates between the First Order’s pursuit of the Resistance and Rey training with Luke Skywalker. Rey has flown the Millennium Falcon to find Luke in seclusion on “the most unfindable place in the galaxy,” and Johnson makes excellent use of that stirring last shot of The Force Awakens, where Rey hands Luke his lightsaber, by turning the moment on its head. Luke has lost faith in The Force, and he proves a reluctant teacher. Meanwhile, the Resistance tries to evade capture in a protracted chase, as General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) has somehow found a way to track their convoy even after a hyperspace flight. Much of the second act drags and meanders, proving unnecessary to the plot. Low on fuel and locked in a high-speed chase, the Resistance convoy keeps the First Order at a relatively safe distance, but Leia is injured during the ongoing pursuit and replaced with the purple-coiffed Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern). With just a few desperate hours before they’re overtaken, Poe, unwilling to follow Holdo’s uncertain plans, concocts a ridiculous scheme to send Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), an impassioned rebel, to a casino planet to find a codebreaker. Once they secure the codebreaker, they can sneak onto the First Order’s ship and briefly disengage their ability to track through hyperspace. This curious detour to a galactic French Riviera halts the film’s forward momentum (it’s as though one of the passengers in John Ford’s Stagecoach took a horse from the coach and went on a separate mission). Worse, it ends up utterly pointless when their plan falls through and their stuttering codebreaker (Benicio Del Toro) double-crosses them. The Last Jedi‘s midsection may feel bogged down by a needless deviation, but the rousing finale contains several impressive scenes of action and lightsaber dueling. After learning about The Force from her disenchanted instructor—specifically, how the Jedi are hubris-ridden hypocrites to think they’re the only people entitled to wield a power that surrounds everyone and everything—Rey believes she can turn Kylo toward the light on her own. A psychic rapport has somehow formed between them across an expanse of light years, and they now have a conspicuous bond through telepathic conversations. She resolves to confront Kylo and, with his help, they destroy this film’s resident Emperor, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis, under a rubbery CGI motion-capture performance), during a breathless sequence. But this only emboldens and does not quell the monster inside of Kylo. Realizing she’s failed, Rey joins the Resistance for the final battle on a nearby planet coated with salt, which has a red soil underneath (a striking image reminiscent of Crimson Peak). Kylo leads the First Order against the last remaining Resistance fighters, and he faces Luke in a tense duel that recalls the last living moments of Obi-Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. Johnson’s screenplay results in a mind-wandering 152-minute runtime that sags in the middle (as suggested, everything involving the casino planet and Del Toro’s character proves inconsequential to the plot). Nonetheless, the writer-director incorporates revisionist ideas about the Jedi and Star Wars that go against what fans often celebrate about this franchise. His characters observe how the past and its traditions do not matter, despite the franchise’s ingrained mythology. Snoke remarks more than once that Kylo has failed to become the next Darth Vader, and perhaps out of his failure, perhaps after killing his father, Kylo resolves to “let the past die” and become his own man. Elsewhere, Rey hopes to find a living legend in the Jedi warrior Luke Skywalker, but instead, she finds a broken monk that has lost faith in his order. Finn and Rose learn that anyone can become a hero, no matter how insignifcant—and several characters learn this same lesson. When Rey discovers her decidedly modest lineage, combined with Luke’s skepticism toward Jedi precepts, it becomes evident that bloodlines do not make heroes; a person’s willingness to do what is good does. Johnson touches on themes that resonate in our present culture war, infusing The Last Jedi with an overt ideological perspective. Although hardly intentional given that Johnson’s script was finished before the 2017 election, the film opens in an age where controversial politics and nepotism go hand-in-hand, and associations cannot help be made between the Trump family takeover of Washington and the First Order’s leadership (thus making the Nazi parallels even more frightening). Johnson questions the authority of heritage, suggesting that The Force is something not exclusive to a noble few. Throughout multiple story threads, he remains critical of the super-rich and how they acquire their means, as well as those who jealously hold onto their power. Johnson’s film also calls for animal rights in a subplot on the casino planet, where Finn and Rose liberate large racing dogs; he condemns the eating of meat in a comical sequence wherein Chewbacca thinks twice before chowing on a birdlike Porg, a resignedly cute trifle; and he censures both slavery and child-labor as well. To be sure, this is the most political and socially reflective of all Star Wars films. Johnson’s formal approach is also revisionist, but fans may balk at alternative flourishes that threaten to betray the formal toolkit commonly used by filmmakers in this series and feel dissimilar from the standard formal model of a Star Wars film (though the usual swipes and transitions remain intact). Take how, during the initial Resistance escape, Rose’s sister Paige (Veronica Ngo) must release several bombs at the right moment. Johnson drops all diegetic sound and engages in slow-motion to heighten the tension, a familiar device in many other action films, but the tactic seems out of place in a Star Wars film. Johnson also plays with sound when he drops all audio except the dialogue in psychic conversations between Kylo and Rey. Similiar formal oddities appear throughout, making The Last Jedi feel less connected to other episodes in terms of its technique: Consider when Johnson interrupts the usual forward thrust of Star Wars films with a rare flashback. Or later, cinephiles may note that The Last Jedi is the first episode to make direct reference to another, non-Star Wars film. While other episodes draw inspiration from established films, the most obvious being Akira Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress (1958), none has been so bold as to borrow exact lines from Terry Gilliam’s Brazil (in a nod to the dreaded form, the “27B-6”). The Last Jedi alternates between material that either inspires celebration or feels strangely out of place, if not inconsistent or overly cutesy. Fortunately, there’s more of the former category. In the failing camp: the inclusion of (admittedly aww-inspiring) Porgs to sell stuffed animals and videogames; the slow-motion used throughout the film; toad-like nuns used for comic relief; the sudden disappearance of Han Solo’s charms in a universe where people, but not inanimate objects, fade into nothingness upon death; Leia’s return from the vacuum of space by way of her never-again-referenced use of The Force; and the frustrating reality that Snoke, and his horrible facial scars, will remain a villain devoid of any backstory. Obviously, most of these observations are mere quibbles. More triumphant are Driver, Ridley, and Hamill’s impassioned performances; the final lightsaber battle with Kylo and Rey; the continued energy of Boyega; and Johnson’s investment in his film’s thematic and political integrity. Whatever issues this review may have explored or nitpicked, The Last Jedi both honors and expands upon the mythology of Star Wars, while also providing the necessary, popcorn-munching escapism. The film even boasts some laugh-out-loud moments of wit and humor—the opener’s radio prank was hilarious, even if it seemed ill-suited for a Star Wars film (the misplaced meta-humor is a trend throughout the film). But Johnson’s film supplies the requisite spectacle that casual fans expect, while devoted enthusiasts have new, complex ideas to consider for the franchise’s future. The Last Jedi gives audiences much to think about; unfortunately, some of that thinking is done during the film, instead of after it. Even so, Johnson’s desire to push forward and alter the Star Wars universe in substantial ways remains brave and bold, making the film’s uneven pacing and few missteps negligible next to the sheer scope, acting prowess, and thematic ambitiousness of the episode."
"Feb 18, 2022",positive," Over the past hour, I have sat and contemplated where I even begin with the film I just saw. Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is without a doubt the most anticipated film of 2017 and will quite possibly be the most talked about of the year as well. Over the past two years, fans of Star Wars have been anticipating the direction of where their favorite characters were going. Thanks to writer and director Rian Johnson, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the most original, unique, and best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.  Without delving into any spoilers, The Last Jedi picks up after the events of 2015’s The Force Awakens, after a successful assault on the Starkiller base. General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and the resistance must now evacuate their current hideout before the First Order arrives at their base to eliminate them. Meanwhile, the end of Force Awakens showed Rey (Daisy Ridley) having found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who had been in hiding since Kylo-Ren’s turn to the dark side. As seen in the trailers, Rey hopes that Luke will not only train her but also assist in helping her understand why she is so strong with the Force and that he will give her an insight into her abilities that will assist her in her path to either the dark side or the light. The basis of the plot noted, The Last Jedi is a film that you must stop and think about after viewing it. A film that while the longest in the franchise’s history at 2 hours 32 minutes is quite possibly its fastest paced in its 40 years. From beginning to end, Rian Johnson lays out a plot that keeps fans at the edge of their seats. Usually, when glancing at my phone to look at the time, it’s because of the lack of entertainment value, however, this goes the other way around. This time, I glanced hoping there was still more time left in this magnificent film. Outside of The Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi may be the best overall performances by the ensemble in its film history. From the latest editions to the franchise, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis and John Boyega, to legends of the franchise, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill, The Last Jedi’s cast’s performances consistently maneuver from good to great. As a big fan of The Force Awakens and I for one failed to join the club of those that felt it was a rehash of A New Hope. That being said, while there were some callbacks to New Hope in Force Awakens, The Last Jedi’s only call back to Empire was its darker tone. Other than that, The Last Jedi goes in directions no one expected, and I for one absolutely loved every second of it. Those who were bitching and moaning on social media about the lack of originality in The Force Awakens have already taken to social media about this film saying it’s “not a Star Wars movie” along with citing its “weirdness” and I find that quite adorable. It truly shows that no matter what, there will plenty of “fans” that will always find something to complain about. A big bright spot for me was Lucasfilm and Disney having faith in Rian Johnson to not silence his vision. Directors tend to lose their voice in this big-budget franchise entries and instead of going the formulaic route, Johnson is given the keys the kingdom and while some find his vision, “weird and different,” my suggestion is to not be so close-minded and pick up Looper where Johnson’s brilliance is on full display. The future is bright for the Star Wars universe with Rian Johnson at the helm. As with every Star Wars film, The Last Jedi is a technical beauty. From its battles in space to its finale on Crait, the entire film continues the franchise’s recent streak of beautifully looking films. Visual effects, sound mixing, and editing Oscar nominations should be in the film’s future. Speaking of an Oscar nomination, John Williams should be in line for yet another nomination as he has done it again with his score for The Last Jedi. It’s brilliant. Another notch to an already sparkling resume to the greatest film composer of all time. In reading other critics reviews of this film, most are not fans of the side story between Finn and Rose. While considered filler, I did not find it as distracting as most. The Force Awakens had a similar “filler” scene with Han and Chewey and their smuggling adventures when first meeting Rey and Finn. However, Finn and Rose’s story had a purpose to the eventual end game of the film, therefore, it did not harm the film in my eyes. Finally, we have come to the Porgs. I am happy to report that they are not the Jar Jar Binks of the new trilogy. Quite frankly, they are in just enough to stay adorable and become a fan favorite among the kids. Star Wars: The Last Jedi was everything I hoped for and more. While rating it just a few hours after leaving the theater would be quite irresponsible on my part, the film is certainly the best in the franchise since The Empire Strikes Back and its twists and turns are quite frankly some of the best in the Star Wars lore."
"Dec 29, 2021",positive," The best thing sequels have going for them are that a lot of the heavy-lifting has been done. They’re free from establishing characters and winning over the audience. The Last Jedi takes full advantage of its sequel status and delivers a follow-up to The Force Awakens that expands upon that film’s characters and stories in exciting and frankly shocking ways. Writer/director Rian Johnson deserves immense praise for taking big, bold moves with the narrative that feel subversive without being disingenuous to the story that’s come before. It’s a masterful balancing act in giving the audience what they want — a rousing adventure with compelling and fun characters — while simultaneously giving the audience what they need: a story that doesn’t adhere to predictability in order to please the widest possible audience. But even then, Johnson delivers the crowd-pleasing action, endearing humor, and epic scope fans want out of Star Wars. Freed from the more reverent and fetishistic tendencies of J.J. Abrams, Johnson’s filmmaking style feels more like a natural evolution of the original trilogy than The Force Awakens. He still nails the grandiose moments like Abrams does, but he reserves being showy for moments that count. And boy, are there moments that count in The Last Jedi. There are striking story beats that, while they do echo The Empire Strikes Back and even Return of the Jedi, manage to twist those familiar bits into twists that had me reeling backward into my seat. The Last Jedi goes places that feel like the end of a saga rather than a middle entry. That actually helps make everything feel momentous and impacting. Instead of pulling punches for later entries, Johnson’s script holds nothing back and it pays off in enormous ways. There is also a real sense of darkness and complication at the heart of The Last Jedi. This film explores the sacrifice of war in a personal way that Rogue One didn’t quite understand. Instead of drenching itself in griminess and a surface desire to muddy the moral waters like Rogue One did, The Last Jedi lets its complexities and dilemmas come naturally from the characters instead of the larger plot. This also helps make some of the jaw-dropping moments hit harder. I won’t spoil any of the big stuff but I will say that as someone who considers Luke Skywalker one of his favorite fictional characters, this movie more than makes up for his absence in The Force Awakens. Luke’s arc in The Last Jedi is fraught with regret and despair, and it’s great to see Mark Hamill return to the character with a new angle with which to play him. It leads to some of Luke’s best moments in the entire series. If I had one significant complaint, it’s that the movie is a bit overlong. There are some deviations the story has to take that feel like they could be trimmed without losing a whole lot of necessary plot points or character progression. This is especially true of the section where Finn and Rose visit Canto Bight. I dug this part for some cute bits and the plethora of alien species, but it is the only part of the movie that starts to feel a tad sluggish. It’s the best of the new wave of Star Wars films by far, encapsulating everything that’s great about Star Wars as a story: hope, friendship, rebellion, conflict, and sacrifice. Without feeling like the $200 million dollar fan films that we’ve recently gotten, Rian Johnson has given us a Star Wars film that actually is a genuine evolution of the series in style, narrative, and emotion. Never before have I been as excited to see where Star Wars will go next. Oh, and you know that brand new trilogy Rian Johnson is working on? Just give him all the Star Wars. Just do it. Disney, if you’re listening, give Rian Star Wars. Please? Thanks."
"Sep 9, 2021",positive," A line delivered to heroine Rey by cosmic curmudgeon Luke Skywalker, and a stark piece of advice to anyone who thinks Star Wars: The Last Jedi will bend to their total will. Writer-director Rian Johnson delivers, through and through, a spirited Star Wars film, as Star Wars-y as Star Wars can be, but this one’s got a rebellious streak that separates it from any other LucasFilm picture that came before it. Following the grander steps of The Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi throws a brick through the glass house of expectations built after the fervor of The Force Awakens. Whereas that film was a fantastic piece of fan service, The Last Jedi simultaneously feeds the birds and finds new, unexpected ground to fight on. Johnson has always relished the art of subversion, and The Last Jedi is not spared his delight in disassembly. This is how you honor what’s come before: by carefully setting the stage, and blowing it all up to smithereens, Death Star style. In the rubble, new life can grow. To discuss the plot beyond the murkiest abstract should land anyone in a force chokehold, so just know that everything picks up right where J.J. Abrams left it two years ago. From there, Johnson stops and starts with no warning of when things will slow down, or when they'll go from lull to lightspeed. It’s that playfulness in the pacing, along with Johnson’s willingness to take the story in bold directions, that makes every little twist and turn so unexpected and refreshing. Mark Hamill, who’s back after his Force Awakens cameo, digs his feet into the mud to portray a Luke we really haven’t seen before. He brings some real anger and weariness to the table, a far cry from the aw-shucksy Jedi apprentice from the original trilogy. He’s a grump with gravitas, and Hamill’s is the best performance in this Jedi revival so far — though the delightful Daisy Ridley and austere Adam Driver give him a run for his money. What's more, after a calendar year of watching and waiting for the next worst moment to pop up on our Twitter timelines, The Last Jedi also stands for something we could all use a little more of: hope. Moment in and moment out, Johnson’s film finds ways to inspire, and teach, in these times of tumult. As a sensational Star Wars vehicle and a pensive reminder of ideals for any age, The Last Jedi holds its lightsaber high — a beacon for what these films can be, and what they can impart."
"Aug 24, 2021",positive," Watching “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” was bittersweet knowing the death of Carrie Fisher means that, after this film, Princess Leia will never grace the big screen again. The character of Leia has always been the one to hold onto hope, even in the most desperate times. She does so again in “The Last Jedi.” I felt the thrill of being in a full movie theater as the previews ended and the lights went dim. A hush settled in the room before the first strains of John Williams’ famous music erupted and the familiar scroll began to roll slowly up the screen. After the success of “The Force Awakens,” “The Last Jedi” has a lot of expectations to fulfill and it does so with just the right mix of gravitas and humor. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a story that begins right where “The Force Awakens” left off. Even after the destruction of Starkiller Base, the First Order has fought the Rebellion to the point of extinction. What’s left of the rebels is led by the exquisite General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). Together with her people, she’s trying to figure out how to overcome the power of the First Order, led by the pasty-faced slimeball, General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and directed by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis in another CGI role). Meanwhile, on the island in the middle of nowhere, Rey (Daisy Ridley) tries to talk Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) into coming back to help the faltering rebellion and discovers that she has a weird connection with Kylo Ren (and appropriately brooding Adam Driver). Two new characters grace the story this time around. Kelly Marie Tran plays Rose Tico, a talented rebel mechanic who teams up with Finn (John Boyega) on a mission that will, hopefully, enable the rebels to live long enough to fight another day. She starts off as an overexcited fan-girl of Finn’s but embraces her mission with determination. Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo, decked out in an amazing dress, steps into an unexpected leadership position and has to deal with hothead pilot, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who seeks permission for his crazy plans. Rian Johnson brings freshness and originality to “The Last Jedi.” While there are enough references to the Star Wars mythology to satisfy life-long fans, the film sets off in its own direction that will ultimately lead to the next chapter in Episode Nine. The interplay between good and evil, the dark and the light, takes on a number of different forms in “The Last Jedi.” There are internal struggles, temptations to be overcome, sacrifices to be made. In the face of the evil of the First Order, the remnant of the rebels still have hope that the light will come out on top. It may not look like it right now but as long as there are people to hold onto the light the darkness will never overcome it.

"Aug 24, 2021",positive," The Force Awakens was a fine re-entry into the world of Star Wars, even as the film seemed to be a beat-for-beat copy of A New Hope. But while The Last Jedi is definitely reminiscent of The Empire Strikes Back (particularly in its training scenes) and Return of the Jedi (in a scene I won’t spoil), this finally feels like a filmmaker putting his stamp on the series. Rian Johnson has been one of the best American filmmakers of the last decade-plus. He’s also the last of the class that had to make a few indie and modestly budgeted features before getting called up to the big leagues. But his three features prior to this – the high school noir Brick, the caper comedy The Brothers Bloom and the sci-fi thriller Looper – were all special in their own ways, but with a focus on excellent writing that both served the story and subverted our expectations. And while The Last Jedi absolutely does that, it has one thing Johnson’s movies never had before: bloat. At two-and-a-half hours, this is the longest Star Wars movie to date. And while the emotional stakes of the story as it plays out supports that scope, its pacing makes it feel at least 30 minutes too long. The story, such as it is, is basically one long chase: the rebels are on the run from the First Order, trying to find a planet where they can hole up and send a distress signal. Meanwhile, Rey is still trying to convince Luke Skywalker to train her and also return to fight the new incarnation of the Empire. “This isn’t going to turn out the way you think,” he tells Rey at one point. And for the most part, he’s right. The Last Jedi is as much into de-mythologizing the Force as it is relishing in its fantastic fight choreography and intergalactic dogfights. One of my issues with The Force Awakens was that I never bought the scenes of emotional weight. There was never enough context to believe Kylo Ren’s struggle in particular. That problem has been taken care of here, as the battle for his soul is placed front and center, with brief but crucial backstory filled in. The same goes for Rey, whose past has been the subject of countless speculation and Reddit threads. The answers here are both simpler and more complex than all that guessing. Blockbusters comparing themselves to classic films is nothing new, but the film I was most reminded of during The Last Jedi was The Dark Knight. Both films are willing to kill off major characters (for actual emotional resonance and not just for shock value), both films let trustworthy characters obscure the truth for a larger purpose, both films are probably too long and might have been better served by putting their last 30 minutes into a third film. But both films also have endless possibilities for where the series can go from here. Let’s just hope Episode IX ends better than The Dark Knight Rises."
"Jul 28, 2021",positive," AUSTIN, Texas—It may come with resources you can’t find anywhere else, but helming a Star Wars film is no walk in the park. To start, it involves sky-high expectations, continent-spanning production schedules, and perhaps unrivaled levels of fan obsession (including possible Russian social accounts lobbying for General Hux to live, seriously). The House of Mouse now also looms over everything, inevitably demanding a certain box office bottom line. That’s a daunting task for even the most established of Hollywood creators—but it’s especially herculean for a relatively unknown filmmaker. And that evidently made Rian Johnson’s intergalactic debut with The Last Jedi the perfect opportunity for a full-length behind-the-scenes documentary, The Director and the Jedi. ""I’m the newbie—every department head has done a movie of this size before,"" Johnson says as he sets the stakes early in the film. ""[Producer] Ram [Bergman] and I are the outsiders who have infiltrated. With every decision, I’m laying down my chips in front of these great poker players and trusting just a little tingle in my stomach. It’s terrifying."" Johnson, Bergman, Mark Hamill, and documentarian Anthony Wonkie came to the South by Southwest conference to present the world premiere of this unprecedented look at the Lucasfilm methods. And during the post-screening Q&A, Johnson told the crowd he was inspired to agree to it due to his own childhood fandoms. ""There was an amazing [Return of the] Jedi thing about the creature work on Jabba’s palace, and that had a great impact on me,"" he said. ""And the doc on Magnolia, the Paul Thomas Anderson film… I love docs that really get you into the process rather than promoting the end result."" The Director and The Jedi probably won’t be technically meaty enough to similarly inspire the next generation of blockbuster filmmakers—it runs for roughly one hour and 45 minutes, but the film jumps between many topics. And though we get glimpses of life with the costuming, stunt, production design, VFX, and creature departments, this new documentary has other stories in mind. Among them: the scope of a production like this must be seen to believe—120 sets, 100-plus days of filming, but budgets that can't quite fit every single desired drone and UNESCO heritage site set location (""Take Rogue One and The Force Awakens, put ‘em together, this is double in size,"" says creature supervisor Neal Scanlan). Newcomers like Johnson and Bergman or Kelly Marie Tran (Rose) have entered into this hallowed and established universe with unorthodox ideas (a casino in Star Wars?!) for the franchise's traditionalists. And as the title may imply, the dynamic between the new creator and the old star has its own heroes' journey to progress through before opening night. The documentary might have been better served by selecting the most compelling of those subplots, editing down closer to the hour mark, and maintaining a narrower but deeper focus. Ultimately it does the opposite. Still, this new documentary does have merit beyond opening up new marketing and revenue opportunities for Lucasfilm. In particular, somehow this film about the new era of Star Wars feels like a fitting send-off for the series’ pioneers. There aren’t many franchises around where the central characters (and the actors behind them) still participate beyond mere cameos some 40 years after debut. But it’s yet another unique aspect that makes a Star Wars film a big ask of any director. Take Hamill as evidence. ""When I called, I said, ‘I’ll do it [the new trilogy], and I have two requests,"" the actor recalled during the Q&A. ""I don’t want a cameo, and I want a real trilogy role."" Even though Harrison Ford is obviously not involved, The Director and The Jedi acts as a nice postscript farewell to many of the original Star Wars icons. The film reveals that more than 100 individuals auditioned for the voice of C3PO in the new trilogy, for instance, but none felt right and thus Anthony Daniels came out of retirement. And while many of the VFX folks anticipated Yoda would be done via CGI this go-round, the emotion necessary in that character’s Last Jedi reunion with Luke Skywalker meant coaxing Frank Oz back to set. The puppet itself may have been new, but the ILM team even created this version by first acquiring the original wooden model molds and building from there. Kathleen Kennedy appears on screen a handful of times, too. And though we never see him, George Lucas’ presence is certainly felt. Early on, we see the beginning stages of script trials as Johnson invites Hamill and Daisy Ridley to read in a living room at Pinewood Studios. Later in that very sequence, someone breaks into the room with a message for the new director. Some of the best parts of The Director and The Jedi come from Johnson exploring the old Star Wars world as if he were merely a kid in a candyst… err, as if he’s a kid on the set of a freakin’ Star Wars shoot. When he meets Oz, Johnson asks to try on the Yoda puppet and lets out what we learn is his signature giggle of joy. When he sees the new creatures Neal Scanlan and team bring to life, Johnson can’t hide his enthusiasm, either. Given that he grew up with some of these films, it’s no wonder the director came prepared with as defined opinions on sea cow bellies as he does Kylo Ren’s scar makeup. ""When you’re a little kid, the Jedi, and the myth of the Clone Wars, and the mysticism of Yoda—that connects to something within you,"" Johnson told the SXSW audience. ""That makes it scary coming into this, but I can’t imagine [making a film] without that—if you don’t take the Force, the Jedi, and Luke Skywalker seriously, then what’s the next step in this?"" Perhaps Johnson’s reverence for the franchise comes across best in this documentary’s most human scenes. It’s perhaps no surprise to any longtime Star Wars fans that the most genuine on-screen emotion happens when Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill get involved. On the tension front, Hamill’s initially blunt frustration with The Last Jedi’s new direction for Luke may be the only real conflict within the entire documentary. ""My character always represented hope and optimism, and here I am pessimistic and disillusioned and sort of demoralized,"" Hamill says. ""I told him, ‘I fundamentally disagree with this concept and how you use this character, but I’ll do everything in my power to fulfill your vision.’ This character doesn’t belong to me, they just let me rent him out. So no matter how it comes out, if it’s wonderful, it’s because of him. If I’m horrible, it’s also his fault."" (The majority of the post-show Q&A stayed on the relationship between Hamill and Johnson, given that the documentary leaves audiences wanting more of that dynamic. The most recent film’s title literally comes from Johnson’s new Luke Skywalker direction, after all, and one of the best moments in this doc comes when the director reveals his title idea to Hamill for the first time.) As carefully curated as you'd expect this Disney-approved documentary to be, Carrie Fisher both shares and elicits what seems like the doc’s few truly moving moments. We see her interacting with Ridley and Laura Dern, younger actors approaching Fisher with reverence both on and off screen. And moments later when the first lady of this franchise is asked how Johnson is fitting into the director’s seat and handling the canon, she doesn’t hesitate to flash the personality fans have grown to adore. ""He’s an asshole,"" she quips, prepping the insightful compliment to come. ""Rian has a very specific vision, but he’s not like that when you first meet him. He doesn’t have a dominating effect, he has a dominating vision."" The off camera mechanics behind The Last Jedi's Leia-Luke reunion are later explored, speaking to that Johnson vision that combines reverence with new energy. It was the lone documentary moment where it felt like the entire audience silently caught themselves welling up. ""The movie wasn’t meant as a goodbye,"" Johnson notes. ""But hopefully there are a lot of scenes that will give people… scenes that will feel good to see."" For diehard fans of the Star Wars franchise, The Last Jedi, or Johnson's work in particular, The Director and The Jedi qualifies as must-see. You may not get all the process you want, but you’ll leave with a sense of Johnson’s persona behind the camera and his particular approach to the unique challenge presented to him with The Last Jedi. For everyone else, you'll probably enjoy the experience, too—just know you’ll likely glance at your phone or second screen a few times. The Last Jedi this is not. But it’s more than that film’s Blu-ray extras, too. The Director and The Jedi is set for wide release on June 27... naturally, as a behind-the-scenes featurette on the Last Jedi video release. No information on additional screenings is available at this time."
"Apr 29, 2021",positive," Fun as it was, The Force Awakens was Star Wars by the book. It replayed the plot of A New Hope, with enough tweaks and loveable new characters to come off as affectionate homage rather than big ol’ rip-off. It was a safe but highly successful reintroduction to the galaxy. The Last Jedi blasts the rule book to pieces, sending the Skywalker saga in unexpected directions. Not all its risks pay off, but its biggest wins outdo anything in the previous film. For fans, there are many, many moments that will leave you cheering or weeping, possibly both at once. After a feature-length tease, Jedi brings Luke (Mark Hamill) to the fore. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is trying to cajole him into training her in the ways of the force, but Luke is resistant, after his failure with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Hamill slides back into his defining role like he’s never been away: angry, funny and still with traces of the whiny farm-boy. He gets to shine in a way he never did when he was in Han Solo’s shadow. Elsewhere, Leia is leading the dwindling Resistance, which is rapidly being picked off by the First Order. As a goodbye to Leia, director Rian Johnson does the late Carrie Fisher proud. She’s wise, quiet leader and occasional action hero. One of her final scenes is the most emotional in the entire series. It’s not a neat end to the character, or the one deserved, but a respectful farewell. The one story strand that doesn’t land is that with new character Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a plucky engineer. Tran is terrific, but she’s stranded in a dreary side-plot with Finn (John Boyega) on a casino planet, which has the stale whiff of the prequels. The flatness of those scenes is not enough to derail an otherwise thrilling instalment. Rian Johnson conjures astonishing space battles, fills his script with genuinely excellent jokes and has deepened the characters significantly (special mention to Adam Driver, who has helped make Kylo Ren the series MVP). With all the surprises here, we’ve honestly no idea how this trilogy will conclude, but the wait to find out is already too long."
"Feb 16, 2021",positive," That line, spouted in pained fashion by Luke Skywalker, stood out in the intriguing trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It felt like more than a suggestion from Disney aka LucasFilm aka director Rian Johnson that the second film in the newest Star Wars trilogy would not follow a familiar template, as many have accused its predecessor The Force Awakens of doing. Luke’s words would turn out to bear fruit in a film which feels both like the box office shattering ultimate expression of Hollywood blockbuster it no doubt will be, and at the same time something wilfully subversive. Johnson started with small beginnings, with a precise and almost poetic low-budget modern noir, and you can still feel the pull of a director who wants to do things his way. Doing things your way as a creative force on a series like Star Wars is no mean feat. Despite how Marvel have dominated the cinematic landscape in the last decade, Star Wars has no equal in terms of scope, scale and fan anticipation. When Disney bought the franchise from George Lucas in 2012 with the intention of relaunching the saga, it was the biggest news in filmmaking for many years. Considering it was originally just three space fantasy movies, and subsequently three maligned and ill-judged prequels from Lucas, the fact Star Wars as an entity has never left the public imagination or consciousness speaks to its power. Not everyone loves it, but those who do understand Star Wars has a special alchemy no other franchise can boast. The Last Jedi is Rian Johnson asserting himself in striking fashion, with a script and story which determine to rip up the Star Wars rule book and potentially set the franchise in a bold new direction, while still honouring what came before. The fact producer Kathleen Kennedy and those at LucasFilm loved Johnson’s take so much that he has now been gifted his own unique Star Wars trilogy to devise—not just film, trilogy—shows they too are keen for Star Wars to spread its wings and embrace the future.  The Last Jedi doesn’t entirely detach from the mythological themes and fantasy tropes Lucas’ movies, and indeed The Force Awakens, played with – but it feels like the start of a brave new world. Star Wars, at its heart, has always been a metaphysical, philosophical story about contrasting, balancing forces waging within the human soul, represented by the iconic idea of the ‘Force’.  It’s why the universe may be filled with strange alien lifeforms and reliable droids, but the spiritual conflict has always been with characters who look and sound very human, despite Star Wars taking place long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away. George Lucas originally rooted this battle in Judeo-Christian terminology, with characters such as Luke discussing villainous father Darth Vader in terms such as “there is still *good* in him”. Come the 2000’s and the prequels, Lucas was attempting to convert the metaphysics into a level of ‘magic science’, with terms such as midichlorians and the like. Come The Force Awakens, when an older Leia is discussing her wayward son Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo, her description from the pen of JJ Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan is “there is still *light* in him”. Good and evil become light and dark, the Old Testament becomes a far more philosophical Buddhist concept of duality and spiritual dichotomy. Star Wars’ approach, therefore, to the underpinning religious constructs inside its world and mythology have evolved over the last forty years, changing to edge away from a harder line delineation of philosophical ideals to a depiction of the Force more in line with Far Eastern ideas of body and soul. This feels important to The Last Jedi because Johnson truly attempts to explore just what the Force means, where Lucas felt more inclined to try and explain what it *is* in his prequels. Johnson’s message very much seems to indicate ‘the Force is whatever you want it to be’, and, crucially, it’s for whoever you want it to be. This feels at odds with Lucas’ central messages within his original trilogy and especially the prequels, whereby Anakin’s Skywalker’s Lucifer-like fall from the heavenly Jedi chorus was framed in concepts of destiny, as if his transformation into Vader had long been pre-ordained. The Force, whether good or evil or light or dark, was for a Chosen few. The biggest thing Johnson does is call bullshit on that higher order idea – Star Wars is done playing with prophecy. Johnson actualises this through Rey, our erstwhile female protagonist. She grated a touch in The Force Awakens; an earnest, tomboy stray who did little except run around like a headless chicken and emote quite expressively. Daisy Ridley isn’t exactly an award-winning player in the making but Johnson’s script gives her more heft by grounding her on Ahch-To island, and developing the two key relationships central to her in the film – her dynamic with Kylo and her dynamic with Luke. What Johnson does, and one wonders if this was a change in direction from Abrams’ vision, is take away the very idea Rey is ‘special’ and has a destiny, by pulling the ultimate flanker: her parents, set up as mysterious abandoners in the previous film, were nobody, when we all expected them to be somebody. Here’s the rub, and the central key to The Last Jedi – you don’t have to be anyone in order to be someone. It doesn’t matter if Rey’s parents weren’t Jedi or Sith or gifted of some powerful history or destiny. Kylo throws this back in her face when he lands the revelation on her about her family (which she already deep down knew), suggesting “you’re not part of this story”. Johnson almost reaches out here from behind the lens and shouts – “IT DOESN’T MATTER!”. Lucas’ original tale was all about a special, gifted, destined family with a Royal, entitled lineage who provided balance to the Force, both light and dark, but Rey breaks that cycle. She is just a girl from a nowhere planet and nowhere parents who happens to be one with the Force. Star Wars can’t be the same after this evolution. Having the Force be accessible and open, free of destiny or Royalty or even the Jedi Order, opens up a mountain of possibilities. This is what Luke comes to understand through a character arc which carefully avoids him becoming Obi-Wan Kenobi, which he so obviously could have been. R2-D2 showing him the original “help me Obi-Wan…” hologram of Leia from A New Hope as he sits inside the Millennium Falcon underscores this very point – Luke may be old, may rock a beard, may have gone into hiding in a cave after watching the Jedi almost destroyed around him, but he isn’t guarding or protecting anyone, waiting for the new saviour to emerge. Luke begins this film fundamentally convinced there is no hope. Luke’s nihilism, born out of Ben Solo’s fall to the Dark Side and the destruction of Luke’s attempt to re-create the Jedi Order, is taken further by Johnson than you suspect Abrams, and definitely Lucas, ever would have dreamed. Johnson’s open, egalitarian world where the Force could be in anyone is a world where characters are encouraged to reject history and reject myth. Many fans had heard Luke was seeking a Jedi Temple and almost everyone expected The Last Jedi to see Luke uncover Jedi secrets or arcane knowledge that would help save the day – almost nobody would have expected Luke, with the help of Yoda no less, to burn that knowledge and those secrets to the ground and extinguish the Jedi of the past. Doing this was perhaps the film’s bravest choice. Bear in mind just how much the Jedi religion and idea has become an iconic piece of pop culture and, to an extent, has grown beyond Star Wars itself. People don’t dress up as random Sith Lords, but they do dress up as Jedi Knights. In the UK, on a religious census, Jedi was written by so many people as their denomination that the government had to officially recognise it, passing the required 100,000 signatures. We’re talking about a fictional code which if not practiced by film fans, and children, the world over, is certainly revered and honoured by millions. The word Jedi would be known to almost everyone in Western society, irrespective of whether they know Star Wars well or not. To fundamentally change the paradigm of how the Jedi work is a striking move. Luke spells this out when lecturing Rey in why the Jedi need to die, reminding her it was their hubris and arrogance which allowed Darth Sidious to turn the Republic into an Empire, and subsequently see the extermination of much of the Jedi Order. While this is Luke to a sizeable degree abrogating Sidious and Vader of responsibility in the choices they made (and it all does come down to choice), his point is given context and clarity by Yoda: the Jedi doesn’t have to exist in the form it did for millennia in order to survive. Much like the Star Wars franchise itself, the Jedi can themselves evolve in purpose and form, and this plays greatly into Johnson’s other major level of commentary: sociological class in the Star Wars universe. A tonally jarring sequence it may be, and perhaps an indication of one of Johnson’s weaknesses as a filmmaker (his own Looper has the same problem), but Finn and Rose’s sojourn to the Canto Bight casino and races planet reveals the major schism and dichotomy which has always existed in the Star Wars universe but Johnson writs large – the lower and upper classes which make up the galactic framework. Rose seems like a needless additional character but her purpose is abject; her essential skills are the final expression of a crucial part of the Resistance and fight against tyranny, despite her coming from nothing (much like Rey). She was one of the servants and slaves who feed the rich gamblers and dilettantes which fill Canto Bight, people who became rich off the First Order’s rise to power. This too has to be a pointed level of allegory in Johnson’s writing, which is interesting as Star Wars doesn’t often tend to stray too heavily into an allegorical framework of storytelling, much as Lucas apparently read the original 1977 movie as an indictment against Vietnam, with the United States as the evil Empire. The commentary here is clear – the 1% of super wealthy are serving a dark, fascist, tyrannical force who want to be the ultimate boot in the face of the little people. By giving the Force back to this underclass, the Rebellion of the original trilogy and the Resistance of the sequel trilogy are framed in a new context: the Revolution. Johnson’s final shot, of a young, impoverished child looking up at the stars, wearing a Resistance sigil and holding his broom like a lightsaber after hearing stories about Luke and the Jedi sells it: the Force is with everyone, and woe betide a fascist dictatorship who underestimate them. Naturally you can apply the iconography and visual style of the First Order with the Nazi Party (Abrams made this very clear in The Force Awakens) but is Johnson making quite pointed parallels to the modern Republican government and the increasingly fascist direction of Donald Trump’s Presidency? Possibly. Not pointedly, but the inference is certainly there. The fact those young children are telling stories, too, is crucial, because it reframes the myth and legend Johnson’s script is keen to snuff out, or at least redefine without the historical names and touchstones characters in the Star Wars universe, and fans outside of it, are used to. Johnson clearly sees legends in a different way to Abrams. The latter feels they’re important and venerates them – you only have to look at Rey’s excitement when she first meets Han Solo in The Force Awakens, and the hushed tones of myth when Luke is referred to. This is exactly how we, the audience, consider these characters and The Force Awakens indulged our euphoria at being in their presence once more. The first thing Luke does when we meet him in The Last Jedi is disdainfully toss away the lightsaber which itself became legend – the lightsaber that fought Vader, which cut off Luke’s hand in The Empire Strikes Back. To all of us, its a symbol. It was almost the McGuffin of The Force Awakens. Johnson tosses it away like its nothing, like its a falsehood. Legends are earned, not simply made and set in stone. Kylo Ren certainly comes to understand this, and quite early on. It’s telling how Johnson has him destroy the very mask he created to try and emulate his grandfather Vader. That was a visual piece of original series iconography in The Force Awakens, Abrams’ honouring the legend of Vader, but when Supreme Leader Snoke mocks him for wearing it, Kylo destroys it and never wears a mask again. His central, inner conflict across The Last Jedi is no longer about trying to be Vader, it’s deciding where his destiny lies. Kylo believes himself part of the Skywalker path he mocks Rey for not being part of, but he’s choosing to repeat the cycle of the original trilogy. He chooses not to blow up Leia, or kill Snoke instead of Rey. That choice wasn’t the same for Vader when a very similar situation played out in Return of the Jedi. The Emperor actively wanted Luke to kill his father to ‘complete his training’, in no small part because part of him undoubtedly knew Vader could be more powerful than even him. Snoke doesn’t consider Kylo in the same terms. He thinks him weak and feeble for much of this, and doesn’t even countenance the possibility he could be bested. Johnson sets up an Episode IX which explores the concept Return of the Jedi never could – what if Vader had chosen to kill his master and become Emperor, instead of dying regretting his dark path? Kylo actively chooses this path, even if he doesn’t choose the direction. Indeed Kylo is as keen to redefine everything as Luke is. Remember how he asks Rey to join him, but not in the same way Vader asks Luke to join him in Empire. Vader wanted to continue the Empire, wanted to reaffirm the status quo as a family, hereditary, honoured, Royal destiny, but Kylo wants to let it all burn – not just the Jedi but the Order. He wants Rey to join him and start again, redefine what the Dark Side could mean. Johnson doesn’t even use the words ‘Dark Side’ across his script, another rejection of the previous terminology and tropes which define the Star Wars universe. Sides aren’t as clearly defined in The Last Jedi. There is room for manoeuvre. Kylo almost becomes the new Supreme Leader by sheer happenstance, once he puts General Hux in his place. Story therefore is key to The Last Jedi, and how it inverts what we expect from Star Wars. Indeed there’s a clear level of self-mockery going on with quite how Star Wars tells its narrative; how Johnson plays Hux as a fascist buffoon for comedy is telling, from Poe Dameron’s early joke about not being able to connect, and a wonderful moment when Hux shouts an order again that Kylo has just given – there’s a wonderful glance by Kylo as if to say ‘I just said that, what are you doing?’. This subverts the very earnest way Admirals and Commanders, often with cut glass British accents, would repeat and deliver orders in the original trilogy, often thanks to Lucas’ quite ripe dialogue. Johnson seems to understand the silliness inherent in Star Wars while honouring and revelling in everything about it. The Last Jedi could well end up being the most polarising Star Wars film ever made. It’s a touch too long, has tonal problems, feels like it has two distinct endings rather than just one, and it lacks the sheer joie de vivre of The Force Awakens, but intentionally so. It’s the middle part of a story where the heroes take a severe beating at the hands of a seemingly unstoppable, un-defeatable force, to an even greater degree than they do in The Empire Strikes Back; this is a Resistance taken to the absolute brink of destruction and saved only by the power of the Force let loose from the restraints of the Jedi. There are plenty of moments of levity, nods and winks to previous films, and lots of loveable droids and cuddly alien creatures (hello Porgs!), but The Last Jedi by default has to be a story where victory and resolution is far from the characters’ grasp. Where it will divide opinion is just how it approaches the Star Wars universe, attempting to redefine and reconstitute some of the key, central concepts which have made the franchise and the mythology ingrained within such a revered success for forty years. Rian Johnson’s film will potentially reward repeat viewing in a way certainly The Force Awakens doesn’t, and The Last Jedi leaves a returning JJ Abrams with some oddly big shoes to fill, because his successor has changed the very manner in which the Star Wars universe considers itself. "
"Jan 27, 2021",positive," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- In the run-up to this week's mammoth release of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" director Rian Johnson and company have been selling fans an idea that the latest film in the saga is unexpected, unpredictable and unlike any other episode that came before it. ""The Last Jedi"" is at once a thrilling space adventure and an emotional roller coaster of a film with just the right amount of nostalgia thrown in. It's simultaneously dark and funny with more twists and turns than a ride aboard the Millennium Falcon. Clocking in at two and a half hours, ""The Last Jedi"" is a dense film, full of characters scattered across the galaxy and put through the wringer. There's a lot to get to. The action begins with the evil First Order in pursuit of the freedom-fighting, depleted Resistence, but the film really gets off the ground when the story shifts to the island planet Ahch-To and the moment where ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" left off. Fans have been waiting for two years to see what Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) does when Rey (Daisy Ridley), a girl strong with the Force but a mystery to him, presents him with his old lightsaber. This clearly isn't the same Luke we last saw in 1983's ""Return of the Jedi."" The confident, wise, legendary hero of the Rebellion is gone, lost and replaced by a broken shell of the man he once was, a failure in his own eyes for not stopping his nephew, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), from turning to the Dark Side. Get over the fact that, yep, that's Mark Hamill(!) up on the screen as Luke Skywalker once again, and you'll find a skilled actor channeling his inner Shakespeare in a performance that is tortured and inspired. He's a relunctant Yoda to Rey's aspiring Jedi, an experiment that doesn't go all that well. Leave it to an old friend (no spoilers here) to set him straight. If Skywalker is at the emotional center of the film, Rey and Kylo Ren serve to deliver its underlying message of letting go of the past in order to find yourself. The two have developed a connection since we saw them last. She calls him ""Ben"" and helps him deal with the death of his father, Han Solo. He knows stuff about her parents. Is their bond strong enough for one of them to turn? That is answered, rather compellingly, in a jaw-dropping sequence highlighted by one of the coolest lightsaber fights you've ever seen. Indeed, this is not going to go the way you think. In their scenes together, Ridley and Driver fully inhabit their characters, who refreshingly aren't the classic archetypes of good and evil we're used to seeing. Ridley's Rey is strong, compassionate, determined, optimistic and, yet, temptable. Driver's Kylo Ren is as complex as he is conflicted, that ever elusive villain with nuance you just might find yourself rooting for. His performance is that good. That's not to say it all works. While Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) are given plenty to do, their stories don't really go anywhere. Lingering questions about the evil Snoke (Andy Serikis) are left unanswered. In her final appeance as Leia, Carrie Fisher is largely kept on the sidelines and some fans might even find one of her early scenes to be, frankly, ridiculous. If Domhnall Gleeson's performance as General Hux was any hammier, you could serve it at Thanksgving. The film's new additions, namely Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern and Benicio del Toro, carve out their places in the galaxy far, far away just fine. The standout is Tran, whose plucky mechanic Rose steals every scene she's in. Among the non-humans, you might cringe at the first sight of a Porg, that is, until Chewbacca tries to eat one and then you'll fall in love with the furry little creatures. BB-8 is so cute and resourceful here, the round mound of the rebellion might as well be an Ewok. Threepio is, well, Threepio. R2-D2 gets a moment to shine for old time's sake. By contrast, the film's final showdown is undecidedly unrestrained, one that forces you, in the famous words of Darth Vader, to search your feelings. Once again, the ragtag group of Rebels finds itself facing incredible odds against the heavily armed forces of evil. Their battle is as exhilarating and epic as anything we've seen in a ""Star Wars"" movie. But, as it tends to happen in these films, ""The Last Jedi"" comes down to a lightsaber duel. But, trust, you haven't seen one like this before as Johnson delivers the goods with an ending that is surprising, satisfying and even hopeful-- one that is sure to make even the most stoic fanboy shed a tear or two or twenty.

"Dec 5, 2020",positive," upreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his First Order minions, commanded by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), continue to take military control over more and more planets. Their only real opposition is the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who faces dwindling numbers of soldiers and ships, as well as nonstop confrontations against an enemy of vastly superior strength. As Hux’s fleet steadily closes in on its prey, Resistance heroes Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), along with newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), devise a precarious plot to evade their First Order pursuers. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley), a strong-willed orphan powerful in the Force, locates long-missing Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), hoping to persuade him to both train her and aid in the Resistance’s plight. But after his previous failure with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a former student who turned to the Dark Side, the reclusive tutor becomes insistent on not repeating his mistakes with Rey. When the rebellious young girl discovers an unnerving connection to the Dark Jedi, she determines to face Ren once again, even if it means surrendering to Snoke himself. “The Last Jedi” begins like “The Empire Strikes Back,” before quickly turning into “Return of the Jedi.” It’s surely purposeful for this latest chapter to pay homage to its predecessors, but there’s a limit to the nods, which shouldn’t be surpassed, for fear that it succumbs to the main criticism of “The Force Awakens”: that it’s essentially a remake. But writer/director Rian Johnson doesn’t seem too concerned. In order to fuel the nostalgia factor to an extreme degree, the film opts to recreate many familiar storylines and scenarios from the original trilogy, forgetting that the world is so expansive that it wouldn’t take much to concoct something entirely new. Instead, a disgruntled Luke exists in seclusion on his own equivalent to Dagobah, and must train a fresh apprentice as if to become a less mischievous version of Yoda; a rebel base is evacuated as enemy ships prepare to wipe it out (a sequence that boasts substantial comedy, which feels unnatural); elephant-shaped tanks slowly saunter across a bleached battlefield; and yet another iteration of Mos Eisley’s tavern of decadence furnishes strange creatures and odder aliens. The first two-thirds of “The Last Jedi” focuses heavily on old routines. Trivial side missions are derived spontaneously to give certain sets of characters extra adventures – and to draw out an already long running time. In fact, one of the major components of the film is a slow-speed chase, which is so lengthy that it allows numerous other mini-stories to play out to their conclusions (including a hunt for a codebreaker, preparations for abandoning the fleet, and Rey’s Jedi training) – all before a dreadnaught warship finally catches up to the cruiser it was pursuing. Much of this picture involves space battles, which, while exciting in the moment, has very little lasting power. They also contribute to an overwhelming number of close-calls – ones designed to drag battles out to the last second, where tensions can build with ample manipulation. When plot lines choose to follow this course, they generate a sense of blind luck; most of the rebels are unable to accomplish their tasks, perhaps due to poor planning or trusting in the wrong allies, but they rarely perish in logical ways. Martyrdom tends to save them all, even when luck falters. “There’s still conflict in him!” Numerous lines are delivered with strained sincerity, especially as a subplot to find the remaining strands of good left in Ben Solo – and to turn him to the Light Side – begins to resemble “Return of the Jedi” a bit too much. Adding to that comparison is Snoke, an elderly, robed, wrinkled, lightning-spewing, inexplicably evil entity. Who exactly is he supposed to be? Zero answers were given in “The Force Awakens,” and this follow-up remains comparably tightlipped – pointlessly. His involvement and storyline are indicative of too many creative visions continually altering or revising key concepts. But despite the vagaries and vagueness and repetition, the visuals are stunning: new spaceship designs are appropriately menacing; special royal guards in shiny red armor wield lightsaber-like weaponry; and a mining facility sits on crimson dirt, blanketed by glowing white salt. Countless other sequences, brimming with explosions and action and computer-animated monstrosities, will remind viewers that the “Star Wars” franchise has few limitations when it comes to visual effects. At the end of it all, “The Last Jedi” is still a middle chapter (which means that it doesn’t tell a complete story and leaves many questions unanswered), but a few major surprises and some jaw-dropping showdowns are thoroughly entertaining – especially for audiences who aren’t too caught up in the series’ insistence on revisiting so many recognizable themes and ideas.

"Sep 24, 2020",positive," It wasn't anything but Star Wars. There wasn't any such thing as A New Hope. In my 12-year-old mind, I wasn't entertaining any notion that this amazing universe unfolding before my eyes would have sequels or become a years-long saga.  I was a 12-year-old boy, an outcast in virtually every area of my life. I was a young boy with a disability and Star Wars, in some weird way, gave me a place where I felt like I belonged.  I loved everything about Star Wars. I loved the heart and soul of these relationships between Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, R2-D2, C3PO, Darth Vader and all the others. I loved the adventure. I loved the humor. Heck, I was only 12-years-old but I even loved the incredibly chaste romance.  The same was true, maybe even more true, for The Empire Strikes Back, which has long been my favorite amongst the Star Wars films though I'm certainly far from alone in that opinion. While what we now call A New Hope started it all, The Empire Strikes Back is the film that truly made me fall in love with this universe and these characters and their stories. After The Empire Strikes Back, these Star Wars films became more than just a couple hours of escape to me - they became, in ways I'm not even sure I can explain, a way of life.  I thought about all of these things as I sat back in my seat and became enveloped in the worlds manifested in Rian Johnson's latest of the Star Wars entries, The Last Jedi.  While The Force Awakens brought the series back from the brink of prequel devastation, The Last Jedi brings back the heart and soul of Star Wars in ways I'd feared impossible and in ways that took me back to those days when I was an absolutely enthralled 12-year-old staring up at the movie screen imagining myself immersed in these remarkable worlds.  This is not to say that Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is a flawless film. It's not a flawless film, but if not flawless it's a near cinematic masterpiece that should have, I'd dare say will have, audiences falling in love all over again with Star Wars and these new adventures and adventurers and the ways in which Rian Johnson has masterfully incorporated faithfulness to the film's legacy with a unique vision that is woven into the fabric of the Star Wars universe to near perfection.  The challenge, and I'm trying desperately here, is to share my immense joy with the film without providing spoilers along the way because, indeed, there isn't a scene that unfolds here that I wish to give away. I want you to experience it for yourself.  The Last Jedi offers something for everyone in its increasingly complex and shaded portrayals of Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega), its reverence for Luke (Mark Hamill), its respectful yet somewhat slight embrace of the now deceased Carrie Fisher as Leia, or simply the ways in which Johnson has found to create action sequences that are familiar yet fresh. Tasked with finding life within this middle film within a trilogy, Johnson has done more than bridge two book-ends. He has created an adventure that ripples throughout the universe while adding in a few of his own flourishing touches.  There are certain story threads of The Last Jedi, especially those connected to how The Force Awakens unfolded and ended that are simply brilliant in the ways in which they add layers to the existing universe. It is much to his credit that Johnson has found ways to both honor that connectivity while adding layers to it and characters that are no longer simply black-and white but several shades of gray.  Despite having achieved near superstardom in Star Wars, there's a reason that Mark Hamill's film career never came close to achieving the heights of Fisher or Ford. The truth is he was always the weaker actor, a charming kid who never stopped playing a charming kid until he was finally too old to play a charming kid. It's damn near miraculous what Johnson has pulled out of Hamill here, a melancholy and soulful performance that emotionally resonates and feels like it belongs here. He has attained the status of legend here, yet it's a status he doesn't want from a life he's long since left behind. How this all plays out between he and Rey is beautiful to behold on this tiny island where he has secluded himself amidst the lively, inspired creatures we've come to know and love from the Star Wars universe.  Of course, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is back. He's scarred now, a physical memory left over from his epic The Force Awakens battle with Rey and he's still the same ragingly immature young man who is both a conflicted villain and a dastardly one who feels and acts even more evil here. Paired up with General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), it feels inevitable that his evil will grow and that somehow he and Rey will deal with one another again and again.  There are others, of course. Poe (Oscar Isaac) is relentless in his efforts to go face-to-face with his enemies, while newcomer Laura Dern shines as Vice-Admiral Amilyn Holdo. Finn finds himself teamed up with Rose, a rebel engineer played expertly by Kelly Marie Tran as the two embark on a code-breaking mission that looks familiar yet has been designed impeccably.  Benicio Del Toro is here, as well, in a relatively brief appearance and the film features many of the others familiar within the Star Wars universe and more than a few pleasant surprises along the way.  At 152 minutes, The Last Jedi goes on for a bit too long and tries to tell us too many stories but these truly are minor quibbles for a film that is relentlessly captivating, magnificently produced and utterly immersive from beginning to end. Johnson has not only mastered Abrams' return to technical precision, but he's also embraced the heart, the humor, the depth, and the hope that we all felt when all of this began in 1977.  Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi may not be a flawless film, but it's amazingly close to everything that I wanted it to be. With strong, layered and more authentic performances from its ensemble cast and a universe that will make you feel like it's a place where you belong, The Last Jedi becomes one of the most satisfying Star Wars films to date, perhaps second only to The Empire Strikes Back, and a film that will make you want to watch it again and again and again. "
"Aug 26, 2020",positive," It may not be the greatest Star Wars film ever.  That mantle still resides with The Empire Strikes Back and naturally it will take time (preferably a second watch) to see how this film will rank overall.  However, Star Wars: The Last Jedi might be the most significant in the franchise’s history. The last major release of the year and The Last Jedi is a milestone release for a few reasons.  The most obvious of course is that it follows on from the highly enjoyable The Force Awakens.  Director Rian Johnson receives that challenging baton to pick up the where the story left off.  But in the larger context, 2017 has brought back the art in films where directors have used the medium to deliver unconventional films that have gone against audience expectations and taken us out of our comfort zone.  We’ve seen it in Logan, Dunkirk, Blade Runner 2049, War for the Planet of the Apes, Baby Driver, Wonder Woman, Get Out and Detroit. The Last Jedi naturally belongs on that list.  To paraphrase Obi Wan in A New Hope – this was not the Star Wars film you was looking for. The Last Jedi is far from perfect.  No film is.  Does the runtime feel a little excessive?  Yes.  The ending felt a little tact on when it already had a natural resolve and could have been saved for the next film.  Could the pacing been a bit better?  Yes.  Are there a few OTT moments which are cheesy?  Yes.  Is it clunky at times?  Yes.  Could some elements of the story been handled better to give it some tonal consistency?  Absolutely. For all the love I have for The Force Awakens, it’s hard not to see the obvious connections to A New Hope.  That is not a criticism but a common observation.  As mentioned in my review, The Force Awakens uses A New Hope as a guidance to shape the new trilogy.  It is specifically designed and constructed to introduce the next generation of strong characters in Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Kylo (Adam Driver) and Poe (Oscar Isaac).  But The Force Awakens is steeped in heavy nostalgia, reminding the audience why they fell in love with the franchise as if we magically became children again.  Seeing familiar things like the Millennium Falcon, the droids and all the familiar faces from that universe are the equivalent of buying and listening to a greatest hits compilation.  Again, not a criticism but it helps build a context for The Last Jedi because it is the stonewall opposite of that. The dangerous thing about nostalgia is that it can eventually become predictable and safe because of the lack of engaging challenges or fresh new stories for its audience.  It’s the surreal sense of deja vu and like comfort food it relies on the same clichés and tropes to tell a story that remains within that unadventurous status quo.  Rogue One largely suffered in that respect.  It sadly doesn’t hold up after repeated viewings because of the high level of distracting fan service and not enough character development to flesh out a real and genuine purpose for the rebels to fight against the Empire.  The film was clunky, saved only by the incredible battle on Scarif.  We’ve already seen in other franchises such as Alien, Pirates of the Caribbean and Terminator on how tired that repetitive formula can be. For franchises to have a chance at survival, they eventually need to evolve.  Otherwise, they stagnate or in the worse case scenario, die as a consequence. However rough around the edges this film was (and possibly could have done with another written draft), if The Force Awakens showcased that original, nostalgic innocence where it was allowed to be fun and energetic, then The Last Jedi is arguably the most layered, adult and grown up Star Wars film ever made. That is one of the most surprising elements.  Star Wars is meant to be a rapturous feeling of childhood excitement, fist-pumping hype and expectation but The Last Jedi delivers something unexpected.  This is a film that took a risk with the Star Wars mythology by challenging those sacred and conceived notions.  As controversial and upsetting this may sound for die-hard fans, but The Last Jedi doesn’t deliver on fan pleasing moments, revelations or cliffhangers (both in the cinematic fashion or literal fashion with Luke in The Force Awakens) just to satisfy an audience.  This is a film that was bold enough to make a challenging statement to propel the franchise into uncharted territory where you have no idea what is going to happen next. Given the amount of fan theories and in-depth discussions that developed in between the new films, it’s a nice feeling to be suddenly kept on your toes and freed from the compartmentalized beliefs.  Because ultimately that was the danger with Episode 8, long before the famous “A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away,” faded on-screen.  Maintain the status quo and accusations of a lack of originality would have been fierce.  We would have been back to square one in questioning the repetitive direction.  But from a cinematic experience, who would want to go to a cinema and already know the outcome of the film? At the heart of it, The Last Jedi is more of a character driven movie which again is another welcomed surprise.  Similar to what Twin Peaks: The Return did, the more The Last Jedi is analysed, the more it serves as a brilliant running commentary about the legacy of franchises and how we interact with them.  We’re all guilty of it.  There’s always an element of hero-worship where characters become a source of inspiration and motivation.  We put them on a higher plane where we can look up and believe.  It also creates a celebrity head canon and culture defined by our own fantastical expectations.  Yet similar to Denis Villeneuve‘s Blade Runner 2049, The Last Jedi cleverly dissects the idea of the hero complex by subverting the traditional story construct we’re use to.  It embraces a nuance that is explored not as simplistically as good versus evil, but something far more complex, blurred and in-between.  What writer and director Rian Johnson achieves are characters which are more human, grounded and real. It’s not done in a disrespectful way.  The classic and faithful homages are present and acknowledged.  There are emotional scenes which recognise the symbolic connection of the journey started forty years ago.  But The Last Jedi also rips up the rule book on what was done before to journey into the beyond.  That aspect of The Last Jedi was the most liberating. How often do you see a Star Wars film where the rebels are really up against it and on its last knees?  Suddenly you slowly find yourself watching a bleak situation and the opening battle is one of the best moments in the film.  It’s not to say that this aspect wasn’t explored before in previous films but The Last Jedi gave us something more visually in-depth instead of the 2D characterisations that Rogue One or the prequel trilogy suffered from at times.  It’s the exploration of the human struggle, the sacrifices and the highly charged conflicts that rose out of those battles.  As the tide kept on turning, the weaponry for the fight back becomes limited as if the First Order are Apple to the Rebels’ Windows 95.  Our heroes are under severe pressure and there’s a consequence to these actions.  That’s what kept the film interesting and emotionally dramatic.  Suddenly you felt an endearing care for characters because of their own personal story arc.  Like a cross-generation divide between the old and the new, everybody eventually learns and develops from their actions to become better leaders. That speaks true of Rey and Kylo Ren.  Their parallel story involves abandonment and trying to find a belonging in this vast universe.  In a seminal way, they’re both looking for acceptance from their surrogate “fathers” which naturally plays along with the standardise thinking of the light and the dark side.  But in the particular case of Kylo, arguably one of the best, well-rounded villains created for the new trilogy, his desperate emulation to be Darth Vader 2.0 is ridiculed as a childish exercise by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis).  The emotional conflict that resides between the two characters is their ultimate desire to live up to their influential legends and The Last Jedi becomes the realisation that they are stronger than what they think they expect of themselves.  There’s a beautiful line which sums up that evolving trajectory – “We are what they grow beyond.” But it’s also how the film deals with the old guard.  We see General Leia (the late, great Carrie Fisher), vulnerable and scared of the consequences as she counts up the losses.  Luke Skywalker (a brilliant performance by Mark Hamill) is not the clean-cut hero you thought he was.  He’s tired, old, frustrated and a recluse.  Whilst that may split the opinion of the fan base, the positive argument that is established makes him more human.  Time has become a factor and the galaxy has changed, allowing these characters to grow.  We get to see them in a new light, faults and all.  It may go against reason but it also allows characters to escape that bubble and redefine who they are on a path to a peaceful redemption.  It’s different but it is a positive different. But the best of that improved characterisation is how it moves away from a singular ‘you are our only hope’ perspective to a collective ideology.  Again nothing new in the Star Wars world but it’s always pined its hopes on characters bringing balance to the force – the chosen one.  Yet the turmoil has previously ended the same way with the balance ushering in a fascist, totalitarian and autocratic power.  Nobody does the battle alone like a God like saviour and it’s how Johnson found that aspect of the story to tell a distinction between the past and its upcoming future. Rian Johnson excels in showcasing a visual poetry.  J.J. Abrams started this trend in The Force Awakens, freeing the camera from the static nature from the original to a barrel-rolling effect, making us feel we’re right in the thick of the battles.  But for The Last Jedi, the visual storyline is all about the emotional impact, directly connected with the choices made by characters.  Johnson intentionally slows down the action and cuts the sound as if there was a vacuum in space and it removed all the air.  On hindsight it may have contributed to the slow pacing of the film but to see this subtle effect is new for the franchise, reinforcing that mood of action equals consequence.  On the planet Crait, the “blood in the sand” effect acts as a psychological reaffirmation of war and its sacrificial nature, without showing actual blood on-screen.  Every soldier is like a dead person walking towards an impending doom.  The visuals also extends to the production sets which are beautiful, in particular Snoke’s red room and his guards. Through the visuals, director Rian Johnson finds the time to explore the political aspect of The Last Jedi.  Star Wars has always been political with arguably the prequel trilogy closely mirroring today’s world of right-wing nationalism rising up through a democratic society.  But in The Last Jedi, the First Order is made fun of and Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux comes through as the best of how seriously he believes in The First Order and how others mock him.  Again it contributes to the pacing of the film but introducing Canto Bight also highlights the dividing difference between the wealthy rich and the slave poor and the blurred lines that has a direct relevance with the world today. The Star Wars universe is vast with so many potential stories to tell.  The Last Jedi met my expectations because it was an attempt for the franchise to do something different that most blockbuster films struggle with.  It had the audacity in its attempt to break the mould and break out of a repeating cycle that had become far too familiar and predictable.  This is not The Empire Strikes Back in the franchise but a progressive move forward to shape its own new legend and that recognition and understanding will take time.  It’s hard to see what path Star Wars will take knowing that this is the second film in the saga.  But it will be interesting to see how J.J. Abrams will complete, shape and refine those changes for the untitled Episode 9. It will be during this time when people will look back on The Last Jedi not with a petition loving hatred but with an appreciation for the risk taken in the first place.  That should be congratulated regardless. Excellent review! You have captured it perfectly. I thought this was an exciting and risky film, and I commend Disney for being gutsy enough to break away from the expected narrative and risk angering fans. I too believe that when some currently angry fans look back (especially after IX) they’ll like this film more than they do now. It has a few flaws (although these bothered me less on second viewing) but it is a powerful film that really moves the characters forward. Portraying Luke as a broken man opened the door for Mark Hamill to give us a more nuanced performance, and I loved that this movie did not go the way I thought it would. My greatest fear is that Disney will over-respond to the backlash and create a “safer” film for Episode IX. I really don’t want that. I want them to keep pushing the Star Wars universe in new directions. Financially was never going to be a problem with Disney and the Star Wars franchise but the fan backlash can still have an impact on Episode 9 and the other potential risks they may want to do with the franchise.  I don’t think it will happen but anything is possible."
"Jul 23, 2020",negative,"In terms of directing, The Last Jedi shines. In terms of storytelling, it meshes together a lot of elements that have so much potential, but that potential is left untapped."
"Jul 17, 2020",positive," Ever since A New Hope was released in 1977, every Star Wars film followed the same basic formula: operatic space battles between good and evil, with a central character being pulled in both directions, whose final choice could decide the fate of all. From the original trilogy, to the prequel trilogy, and now with this latest iteration, the different variations haven’t moved all that far away from the basic outline. Why is that? Because the outline works. This is a proven equation with generations of fans and financial profits as evidence. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it, right? That’s the feeling I get when I watched Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017). On the surface, this is a slickly made production, helmed by writer/director Rian Johnson. Everything that you’ve come to expect from the franchise is here, bridging the past with the present much better than the last entry, The Force Awakens (2015). Where The Force Awakens relied heavily on fan service and nostalgia as a crouch (almost to detrimental ends), The Last Jedi attempts to use the past merely as a stepping-stone to build its own identity. Even the inclusion of mainstays Luke (Mark Hamill) and Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) isn’t for simple cameos – they play relevant factors into the narrative. But let’s be honest with ourselves. Just as the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the Bond series has to maintain a certain brand type, so does the Star Wars universe. A New Hope (and perhaps more so with The Empire Strikes Back (1980)) was revolutionary in blockbuster storytelling. The Force Awakens and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) felt like they needed to stick to the script. At the very least, Johnson was able to make The Last Jedi feel as much of a “Rian Johnson film” as well as a “Star Wars film.” This is much looser than past entries, taking twists and turns that may or may not work for audiences. But the fact that it took those risks is worth admiration. The plot is split into three different sections, taking place almost immediately after the events of The Force Awakens. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) along with General Leia, lead the small remaining fleet of Resistance fighters as they try to escape The First Order, headed by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). While that’s happening, Finn (John Boyega) – whose development from the last film I will not get into – teams up with new comer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) – in an attempt to help the Resistance escape. And finally, Rey (Daisy Ridley) spends the majority of her time on an isolated planet with Luke, begging for his tutelage and to help the Resistance’s cause. While Rey has been set up to be the key figure of this current storyline, Kylo Ren has emerged to be the most interesting character. Just as Luke was torn between the light and the dark side, Kylo Ren also has conflicting emotions on where his morality stands. He sits right on the fence, where his admiration of Darth Vader and the power of The First Order contrast with the goodness in him calling out. He and Luke share similar emotional arcs – where Luke was on the side of good but was tempted by evil, Kylo Ren initially starts off in darkness and is tempted by the light. The choices he makes often appear hypocritical, but I don’t necessarily see that as a detriment, but more as the actions of a person who is at war with himself. I don’t know if Kylo Ren being the most fully realized character so far is a good thing, given that Rey is thought to be the central character of this trilogy. An issue is that her back story was first shrouded in mystery, with one of the biggest question marks being who her parents are. The fact that we haven’t learned much of her – at least up to this film – makes it a little more difficult to connect to her than to Kylo Ren. Sure, she wants to find meaning to her life and her place in the universe, but those are very broad motivations. Take the interactions she has with Luke. Where Rey goes there to learn and find purpose, it’s Luke who comes out of it as the more developed character. This isn’t just because Luke has been around longer; he has a concrete arc here that takes him from one place to another psychologically. It’s perhaps Hamill’s strongest performance in the franchise – instead of a wide-eyed kid he’s become a cynical old man who’d rather spend his days as a hermit than a hero. Compare that to Rey, who has not been given enough material for us (yet) to gravitate toward her. In terms of production, can you expect anything less from a franchise like this? The space battles, individual fight scenes, and special effects all work incredible well. The sound design specifically works to amplify key moments. During a scene when the sound completely cuts out, the deafening silence made what we see on screen all the more impactful. Another highlighted aspect is how spacecraft jump into and out of light speed. This isn’t used just for window dressing, there is a specific reason for it and the payoff turns out to be one of the major high points we get. I mentioned earlier that the looseness of the narrative allowed Johnson and his team to take the story in directions we may not be anticipating. On the flip side, it also makes the structure a bit messier. Other than Kylo Ren, Luke, and maybe Poe and Leia, the rest of the characters and story beats operate to varied success. Unfortunately, Finn’s storyline dragged everything down, taking an upbeat pace and tossing it into the mud. Where he goes and what he does felt irrelevant, and the dynamic he shares with Rose was more of an awkward plot mechanic than a natural progression. The character of Snoke is also a missed opportunity. Just like Rey, we have a character that is intriguing on the outside, but whom we learn nothing about. What Snoke does and where he ends up could leave audiences disappointed. The Last Jedi is like that updated toy or gadget that you get for Christmas. It has all of the stuff that you liked in the older versions, some new tricks thrown in to keep you satisfied, and just enough features left out to keep you eager for the next one. While those who desire to see something entirely new and different may walk away wishing for more, those that are bought in will embrace this with open arms."
"Jul 17, 2020",positive," ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…."" Seeing those words still brings a chill. Whether on a TV or, in this golden new age, up on the silver screen, once again. With the original Star Wars being the first film I ever remember seeing in a theater, at the impressionable age of three, this franchise has been a major part of my entire life. Seeing that sentence, with its extra-dotted ellipsis, in front of The Last Jedi brings equal parts overwhelming nostalgia and nervous anticipation at what's to come. General Leia Organa's (Carrie Fisher) Resistance has been forced to evacuate their base, and they incur a number of casualties in the initial attack by the First Order fleet. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), along with a new friend Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), have devised a plan to disable the main First Order ship. Because of Poe's rash decision making, their standing in the eyes of the Resistance leadership has diminished, so they must execute their plan in secret. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). What began as a mission to convince Luke to join the fight soon becomes a journey of self-discovery, for both. Rey must figure out what this power is that she feels inside her, and why it keeps connecting her mind with Kylo Ren's (Adam Driver). Luke must try to reconcile his feelings about the history of the Jedi Order and his own place in that story, all while attempting to show this girl what it means to be connected to the Force. The Last Jedi is not only the longest entry in the saga, clocking in at two and a half hours, it is also the densest in relation to story. Being, essentially, the bridge film for this trilogy, a lot happens, building and expanding all those characters we were introduced to in The Force Awakens. So much is going on in this film, at times, that it may feel like you need more than one viewing to really take it all in and figure out everything. That's not a bad thing, since writer/director Rian Johnson (Looper, Brick) has given us a breathtaking visual spectacle to go along with his plot, one which respects the viewer's intelligence and doesn't just hand-feed you. It's not just the characters that get a dose of expansion, but the saga as a whole. We are treated to new ship designs, new species and new locations, all of which serve to give a broader sense of what goes on outside the tiny capsule of conflict. It reminds us that what we're used to seeing in these films is only a tiny section of a vast universe. As J.J. Abrams did with The Force Awakens and A New Hope, Johnson liberally borrows from the previous films. He mostly takes elements from The Empire Strikes Back, this entry's spiritual cousin, but also includes parts of Return of the Jedi. Also like the previous entry, this doesn't detract from the film, as Johnson reworks these pieces of the story and rearranges them in a clever way. He also takes full advantage of the how far visual effects have come over the years. George Lucas has mentioned he took inspiration from several places in creating the Jedi. To me, the one on that list that has always stood out as the main influence was the samurai. Johnson appears to feel this, as well, taking cues from classic Japanese films. This is not only used during the student/master sequences between Rey and Luke, but also when he gives us a fantastic take on the samurai vs. ninjas fight scene the way only a Star Wars film could. In the end, The Last Jedi answers many of the questions brought up in The Force Awakens, while creating some new questions of its own. First and foremost: Where does the story go from here?

"Jul 1, 2020",positive," After the shameless remake of Star Wars (1977, aka Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope) that was Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015, aka Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens), which came roaring into theaters with a bad aftertaste of manufactured PR, the newest installment offers the world an action-packed, technically excellent, mythically present, humorous, and (never thought I’d say this of a Star Wars film) thematically radical entry in the four-decade-old original space opera saga. . . .  At least, that’s how I thought I’d be starting this review as I was walking out of the cinema. Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017, aka Star Wars: Episode VIII—The Last Jedi) is a great film, but is it a great film? Is that even a fair question to ask of just one-eighth of an epoch-making tour de force of imaginative world-creation and archetype-wielding narration? In other words, how fair can you (or I) consider this review to be, given that merely reading the opening crawl had me in tears, and that I’d been following the YouTube press tour so closely that I kept thinking of the on-screen characters by the name of their actors (Vice Admiral who?)? Richard Brody, arthouse champion and bugbear of the popular cinema, calls this film “an elaborate feat of fan service,” and he’s not wrong—even the newfound humor just reveals it to have gone all-out Marvel. He’s not alone: Matt Zoller Seitz, in his masterful review at the Roger Ebert website, also mentions fan expectations and makes a Marvel reference. (Editor’s note: So it’s ironic that, apparently, half of the fandom hates its guts.) The bigger question, though, is where you would find someone who cares about this eighth out of nine (and possibly twelve) films who isn’t a fan? A similar question hovers over Brody’s conclusion that, in its militaristic upholding of the virtues of hope, freedom, and resistance, the film is formally closer to the fascist New Order. Again, right on the money, but as revolutionary theorists from Lenin to Badiou have pointed out, rebellions against authoritarian (or monarchical) dictators prevail in the face of long odds primarily on the basis of their discipline and conviction. Dunno if that’s a contradiction, but it’s history. So the film is ineluctably constrained by its genre and universe conventions, and so plot-centric that I kept waiting for the inevitable cliffhanger ending à la The Empire Strikes Back (1980, aka Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back). Also, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) kills Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) using Occlumency (prove me wrong, I dare you). But the film fills up all the available space within these boundaries—and even breaks through a couple times. Brody mentions the mirror scene and Carrie Fisher’s performance (perhaps out of respect for her, he skips over the part where the shot composition of Leia’s return to the carrier first resembles Superman in space absorbing the rays of the sun, before quickly devolving into a 2D platform shooter). The biggest, bravest, and most radical thing the film does, though, is that it embodies the lesson that Yoda (Frank Oz) imparts to Luke (Mark Hamill): embrace failure. The entire film is premised on a retreat—Dunkirk in space, if you will—and of all the schemes and plans and subplots and side-missions that are played out, the only one that succeeds is Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) bringing Luke back into the fight. Kylo Ren is still on the Dark side, Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) are captured and betrayed by Benicio del Toro (what’s his character’s name again?), no Resistance bases are left standing, the only ship still spaceworthy is the Millennium Falcon, which wasn’t part of the Resistance convoy to begin with, and even Luke enters a higher realm (read: dies) at the end. And we don’t even have Carrie Fisher anymore. All of this just adds ladles of emotion to the final line: Having lost so much, Leia consoles Rey by assuring her, “We have everything we need.” Camera pull upward. Though, for my money, the absolute hands-down best line in the film is when Luke guides Rey to truly understand the force for the first time, and he asks her, “In between [everything], what do you feel?” and she says, “I feel . . . a force.” It’s A New Hope all over again."

"May 29, 2020",positive," BY DAN TABOR FILM CRITIC With Thursday’s release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi  director Rian Johnson picks up the reigns of the space opera mega-franchise left by J.J. Abrams.  Given the bleakness of Looper and cleverness of Brick, I was more than a bit curious to see what Johnson would do in the Disney® sandbox. Surprisingly enough not only did Johnson make it through making the film without being fired — no small achievement, that — but he turned in a film that feels very much like a Star Wars adventure while adding a much-needed layer of complexity to the characters we met all too briefly in The Force Awakens. Since the decimation of the Republic’s capital at the end of The Force Awakens, the First Order has established dominance over the galaxy. When we catch up with the final remnants of the Republic — the de facto Resistance — led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), they are on the run from the ominously reptilian Supreme Leader Snoke and his terrifying star fleet of mega-destroyers, who are on the cusp of wiping out the Resistance once and for all. In a plot point that feels cribbed from an episode of Battlestar Galactica, The First Order now has the ability to track the Rebel fleet through their lightspeed jumps making it only a matter of time before the Resistance fleet runs out of fuel and is overtaken by the First Order. It’s a race against time as Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac),  Finn (John Boyega) and newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) cobble together a plan to sneak onto Snoke’s ship to shut off the tracking device just long enough for the Resistance fleet to slip away. In the meantime, Daisy Ridley’s Rey finds she has a much more daunting task ahead of her, trying to convince Luke Skywalker — who, fed up with intergalactic warfare, has self-exiled to the last redoubt of the Jedi on the oceanic planet Ahch-To —  to help the Resistance and train her in the in the ways of The Force. It’s very apparent Rian Johnson was having the time of his life here. The film is pure visual spectacle, with bigger space battles, more lightsaber duels and higher stakes; all barbed with a razor sharp humor. I can also see why Mark Hamill probably sat out the first film; he is a formidable presence on screen and here he often eclipses the young Ridley with his darkly humorous take on the exiled Jedi master. This dynamic plays into how we come to see this war between the Rebellion and the First Order and the conflict between Jedi and the Sith. It’s not simply black and white, but shades of gray. And sometimes the good guys do bad things. The film begins with a tragic example as Poe Dameron’s ego leads to the death of hundreds of rebels when he disobeys orders and takes on a massive First Order Dreadnought. These sentiments are later echoed by the career criminal DJ (Benicio Del Toro, who revisists the twitchy incomprehensibility of his breakout performance in The Usual Suspects) who lets our Resistance friends in on a little secret: there are those that have been profiting obscenely off of this war, selling arms to both sides, who have a vested interest in keeping it going as long as possible. After that aforementioned spectacular opening battle sequence, The Last Jedi stumbles a bit trying to find its footing and advance the narrative all the while tying up all the loose ends left over from The Force Awakens. Once the film digs in however it delivers a story that proves to be more original and satisfying watch than its predecessor. It almost feels like Rian Johnson had most of the same issues with The Force Awakens we did — that it leaned too hard on the fan nostalgia crutch — and nowhere is this more apparent than when Snoke — who looks like a burn ward victim in a fancy bathrobe — berates Kylo Ren (the always excellent Adam Driver) for failing to vanquish Rey in the previous installment, belittling him as a Vader wannabe. J.J. Abrams is slated to direct the final installment in the Star Wars re-boot trilogy but after seeing how impressively Johnson course-corrected the series and cleared the board for the imminent endgame of the Skywalker saga, I’d rather see him finish what he’s started. The Last Jedi isn’t perfect but is easily everything a Star Wars fan could want that expands the SW universe into bold new realms while deftly invoking the films we love and remember from a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away."

"Feb 10, 2020",positive," As satisfying as The Force Awakens was, as the dust settled, it became clear than J.J. Abrams had basically remixed A New Hope for a new generation without bringing new ideas to the fore (heck, Abrams went for yet another Death Star, the most cumbersome of weapons). Considering this development, concerns over The Last Jedi being another Empire Strikes Back weren’t unfounded. Enter Rian Johnson. The writer/director behind the brainy indies Brick, Looper and The Brothers Bloom explores corners of the Star Wars universe never seen before on screen, without breaking the mold. Chief among them, a scenario beyond the battle between good and evil that has characterized the saga. Johnson also takes full advantage of the visual possibilities and deliver the most unique-looking episode of the franchise, without becoming a CGI hodgepodge like the prequels. I won’t be spoiling the plot here. Suffice to say, the Resistance is in shambles. Even without a massive, impractical weapon able to destroy planets, the strength of the Empire is overwhelming. There is also conflict within each side. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has fallen out of favor with Supreme Leader Snoke, following his defeat at hands of Rey (Daisy Ridley). Among the rebels, Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) can’t agree over the best way to avoid annihilation, with General Hux (Domhall Gleeson) breathing down their necks. Meanwhile, Rey struggles to get Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to rejoin the fray. The Jedi knight is not over the events that led to Kylo Ren switching teams and is not particularly inclined to go through the same motions with another gifted, unruly student. Unlike previous episodes, The Last Jedi relies heavily on the performers and boy, do they deliver. Maybe it’s because of the goodwill generated by her untimely demise, but Carrie Fisher is phenomenal as Leia: The leader of the Resistance is burdened by casualties but her resolve is unshakeable. Mark Hamill is asked to bridge his brash younger self with a cautious, misanthropic present and pulls it off. Of the new generation, Adam Driver is the MVP: More comfortable in Kylo Ren’s skin, Driver makes the character’s tortuous journey believable, even relatable. The movie goes out of its way to present Rey and Kylo as sides of the same coin. They may be in opposite corners, but they recognize in each other a kindred spirit, a connection that pays off tenfold. There are several of these dichotomies peppered through the film, which serve to explore the nature of power, the darkness inside all of us and the generational divide. The Last Jedi has a conflicted relationship with the past, both at internal and meta level. There is a desire to break with it, but at the same time, an acknowledgement of its tremendous power. The tension that comes from these opposing forces serves the movie well.  Whatever side you stand, you can see the appeal of the other. The quality of the space battles has improved exponentially. Rian Johnson -who has already been tapped for a new trilogy set in the Star Wars universe- brings new elements to skirmishes between rebels and the Empire. The opening dogfight is one for the ages. Overall, this is a profoundly satisfying episode without apparent weak spots (it’s a notch disjointed, but nothing unbearable): You’ll laugh, cry and be in awe, which is more you can say of any movie out this decade. There is a question The Last Jedi presents that has escaped every other Star Wars installment: Who benefits from the conflict between the Empire and the Resistance? The answer is as pedestrian as is topical, and has the potential to blow the franchise wide open. Four out of five planets."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"It is the most visually stunning of the eight Star Wars films, the characters speak with the elegance and wit... and the acting is often outstanding. It is exciting, funny, cute, tense, melancholy, smart, goofy, unexpected, and occasionally profound."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Most fans will enjoy The Last Jedi but it won't be for everyone. While well crafted, the current batch of main storyline SW films feel a little hollow"
"Dec 24, 2019",positive," Undeniably the most divisive of the Star Wars franchise, The Last Jedi sought to challenge the very foundations of the property. Building off of the events of The Force Awakens, director Rian Johnson chose a different path than many of the films that came before. Yet at the same time, his mechanisms for crafting the story created the rhyme that remains essential to the franchise. Discarding the “planet-destroying” monstrosities that have plagued most of the franchise, he instead focused on character development and philosophy. This Empire Strikes Back illusions are heavy throughout the film, especially as the characters are pulled in different directions. However, the “kill the past” message reigns supreme throughout the film. How that message has been interpreted is another matter entirely, but it provides the groundwork for a future Star Wars with incredible hope. The Last Jedi begins moments after The Force Awakens. Poe (Oscar Isaac) leads a raid on an Imperial Dreadnaught, taking down a dangerous weapon for the First Order. As General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) looks on, she orders the evacuation of the other ships in the fleet. Among those evacuated are an unconscious Finn (John Boyega) and a young engineer named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). The First Order, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) tracks the resistance through hyperspace, leaving the Resistance on its last legs. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) continues to spark hate in Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), pushing him to his emotional limits. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a distant planet. Unfortunately, he refuses to train her in the ways of the Force. The emotional core of the film comes from Ridley, and Johnson quickly establishes an unconventional nature to her side of the story. He fully embraces the Luke parallels within the character, including her ambition and excitement to receive training. He knows that Ridley comes across as an infectious performer. She needs to belong to something bigger than herself and having the ability to utilize the Force has always sparked an internal examination. Its only fitting that Rey’s involve the biggest hole in her heart, and wanting to belong can often stem from knowing where you come from. Johnson cuts the core with the answer of “no one,” a liberating and emotionally devasting choice all at once. Yes, it means that Rey’s central quest to find her parents will never be solved. However, it means she can be free to pursue her own destiny, one that means she can define herself by those she loves and those she chooses. In a more practical sense, it means that anyone can a savior. Anyone can be a hero. You don’t have to come from privilege or legacy to pave your own way forward. In an age of populism, this particular story rings true. It also builds upon a heartbreaking choice from The Phantom Menance. It does not say that midichlorians are necessarily irrelevant, but it does not mean that only the select few in the galaxy can use the power of the force. Meanwhile, Driver delivers the best performance of this franchise to date as Ren. While I saw him as an unstable and broken character for most of The Force Awakens, Driver transcends the story in Last Jedi. Rocked by a master that still sees him as weak, his connection with Rey deepens both characters. You can see his manipulation at work, showing how his point-of-view diametrically opposes the truth. Yet Driver turns on the charm. He’s slick and raw. Johnson’s choice to dump the Kylo mask means we actually get to see one of the most emotive actors deliver emotional dialogue. He knows he must stand-in for Vader, so his physical presence can overwhelm the screen. Driver’s textured take on a man broken from his own actions, seeking someone to understand him becomes empathetic. But he always comes home. He may not be beyond redemption, but he also holds an unsafe level of influence over our hero. That makes him the most dangerous man in the universe. Returning to the role of Luke, Hamill gives the most introspective performance of his career. He locks into something beautiful about the character at the edge of the world. He has followed the footsteps of his masters, and like both Yoda and Obi-Wan, he chose exile over facing the problems head-on. After freeing the galaxy, he plunged it back into darkness. His failure destroyed everything his friends had lived, fought, and died for. Hope has been extinguished, and for the entirety of the film, Hamill gets to charm his way back into your heart. Even as grumpy and frustrated force wielder, he remains funny and weird. He was never the traditional hero, but a nerdy kid who starred into the suns hoping to find something better for himself. He was the embodiment of George Lucas as he created the franchise, a young boy in California who would rather work in movies than for his father. Like Lucas, he created something reviled, something inherently broken, and was forced to leave it all in the hands of someone else. Yet failure does not stop a legend from continuing to be a spark for hope. Johnson’s dissection of Luke reminds us that while the worlds and stories we create can be inspiring, the important thing is for the next generation to build on what we’ve built. We do not ignore what came before, and instead, use that failure as a way to push beyond what we’ve accomplished. Just as Luke learns from the failure of Vader, Rey too must learn from the failure of Luke. The film’s dialogue never disposes of the past but reframes the way we look at what came before, and the exciting prospects of what can come next. It’s an eternal message, one that deserves to be delivered by one of the great cinematic characters. Hamill’s pathos and heart can be read on his face throughout the film, and while he struggles with his own failure, you can see the hope reborn. His final moments on-screen feel impossibly beautifully, impossibly sentimental, and fit the rhyme of Star Wars. No character in the franchise has ever received a more impactful farewell. On the flip side, the Resistance does its best to survive. Regardless of where you sit on the Leia utilizing the Force sequence (a scene that feels like we’ve been building towards since Return of the Jedi), this section defines why we fight against oppression. Simply painting the world as good guys and bad guys do not create personal stakes for our characters. Isaac begs the audience to see him as the new Han Solo, but he needs to grow into the role. Before this moment, we’ve barely even met him, and allowing him to contrast himself with Hondo and Leia offers that growth. Meanwhile, Finn has never given a reason for why he would join the Resistance. The only motivation he reveals throughout The Force Awakens comes from his feelings for Rey. He was 100% against the First Order, but he was never for the cause. The scenes with Rose, especially those at Canto Bight, snap several political realities into place. First, it directly pushes up against the idea of the rich, or in many cases corporations, caring about the cultural ideologies that play out in public. Anyone can sell anything to any side. After all, Republicans buy sneakers too. It’s a harsh reality, but one that feels undeniable as consumerism and activism continue to blend. Boyega owns the transformation, becoming a movie star in the process. His line reading of “Rebel Scum” will always be his defining moment to me in the trilogy. Tran does not get the strongest dialogue, but her ability to ground the story creates its own benefits. She’s someone who grew up hearing the stories of rebellion and has actually felt the costs firsthand. She believes in heroes and puts herself on the front lines. It’s an admirable character, one that is slightly diminished by a one-sided love subplot. That does not diminish the earnest nature of her role, which in many ways in a non-Force sensitive version of Rey. Yet her message of love and togetherness feels essential, especially as political divides grew deeper within American politics. Finally, the technical aspects of The Last Jedi far outpace any previous entry in the franchise. While the original trilogy did not have the technology to create the images this one does, the creativity Johnson showcases throughout the film creates dozens of brilliant setpieces. The Red Room fight remains one of the greatest fight sequences of Star Wars history. The Holdo Maneuver took the breath out of the theater, creating a visually spectacular shot. The Dreadnaught fight and the battle on Crait provide their own brilliance. Even the little Crystal Foxes and Porgs deserve credit. Johnson unleashed one of the most spectacular visual feats within the Star Wars universe. The use of unique sound, visuals, and production design sprinkled throughout the film makes this one stand out."
"Dec 20, 2019",positive," In the run-up to the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and the end of the Skywalker Saga, we will be taking a look back at all of the Saga films and re-evaluating them and their legacy as a whole. Either a reaction to the creative choices of The Force Awakens (difficult given the production schedule) or an incredibly timely bit of synchronicity, The Last Jedi takes a full look at what Star Wars without its originator could be but is hamstrung by an inability to make up its mind and creative decisions inherited from the previous film. The sequel trilogy was and is weighed down by the desire to both guess what its creator would have done and what its fan base would have wanted. Trying to thread the needle between the two created a backward-looking experience in The Force Awakens, which kept that film from being able to take full advantage of what new things it did invent.  The other side effect of lacking a single guiding hand behind the story is that each new filmmaker has free reign to make their episode what they want it to be, something entirely novel in the series. Working on his iteration simultaneous with J.J. Abrams production, The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson essentially tackles the same questions at the same time and comes to very different conclusions. “Let the past die,” says Kylo Ren, the focal point of Johnson’s thoughts on sequels and franchises. A character who existed in The Force Awakens largely to both impart a Darth Vader vibe to the new films and give Han Solo a dramatic arc, in The Last Jedi, he comes into his own as a fascinatingly compelling character.  Through him, Johnson smashes some of the repetitive fan services of The Force Awakens (usually literally) and makes clear that he understands what Lucas understood – the only way a long-form story can survive is if each edition is intentionally different from the others. Frequently that means taking big whacks at the story structures brought over from The Force Awakens in order to leave something new for the next person coming down the line. [This creates other problems, not the least being that no overriding dramatic structure exists across the three sequel films because no one knows what is happening next or has the time to worry about it. All they can do is leave bread crumbs for the next person to follow and hope they do.] The heroic rebels are nearly wiped out after the flaw of hopeless last stands and reckless plans becomes apparent. The grand leader of the villainous First Order is simultaneously expunged as Johnson realizes the crutch using expy’s of previous characters is. In their place, Johnson takes time to delve deeply into what makes Rey and Kylo Ren tick and build a fascinating relationship between them. The downside of all of this is that it also weakens the structures The Last Jedi itself is relying on. With so much time spent on a new character dynamic, there is less for recurring characters Finn and Poe (who himself is dramatically increased in presence), and what time they do have is focused on The Last Jedi’s thematic pursuits, primarily failure and how it can be learned from.  Which means that they fail again and again and again. It’s fascinating but also unbalanced with little in the saga that doesn’t get subverted. As Owen Gleiberman noted at the time of the film’s release, the problem of taking all the legs out of your mythology is that it will not be there to prop your story up when it is needed. But the real issue The Last Jedi has is that it ultimately lacks the courage of its convictions. As often as it speaks of doing away with the past or simply realizing the past has no power over the present, it refuses to follow the idea to its logical conclusion. The problem is epitomized in the climactic confrontation between Ren and Rey and Supreme Leader Snoke when the two misfit, outcast Jedi seem on the verge of leaving the galaxy to its problems and finding their own way… a truly momentous and unprecedented turn in story which would have left untold options for the final film.  But at the key moment, they don’t. Instead, they merely act as all previous versions of their characters have because they must. Otherwise, there would no longer be scruffy Rebels fighting Stormtroopers, and then what would Star Wars be about? Johnson is canny enough to realize one day we will have to find out, but he is not prepared to make The Last Jedi the film that does so. This is its fatal flaw, as it attempts to have its cake and eat it, too. That problem can be clearly seen in its design elements as well. Some of it is fascinatingly expressive in a way no one but Lucas and Kershner really tried with the series, in particular, the focus on the color red within the palette — sometimes overt and sometimes sub-textually — representing the strong emotional ties, love, and hate, tugging at Kylo Ren and driving the story of the sequel trilogy.  The return of Master Yoda was conceived in Johnson’s words so that it could exactly replicate what was seen in the original films. His other new design elements also replicate those older choices – a particular ask was to make the new vehicles look like they could have been from Return of the Jedi. If the exterior visual vision for the film is kept chained to a certain frame, how can the interior vision grow and change when it’s all stemming from the same point of view? The sequel films, helmed by those who grew up with the series, are trapped in the worship of its iconography. But that kind of worship does not allow for change and reacts violently when it is attempted (a fact both the prequel trilogy and The Last Jedi ran powerfully in conflict with). Lack of change freezes the narrative and leaves filmmakers re-arranging deck chairs rather than moving the plot forward, which is how something like The Last Jedi could end basically how it began [The Resistance in a spaceship running for their lives] with only one film to go to somehow tie up all loose ends. Perhaps if The Force Awakens had been more daring, The Last Jedi itself would have been even freer to experiment. Instead, the expectation was set for nostalgia and safe choices, with the short-term success of that leading to long-term troubles. Dangling plot threads that would have been poisonous to future installments if drawn out — the unknown and unknowable Snoke, the missing Luke Skywalker, the secret of Rey’s parentage — became grenades Johnson had to throw himself onto in order to leave a clear trail for whoever followed him. We’ll never know, and it’s entirely possible the answer would have been ‘pretty much the same’ because this is what happens when an auteur’s vision is turned over to his fans. More than any of the other post-Lucas films, Johnson takes that bull by the horns and truly thinks about what could be different and why. But when the climactic choice comes, The Last Jedi, like Kylo Ren in the throne room, reverts to old habits. “Let the past die,” it says, “but not too much.” Joshua Starnes has been writing about film and the entertainment industry since 2004 and served as the President of the Houston Film Critics Society from 2012 to 2019. In 2015, he became a co-owner/publisher of Red 5 Comics and, in 2018, wrote the series “Kulipari: Dreamwalker” for Netflix. In between, he continues his lifelong quest to find THE perfect tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich combination."
"Dec 20, 2019",positive," Now having seen the final entry in the Skywalker saga, the time is now to look back on the new era of Star Wars films and see how they hold up. In recent years, constant controversy has stalked the online fandom for Star Wars. With a sudden backlash to Rian Johnson’s film, contrasting to the love from critics was just the start, then came Solo: A Star Wars Story and now The Rise of Skywalker. I have no interest in such puny squabbles of fans pre-conceived notions of what Star Wars is. Judge a film on its merits and a filmmaker too, it’s their choices and its a continuation so changes to lore are valid. You’ve always got the old films if you disagree with new choices made. I am a self-proclaimed Star Wars mega fan, I was brought up watching Star Wars and therefore I believe there can be some trust put into my thoughts? Coming ten years after the last Star Wars film, J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens was a nostalgic return to George Lucas’ beloved world. The film is a great success, it captured the feel of the originals while evoking and creating new ideas. However, the narrative feels a little recycled, in that it’s very familiar to that of A New Hope. The Force Awakens is grandly entertaining and riveting, with the piercing new visual and sound effects of the lightsabers, it acted as a surge of Star Wars excitement. It isn’t nearly the best Star Wars entry, it is of middling ground – which says a lot considering how great most of the series’ films are. Another success was the introduction to a whole new series of beloved antagonists and protagonists. Notably, Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Whilst visually it has some intrigue, I believe the biggest flaw is the direction of Abrams, it seems sloppy at points especially in comparison to watching The Last Jedi after. In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a brilliant return to Star Wars that evokes extreme nostalgia and led to a spark that led onto one of the best entries in the Skywalker saga. The Last Jedi, the second entry into the new Skywalker trilogy stirred intrigue after its release and has been much debated for the past two years. Bouncing off from J.J. Abrams’ ending, this film sees Rey attempting to console training with Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Upon re-watching all these films back-to-back you can truly see the mastery of Rian Johnson and his direction. The Last Jedi is not only a fantastic film, but one of the best Star Wars films and could go toe-to-toe with The Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope.  There is something quite poetic to its somewhat relaxed form of storytelling, there is a philosophical aspect to its attempted themes, it feels more like the approach of the originals. Think re-Master Yoda consoling with Luke in The Empire Strikes Back.  The interest in building character over bombastic action (which it does have) is something of an admirable quality. Shot by Rian Johnson’s go-to cinematographer Steve Yedlin, the images they create are sincerely breathtaking and beautiful. The careful and calculated touch of their collaboration when seen in comparison to the more Blockbuster-coverage-type style of shooting in the prior film, clearly shows a mastery in visuals that The Last Jedi has. Rian Johnson’s film is clearly superior in filmmaking and upon re-watch holds up incredibly well as a film, but also as a Star Wars entry. It’s beautiful, breathtaking and poetic in execution, clearly marking the best in the new trilogy. The final entry in the new trilogy has arrived and The Rise of Skywalker is a great end to the new saga. Taking a little while to get used to the overload of exposition and changes made at the very beginning, it gets better and better. It is perhaps the most Star Wars-y film since perhaps the prequels? It is nostalgic, touching and head-turning in the crazy steps taken. It represents a progression in J.J. Abrams’ touch on Star Wars, it’s directed better than The Force Awakens, whilst bringing back some errors that Johnson eradicated in his tenure. The matter of its cinematography, with the sometimes sloppy style of coverage shooting shows less control compared to The Last Jedi, but less-so than The Force Awakens. That being said, it has quite frankly some beautiful and chilling imagery that will send surges of chills down your spine. The scope of the film is frankly very vast, in that it has the challenge of creating a satisfying end for all the films, not just its own. Whilst it has occasional vivid scripting errors and the somewhat rushed beginning exposition, it delivers a mostly great storyline of clarity that becomes more and more clear as the film progresses. Some shots will have you screaming in that they REALLY did that? Delivering extreme doses of nostalgia that honestly ends quite perfectly. Despite its flaws, The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting end. J.J. Abrams improves on his prior work in creating a packed finale that is sure to make fans go wild. On a personal standpoint it has been a pleasure to wait year to year for each new entry. It really works as a trilogy and Rian Johnson must be applauded in creating a film to rival the original trilogy, whilst also J.J. Abrams for lighting the spark that ignited this new reign of Star Wars."
"Dec 14, 2019",positive," Two hours and eighteen minutes into The Last Jedi, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) projects his avatar from across the galaxy to confront Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and save the Resistance. Both times I saw the film theatrically, once in Mumbai, and then in New Delhi a thousand miles away, the image of Luke floating cross-legged, deep in meditation, was met with thunderous applause. This wasn’t just a clever twist for fans of Force magic; for many eastern audiences, the image of the Jedi levitating cross-legged above a mound evokes depictions of Siddhārtha Gautama, the first Buddha, in sculptures and paintings across the centuries.  The climactic reveal of Luke, lost in deep meditation on Ahch-To (the site of his self-imposed exile, where he lives a similarly material-free life), takes the place of the typical “cowboy shot,” where a subject is framed from the thigh-up as they grab their weapon from its holster — a technique Star Wars has used in the past. Instinctively, most audiences in the west know what this image means whenever it appears, especially if it’s accompanied by the camera pushing closer for emphasis (as it does on Rey when she first wields her weapon in The Force Awakens). It’s a precursor to heroic action scenes; a familiar visual shorthand that tickles the senses, as all genre tropes do. But in The Last Jedi, as the camera pushes in on Luke, the shorthand of the climax is an image more familiar to viewers in South and Southeast Asia. For me, the image recalled an enormous statue of the Buddha in the Ajanta Caves, a series of rock-cut Buddhist monasteries built as far back as the 2nd century BCE.  Cross-legged depictions of the meditating Buddha are most often depictions of the revered monk achieving nirvana, a form of deep spiritual understanding in South Asian religions like Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The latter, now the world’s fourth-largest religion, is believed to have been founded in the 5th century BCE by Siddhārtha Gautama, who most historians agree renounced the material world before embarking upon a journey of learning and teaching until his eventual death; more specific details are harder to verify, though most biographies cite his birthplace as Lumbini — modern-day Nepal. In Buddhist traditions that arose in subsequent centuries, nirvana  (or “the great quenching”) became one of Buddhism’s central tenets, an escape from cycles of death and rebirth, achieved through deep concentration, helping others, and a state of peaceful, desireless living.  However, the contradictory behavior of the Jedi would come to light in Return of the Jedi, when Obi-Wan insists that, in order to defeat the Emperor, Luke must vanquish Darth Vader in an act of physical dominance. This course of action would require Luke to detach himself emotionally from his own father, but it also contradicted the very things Yoda had taught him. “A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense,” Yoda said, “never attack.” By the end of the film, Luke rejects both extremes of the Force equation, neither buying into the visceral hatred of the Dark Side nor following the dispassionate Jedi dogma that would’ve also lead him to violence. After pummeling Vader in a fit of rage, Luke tosses his own lightsaber aside, and offers him a path to redemption. By The Last Jedi, Luke has cut himself off from the Force, having failed to exorcise the darkness in his nephew Ben Solo. In flashback, we see Luke momentarily tempted by both sides of the equation once more: the violent potential within him that the Dark Side could draw out, and the Jedi’s dogmatic call to ascetic detachment in order to vanquish evil. In this moment, as in the moment Luke nearly took Vader’s life, the Dark Side and the ways of the Jedi are one and the same. Luke thinks about (and nearly acts on) killing Ben. He doesn’t follow through, but it’s too late: The betrayed Ben, denied the road to redemption by his own uncle, is set down on a dark path of his own. A second Skywalker villain is created by Jedi zealotry.  With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body ... He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. The Last Jedi’s cut away from the duel to Luke’s cross-legged meditation signals the achievement of a greater, clear-minded understanding. The concept of nirvana ties back to the central Buddhist idea of escaping cycles of life and death, or attaining moksha, i.e. salvation from pain; what pains Luke, it would seem, is the guilt of his failure. In Buddhism, in order to attain this moksha, one must ascend — as Luke does — from ceto-vimutti, a state of simple, desireless living, to pañña-vimutti, the escape from physical suffering through vipassana, or meditation. The term nirvana, when literally translated, means “blowing out,” as in a candle. As Luke fades from physical existence, backed by the sun-drenched horizon, his life ends like a fading flame.  Fittingly, Luke’s enlightenment, and his rejection of Jedi dogma, mirrors the rift between two major sects of Buddhism: Theravada, or the School of the Elders, and Mahayana, or the Great Vehicle. Theravada, the oldest and most orthodox form of Buddhism, teaches the path to nirvana as a strict endeavour embarked upon only by chosen monks living according to a rigid monastic code, whose enlightenment takes precedence over helping others. In response, Mahayana, which arose cir. the 1st century BCE, introduced newer, more lenient teachings considered inauthentic by many Theravadins. It allowed laypeople the chance to walk the path to enlightenment, and placed a greater emphasis on helping struggling humans, even if it meant delaying one’s own nirvana in order to do so (Mahayana, as it happens, was also the origin of Zen Buddhism). This divide also echoes the paradigm of the new Star Wars films, which dramatizes the tensions between the rigidity of bloodline legacy — from Vader to Kylo Ren — and the arrival of an outsider Rey, who uses the Force and upsets the established order. Rey is also a key fixture in the film’s use of Buddhist imagery. Her own moment of enlightenment, while searching for her parents’ identity in the cave on Ahch-To, comes in the form of gazing into infinite mirrors. In some sects of Buddhism, the mirror is considered a point of spiritual reflection; seventeenth century Zen master Hakuin Ekaku considered the mirror a false or illusory reflection of reality. Similarly, the “truth” Rey seeks in these mirrors presents itself first as illusion — two silhouetted figures, perhaps her parents, walking towards her — before finally reflecting the reality of the world as it truly is. In seeing these two shadows merge into her own reflection, Rey, the girl who raised herself on Jakku, begins to accept that it’s neither the phantom parents she clings to, nor idols like Luke or Han to whom she runs, nor Kylo Ren by whom she’s tempted, that will show her her path. It’s something she must forge herself.  Rey isn’t the only important outsider in The Last Jedi either. Rose (Trần Loan) and Finn (John Boyega) help a young stable boy (Temirlan Blaev) on Canto Bight, the Casino city frequented by the galaxy’s war profiteers. The capital is a nexus of violence and materialism, in contrast with the Buddhist tenets of ending suffering (dukkha) and detaching oneself from the material desires that cause it (samudaya). At the end of the film, a young slave boy who finds inspiration in a Rebel ring given to him by Rose, as well as in the legends of Luke Skywalker, appears to use the Force. In an immediate sense, this child is a symbol of the continuing rebellion, the birth of a new generation of Jedi, and like Rey, a spiritual successor in the Skywalker story. But where does the Force go from here, after Luke’s ultimate rejection of violence and the Jedi dogma? With few answers from The Rise of Skywalker, the answer may partially lie with the new live-action Star Wars shows planned for Disney Plus. We’ve gotten a little from The Mandalorian and Grogu. This mute infant, of the same species as the Yoda we know, exhibits sensitivity to the Force, and in his innocent moments, tries to use the Force to heal the Mandalorian’s wounds. The Force as a means of physical healing is a concept yet unexplored by Star Wars, though it feels tethered to Luke’s use of the Force as a great vehicle for spiritual healing in The Last Jedi. When the film begins, Luke has taken a dark path akin to Yoda’s didactic prophecy many years ago: “Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. And hate leads to suffering.” But by the end, Luke breaks this painful cycle by finding an alternative to Yoda’s three-pronged mantra, one that echoes the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism, the core of the Buddha’s teachings: Suffering exists. It has a cause. It has an end. And there is a noble path to ending it. The future of the Force, it would seem, lies in the ending of suffering, rather than in answering the call to violence; or, as Rose puts it, “Not fighting what we hate. Saving what we love.” The saga thus far has woven a harmonious fabric, in which Luke Skywalker, the young farm boy from Tatooine who just wanted to be part of something greater, fulfills his destiny by becoming one with the Force. He’s helped along his path by none other than Master Yoda, whose own enlightenment has seen him become one with nature; “We are what they grow beyond,” Yoda tells him, of their Jedi students. “That is the true burden of all masters.” As the saga leans further into Mahayana tradition, the goals of its wise Jedi, and its older generations, are to guide these new heroes — and outsiders — toward their own forms of spiritual understanding.  Luke does not appear in front of Kylo Ren to fight, but to guide others to safety. When his astonishing new abilities are revealed, they are a path to salvation — for Kylo, for the entrapped Rebels, and for the Jedi master himself — instead of bloodshed. When Luke is revealed floating on the mound, the awesome power audiences applauded was not violent fantasy, but a path to peace."
"Oct 18, 2019",positive," Star Wars: The Last Jedi is so good that it will thrill and surprise everyone from the first generation of fans to its newest recruit. It reaffirm to all the power of the force. This film, as written and directed by Rian Johnson, moves the saga forward dramatically, but in truth, it is all about character. It’s best not to discuss any plot points. Fans already know Luke Skywalker is in the movie, because he’s the biggest character on the one-sheet poster.  Audiences will learn more about the characters they’ve always known and loved, and more about both the sophomore and freshman classes.  As to those from A Force Awakens, Poe, Rey, Kylo, and Finn equally get their chance to shine, and show the complexity and motivations of their characters.  There are also some great new additions to the cast.  Most notable is Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico and the dynamic she brings to her scenes with John Boyega. In an interview, Tran talked about why. “From the beginning we clicked during the audition process. I don’t think there’s a better partner anyone could have when you’re going into a movie like this.”  Their chemistry is undeniable. Kelly Marie Tran also talked about the continued theme in the Star Wars Universe of having strong self-aware female characters.  “From the beginning, the Star Wars films have always been groundbreaking in that way.  What keeps people interested is they continue to do so.”  Another new strong female character portrayed by Laura Dern has a very interesting arc we see unfold in what almost feels like real time.  The potential for spoilers dictates no more is said about her role, or that of other Star Wars newcomer Benicio Del Toro, but they fold themselves and their storylines convincingly into the saga.  With all the newer members of the cast, lovers of the franchise can rest easy about the old guard.  Carrie Fisher’s Leia is luminous, as always.  Her swan song took a 1977 ingenue albeit fearless princess, and turned her into both a general, and a powerful wise-woman.   Even at that, it is Luke’s story that is most enriched, having several wow moments that legitimately rival the last act of A New Hope.  As to the expanded diversity in The Last Jedi, it’s not something that hits the audience on the head, but really feels right.  In a story where there is conflict and resistance, it makes sense that those who believe in freedom and equality would be coming from every perspective and gender, as well as a wide variety of alien species.  Visually, the audiences are brought through everything from cityscapes, to deserts, vast galactic spaceships, and desolate island landscapes. Some of the most exciting scenes of dogfights in space take us through such spectacular environments they will make your eyes pop.  Also, as one would expect, there are some spectacular sets, and, as has always been the case for the films of Star Wars, there is a great balance of the real and the digital.  Says Johnson, “We had a huge amount of practical sets for this film. Part of the lived-in feel of Star Wars is something we really wanted to capture.  At the same time, the other end of Star Wars is constantly pushing the envelope in terms of special effects.”   “Rian’s script at first count had something like 160 sets,” said production designer Rick Heinrichs, (Pirate of the Caribbean, Beetlejuice), but they wound up with around 125 sets where it was filmed at Pinewood Studios in England, as well as other locations around the world.  For example, they built a cave that was changed and relit to work for three other settings. There’s so much going on it’s almost impossible to remember the entire story (not that it would be shared in this review..) Which of course, may be a ploy to get audiences all to see it multiple times.  At 2 hours and 23 minutes, it is definitely on the long side, and there are so many plot threads it feels like they could get knotted up in the viewer’s brain.   It’s possible there’s an even better movie that could have been carved out in the editing room.  However,  a shorter film might have sacrificed the strong character development, which is what will remain with fans long after the credits roll. Lovers of Star Wars are incredibly lucky to have Johnson at the helm, who is clearly a super-fan of the saga. He took the stories, archetypes and mythology, and expanded and enhanced it in nearly every way. "
"Oct 10, 2019",positive,"Get ready to buckle up for plenty of action, tension, twists and surprises in this second installment in the trilogy that picks up from The Force Awakens without missing a beat."
"Sep 26, 2019",positive," Star Wars: The Last Jedi picks up immediately from where its predecessor The Force Awakens left off, but its attitude and intent could hardly be more different. The Force Awakens had an almost slavish reverence to the past, but The Last Jedi elegantly unburdens itself from such reverence in order to stake out its own identity and explore the grey-er shades of war, failure, and the stories we tell ourselves and each other. Writer/director Rian Johnson is a risk-taker. So when familiar beats happen, it's less like repetition and more like a carefully laid out trap in which the filmmaker can land a good sucker punch. Some will hate the creative choices made, some will love them – some won't know what the heck to make of them. Doubtless that The Last Jedi will reward or punish multiple viewings. And yes, it's still a sugar rush, it's a crowd pleaser, it's Star Wars at its Star Warsiest. Most remarkably, though, is that its subtle brilliance blooms the more you ponder on it. And all this without the film itself languishing in heavy-handed ponderousness. Where The Last Jedi could have easily fallen to such a dreary, ponderous place is in Rey's storyline, in which the young adept seeks guidance from the exiled Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Far from being the spirited hero we knew, he has been eroded by time, shame and regret. Mark Hamill is simply wonderful as this different Luke Skywalker, and it's difficult not to feel a huge rush of affection the few times Hamill drops the surliness and reveals hints of the bright-eyed young Skywalker who redeemed his fallen father and saved the galaxy. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley, along with Hamill, make for a fascinating and psychologically troubled trio upon which an entire fate of a galaxy depends. As Star Wars has always been about the interplay between light and shadow, tyranny and rebellion, so it is that for as operatic and dramatic as the series can get, it's often self-deprecatingly funny too. The impish sense of humour is a welcome aspect in this most violent instalment of the series yet. Whether it be Luke Skywalker sarcastically fucking with Rey, the twisted Supreme Leader Snoke cruelly chastising his broken-spirited apprentice Kylo Ren (“take off that ridiculous helmet”) or that the fascistic toady First Order General Hux is often the butt of a joke, The Last Jedi keeps a sense of humour amidst the carnage and desperation. Though it's thematically necessary, a slapstick-y detour to a Casino setting undeniably hurts the film's almost perfect pacing and tone. Nonetheless, I loved The Last Jedi. I loved its willingness to go to places that will surely anger legions of fans, I loved that it deepened the charismatic archetypes by exploring their hurts and haunts with deftness and humour, and I loved that Carrie Fisher saved her best for last."
"Sep 2, 2019",positive,"Brilliantly mesmerizing with a dazzling use of color, the action sequences are perhaps the best they've ever been, and the comedy in the film made a guy who generally rolls his eyes at everything laugh like a fool for two and a half hours straight."

"Aug 5, 2019",positive," Spoiler Alert! I’m not holding back on any plot points. Based on the box office though, it seems like everyone has watched the movie already.  30-second review: Admittedly, I was never a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise. I always appreciated its place as a corner of modern-day cinema and believe that The Empire Strikes Back is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. But I’ve never been a fanboy. The Force Awakens was a fun space romp that was well made, but further highlighted my issues with the franchise. Issues that competing franchise Star Trek seemed to solve a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away). However, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi doesn’t only give me a new hope for the franchise. It raises the bar for blockbuster filmmaking the same way that Mad Max: Fury Road did a few years ago and Blade Runner 2049 did this year. The difference is that no matter what, any Star Wars movie is going to be seen. And it’s going to be seen by a lot of people. Whether or not Johnson considered this when crafting the narrative I don’t know, but he has moved the franchise forward in quality and perspective. Before continuing, I want to say thank you to Johnson and Kelly Marie Tran. For the first time in my life, I felt like an action hero. Continuing in the spirit of the franchise, The Last Jedi picks up immediately after the events of The Force Awakens. Rey (Daisy Ridley continues to do great work) has found Luke (Mark Hamill) on an isolated island looking to bring him back to the waning resistance to help empower their forces and to further explore her newfound power with the force. Much of this sounds like The Empire Strikes Back retreaded, but Johnson constantly upends expectations in a way that constantly keeps you guessing.  Hamill has never been better as Luke (he was also great in Brigsby Bear this year). Refreshingly, he’s not the hero that he once was. Hamill famously was unsure about the direction of the character, but eventually came around. I understand why he was concerned. For years he was sold as the undisputed hero of the series, and in this film that is the legend that has persisted. But as the old adage goes, never meet your heroes.  The scenes between Rey and Luke don’t work as well as the rest of the film. However, the theme of the storyline is one that the series has never addressed: what does it mean to be a hero. Rey wants to be a hero, but Luke doesn’t quite believe them anymore. It’s incredibly mature storytelling for a series that has mostly kept its themes surface level. The rest of the resistance is engaging in only what I could call a Mad Max-style chase with the First Order. The theme of what it means to be a hero carries on here, but it also points to a new direction for the series. Star Wars, in spite of its title, has never felt like a war movie. Last year’s Rogue One came close, but The Last Jedi is the first movie to completely feel like it completely embraced the title. The action sequences, which are beautifully directed, visually and structurally feel like war battle sequences.  However, I want to pay specific attention to the opening battle. This is the kind of battle that George Lucas would end the movie on. It’s a triumphant victory achieved in spectacular fashion. Instead, Johnson focuses on the losses of the battle. In particular, he focuses on one resistance fighter’s attempt to drop bombs on a First Order dreadnought. Her ultimate sacrifice is what drives the movie’s narrative. Not her specific sacrifice, but the reason she’s doing it. Johnson is a superb visual storyteller and he makes these scenes feel like they can stand alone. Of course, that emotional arc pays off in the form of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran, a revelation and breakout). Fewer characters were introduced in this film, but of all the new characters in this trilogy, she may be one of the best. Not only does she have a backstory and a complex character arc, she’s an Asian woman. Diversity has never been Star Wars‘ strong suit, thought The Force Awakens did a great job in adding some to the cast, but Rose feels different. Of course, this is coming from someone who is Filipino-American. Still, I’ve never felt like I could be an action hero. However, her inclusion points to another improvement for the series. For the first time, each character feels complex and like they have to make decisions that have consequences. For the entire running time, the resistance has their backs against a wall, which adds stakes to the story. Something that the previous movies never had. The Last Jedi is easily the most consistently exciting film in the series. For fans of Battlestar Galactica, it is reminiscent of the series premiere where fleet must constantly evade their enemies through a series of jumps through hyperspace. Johnson’s direction of the sequences are sensational and the effects are among the strongest of the year. However, what is more interesting is General Leia (Carrie Fisher — she gives a performance that reminds us how far presence can get you in a scene) and her attempt to save what is left of the resistance. Poe (Oscar Isaac), who seems to be the new Han Solo, has the “shoot from the hip” attitude that got our heroes out of more than one sticky situation in the original trilogy. Instead, Johnson makes it a point to highlight the strategic side of the fight. At one point Leia becomes so angry at Poe taking the heroic path rather than the strategic one that she slaps him and delivers the soon-to-be iconic line, “get your head out of your cockpit.” Thematically, the film explores what it means to be a hero through Poe and his contentious relationship with Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern, a standout). More interestingly, though, it also blurs the line between good and evil. As a space western, the Star Wars films have always felt like good vs. evil. The Last Jedi explores what it is to be good or evil as Rey and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) become linked to each other through the force by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), which culminates in one of the best lightsaber battles in the series’ history. Johnson elevates the design of the universe by showing us corners that we’ve never seen before. The casino that Rose and Finn (John Boyega) visit is a highlight. And in the final battle sequence, the salt planet serves as an incredible backdrop for the rebels’ last stand. It’s that kind of visual innovation that the series lacked in The Force Awakens, which just felt like more of the same, even if that same is delightful. Coming from a background of appreciation rather than complete adoration, I never understood the undying love for the series. Well, The Last Jedi made me understand it. I felt emotional during the hero moments because I felt attached for the first time. Partially because I got to know them on a deeper level, but also because people of color and women got a chance to have those hero moments.  They truly saved the day. Will that anger some fans? Yes. But objectively, The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars movie to ever be released. That fact can’t be disputed. It may not be the Star Wars you remember, but change, in the end, is good. And to the fans that are unhappy about the changes or the diversity, I leave you with this: “we’re going to win this war not by fighting what we hate, but saving what we love.” Hey, I'm Karl, founder and film critic at Smash Cut.

"Aug 2, 2019",negative," Star Wars es una saga esencial para muchos amantes del séptimo arte. De hecho, tampoco serían tan descabellado calificarla como la más importante de la historia del cine. Sin embargo, cada espectador tiene una relación diferente con ella, desde los que quedaron tan marcados que luego han vuelto a verla decenas de veces hasta aquellos que simplemente no logran entender su éxito. En mi caso fue la franquicia Indiana Jones la que más me impactó durante la infancia y la adolescencia, ya que llegué un poco tarde al universo galáctico creado por George Lucas. Eso no impidió que lograra seducirme, algo que se repitió con el estreno de ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ (‘The Force Awakens’), pero, por desgracia, no ha sucedido en el caso de ‘Star Wars: Los últimos jedi’ (‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’). No puedo decir que sea mala, sobre todo como entretenimiento, pero sí que ha sido una decepción. Me encantó la noticia del fichaje de Rian Johnson para ocuparse del Episodio VIII, tanto porque había seguido con mucho interés su carrera desde el estreno de ‘Brick’ como por el hecho de que invitaba a pensar en que la trilogía al fin iba a despegar por sí misma. Y es que ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ sí tenía mucho de remake encubierto, pero su utilización era muy eficiente para situar a los nuevos personajes y dejarnos con ganas de saber a dónde nos llevarían sus aventuras. Claro que existía la posibilidad de limitarse a rehacer ‘El imperio contraataca’ ('The Empire Strikes Back'), pero habría sido un error mayúsculo. Por suerte, solamente se toman algunos elementos de la mejor entrega de la saga y se nota los esfuerzos de Johnson por construir un relato con personalidad propia, pero nunca logra dar con las teclas adecuadas para que todo encaje de forma genuina. Dicho de otra forma, los límites de la fórmula son más evidentes que nunca y los intentos de Johnson de hacer la película suya solamente funcionan a veces. Uno de los elementos más destacados es que ‘Los últimos jedi’ es la entrega de la saga que contiene más humor con diferencia. Algunos incluso querrán ver en eso una especie de prolongación de lo que tan bien está funcionado en el caso de los superhéroes de Marvel, pero parece que es más un contrapunto para evitar que la película sea demasiado oscura para un público masivo. Lo curioso es que al mismo tiempo que funciona individualmente acaba restando al conjunto. Repasando todos los golpes cómicos, me cuesta encontrar alguno que no me sacase al menos una sonrisa, toda una sorpresa en el caso de los Porgs, ya que tenía miedo de que me acabasen resultando tan repelentes como los Ewoks. El problema es que no está bien modulado, excediéndose en cosas -demasiadas criaturas en la isla donde está Luke- y aligerando de forma extraña -hay veces que casi da la sensación de rozar lo paródico- situaciones que deberían rebosar intensidad.  Quizá lo más adecuado habría sido limitar ese elemento cómico a lo que acontece entre Rey y Luke, ya que al colarse en otros frentes no solo no consigue dar la unidad deseada, sino que hace más evidente el desequilibrio resultante de separar los caminos de los protagonistas. Y es que me podréis poner todas las pegas que queráis a ‘El despertar de la fuerza’, pero una de ellas nunca será la falta de química entre Daisy Ridley y John Boyega.  Aquí a ambos les toca otros compañeros de baile y el resultado es bastante menos satisfactorio. No sé si el entusiasmo de la primera vez algo ayudó a que me dejasen tan buen sabor de boca, pero aquí eso se desvanece, sustituyéndose el espíritu de la aventura por la necesidad de cumplir su cometido. Aún brillan puntualmente, pero aquí se requiere otro tipo de interpretación de ellos y me duele decir que hay ocasiones en los que resultan un poco monótonos. Eso también se traslada al resto del reparto, donde hay situaciones que no terminan de funcionar -lo siento, Han Solo solamente hay uno, no intentes crear otro y menos si minimizas esa pillería del mítico personaje interpretado por Harrison Ford-, como si les faltara fuerza incluso cuando Johnson quiere elevar la intensidad. Es cierto que no llega a resultar mediocre y que pasas un rato agradable, pero la magia de Star Wars simplemente no está ahí. Se parece, pero no llega. Por el camino encontramos multitud de ideas interesantes como el vínculo que se crea entre Rey y Kylo -él es lo mejor de la película y Adam Driver saca provecho de ello- que ya se adelantó en los avances de la película. De hecho, es entonces cuando ‘Los últimos jedi’ está más cerca de convencerte de que realmente estás viendo ese grandioso entretenimiento que esperabas, pero es que siempre acaba sucediendo algo que rompe el encanto. Desde el humor ¿involuntario? hasta algunas lagunas del guion firmado por el propio Johnson, pasando por una serie de revelaciones que confirman que se ha ido improvisando sobre la marcha. De esta forma, ‘Los últimos jedi’ también fracasa en la necesidad de hacer mejor a ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ rellenando algunos de los vacíos que dejaba la cinta de JJ Abrams. Allí era algo que se podían permitir por todo el camino que faltaba por andar, pero algunas respuestas evidencian falta de preparación y restan tanto a lo ya visto como a lo que presentan aquí. Hay un detalle especialmente llamativo que evita que el mejor momento de la película llegue a ser brillante. Alrededor de todo esto encontramos un espectáculo más reposado en el que Johnson demuestra un gran control de la situación sobre cuándo hay que saltar de una trama a otra, tomándoselo también con calma en la evolución de cada una de ellas. Sobre el papel parece una situación ideal, pero el desarrollo de las mismas está lastrado de entrada por la necesidad de satisfacer las expectativas de una aventura de la saga y al mismo tiempo querer ofrecer algo más. Por desgracia, ese barniz mitológico que siempre ha tenido la saga resulta algo forzado, en parte porque el tratamiento de Luke no está especialmente conseguido. Eso daña a su historia con Rey y va perdiendo interés de forma lenta pero inexorable tras la alegría inicial de reencontrarnos con él. Él no cuenta con el factor “se ha muerto y te echamos de menos” que juega a favor de Carrie Fisher -de lo contrario seguro que estaríamos hablando en otros términos de cierta escena- y te deja claro que el universo realmente requiere dejar morir el pasado. Más allá de eso vuelve a ser impresionante visualmente, recreándose quizá en exceso en algunos detalles porque tenían que estar ahí,  el personaje de Benicio del Toro me intriga y atrapa lo suficiente como para querer reencontrarme con él e incluso en sus escenas menos conseguidas logra mantener un estándar en el que es fácil dejarse llevar y disfrutar. Ese mérito hay que reconocérselo, pero si somos justos, ‘La amenaza fantasma’ (‘The Phantom Menace’) también lo conseguía durante muchos tramos y ha sido vapuleada en infinidad de ocasiones. Por mi parte, me hubiese encantado salir entusiasmado de verla como le ha sucedido a muchos, pero ‘Los últimos jedi’ me deja a medias. Es como si te sucediera algo maravilloso y acto seguido pasara otra cosa que lo anulara. Eso le pasa a la película, que cuando parece que va a despegar hay algo que la devuelve a ser un entretenimiento cumplidor que me deja con menos ganas de ver la siguiente entrega de lo que logró ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ con todos sus defectos. Es verdad que en ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ ya había mucho de producto de masas intentando ir a lo que sabían o al menos creían que iba a funcionar, pero era una aventura mucho más compacta y con todo por delante. ‘Los últimos jedi’ es mucho menos vibrante y así acaban siendo más llamativos los defectos de un guion que quiere traspasar ciertos límites pero pronto llega el golpe de realidad o nostalgia hueca que la devuelve al camino marcado. Sé que quizá he sonado un poco duro en lo que digo de ‘Los últimos jedi’, pero es lo que pasa cuando algo que te encanta te da algo que simplemente te hace pasar el rato y con momentos donde detectas lo que te enamoró en primer lugar. Esto último hace que el sabor agridulce se acreciente y con el paso de las horas también la sensación de decepción. Puede que con el paso del tiempo y los revisionados prefiera quedarme con lo bueno -que lo hay-, pero a día de hoy lo que vi en pantalla me da hasta un poco de pena."
"Aug 2, 2019",positive," Nadie ha dicho que el fregado con el que se ha encontrado Rian Johnson sea sencillo. Es más, es complicadísimo: la aproximación de J.J. Abrams a la franquicia galáctica con 'El despertar de la fuerza', una plétora de guiños nostálgicos y recuperación de iconos infantiles de millones de fans, pero no muy consistente en otros aspectos, fue aclamada en taquilla y con opiniones de todos los colores entre los seguidores de la serie. 'Rogue One', una propuesta interesante sobre el papel, pecaba de tímida y conservadora, y sobre todo, no dejaba claro en qué dirección quería llevar Disney esta nueva encarnación de la saga. O quizás sí, quizás quería que la saga fuera más de lo de siempre. Rian Johnson, a estas alturas más o menos lo tenemos claro, ha intentado enfocar la serie en una dirección distinta con 'Los últimos jedi'. Lo ha intentado con humor desmitificador. Lo ha intentado con imágenes de una fuerza plástica que rivalizan con momentos icónicos de la trilogía clásica. Todo ello hace de 'Los últimos jedi' una película intrigante y de la que vale la pena hablar. Pero... ¿es suficiente? En nuestro nuevo vídeo hablamos de la película y de si va a ser capaz de hacer olvidar los hitos previos de la serie. Con abundancia de spoilers y entrando en detalle en las secuencias que más nos han gustado y disgustado, damos una cal y otra de arena. Destacamos los momentos brillantes de la película: los personajes, las secuencias cumbre, el cáustico humor que pone patas arriba algunos intocables de la franquicia... Y también le damos donde más duele, que esencialmente es... que 'Los ultimos jedi' es una película de 'Star Wars'. Con ese tonelaje insalvable y, sobre todo, con ese legado absurdo de décadas y décadas de historias acumuladas y de mitología parcialmente contradictoria que hay que respetar. Te lo desmenuzamos todo con efectos de sonido.  Rian Johnson tiene ante sí un desafío de los gordos, pero lo cierto es que su nombramiento para encabezar un futuro a medio plazo de la saga hace que quizás haya que contemplar esta entrega de otra manera. ¿O no? ¿La has visto y te ha horrorizado o todo lo contrario? Hablamos de ello y más en esta videocrítica."
"Aug 2, 2019",positive," El impacto anual del nuevo plan de Disney por explorar la franquicia comprada en su plan de expansión monopolista es cada vez menos efectivo. En tan solo dos años hemos visto tres películas de 'Star Wars'. Tres batallas espaciales con escudos protectores, maquetas y mate painting digital, láser, cgi y tíos en naves con cascos diciéndose cosas mientras la cámara los recoge en su cabina, desde el mismo ángulo y distancia en el que lo hacía la primera película, allá por el 77. Es natural asumir que las nuevas entregas ya no van a tener la misma carga de sentimiento especial por pura repetición. Incluso la vilipendiada trilogía de precuelas de George Lucas aún albergaba un carácter de evento que las nuevas tratan de imitar, sin conseguir vencer la corriente de evidencia que nos indica que son, al fin al cabo, operaciones gigantes de marketing que pueden jugar a ser cualquier género para copar el mercado cada navidad. Esto es, que una película convencional como ‘Rogue One’ se puede convertir en un blockbuster por el que esperar durante todo un año con la campaña de redes adecuada. Sin entrar en detalles de por qué ‘Star Wars: El despertar de la fuerza’ era mejor película que aquella, se entiende la ventaja a priori de una nueva trilogía que cierra los arcos de los personajes originales y los convierte en piezas del tablero de algo distinto. Y en eso, la película de J.J. Abrams lograba un éxito tremendo, porque, sea o no sea un remake del Episodio IV, lograba conectar al público con nuevos personajes mientras la presencia de Han Solo tenía un sentido como comparsa de la trama principal. Y ‘Los últimos Jedi’ logra, de nuevo, hacer esto. Hace unas semanas, exponía en un pequeño estudio las dinámicas narrativas que hacían del Episodio VII una pieza relevante dentro de la tradición, puesto que su simbolismo, sencillez y funcionalidad narrativa exigía una capacidad de síntesis que parece que se pasa por alto a la hora de analizar el cine comercial de esta categoría. Lo cierto es que su continuación, en la mayoría de aspectos, está a la altura de lo que prometía aquella, e incluso supera expectativas, pero se queda a las puertas de alcanzar un equilibro entre el papel del autor detrás del resultado y su etiqueta galáctica. Para bien o para mal, ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ era una película de ‘Star Wars’ de forma casi pura, pero sucedía que también pertenecía a su autor en un 100%. Planteaba estupendamente un montón de preguntas y en sus dos horas y pico contaba la primera fase del camino del héroe de Rey, la chica a la que seguiremos en las tres películas. El Episodio VIII contesta a muchas de esas preguntas y deja otras en el aire, adrede, pero se alza como una extraordinaria entrega que se muestra valiente en desafiar las ideas preconcebidas de la saga. Muchos comentarios aplauden y ponen de manifiesto esa voluntad renovadora, progresista dentro de una ficción que habla de religiones y dogmas. Ese descaro es valorable, pero ¿es por ello necesariamente mejor? O mejor formulada la pregunta, ¿justifica eso sus dos horas y media de duración? Y claro, la pregunta estrella, ¿Es mejor que ‘El despertar de la fuerza’? Las respuestas no están claras, pero lo cierto es que no es un episodio menos disfrutable e interesante que el anterior. Pero tiene un puñado de problemas bastante cristalinos cuyo peso sobre el resultado final depende de la disposición a hacer la vista gorda de cada uno.  Uno de sus puntos fuertes es la sólida dirección de Rian Jonston. La puesta en escena pulcra y cinemática de Abrams parece casi ingenua, comparada con la proyección visual más barroca y sofisticada del director de ‘Looper’ (2012). Parte de la sangre nueva de su estilo es la concepción de escenas mucho más contenidas en sí mismas, algo no tan habitual en el universo ‘Star Wars’, en el que casi todo se siente conectado. Como ejemplo, el momento en el que una rebelde debe lanzar unas bombas y hace lo que puede para hacer caer el controlador de estas.  Johnson acumula intensidad dramática de vida o muerte a una escena que podría servir para un clímax. Es tremendamente tensa y efectiva, pero en el transcurso de la película repetirá muchas veces el truco, con lo que se genera una textura de tira y afloja en la que parece que cada nueva situación debe ser importante en todo momento durante 152 minutos, dando énfasis a momentos en los que no acaba de pasar nada TAN relevante, como veremos a continuación.  La primera escena de lucha naval es de lo más impresionante visto en la space opera, pero crea un pico de grandiosidad tan elevado, que no le es fácil retomar el vuelo durante el resto de la película. Claro que esto también es achacable al riesgo que supone elegir contarnos la caída de los rebeldes. Es la primera vez en estas películas en la que hay una sensación de derrota constante, de que ninguno de los planes sale bien. El clímax es la aparición de Luke Skywalker y su enfrentamiento con Kylo Ren, colocado como apuesta final en el cierre de la película, pero no hay una batalla como tal, sino una huida. El desarrollo también sigue la transformación de los dos personajes clave, Kylo Ren y Rey. El primero tiene un cambio de rol final satisfactorio e importante, sin embargo, el tratamiento de Rey es menos completo. Ahora todas sus intenciones son cambiar a Ren, olvidándose de su formación, y centrándose en tratar de encontrar su papel. Pasa la mayoría de la película hecha un lío con lo que su peso en el entramado se desplaza por la presencia de Luke, y además se nos presenta como una potencial víctima del lado oscuro, al que logra vencer, sí, pero que surge un poco de la nada, como excusa errónea para darle un arco en un personaje que irradia bondad. Los dilemas del héroe en el nudo deberían cambiarle, dejarla en otro punto, dejar una gran revelación en el aire, confrontarnos y confrontarle… pero al final  no hay un vuelco que convierta su periplo en algo extraordinario, salvo haber confirmado los poderes que vimos en el anterior capítulo. Un camino que, quizá, no está a la altura de las expectativas que creaba la anterior película, pero en compensación, hay una resolución muy hermosa de los problemas que han llevado a Luke a esa posición de aislamiento.  De nuevo, es valiente al plantear a un héroe viejo, cansado, que no llega a forjar una relación maestro-alumno verdadera con Rey. No como Obi-Wan con él. No como Yoda. El momento más intenso y enternecedor de toda la película, por cierto, es la aparición del maestro verde para darle una última lección a Luke, es a través de los ojos de maestro en el momento en el que vemos al mismo joven con dudas, destrozado y encontrado de nuevo. Un regalo para el personaje que se cierra con una aparición final grandiosa, un momento crucial para la resistencia, pero no tanto para Luke, que se ha recuperado de lo suyo solo a medias. Su carga, la culpa, es otro elemento para reafirmar las teorías renovadoras de Johnson. No existe el blanco y negro, o el bien y el mal establecido en el nuevo lore de este universo. Se atreve a pintar de gris el currículum del Jedi con un acto contado en tres versiones diferentes, para acabar dibujando un fugaz intento de asesinato, aunque de intenciones nobles,  del cual se arrepiente nada más pensarlo. Nos cuesta imaginarlo en el hombre noble que hemos conocido, pero es uno con la idea de la película, aunque tenga que aparecer Rey, con un discurso típico de sitcom de los 90, para subrayar que no pasa nada, que lo importante es que no llegó a hacerlo. Todo ello nos lleva al emotivo final, con Luke desapareciendo como Obi-Wan, disolviéndose en la fuerza tras haber encendido “la mecha de la rebelión”. Un instante duro, pero bellísimo, que deja otro plano exquisito para un sacrificio comprensible en lo literal, tan abstracto como la salvación de la humanidad gracias a la muerte de Jesucristo. Un toque mesiánico para Skywalker que no sorprende en una película con varias referencias bíblicas.  Podría ser de esperar que el Jedi se le aparezca a Rey en la siguiente entrega, al menos para darle esa tercera lección que queda en el aire, ¿Tendría sentido? ¿Han llegado a ese punto de interacción de padawan y maestro? Si llegara el momento es probable que quede extraño, pero si no aparece ¿Eso ha sido todo? ¿Eso es todo lo que teníamos que ver de Luke Skywaker? Sí, la nueva trilogía quiere romper con el pasado, pero también podría haber sido una buena oportunidad para saber algunos porqués, y qué ha estado haciendo en estos años. Desde luego, dan ganas de aplaudir con las orejas en su último truco de picaresca Jedi, pero no deja de ser un final conflictivo para el personaje. La muerte de Han Solo tiene relevancia posterior para el villano de la trilogía, debemos de esperar al último capítulo para comprobar el legado de esta desaparición. El papel de Leia, por otra parte, se ve reducido por un golpe que la deja fuera de combate la mayoría de la película, pero resulta bastante insatisfactorio que no llegue a tener un cara a cara con su hijo en ningún momento.  Cuando su hermano le dice que no hay opciones de salvar a Ben y que lo va a combatir a muerte, o en el momento que nota su presencia cuando el muchacho está a punto de disparar a su nave, Leia es una madre preocupada, se aflige como si su niño no hubiese aprobado en el programa ‘Hermano mayor’, pero lo cierto es que si ella también tiene la fuerza, ¿Por qué ni un intento de conectar con su hijo? O al menos alguna nota familiar previa que nos ayude a entender cuando el chaval descarrió. Hay mucho más que aportar en ese personaje que un vuelo a lo ‘Gravity’ (2013). Desde luego, ninguno de esos son problemas importantes a nivel de ritmo o estructura. Por lo general, se mantiene más o menos fiel a su espíritu transgresor, y logra muchos momentos de altura , pero, mientras ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ tenía un desarrollo trepidante y ascendente, en ‘Los últimos Jedi’ hay un bloque por el que es difícil cruzar sin levantar los pies enfangados. Y el gran escollo de este segundo acto no es difícil de detectar: el plan. El plan de Finn y Rose es totalmente peregrino. No es fácil del todo entender que medio de una situación desesperada, se les encargue ir a buscar a un MacGyver de ida y vuelta para poder desactivar el típico cacharro de la nave de los malos, es que parece que, en esa miniaventura dentro de la principal, se ha acercado el Lucas más borracho de CGI a echar una mano con la segunda unidad. Un planeta-casino, una estampida de llamas con orejones y un uso de BB-8 totalmente improbable, deshaciéndose de todos los enemigos lanzando monedas que le han metido confundiéndole con una máquina, ¿En serio? Probablemente, esos momentos estén cerca de los más bajos de una saga que, se supone, nos estaba queriendo hacer olvidar que R2-D2 volaba. La cosa no mejora cuando el robot-pelota se pone a manejar un AT-ST. No acompaña tampoco lo lejos de lo espectacular del tratamiento de un puñado de nuevos personajes, que no hacían ninguna falta, como Rose y el ladronzuelo de Benicio del Toro. Su quítame allá esas pajas por un medalloncito de un metal extraordinario no importa. Al menos, el interpretado por una siempre brillante Laura Dern tiene un peso mayor y su final le da más sentido a su aparición. Pero con un puñado de personajes de trilogías anteriores, más los incorporados en ‘El despertar de la fuerza’, dudosamente hacían falta más piezas en el tablero. Esto solo consigue embarullar más esa segunda fase, en la que nos hartamos de ver el escudo de protección de la nave rebelde recibiendo disparos láser. Y cuando parece que todo empieza a moverse, tenemos una huida de pequeñas naves rebeldes volviendo a recibir tiros durante otro buen rato. Una situación un tanto repetitiva que suena a excusa deliberada de guionista para ganar tiempo mientras se colocan las cosas en orden para el tercer acto. Mientras ‘El  despertar de la fuerza’ era fiel al corsé de no utilizar chistes que impuso George Lucas, sí utilizaba el humor como tejido conectivo de su tono jovial, aventurero y dicharrachero. No pretendía lograr la carcajada sino hacer que sus personajes ganaran carisma o la mantuvieran, como en el caso de Han Solo, un ejemplo perfecto de que el humor de la saga siempre ha sido muy tontorrón. Un humor de mímica, heredero del cine mudo, con más que ver con la cinemática y la ocurrencia. El humor de Johnson, sin embargo es más premeditado. Para bien o para mal, introduce el chiste prohibido. Hay una mayor sensación de autoconsciencia, frente a la ingenuidad encantadora del ‘Episodio VII’. En ocasiones parece que quiere entrar directamente en la comedia pura, paródica. Como bien dice mi compañero John Tones, recuerda a un humor más propio de ‘La loca historia de las galaxias’ (Spaceballs, 1987), con algunos gags desmitificadores, muchos cargados de brillante ironía, que rompen la solemnidad de momentos tan intensos como el final de la anterior, irremediablemente condenado a perder su mística al retomarla, tras ver la reacción de Luke en este otro. Son golpes, la mayoría de veces afortunados, pero que en ocasiones pueden empachar. El humor, fuera de las frases ingeniosas, tiene algunos de los gags en el límite del desconcierto. El tono crea un caldo de cultivo para que momentos que no parecen diseñados para crear ese efecto, resulten en cierta manera perversa, bastante divertidos, como ese momento en el que Luke descubre a Rey y Kylo haciendo “manitas” psíquicas y entra como si fuera un monitor que ha pillado a dos adolescentes del campamento cohabitando en una tienda de campaña. Lo que nos lleva a otro tema que estaba implícito y aquí se consolida. La relación de Rey y Kylo que se establecía con montajes paralelos e intercambios de miradas en la anterior, es implícitamente sexual. A través de símbolos como la mano mojada de Solo, su aparición a torso descubierto, o la lágrima de Rey al tocar el dedo de Ren, puede palparse la atracción de esos dos polos opuestos en cada una de sus apariciones juntos. Rey parece determinada a repudiar a Ren, pero acaba acercándose a él, y luchando codo con codo en un giro sorprendente y valiente. Cuando se retoma el conflicto, una explosión resuelve el momento a las bravas, pero por el camino deja un planteamiendo de héroe y villano complejo, y tremendamente interesante. Algo que ha creado incomodidad entre el fandom son las distintas afrentas hacia el legado de Lucas. Aunque pueden tomarse como un corte de mangas de autor, en realidad tienen algo de movimiento industrial, un ardid de Disney para ir preparando al mundo a un nuevo universo de ‘Star Wars’ en el que no va a haber contactos con la historia que ya conocíamos. En realidad, en ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ ya se hacía esto de forma simbólica con la muerte de Solo y un clímax en el que se apostaba exclusivamente por los nuevos personajes en una pelea a tres. Sin embargo, aquí se trata de verbalizar. Se repite en boca de los personajes, a los que solo les falta romper la cuarta pared para azuzarnos contra la nostalgia. Si en la de Abrams el elemento de nostalgia se materializaba, sobre todo, en un sable láser y el Halcón Milenario, ‘Los últimos Jedi’ va más a la encía con los dados de la suerte de Han Solo o el holograma vintage de la princesa Leia saliendo de R2-D2, (sí, el de ‘ayúdame Obi-Wan’). Además, tenemos aparición del Yoda marioneta, el de toda la vida, de nuevo para reivindicar lo antiguo frente al de las precuelas y en el momento climático, cuando Luke se difumina, ocurre en un atardecer de dos soles como los de Tatooine.  En su voluntad de cortar con los clichés, la afición por sacar estrellas de la muerte tan caricaturesca parece haber acabado. Pero, sin embargo, no han podido resistirse en hacer una mención bastante gratuita, cuando un ariete láser aparece en los momentos finales, y Finn, que conoce de primera mano el arsenal del imperio, se refiere a él como una “mini-estrella de la muerte”. A la fuerza rogando y con el mazo dando. Y eso que no hemos entrado en el factor ‘reboot’. Se ha comentado en muchas ocasiones que ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ tiene muchas similitudes con el ‘Episodio IV’ de la saga, y es sencillo comprobar ciertos aspectos de la trama que discurren de forma similar. Pero, aunque la plantilla de trabajo fuera la misma, había un énfasis diferente en cada uno de los elementos que conformaban el tablero, de modo que ninguno de ellos tenía el mismo peso en ambas películas, el foco apuntaba a lugares diferentes, por mucho que uno se empeñe en encontrar similitudes. En ‘Los últimos Jedi’ la trama que narra cómo los rebeldes son casi aplastados parece nueva. Como hemos comentado, hay un espíritu renovador consciente, muy machacado en el guion. Pero, de nuevo, lo está escrito en el texto no siempre se prodiga en la práctica. Se puede interpretar de muchas maneras su intención, sí, pero lo cierto es que la película de Johnson no es menos “remake” que la de Abrams, aunque lo esconde de forma más o menos audaz. Al igual que el ‘Episodio VII’, no por ello deja de ser una obra casi sobresaliente, pero el ejercicio de reciclado de ‘El imperio contraataca’ y ‘El retorno del Jedi’ es bastante evidente. El elemento más claro, obviamente, es el entrenamiento Jedi en la isla del origen de la orden, que hace las veces de Dagobah. El ritual sigue un camino similar al que vimos en ‘El imperio contraataca’. La resistencia inicial del maestro al entrenamiento, su carácter cascarrabias, e incluso el propio emplazamiento, con pequeños homenajes más o menos conscientes, como ese Ala-X de Luke bajo el agua, que aquí indicaría la decisión del piloto de quedar aislado para siempre del resto del mundo. Ahora él es el Yoda y Rey es él.  Johnson parece no pretender evitar que la situación siga al modelo. Rey decide interrumpir la formación para tratar de recuperar a Kylo Ren, convencida de que aún hay bien en él. Sí, exactamente lo mismo que Luke hizo por su padre en ‘El retorno del Jedi’. Aunque en ‘El imperio contraataca’ primero se iba para ayudar a sus amigos, aquí se toma el atajo hasta el ‘Episodio VI’ y tenemos una rendición total de Rey a Ren. En tierra se queda Luke, charlando con el fantasma de Yoda sobre el destino del pupilo, tal y como hacía Yoda con el fantasma de Obi-Wan, discutiendo detalles sobre si es el último Jedi o no.  Todo esto lleva a una representación, en clave de arte moderno, de la escena en la que se desarrollaba el intenso triángulo de Luke, Darth Vader y el emperador Palpatine. Un momento que transcurre de forma más o menos similar pero ahora con Rey, Kilo Ren y Snoke: unos rayos azules de castigo, un tormento del padawan con imágenes de los rebeldes sufriendo incontables bajas en el espacio, y la rebelión del discípulo del lado oscuro a su maestro, solo que esta vez, después de liberar al héroe, el villano no se redime sino que se queda con el puesto de emperador. Pero ah, no sin antes extender la mano a Rey y proponerle gobernar la galaxia como padre e hi... digamos como ¿amantes? A estos calcos hay que sumarle pequeños momentos de resampleo menos evidente, como el esa deserción de Finn, similar al de Han Solo en la primera película. Hacerse pasar por soldados del imperio para desactivar un rayo tractor, igual que en el ‘Episodio IV’, y si ya nos vamos más cerca, de la propia ‘Rogue One’. El truco sigue funcionando, pero, oigan, igual en dos películas, dos años seguidos, ya canta. Por si acaso también está la traición del personaje de Benicio del Toro en el momento culminante, lo que explicaría que no aparezca Lando Calrisian por ninguna parte. Y, a falta de Han Solo, bueno es tener una nueva aparición en último momento del Halcón milenario para lanzar unos cuantos tiros a los malos con un ¡yuhu! ¿Qué malos? Unos cuantos AT-AT acercándose a una base rebelde, similar a la del planeta Hoth, que en vez de nieve tiene sal. Uno de esos momentos en los que alguien en la sala de guionistas propone “El principio de ‘El imperio contraataca’ se coloca al final, y así nadie se dará cuenta”. Una secuencia, por otra parte, increíblemente preciosa a nivel visual, con su suelo cada vez más rojo, de la misma manera que la mansión de ‘La cumbre escarlata' (Crimsom Peak, 2015) del otro del Toro. Como fuerza creativa, Johnson se postula como el renovador de la saga, pero aunque hayamos visto que no es tan rompedora con lo antiguo, sí que parece querer mostrarse bastante opuesta a la apertura de Abrams. Puesto que mucho de lo que construía aquella, aquí parece ser derribado para volver a empezar de nuevo. Si Rey encontraba el sable de Luke, aquí acaba destrozado en dos. La religión Jedi acaba en llamas. No hay mucha reverencia al acabar con iconos antiguos como el Admirante Ackbar.  C3-PO y R2-D2 son poco más que cameos, incluso  Chewbacca es uno alargado, solo se hace un pequeño guiño a su tristeza porla muerte de su compañero de aventuras durante años. Sin embargo, es más amable con apariciones como Maz Kanata vía holograma, para proveer de una información que, por otra parte, podría haber dado Poe Dameron él mismo. Un personaje, por cierto, al que se le da cierto arco como aspirante a líder enfrentado a Holdo, comenzando un motín interno que, una vez se despierta Leia, se demuestra inútil. Huir de las antiguas ideas, como intención, se enfrenta al hecho de que hacen falta nuevos aportes lo suficientemente potentes para sustituirlas. Hay muchas de las cosas que hacía bien el anterior episodio que no han tenido continuidad. Por ejemplo, los intereses amorosos, que estaban llevados al mínimo, se trasforman en un romance descuidado, de última hora, como si a los ejecutivos del estudio se les hubiera ocurrido meter el detalle a presión, quedando doblemente extraño con un beso un poco fuera de lugar.  Uno de los momentos más dudosos y forzados es el enfrentamiento de Finn contra Phasma, una némesis que nunca acaba de desarrollarse desde el ligero apunte de ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ pero que aparece aquí como un momento cumbre. En ausencia de un sable laser, Finn toma un arma con resplandor azul para luchar con su “maestra”, cuyo final es un poco tópico, caída cual coyote de Tex Avery, en medio de una orgía de fuego que se percibe como concesión al blockbuster rutinario. Hay otros detalles un poco parodiables. Como ese estilismo de Snoke, que quizá intenta compensar su fealdad con un batín de Hugh Hefner y, sobre todo, ese comentado vuelo del espacio de Leia a lo  Mary Poppins. Seguro que está lleno de buena intención, y no es malo recordar que, al fin y al cabo, suponemos que Organa/Skywalker es una Jedi, o debería serlo tras las promesas de la trilogía original, pero la ejecución del momento está lejos de convertirse en un testamento estelar para la desaparecida Carrie Fisher. Toda la universalidad de conceptos que tenía el anterior ciclo, como el héroe homérico, el descubrimiento artúrico, son completadas por referencias religiosas más expresas, obvias en su segunda lectura. Tenemos el sacrificio de Abraham por aquí y algunas cruces puestas intencionadamente por allá, pero en su desmitificación a dos bandas pierde algo del poder de comunicación atemporal que hace que ‘Star Wars’ llegue a distintas generaciones. ‘Los últimos Jedi’ patina es en sus, por suerte no abundantes, intentos de ser relevante e incluir un discurso que hable sobre la actualidad. Si lo mejor de la trilogía de precuelas era el arriesgado, (y nada habitual en el cine fantástico), movimiento de Lucas por exponer que los caudillos aparecen siempre detrás de sonrisas durante un paciente desarrollo de tres películas, aquí Johnson prefiere, de nuevo, colocar el mensaje en boca de los protagonistas.  La charla sobre la resistencia de la vicealmirante Holdo tiene ciertas implicaciones subersivas con el terrorismo, pero el pueril y trasnochado alegato animalista —es la mejor película de la saga contra las carreras de caballos— está metido con destornillador. La pormenorizada explicación sobre los especuladores de la guerra, traficantes de armas y corporaciones explotadoras no tiene más relevancia en la trama que tratar de actualizar el rostro del mal, apuntando al neoliberalismo global. Lo cual, todo sea dicho, no deja de tener su gracia que venga desde el estudio Disney, que espera recaudar dos mil millones de dólares con la película para sumar a los tres mil de las dos anteriores. Su discurso rupturista es refrescante, pero se echa en falta alguna idea sobre las razones del ascenso de Snoke y la primera orden, algo ausente en ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ que es de nuevo ignorado, sin dar apuntes que expliquen cómo el Imperio, aparentemente derrotado por la muerte del Emperador Palpatine y la destrucción de la Estrella de la Muerte logró reformarse hasta este punto, aunque lo importante es que nos deja la puerta abierta a otra clase distinta de imperio y también de alianza rebelde. Lo cierto es que, gracias a la rotunda dirección, su extasiante belleza plástica, y su capacidad de crear momentos de intensidad épica, 'Los últimos Jedi' se sobrepone a los baches y se alza como una enorme aportación al legado de la saga. Quizá no es el capítulo que esperábamos, con un guion con tendencia al trazo grueso y poco elegante al transmitir su tema, pero está totalmente a la altura de las circunstancias, y aunque se haga el duro, aún cree y nos hace creer en la magia."
"Jul 21, 2019",positive," When Star Wars: The Force Awakens debuted exactly two years ago, its detractors groused that it was a timid and lazy movie insofar as it never deviated much from the template established by the original Star Wars back in 1977. I would counter that this isn’t exactly true – while it did borrow plenty of plot points from George Lucas’ first baby, it did so in imaginative and exciting ways – but never mind. Star Wars: The Last Jedi likely won’t be dismissed with similar charges, even if one sizable chunk feels like a rehash of The Empire Strikes Back. Written and directed by Rian Johnson, The Last Jedi is very much its own entity, exploring new routes as it teases out themes that have always been present in the Skywalker saga. It’s a bold and challenging work — exactly what we would expect from the auteur of Brick and Looper. In the debit column, it’s also a tad bloated, and it contains an almost risible number of false endings — admittedly not as many as the 42 or so that closed The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, but enough to draw attention. The last thing anyone would want in a review of a new Star Wars movie is spoilers, so let’s tread carefully, shall we? As we saw at the end of The Force Awakens, new Jedi on the block Rey (Daisy Ridley) has finally made contact with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who’s been hiding out on an island populated by Porgs (this movie’s equivalent of those infernal Ewoks, though thankfully employed only sparingly). Meanwhile, in another part of the galaxy, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is doing her best to keep the Resistance from being crushed by the First Order. In other story strands, the bravery exhibited by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is weighed against his recklessness; Finn (John Boyega) finds a new friend in maintenance worker Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran); and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) continues to fret and fume and throw tantrums with the best of them. Actually, the character arc given to Kylo Ren is an excellent one, marking him as one of this entry’s most intriguing players. Yet the greatest appeal is in watching Hamill and Fisher again explore and expand upon their iconic roles. Fisher delivers a commanding performance in both senses of the word, and knowing that her tragic death means this will be her final appearance further lends the proceedings a somber and bittersweet tone. As for Hamill, this might represent his finest work in the 40-year-old franchise. Johnson allows the character of Luke Skywalker to evolve in some startling and unexpected ways, and Hamill is with him every step of the way, contributing a turn that’s weighty and wonderful. At 152 minutes, The Last Jedi is the longest of the nine Star Wars films to date — it’s also the only one where the length is felt (that riveting Trade Federation chat that opens The Phantom Menace, though…). While all the scenes involving younglings should have been deep-sixed, the rest of the fatty tissue can be forgiven, since it simply meant Johnson wanted to make sure fans were saturated and satisfied. Yet there aren’t many vignettes that couldn’t have benefited from a judicious trim here or there. Still, this is a minor quibble when placed against the magnitude of the movie. Between its acute attention to character growth, the excellent effects that serve rather than dominate, and the poignant moments that tie back to past entries (a particular scene that employs a snippet of vintage footage is nothing less than glorious), it’s easy to imagine true believers’ emotions hitting hyperdrive as they anticipate the concluding chapter that’s landing on December 20, 2019."
"Jul 17, 2019",positive," In the lead up to the Star Wars: The Force Awakens release two years ago, most excited fans ignored the studio’s chosen title for the film and just referred to it as “New Star Wars.” But it wasn’t. Not really. The Force Awakens was an artfully curated exercise in weaponized nostalgia designed to reintroduce a beloved mythology to brand new audiences. It mixed the old and the new well enough to function, but JJ Abrams was tasked with recontextualizing A New Hope more than he was with creating something brand new. Seeds were planted for the future, but revisiting the film now, it doesn’t hold the same power it did opening weekend. The Last Jedi actually is New Star Wars. With the groundwork laid to rest in the previous outing, Looper writer/director Rian Johnson is free to plot a new course, resulting in a film that is very recognizably “Star Wars” in tone and scope, but executed with more sound filmcraft than its predecessor. Since it’s Act Two of the new trilogy, some expected this new chapter to rhyme with Empire Strikes Back and hew darker in tone with a more down-note cliffhanger conclusion. But Johnson has created a Star Wars film that balances heavy stakes with light hearted frivolity, that couches disturbing revelations within refrains of hope. Whether it’s the best film in the canon is sure to be a tiresome debate but it’s easily the most exhilarating blockbuster experiences of the year. As everyone behind the film has gone to great lengths to protect the film’s plot details, a rundown of The Last Jedi’s narrative would be a disservice to anyone who wants to see the film blind. Episode VIII takes place not long after the closing moments of the last film, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeking out help from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and The Resistance want Luke back just as badly as Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and The First Order want him dead, so the mystery of why he’s gone full hermit drives much of the film’s story. The other two thirds of the new trilogy’s holy trinity, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) each have their own thrilling B-plots that run parallel to Rey’s quest, but another major player, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) emerges as a compelling lead equal to the others in emotional resonance, even if she receives less screen time than the conflicted Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Every single cast member avails themselves quite nicely, but it’s Tran who steals the show for the newer characters. She’s impossible not to fall for. As for the old guard, the realization that this is the last we’ll ever truly see of General Leia is disheartening, but Fisher is as great as she’s always been. However this trilogy ends up turning out, knowing the next film was intended to be her big showing (the way The Force Awakens was Han’s) will always be its greatest tragedy. This film’s core performance, though, must be Hamill’s. This man has waited years to get this shot and he knocks it out of the fucking park, delivering the best turn in his career and reinventing Luke as a man wrestling with his own legend. So much of the film is about burning down the past and forging ahead anew, and no one embodies that more than Luke. This being “Star Wars” and not “Intergalactic Conflict,” the battle between good and evil, right and wrong, has to be writ large, all encompassing, with everyone in the cosmos choosing a side. More than ever, this outing seems the most concerned with each individual character’s fluid alignment for and against the central cause of resistance. In the macro, one of the film’s weaknesses is its inability to clearly define its villains and the real power behind their motivations, but on a micro scale, all the film’s central figures are given recognizable arcs that tie together thematically. Johnson’s script, while on the bloated side (especially the latter half of the third act), is remarkably character driven, with the prime players and their decisions informing the direction of the story, rather than shoddy plotting and the necessity for regularly timed set pieces. But when there is an action sequence, and the film houses many, they’re immaculately arranged segments of cinema that make it clear why Johnson was the right man to helm this film. His prior work shows an artist with a shrewd appreciation for visual storytelling, so blowing up his style to the size of iMAX means his work retains its necessary clarity, resulting in one of the few big budget IP exercises that would function just as well stripped of its nostalgic brand recognition solely on the strength of its potent building blocks. It’s imperfect, yes, and there’s a few wrong notes throughout that will surely stick out across its two and a half hour run time, but this is a film that works. The writing, direction, cinematography, score, editing and performances are firing on all cylinders in concert. The Last Jedi runs like such a well oiled machine that its forgivable sputters and false starts stick out more than they might in a lesser film. Upon first watch, few will find much to dislike about this movie, and the realization that Abrams is returning for Episode IX will make most long for this trilogy to be over so Johnson can come back and kick start the next one. But after a week or two of think pieces and countless writers trying to ascribe the film’s aspirational statements about the nature of hope and the necessity of resistance to our depressing reality will ignite any backlash this crowd pleaser ends up receiving. The Last Jedi has quite a few potent moments, the kind of heart soaring peaks pop art popcorn flicks so rarely seem to achieve anymore. Within the nebulous, somewhat ill-defined world of “Star Wars” morality, these cinematic aphorisms have weight, but those wishing to pluck them wholesale from a galaxy far, far away and into the all too chilling world we actually live in will find them wanting. At its core, Johnson can only push the Disney machine so far. This is still a cash cow designed to sell merchandise. Anyone going in thinking someone has finally cracked the monoculture code and created One Film To Rule Them All will be disappointed. But for a damn good time at the movies, bolstered by a buoyant sense of hope for a darkened world, nothing else in 2017 will leave you feeling like there’s still a chance, even if life after the credits will do its damnedest to convince you otherwise. Early Water doesn’t have much of an arc — after all, it’s a rehearsal tape. But it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters. "
"Jun 21, 2019",positive," *NOTE: The original headline read STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI Frustrates As Much As It Thrills.  Upon a second viewing, I felt it necessary to edit my review. I’ll admit, as a lifelong STAR WARS fan, a release of a new film always puts me on edge. I can admit when I’m wrong and THE LAST JEDI is a thrilling chapter in the STAR WARS saga. The second time around, most of the flaws held true, but overall the light side far outweighed the dark. My original review can be found unedited at the bottom of this article.  There’s a moment in THE LAST JEDI where the villainous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) smashes his helmet in a fit of rage after being belittled by Supreme Leader Snoke for his costume. Ren’s get up was as much an ode to the character’s idol Darth Vader as it was a throwback to the original STAR WARS trilogy. The latest STAR WARS adventure seeks to “destroy the past”— a theme in the film—by attempting to avoid the critiques of 2017’s THE FORCE AWAKENS being simply a retread of the 1977 original. While JEDI certainly is not a riff on THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it does feel like writer/director Rian Johnson culled sequences from EMPIRE, RETURN OF THE JEDI—and even takes a few cues from the maligned prequel trilogy—and rearranged them at random. If THE FORCE AWAKENS was the film to get older fans back in the saddle, THE LAST JEDI is made for the generation of STAR WARS fans that were introduced to the dysfunctional Skywalkers through Padme, Ani, and Qui Gon Jin. That said, there’s enough of those terrific, classic STAR WARS stylings—a dirty, lived in universe, frontier style landscapes, and a brisk sense of fun—to satisfy the old timers as well. Featuring slam-bang action, lots of quick and witty dialogue, and some terrifically memorable character moments. the more modern in style LAST JEDI is certainly overstuffed, at times exhausting and even unsatisfying, but remains a thrilling STAR WARS adventure. The film opens what feels like days or perhaps hours after the climax of THE FORCE AWAKENS with the Resistance on the run from the evil First Order. The opening space battle is thrilling and compellingly shot; director Rian Johnson gives the audience a real sense of space, never crowding the screen with too many ships and giving a real sense of urgency and emotion to the action as hotshot flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) takes on a dreadnaught Star Destroyer on his own. THE LAST JEDI then makes way into an extended chase sequence—owing a bit to MAD MAX: FURY ROAD—that extends through most of the film’s almost three hour run time. The film hits the ground running and keeps running. THE LAST JEDI feels like it’s rushing towards the finish line, never slowing down enough to give the characters a real chance to breathe and get to know one another, and by that allowing the audience to do the same. The runtime of the film leads to pacing issues; sometimes there can be too much of a good things, and sometimes Johnson doesn’t know what the good thing is. One of the most entertaining tropes of the series is when the characters get to explore fantastic new worlds. The heroes split up, with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) training Rey (Daisy Ridley) on the misty planet of Ahch-To, Dameron dealing with a power struggle with Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) while on the run from The First Order, and Finn (John Boyega) and newly introduced freedom fighter Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) on a mission to a casino on Canto Bight. Canto Bight—a sort of Monte Cristo meets French Riviera—is a stand out in THE LAST JEDI. The audience is introduced to the 1% of the STAR WARS universe: arms dealers decked out in evening wear and sipping on champagne, featuring inspired, classic sci-fi style costuming on its police force that recalls the old Marvel run of STAR WARS comic books and Ralph McQuarrie concept art. Unfortunately for as much as Johnson’s camera sweeps around the planet and the interior of the gambling parlor, the audience never really gets a chance to take in the surroundings, the film almost cutting away each time things really seem to be getting interesting. In the sequences between Rey and Luke, it feels like they barely get to know each other, much less have her trained to use the Force. There’s so much intercutting going on between the heroes and the villains that Kylo Ren—arguably the most interesting and complex character of the new films—gets the short shrift. Adam Driver mopes and mumbles throughout the film and really only gets to come alive in the third act when Ren becomes unhinged. While STAR WARS is best told in broad strokes, lending to the imagination of the audience, it helps to slow down and look around. As a result, the film feels disjointed.THE LAST JEDI is made for a different generation of film fan than the original series, its pacing having more in common with a Marvel superhero story, HARRY POTTER, or LORD OF THE RINGS (particularly with its multiple endings.). The telepathic conversations between Kylo Ren and Rey especially feel clunky, telling the audience big bits of exposition rather than showing. While a STAR WARS film—or any actioner—should indeed move quickly and keep the audience entertained, THE LAST JEDI feels more like a collection of moments—albeit genuinely exciting and visually impressive moments—rather than a complete story. While the plotting of the film may be half-baked, the characters come alive in THE LAST JEDI, propelling the film. John Boyega shines, as does Kelly Marie Tran. Together, they supply the film with that camaraderie one expects  and wants from a STAR WARS film. They join the lineage of great onscreen duos, from Han and Luke to Threepio and Artoo. There’s an easy-going, natural chemistry between the two actors that translates to the screen and the characters. There is even a hint of romance that was sorely missing from THE FORCE AWAKENS and spinoff film, ROGUE ONE. Tran brings a depth and coolness to her character that makes it impossible to take your eyes off her whenever she’s onscreen. Their storyline leads them to master hacker DJ played with genuine gusto by Benicio Del Toro. The villains remain the most interesting and complex characters of the new trilogy and it’s terrifically fun to watch Kylo Ren and General Hux (Domhall Gleeson) jockey for control of The First Order. While it’s wonderful to see Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill again, this film really does belong to the new characters, which is a double edged lightsaber. Older fans are going to leave wishing they spent more time with Luke and Leia, but this isn’t their story. This is a modernly directed STAR WARS tale for the next generation, and the film focuses on the new crew of heroes. There’s a brisk sense humor that flows through THE LAST JEDI. When the jokes hit, they hit hard like they came from the Lawrence Kasdan playbook (particularly Poe Dameron tooling with General Hux in the films opening) but some of the one liners—cribbing from the quippy style of Joss Whedon’s AVENGERS films and the Marvel Cinematic Universe—draw attention to themselves and cut down the soapy drama that has propelled the STAR WARS series since EMPIRE. There’s a particular crack from Daisy Ridley’s Rey about a shirtless Kylo Ren that while funny, really doesn’t have a place in the scene and in turn kills any dramatic tension.There’s also an abundance of slapstick that—while always a part of the series—seems to have more in common with Jar Jar Binks than Artoo and Threepio. Sometimes it plays, more often it doesn’t. Not everything needs to be gritty, but THE LAST JEDI could have benefited from leaning into some darker places. The film does tie up loose ends and attempts to give payoffs to the hanging threads not only from THE FORCE AWAKENS but Luke Skywalker’s personal journey from the original films. There does seem to be an attempt to squeeze the best elements of EMPIRE and RETURN OF THE JEDI into the film, the problem is, some of it feels unearned as they’re happening just too soon in the series. Ridley, Driver, and Andy Serkis’ as Snoke do command the screen when they’re together, bringing a real sense of pulpy drama to rehashed EMPIRE STRIKES BACK via RETURN OF THE JEDI bits. One of the best is the confrontation between Finn and Captain Phasma, having been expertly, and simply built upon from THE FORCE AWAKENS. The audience hasn’t spent enough time with these characters for the pay offs to carry any real weight and on the flipside, Luke Skywalker’s arc feels a touch unsatisfying, but at the same time perfectly fits in the theme of hope that has flowed through STAR WARS since 1977.  Hamill delivers a great performance, but his character feels lost in the shuffle. Hamill’s reunion with Artoo is a stand out in the film filled with so much emotion, despite the fact that he’s talking to what amounts to a prop. It’s a perfect blend of characterization and nostalgia for long time fans. THE LAST JEDI thrills far more than it frustrates. There’s so much good in the film: the set design and costuming are spot on from the beat up leather jackets, to the samurai influenced Praetorian guards, and an ultra cool Luke Skywalker in Jedi garb. There is a gangbusters lightsaber battle that—while not as rough and sweaty as this reviewer would have liked—is an all timer and the reveal of Rey’s lineage is smartly written by Johnson and wonderfully played by Driver and Ridley. John Williams’ score is arguably the real star of the film this time around,  expertly weaving new themes with the classics that have been rattling around in fans’ brains for forty years and Johnson pulls off some truly beautiful shots. Unfortunately, with a STAR WARS film being released what will probably be every year until we all become one with the Force, there will be more pretty ok ones than truly great ones. THE LAST JEDI sits somewhere in the middle as a very good entry in the STAR WARS series. Johnson takes some risks with the story—maybe not enough of them to truly make THE LAST JEDI a classic—and some of them pay off, and some of them fall flat, or feel like cheats. With J.J. Abrams coming back in the fold for the trilogy’s conclusion, perhaps his more traditional approach to filmmaking can provide a satisfying conclusion to this interesting new saga. There’s a moment in THE LAST JEDI where the villainous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) smashes his helmet in a fit of rage after being belittled by Supreme Leader Snoke for his costume. Ren’s get up was as much an ode to the character’s idol Darth Vader as it was a throwback to the original STAR WARS trilogy. The latest STAR WARS adventure seeks to “destroy the past”— a theme in the film—by attempting to avoid the critiques of 2017’s THE FORCE AWAKENS being simply a retread of the 1977 original. While JEDI certainly is not a riff on THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it does feel like writer/director Rian Johnson culled sequences from EMPIRE, RETURN OF THE JEDI—and even takes a few cues from the maligned prequel trilogy—and rearranged them at random. If THE FORCE AWAKENS was the film to get older fans back in the saddle, THE LAST JEDI is made for the generation of STAR WARS fans that were introduced to the dysfunctional Skywalkers through Padme, Ani, and Qui Gon Jin. While infinitely more enjoyable than the prequel trilogy featuring slam-bang action, witty dialogue, and some terrifically memorable character moments, the more modern in style LAST JEDI just misses the mark, feeling overstuffed and at the same time more hollow than audiences expect from STAR WARS. The film opens what feels like days or perhaps hours after the climax of THE FORCE AWAKENS with the Resistance on the run from the evil First Order. The opening space battle is thrilling and compellingly shot; director Rian Johnson gives the audience a real sense of space, never crowding the screen with too many ships and giving a real sense of urgency and emotion to the action as hotshot flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) takes on a dreadnaught Star Destroyer on his own. THE LAST JEDI then makes way into an extended chase sequence—owing a bit to MAD MAX: FURY ROAD—that extends through most of the film’s almost three hour run time. The film hits the ground running and keeps running. THE LAST JEDI feels like it’s rushing towards the finish line, never slowing down enough to give the characters a real chance to breathe and get to know one another, and by that allowing the audience to do the same. One of the most entertaining tropes of the series is when the characters get to explore fantastic new worlds. The heroes split up, with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) training Rey (Daisy Ridley) on the misty planet of Ahch-To, Dameron dealing with a power struggle with Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) while on the run from The First Order, and Finn (John Boyega) and newly introduced freedom fighter Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) on a mission to a casino on Canto Bight. Canto Bight—a sort of Monte Cristo meets French Riviera—is a stand out in THE LAST JEDI. The audience is introduced to the 1% of the STAR WARS universe: arms dealers decked out in evening wear and sipping on champagne, featuring inspired, classic sci-fi style costuming on its police force that recalls the old Marvel run of STAR WARS comic books and Ralph McQuarrie concept art. Unfortunately for as much as Johnson’s camera sweeps around the planet and the interior of the gambling parlor, the audience never really gets a chance to take in the surroundings, the film almost cutting away each time things really seem to be getting interesting. In the sequences between Rey and Luke, it feels like they barely get to know each other, much less have her trained to use the Force. There’s so much intercutting going on between the heroes and the villains that Kylo Ren—arguably the most interesting and complex character of the new films—gets the short shrift. Adam Driver mopes and mumbles throughout the film and really only gets to come alive in the third act when Ren becomes unhinged. While STAR WARS is best told in broad strokes, lending to the imagination of the audience, it helps to slow down and look around. As a result, the film feels disjointed.THE LAST JEDI is made for a different generation of film fan than the original series, its pacing having more in common with a Marvel superhero story, HARRY POTTER, or LORD OF THE RINGS (particularly with its multiple endings.). The telepathic conversations between Kylo Ren and Rey especially feel clunky, telling the audience big bits of exposition rather than showing. While a STAR WARS film—or any actioner—should indeed move quickly and keep the audience entertained, THE LAST JEDI feels more like a collection of moments—albeit genuinely exciting and visually impressive moments—rather than a complete story. While the plotting of the film may be half-baked, the characters come alive in THE LAST JEDI, propelling the film. John Boyega shines, as does Kelly Marie Tran. Together, they supply the film with that camaraderie one expects  and wants from a STAR WARS film. They join the lineage of great onscreen duos, from Han and Luke to Threepio and Artoo. There’s an easy-going, natural chemistry between the two actors that translates to the screen and the characters. There is even a hint of romance that was sorely missing from THE FORCE AWAKENS and spinoff film, ROGUE ONE. Tran brings a depth and coolness to her character that makes it impossible to take your eyes off her whenever she’s onscreen. Their storyline leads them to master hacker DJ played with genuine gusto by Benicio Del Toro. The villains remain the most interesting and complex characters of the new trilogy and it’s terrifically fun to watch Kylo Ren and General Hux (Domhall Gleeson) jockey for control of The First Order. While it’s wonderful to see Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill again, this film really does belong to the new characters, which is a double edged lightsaber.

"Jun 18, 2019",positive," 5 – I think it’s super-neato-cool that you have spent the last two years talking about how you didn’t like The Force Awakens—and, thus, aren’t looking forward to The Last Jedi—because you thought it “ripped off” A New Hope. Using that logic, computers ripped off typewriters and the internet totally bogarted the encyclopedia’s jam. Building off things while improving on them is apparently only unnatural to creationists and OG Star Wars fans. Going into any installment of any series primed to hate it only makes an ass out of “u” and me. Or something. Like the storied, legendary oracles En Vogue once said, “Free your mind, and the rest will follow.” 4 – The Last Jedi not only doesn’t care that we’ve spent the last two years agonizing over certain mysteries, backstories and destinies, it actively LOLs at us for doing so. The way Luke (Mark Hamill) reacts to Rey (Daisy Ridley) handing him his lightsaber is like a Rickroll from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far in your face. Writer/director Rian Johnson immediately establishes that he is the first director interested in using the most beloved franchise in film history to actually share a timely thematic message and say something. And what he says will shock you! You’ve got to see what’s number one below! Sorry, the impending loss of internet freedom after the FCC’s net neutrality vote has me feeling a little clickbaity. 3 – The Last Jedi’s first half is clunky. Finn (John Boyega) gets paired with Rose (Kelly Marie Tran)—a kindly Rebel grunt who is easily my favorite new character in this new trilogy—to get a code or something to shut something off or something… The character dynamics work, but that subplot substantively does not. Poe (Oscar Isaac) is paired with Leia (Carrie Fisher) in a subplot about the future of the resistance, while Luke and Rey invert expectations about Jedi training and the very nature of the Force. If George Lucas shat upon the sanctity of the Force with the prequels, Johnson scrubs it clean and holy again. It all culminates in a breathtaking finale that blows every Death Star kaboom out the damn water. 2 – Before we get to Johnson’s inspired, poignant message, let me say that Benecio del Toro needs to stop it. He needs to stop it right the hell now. Ever since The Usual Suspects, we have quietly enabled him to do goofy, dumb shit with his voice, pretending it was cool. It’s not cool, Benecio. It’s never been cool. You’re just bored, and it’s weird. I barely noticed the gaping plot hole your character created because you were so busy having tiny seizures or picking your teeth with your uvula or whatever that fake stuttering crap was you were doing. 1 – The Last Jedi simultaneously condemns the notion of importance by virtue of birthright and elevates the power and responsibility inherent in the masses. In the span of one film, Johnson has deemphasized the central conceit of the first seven Star Wars movies—that a powerful, chosen few are key to our collective future—and replaced it with an emphasis on the “specialness of the unspecial.” The best climax in a Star Wars movie is followed by one of my favorite endings to a blockbuster film ever, which underscores this theme with bold strokes. It’s almost impossible to rank a film in this series after having only seen it once, but this is closer to the top than it is the bottom. Except for Benecio del Toro. Serously, man, knock it off."
"Jun 8, 2019",neutral," Well, as writer/director Rian Johnson’s “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” unfolds, one might wonder if the Resistance needs a better marketing department, because – yet again – they are greatly outnumbered by the draconian, downright awful First Order.  The First Order, whose members sport pitch black threads and their faces wear scowls (coupled with occasional smirks), are simply not easy to like, but the Resistance - like the Rebel Alliance before it – is facing overwhelming odds against a superior military and legions of bad guys.   Maybe someone in the Resistance should form a promotions department or at least print up some fliers, because they seem to be missing an opportunity to recruit new freedom fighters. Johnson must have recruited a talented film crew, because his movie looks absolutely stunning.  Mixed with some new mechanized ships, weapons and contraptions and along with some fearsome, familiar ones, the battles on land and space spectacularly strike the right science fiction, escapist tones that both children and adults pine for during a Star Wars picture.  The film offers about a half-dozen take-your-breath-away moments and credit Johnson for thoughtfully constructing these particular sequences that will steal a collective bit of oxygen from the lungs of theatre audiences.  On the other hand, the sluggish and very mechanical main plot thread, the surprisingly undeveloped relationships between key characters and a few head-scratching choices (which I will not reveal) construct a questionable foundation that the aforementioned visuals and assorted heart-stopping minutes cannot conceal. Meanwhile, The First Order – led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) - is in relentless pursuit of Leia, Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and rest of the Resistance, who continue to experience their numbers problem.  With a highly intriguing mix of old characters and relatively new ones (Rey, Poe, Finn, Hux, Kylo Ren, and more) and brand spanking new ones – played by Laura Dern, Kelly Marie Tran and Benicio Del Toro – Johnson holds the ingredients for a complex, character-driven story to match his visual storytelling.  Sadly, that never materializes, as he appears content to highlight long stretches of uneventful exposition instead.  With Rey and Luke, Johnson’s script offers some scarce table scraps of new facts, and - like two people staring at their individual cell phones during a nice meal on a Saturday night - their time feels completely wasted on the island.  Admittedly, Rey and Kylo Ren’s verbal duels do raise a new hope (pardon the pun) for a warm détente and also a fear for a dark turn.  I will not reveal the results of their particular encounters, but – stylistically - their engagements play in the same ballpark as the artless, highly criticized exchanges between Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Padme (Natalie Portman) in “Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones” (2002).  Although, they are not quite that bad. Outside of some long-winded talk, the picture contains three extensive physical clashes between the baddies and the good guys, but the biggest conflict in the movie is finding enough screen time for the very worthy characters.  Except for the opening 15 minutes, Poe is really given nothing substantive to do.  For Laura Dern’s character (who I will not name or describe), Johnson presents no backstory or establishing scenes, so her few on-screen moments do not generate enough gravitas.  Somehow, Chewbacca must have learned magic in his spare time, because he pulls off a tremendous on-screen disappearing trick.  He is barely in the picture.  In fact, when he suddenly reappears in the third act, this particular critic actually forgot that he was starring in movie, as the screenplay treats him like a bit, sideshow player, like some of the new Star Wars creatures:  the Porgs who look like cute little penguins and a pack of albino wolves who may have accidentally stepped into a glitter factory. Finn and a resistance fighter named Rose (Tran) do chew up lots of movie minutes on a special mission, but their tangential side project feels recycled, as just a vehicle to show off a new planet. All of this and more fill a very long 2 hours and 32 minutes but with only a fraction of the swashbuckling fun of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”.  Sure, the 2015 picture might be a fraternal twin to “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope” (1977), but it recaptured that magic, those goosebumps that a great Star Wars film can give.  Despite meticulous efforts, mammoth productions, striking locales, some enjoyable fan-friendly moments, and about six explosive swathes of celluloid, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is missing that goosebumps-factor.  The 152-minute picture felt familiar and not nostalgic, but repetitive within its own narrative.  It is not the worst film in the series, but perhaps the biggest waste in terms of advancing the 9-part storyline.  Of course, casual and diehard Star Wars fans should see this film, and many, many audiences will hopefully and probably walk out of theatres with big smiles, because it is a rare treat to experience a brand new movie from this iconic franchise.  Unfortunately, this particular critic walked away with a lengthy list of the film’s missed opportunities while also wanting to help jumpstart the Resistance’s nonexistent recruiting campaign.  Jeff – a member of the Phoenix Critics Circle – has penned film reviews since 2008 and graduated from ASU’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.  Follow Jeff and the Phoenix Film Festival on Twitter @MitchFilmCritic and @PhoenixFilmFest, respectively.

"Jun 4, 2019",positive,"A world where women can be strong without the help of men, where princesses can become generals, and girls who come from nothing on a backwater planet can rise to become the hope of the galaxy."
"May 16, 2019",positive," NOTE: This review is SPOILER-FREE. However, to talk about the movie we do need to talk about the plot, even if it is the vaguest terms. So if you're someone who wants to go in knowing absolutely nothing, the first line is a short ""thesis"" for the review, then the small amount of story details are after the director and summary. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the best kind of entry into a franchise that takes unexpected risks, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is emotionally moving in a way that will be leave fans stunned. Director: Rian Johnson
Summary: Having taken her first steps into the Jedi world, Rey joins Luke Skywalker on an adventure with Leia, Finn, and Poe that unlocks mysteries of the Force and secrets of the past. In one of the many trailers for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, we hear Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) say, ""This is not going to go the way you think."" That is a pretty fair description of the experience of watching The Last Jedi. Fans who think they know what to expect from this movie are going to be have those expectations blown right out of the water when they get into The Last Jedi. Our story follows three basic plot lines: Rey (Daisy Ridley) tries to convince Luke to return to the Resistance because they need his help. Finn (John Boyega) is joined by newcomer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to try to save the Resistance from impending doom. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is still struggling with the conflict within himself from killing his father in The Force Awakens. There is obviously more to all of it than that, but this is spoiler-free, and going in with as little knowledge as possible makes for an optimal viewing experience. There has been some worry among fans that Lucasfilm wasn't giving their directors and writers any room to create their own movies. While many agreed that The Force Awakens was good, it did feel very similar to A New Hope. The Last Jedi is nothing like Empire Strikes Back, and in fact feels very much like Rogue One in that it's extremely different. It takes risks from the first moment and opens up new doors in what the mythology of this world really is. This is a character piece, and the moments of building are subtle and lovely to watch. We see our main heroes each go through new trials and tribulations that help shape the people they will become in future movies — in both good ways and bad. Director/writer Rian Johnson doesn't just take risks; he does things with this movie that could easily be considered ""unsafe"" for brand management, and no one at Lucasfilm seems to take issue with it. There is a reason they gave this man his own corner of the Star Wars universe. The cast continues to be the best part of this entire franchise. Any moment Carrie Fisher is on screen is just a reminder of what a wonderful actress and person we lost. It makes every one of her scenes that much more moving and heartbreaking. Hamill shows us a new side to Luke Skywalker and proves that he can take this character in new and believable directions. Ridley is a powerhouse in the role of Rey as we watch this young woman struggle to find her place in this world. Boyega and Tran are a great duo. Their story is fun and engaging to watch, with Tran clearly becoming the new heart of the series. Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron grows in beautifully subtle ways and continues to steal every single scene he's in. Newcomers Laura Dern and Benicio del Toro don't have a ton of screen time, but Dern in particular is handed one of the best scenes in the movie. Driver and Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux continue to play wonderfully off of each other to the point where you want to ask them to lay their lightsabers on the table and get out a ruler to clear everything up. It's not an entirely perfect movie, to be fair. There is a bit of clunky dialogue at times, and the structure is a little weird when you think about it too much. It's also a long movie and there are times when it feels that way, which is usually indicative of a pacing issue. These are nitpicks, though, and hardly dealbreakers when it comes to the final product. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an emotional roller coaster of a movie. It fakes you out with what you think is going to happen, and then completely flips that on its head. It expands the scope of what we think is capable from the Force in this universe. It sets up a new dynamic that is going to prove fascinating to watch in future movies. ""This is not going to go the way you think,"" is the best possible way to describe this gift of a film."
"May 9, 2019",positive,"Let's not mince words: This will be remembered as one of the best science fiction/fantasy movies of all time, and this backlash simply must stop, because that's no way to treat a near-masterpiece."

"Apr 28, 2019",negative,A lot of the films ideas I like in theory but it was not executed well. The more I thought about it the less I liked it
"Apr 25, 2019",positive,[Rian Johnson] succeeded on a lot of levels; I feel like there were a lot of other levels that didn't work as much.
"Apr 16, 2019",positive," ""The Force Awakens"" brought a new generation of lovable characters together. ""The Last Jedi"" breaks them apart. The result is the richest, most epic, most emotional Star Wars movie so far.  General Leia's rebel forces flee the enemy's military might. A side mission to a shady city brings intrigue and betrayal. And a powerful student learns the ways of the Force from an aging Jedi master.  At the heart of the film is the plotline following troubled apprentice Rey as she joins Luke Skywalker to dive into what it means to be a Jedi. It's a joy to watch Mark Hamill's and Daisy Ridley's characters wrestle with the true nature of the Force and the moral and spiritual questions at the heart of the Star Wars phenomenon. Then, when this compelling strand intertwines with Adam Driver's tortured villain, Kylo Ren, ""Last Jedi"" reaches levels of intensity never previously seen in the entire 
  Star Wars
 saga. A key revelation halfway through turns everything you think you know about Luke upside down, fueling a soul-stirring climax. Except that isn't even the end, as the film slips into an even higher gear for an epic final crescendo, alternating gut-punching emotional beats with air-punching action set pieces. It's glorious to behold.  Fans might spot one wrinkle, however. It's understandable that this second film in the new trilogy might be influenced by ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the second film in the classic Star Wars series and the movie widely considered to be the best in the saga -- if not a contender for best sequel ever. But it isn't far into ""The Last Jedi"" that you begin to see parallels and even individual details copied and pasted from ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Rose, an upstanding rebel mechanic played by Kelly Marie Tran, is a delight to watch. She embodies the indomitable moral spirit of Star Wars with her clear-eyed determination to do the right thing and amusingly sparks off John Boyega's Finn.  Another storyline, in which dashing pilot Poe Dameron attempts to protect the rebel fleet, is also undercooked. Manufactured conflict can't disguise the fact that Poe, played by Oscar Isaac, doesn't have much to do but spin his wheels and yap at his superiors. Luckily, those superiors are General Leia and Admiral Holdo, played by Carrie Fisher and Laura Dern, who could teach master classes in cool, commanding authority.  Truly funny moments balance the intense, emotional ones. General Hux, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is the butt of most of the gags, but Luke Skywalker also brings tragic-comic laughs. BB-8 is a one-droid hilarity machine, and only the hardest heart could resist the penguin-like porgs, which thankfully are more tribble than Ewok. "

"Mar 26, 2019",positive," Letras amarillas sobre un fondo estrellado, piel de gallina, espectadores impacientes y cosplays incómodos. Ir a ver una película de Star Wars al cine no es, simplemente, ir al cine. Como generación, tenemos el privilegio único de ir al cine a ver una película nueva de Star Wars todos los años. Y esa es una de las maravillas de la era nostálgica que estamos viviendo. Por eso, la sensación que me deja Star Wars: The Last Jedi es extraña. No salí del cine conmovido ni emocionado; más bien pensaba, una y otra vez en la peculiar experiencia que fue ver esta película. Ésta no es una cinta efectiva que derrite corazones como The Force Awakens, no es una reinvención realista como Rogue One, no es un bodrio espantoso como Attack of the Clones y no es una clásica secuela como Empire Strikes Back. Es todo eso y nada de eso, es la película más arriesgada de Star Wars y una apuesta valiente que funciona con efectividad desigual. The Last Jedi merece el hype que se ha ganado por ser una reinvención osada del mito de Star Wars. Con esto, no es la mejor película de la saga, ni de cerca, pero se gana un lugar único en el universo de nuestros cariños galácticos. Éste es el principio del fin, la culminación de una saga familiar, el término de treinta años de espera. Después de la cinta de Rian Johnson, queda un universo renovado en espera de nuevas épicas. A diferencia de muchas otras cintas de Star Wars, The Last Jedi empieza casi inmediatamente después de su antecesora: los rebeldes están atrapados en la base de D’Qar acosados por la Primera Orden, Rey está llegando al final de su peregrinaje para encontrarse con Luke, y Finn se recupera de las heridas de la batalla en la Starkiller Base. A partir de ahí, la trama se construye en estas tres líneas narrativas: la de la guerra, protagonizada por Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) y la Vicealmirante Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern); la del aprendizaje en la Fuerza con Rey (Daisy Ridley) y Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill); y la de Finn (John Boyenga) con su nueva sidekick Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) en una misión para infiltrarse en la nave del Líder Supremo Snoke (Andy Serkis) ayudados por un ladrón de dudosa moral (Benicio del Toro). Paralelamente, se sigue desarrollando la eterna lucha por el cariño paterno de Snoke entre el General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) y el aprendiz Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). De ahí, The Last Jedi se construye como una clásica película de Star Wars con la típica edición entrelazada. Y toda la anécdota se fundamenta, básicamente, en una persecución: lo que queda de los rebeldes, después de la destrucción de la República, escapa de la Primera Orden y sus mortíferas armas esperando el regreso de Skywalker para liberarlos. The Last Jedi no es una película fundacional sino de conclusiones, no es una película de contexto sino de particularidades, no es una cinta de instituciones sino de individuos. The Last Jedi no es una película fundacional sino de conclusiones, no es una película de contexto sino de particularidades, no es una cinta de instituciones sino de individuos. En esta cinta no hay grandes viajes en la galaxia, no hay exploración de distintos mundos y sistemas, no hay una macro escena política. Todo se reduce al drama íntimo de la última persecución de los rebeldes y la última esperanza de una república herida de muerte. Aquí no hay Senado ni diplomacia, no hay instituciones y la jerarquía totalitaria de la Primera Orden es, junto a los estatutos militares de los rebeldes, el único orden que se vislumbra. Así, esta cinta no crea una densidad de universo sino que se vuelca completamente hacia el drama pequeño de sus personajes. No es una película fundacional sino de conclusiones, no es una película de contexto sino de particularidades, no es una cinta de instituciones sino de individuos. A diferencia de otras entregas de la saga, nada en esta cinta sale como uno espera. Porque, a pesar de lo sencilla que es la trama, Rian Johnson optó por integrar cosas absolutamente innovadoras… incluso, se podría decir, heréticas, en la mitología galáctica. The Force Awakens fue, evidentemente, un homenaje a la primera cinta de Star Wars. Con un argumento prácticamente calcado de la cinta de Lucas, Abrams quiso complacer a los viejos fanáticos de la saga al mismo tiempo que volvía familiares los temas para neófitos de estas regiones espaciales. El resultado fue emotivo y conmovedor… pero también gastó la fórmula. Si el Episodio VIII hubiera sido una calca de Empires Strikes Back, viejos y nuevos fanáticos hubieran abandonado el cariño a la saga. El predicamento de Rian Johnson era seguir los pasos de Abrams sin repetir su fórmula. Y lo logró con creces: esta cinta es una de las más arriesgadas y ambiciosas concepciones de Star Wars y su vieja mitología. Además, como un gesto de máximo respeto, Johnson utiliza marionetas tipo Jim Henson y animatrónicos para dar vida a las numerosas criaturas de este universo: desde Porgs hasta unas extrañas monjas protectoras del legado Jedi. Si esta cinta no explora a fondo el universo, sí juega constantemente con un trasfondo de vida animal y antropomorfa de una riqueza enorme (salvo por el Leprechaun). Pero la más fuerte influencia de esta cinta no mira hacia el pasado sino que se dirige hacia el futuro de la saga: se trata de Rogue One. Y, si la influencia de Rogue One no fuera evidente, podemos ver en un cameo a su director, Gareth Edwards, en una lucha de trinchera rebelde. Aquí la guerra se construye como una lucha estratégica paciente, se convierte en algo mucho más crudo y real, los aspectos más maniqueos se diluyen en tonalidades de gris. Aquí la guerra se construye como una lucha estratégica paciente, se convierte en algo mucho más crudo y real, los aspectos más maniqueos se diluyen en tonalidades de gris. Así, la influencia de Edwards está presente en toda la cinta: aquí la guerra se construye como una lucha estratégica paciente, se convierte en algo mucho más crudo y real, los aspectos más maniqueos se diluyen en tonalidades de gris. Hay que recordar que Rogue One fue la primera película que retrató a los rebeldes haciendo crímenes de guerra, asesinando por la espalda y a distancia, robando y destruyendo. Fue la primera cinta de Star Wars en salirse de la dicotomía entre la luz y la oscuridad. Basándose en los esfuerzos de Edwards, la cinta de Johnson quiere mostrar también otro aspecto de la eterna guerra: el del negocio que representa para los privilegiados que comercian con la guerra y la muerte. En esta cinta en donde prácticamente no hay política (como sí la hay –y mucha– en la segunda trilogía), la única mención a la forma de organización del régimen es sobre aquellos que están encima de toda política y de toda ideología. Los vendedores de armas como los cínicos de este universo que se olvidan de las luchas trascendentales para hacer un muy pragmático negocio. En este sentido, Johnson quiso empezar a desmitificar toda la construcción de Star Wars como un universo maniqueo en donde sólo importa la lucha trascendente de la luz contra la oscuridad. Esta cinta quiere reformar el universo de Star Wars con otros tonos, con otros conflictos, con nuevas ideas para nuevas generaciones. Con esto se ve que Johnson, como Luke queriendo renegar de la orden Jedi, quiere olvidar las pasadas obsesiones de la mitología de Star Wars. Por eso se permite explorar libremente, también, las posibilidades de la fuerza mostrando poderes que nunca antes se habían visto (y que seguro causarán más de una polémica entre los fanáticos más radicales). Todo esto muestra, dentro del concepto cíclico de la historia (con “h” mayúscula y minúscula) en esta saga, que la repetición se está diluyendo para dar paso a nuevas posibilidades. El fuerte verdadero de The Last Jedi está en la rebeldía que muestra, la originalidad que busca y la valentía que tiene al jugar con los conceptos más fetichizados de esta pesada mitología. Pero Johnson no siempre sale avante con esta apuesta. Esta es una cinta que quiere ser mucho con muy poco; es una trama sencilla que trata de incluir el fin de la saga familiar de los Skywalker y la renovación de un universo. Al final, The Last Jedi, para citar a Bilbo, se siente como poca mantequilla untada sobre demasiado pan. En las dos horas y media de cinta, Jonhson no muestra la misma maestría de Abrams que, como buen alumno de Spielberg, es un experto en mantener tono y coherencia. Aquí, la historia de Finn puede sentirse, por momentos, como algo accesorio que no aporta gran cosa a la trama y vuelve más pesada una de las cintas más largas de la saga. En otro sentido, el humor ligero de la cinta puede destantear a algunos que están acostumbrados a la solemnidad habitual de Star Wars o al humor más ácido de Han Solo (snif). Porque esta cinta trata de aligerar considerablemente el tono oscuro de otras entregas (Rogue One, por ejemplo) con constantes alivios cómicos con los personajes principales (y no nada más los androides en su rol tradicional.) Todas estas deficiencias, sin embargo, puede relacionarse con el mismo espíritu de cambio que comentamos. Porque las rupturas narrativas y de tono son parte de una necesidad de renovación: si The Force Awakens es una película nostálgica sobre el pasado, The Last Jedi es una cinta sobre la destrucción de un legado histórico. Luke y Leia tienen apariciones absolutamente memorables pero es la nueva relación entre Rey y Ben Solo la que se lleva la cinta. En la construcción entrelazada de sus identidades en proceso de formación vemos que el balance de la Fuerza no es algo que se logra, que se busca, o que se encuentra en alguien; sino una necesidad misma de la naturaleza. La Fuerza tiende al balance y esa explicación central en la película (que es de una belleza impresionante) tendrá repercusiones en el resto de la saga. The Last Jedi concluye la saga Skywalker, concluye el mito de los Jedi, asume el pasado legendario y fertiliza la tierra para nuevas creaciones. Si The Force Awakens me parece mejor película, The Last Jedi es esencial en una nueva coyuntura. Johnson pasará a la historia como el hereje que acabó con los viejos mitos para aligerar el pesado fardo del pasado y darle, a una nueva generación, su propia guerra de las galaxias. Elenco: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, Benicio del Toro."
"Mar 2, 2019",positive," I have to admit that my life has been so hectic lately I haven’t really had time to anticipate any films this holiday season like I normally do. But when the press screening invite came out for The Last Jedi, I actually got more excited despite only having seen only one trailer. Well, I’m glad that is the only trailer/videos I’ve seen of the film… it’s best to see it ‘blind’ knowing as little as possible. I don’t write reviews very often anymore, so indulge me when I go a bit longer with this one. Force Awakens is more nostalgic and an homage to the original from JJ Abrams, and while The Last Jedi also still has to tread on familiar grounds, it somehow feels fresh and new. There are quite a few surprises that thrills, delights and tugs my heartstrings. Ok granted I’m more of a casual Star Wars fan, so I don’t have the depth knowledge like ardent aficionados, but I was quite caught up with the journey of the main characters. The story pretty much picks up where the last film leaves off, with a literal cliffhanger as we saw Rey (Daisy Ridley) meeting Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) up high on a cliff by an ocean. 
But before we get there, the film drops us straight into an intergalactic space battle of the Resistance fighters, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) against the reigning First Order. I enjoy thrilling aerial battles and the SFX is off the charts in a film of this magnitude, but I’m glad there’s more to this movie than just action, action, action. What I really enjoyed most from the film is the quieter, more talky scenes between Rey and Luke. Writer/director Rian Johnson delved deep into the saga’s mythology and Jedi philosophy… about what the force really is, the real power of the Jedi, etc. Those are the real appeal of this enduring franchise and what makes me go ‘ok I see why people love this saga so much and why it appeals to multiple generations.’ There are fans who might not like the direction of Luke in this film (even Hamill himself reportedly told Johnson he fundamentally disagreed how his character was written), but I personally love the deconstruction of such a titular character. Why is Luke such a legend? Just what exactly is the Force and who gets to have it? How does Luke himself sees his own power and its effect in the universe? It’s always intriguing to learn just what the fuss is about Luke, especially given how he was talked about in virtually every scene in The Force Awakens, yet we only got to see him for mere seconds! I love the grizzled, curmudgeon Luke (like Hamill was channeling the real Harrison Ford!), the salt & pepper longish hair and beard makes him look even more distinguished. The scenes between him and Rey are definitely my favorite. “This is not going to go the way you think.” Luke says at one point (it’s not a spoiler as it’s in the trailer and all over its promos)… and you know what, the film actually delivers on that sentiment! The film is divided into three major scenarios, in which each team has to fulfill a certain ‘task’ if you will, all happening around the same time. My main quibble with the movie is that the transition between one scenario to another feels disjointed at times. One scene would be solemn and intense, then it’ll switch to something more mischievous and funky and then it’s full-throttle action. Perhaps it’s to be expected when you have such a vast narrative involving so many players but it could’ve been done more smoothly. That said though, the film has enough going for it–the energetic action, lively humor and genuine emotion–that I didn’t even mind the 2.5 hours running time. Obviously the strength of this space saga is the characters people truly care about over the years. I feel like there’s a proper balance (a word thrown out a lot in this film) between the iconic characters and the newer ones that expand the story. The emotional tug of war between Rey and Kylo is the heart of the story here, and both Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are absolutely terrific. I’ve loved Ridley’s spunky Rey from the start and I find Driver’s Kylo even more magnetic here (and not only ’cause he’s got such great mane!). Yes he’s a grandpa Vader wanna-be (and he’s still got serious anger-management issues), but there’s much more than that and the internal conflict within him is palpable. Poor Domhnall Gleeson though, a terrific actor who’s relegated to being the comic relief as the over-the-top General Hux. On the Resistance team, pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, not to be outdone by Adam in the sexy hair department) gets more to do here. I wouldn’t mind seeing a Poe solo movie with the oh-so-charismatic Isaac, he’s just a cool guy with a reckless energy a la Han Solo. There’s less bantering between him and his bestie Fin (John Boyega). Instead, Fin is paired with another spunky maintenance worker loyal to the Resistance, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). BB-8 is still an immensely fun droid to watch, while the new avian creature Porg likely only appeals to little kiddies. I’m glad to see two new female characters with a proper arc, one is Rose and the other is Vice Admiral Holdo, played by veteran actress Laura Dern. There’s a pretty intense exchange between her and Poe, but I’m not even going to spoil it for you what it’s about. One thing I can say is the scenes of Carrie Fisher is truly bittersweet. The film is dedicated to her (naturally!) but the whole film gives a proper homage to such an iconic character. It was cool to see Yoda making an appearance here with Luke on the island. As Luke struggles with destroying the ancient Jedi text, Yoda just made it go kablooey. It’s not particularly a highlight for me, but it’s cool to see the apprentice and the master reunited. Another reunion that made me tear up is Luke and Leia… especially when she gave the Han Solo’s dice he grabbed from the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon. I love when Leia said ‘Luke, I know what you’re going to say. I changed my hair.’ Ha! It feels like something Carrie Fisher herself would say. When Luke said to her (about Han) ‘he’s never really gone’ it feels like how Carrie herself is to the SW family and the fans. Her spirit will always be with the franchise.  Now for those who’ve seen this? Who do you think the Last Jedi is? Is it Luke or is it Rey? Thoughts on the kid in the last scene that hints he’s got the Force with him? My initial reaction after I saw this is it’s currently one of my favorites in the franchise! Well, after four days seeing it, I still stand by it. In fact, I don’t mind seeing this again by year’s end. It’s really got everything. Thrilling action, check. Intense lightsaber battle, check. Witty repartee, check. Emotional struggles, check. The action punctuates the story and that’s how it should be. Unlike the overwrought and mawkish prequels, Rian’s script has zest and wit, and also unafraid to poke fun at themselves. I also marvel at the cinematography by Steve Yedlin, a longtime Rian Johnson collaborator. So many iconic visuals that truly took my breath away, especially those on the island filmed in County Kerry, Ireland. And of course, John Williams’ iconic epic score still gives me the chills! By the time the end credits roll, I am already excited to see how the story goes from there. It’s great to have a filmmaker who evidently has been a fan of the franchise since he was a kid, but still also an ‘outsider’ who dared to take the 40-year-old saga into unexpected paths. The force is certainly strong with Rian Johnson, so I have no problem having him do the next Star Wars trilogy. I think time will be kinder to The Last Jedi than some “fanboy” Star Wars critics have been. There’s an apparent backlash to this film from the very same people who criticised JJ Abrams for “remaking A New Hope” for Johnson’s deviation from what fans “wanted” (whatever that means). I loved the film (despite a few niggling issues – the gambling planet, for example, was utter meh) and cannot wait to revisit this one multiple times to dig deeper into it. Hey Rodney! I actually like the gambling planet scene. Yeah people are gonna always complain about something. It’s either ‘too much of the same’ or ‘too different’ You really can’t please the fans, ahah. I feel the same about this film as with The Force Awakens, I enjoyed it but it seemed to me they introduced too many questions that may or may not get answered in the final film. I’ll probably see it again just because it looks great on the big screen. For some reason I enjoyed this more than Force Awakens. I just think it’s more engaging overall and yes it does look amazing on the big screen! Great review Ruth, I thought ‘The Last Jedi’ had flaws but on the whole it was a good ‘Star Wars’ film and I do like and fully support some of the unexpected creative choices made.  Rian Johnson delivers some incredible visuals and gives this entry it’s own unique flavour without seeming out of place in the overall canon. Hi Chris! Glad you don’t mind the unexpected creative choices, sounds like we’re in the minority amongst fans. This time I’m with the critics in that I think this is a great film and I for one don’t mind Rian in the director chair for future SW films. Ugh your review makes me wish I’d liked this movie more than I did. It just dragged for me, and I felt bored and antsy. I loved the force awakens, but this installment just didn’t sell me the ju ju I needed to feel fulfilled. And, I’m not even a fan boy! WTF, right?? Hi Courtney! Hey it’s ok that we disagreed on this. I wasn’t bored for the most part despite the super long running time. I guess I didn’t know what to expect but really enjoyed Rian’s direction. I’m not a fangirl at all, I guess I might just happen to be in the right mood when I saw it.  I came out of it giving it a 5 out of 5 but I’ve since brought that score down to a 4 after thinking about it a bit more and talking to others about their reaction. I do feel I need another viewing and I’m eagerly anticipating one. But, regardless, I really enjoyed it. I thought Rian Johnson did a terrific job just as JJ Abrams did in the last one. There were moments (fleeting I must admit) when this film featured some of the best bits of Star Wars ever – that opening battle… wow! I could quibble about some of the humour and its hammy delivery by Hamill or the feeling (like Abrams’ effort) this is a re-imagination of Empire Strikes Back or the point plot-wise of the gambling planet apart from (spoiler coming) the kid at the end and the connotations of his actions. But, all in all, I really did enjoy it and thought it an ideal entry in the Star Wars saga. Film is in my blood. LOVE movies of all genres, from Jane Austen to James Bond.

"Feb 8, 2019",positive,"It's a visually stunning movie, finding moments both macro and micro to highlight the beautiful imagination that Star Wars can evoke."
"Feb 6, 2019",positive," Star Wars The Last Jedi came in with some really high expectations. Star Wars The Force Awakens evoked a lot of questions and the Last Jedi trailer stirred up even more questions.  As a matter of fact, we came up with the top 5 burning questions for Star Wars The Last Jedi for your viewing pleasure. After viewing The Last Jedi, I think it’s fair to say that the film exceeded and circumvented my expectations all at the same time. Now just so you know, Star Wars The Last Jedi has a ton of surprises and twists. With that in mind, as I have always tried to provide spoiler-free reviews, I’ll try to be even more spoiler-free as possible. I understand some people still want to get a taste of what’s to come. Worry not because in just a few days, you can tune back in to this post to watch/listen to my spoiler discussion of the film. When the opening credits roll, it almost feels like you’re being transported back into time with the classic Star Wars music blasting, and the intro opening text. That sets the tone for the nice amount of nostalgia the film creates. Fortunately, the movie doesn’t entirely rely on the nostalgia factor as much as The Force Awakens. While there are obvious callbacks to previous characters and such, the Last Jedi does not become a modern day version of The Empire Strikes Back. Not only that, but there are so many climatic moments that will leave on you on the edge of your seat. There’s a nice balance of suspense, action, drama, and humor. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]Director/writer  Rian Johnson deserves so much credit and praise for this film. (I can see why Disney has entrusted him to take on the new spinoff Star Wars trilogy.) One of my hopes with this movie was that it would really start to create its own original path in the Star Wars movie franchise. Johnson successfully does that by avoiding almost all expectations Star Wars fans may have had going into the film.  With the way the movie ends, the field is now wide open with where the next Star Wars movie can go. Johnson did stay true to some classic Star Wars elements. One of those elements was to ensure that The Last Jedi was full of those “Star Wars Life Lessons”. I thought it was brilliant how the film brings about a number of different lessons and themes through each of the experiences of the individual characters. The overall cinematography of this movie must be praised as well. The amazing visuals were simply captivating in this film. Maybe I’m being a prisoner of the moment, but I can’t recall a more visually stimulating spaceship battle. The usage of the environment and terrain was stunning in some scenes. And without question, there’s one particular scene with a spaceship that can only be described as epic! That scene is so jaw dropping,  that the sound is masterfully muted to match the level of suspense that the audience is feeling at that time. you’ll know it when you see it, but I can honestly say I’ve never seen a spaceship do what was done in that iconic sequence. Beyond even that, The Last Jedi will challenge what we thought we knew about the Force. I thoroughly enjoyed the radical new ways that the Force could be used in the film. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]As previously mentioned, Johnson included the infusion of so much more humor compared to other Star Wars films. For a moment, I almost thought I was watching Spaceballs (1987).  I don’t want to say that the movie was comedic, but it did have some funny moments sprinkled throughout. I think the reason why this worked was because the humor made sense within the story. The humor was not shoe-horned in nor did it completely really distract or disrupt the tonality of the movie. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]Now, let’s talk about some of these great characters! In my opinion, the supporting characters seemed to have outshined the main leading characters. I absolutely loved Kelly Marie Tran’s performance as “Rose”. She was a very unexpected character in a supporting role that simply delivers to the very end of the film. The most touching performance that will hit you right in the feels will be Carrie Fisher’s role. Given her unfortunate passing, it was wonderful to see her in the role of Princess Leia as she displayed a beautiful blend of strength, leadership and love through her character. When it came to Snoke, I first of all liked the fact that the CGI was handled very well. We absolutely got to see more of Snoke and, even better, we got to see his power on display. I thought his demonstration of power was extremely effective at showing just how much of a threat he can be. Probably one of my absolute favorite characters had to be that of “Poe Dameron” played by Oscar Isaac. Poe probably displayed the most character development of all the other characters. Last but not least, BB-8 is just a ton of fun and awesome!  Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]As for the heavy hitter characters, I think the one that stood out the most was Mark Hamill as “Luke Skywalker”. As you could see from the trailers, Luke Skywalker isn’t the happy go-lucky, optimistic Jedi that we knew from the original Star Wars films. Without going into spoiler territory, I really appreciated how his character had to go through his own journey in this film. Another kudos to Rian Johnson has to be mentioned here. Yet again, we have probably the most epic moment in Star Wars cinematic history unfold with Luke’s character. In the last couple of scenes of the film, Luke shines so brightly that I’m sure it’ll have the internet buzzing for years to come. Disclaimer: Before any die hard Star Wars fans want to come for my head, let me just say that these “Bad” critiques are incredibly mild. They do not kill the film or anything, but they still have to be noted. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]First off, this movie feels every bit as long as the 2hrs and 32min run time states. Don’t get me wrong, there aren’t really any slow or dragging moments in the film that make the pacing feel too lengthy. Rather, there are a number of moments where it would appear as though the film could’ve/should’ve ended. We have a few big climactic scenes where you really think the movie is going to stop, but it only continues into another side story. Then that happens again, and again. Fortunately, every time you think the movie is about to end, they still give you another set of scenes that keep you entertained and intrigued to see more. However, you still will notice, at the very least, the prolonged time you’ve been sitting in that theater chair. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]Okay, I feel kinda bad for going here, but I’ve got mention that I was not a fan of a particular scene with “Leia”. I’ll just say that the scene is a bit of a “reach” and doesn’t have a good enough contextual basis for the audience to connect with. In order for this very particular and standout scene to make sense, you have to jump through some mental hoops. First you have to  recall the previous original Star Wars films, and then you’ll have to make a huge assumption just for it to make sense. To me, it just needed a smoother transition for her actions to be a bit more believable. (If you listen to my spoiler-discussion, I dig a bit deeper into this.) I think one of the bigger issues that happens in this film is what appears to be the stagnant character development with the two leading characters of Rey and Kylo Ren. Compared to the other side characters who have some major challenges and internal battles to overcome, it didn’t appear as though Rey nor Kylo Ren actually progressed very much as characters. Let me be clear about this. I’m not saying that nothing happens to them, or that they don’t make certain decisions along their personal journeys. What I’m saying is that each character seems relatively the same as they were compared to The Force Awakens. You can’t say that for a character like Poe or even Luke, for example. Star Wars The Last Jedi is probably the best Star Wars film that we have to date! Hold on, pick up your jaw, and put your eyeballs back in their sockets. I should say, that Star Wars the Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film we have to date by default. This film is a natural progression of the Star Wars films because it incorporates all the good things we loved about the previous Star Wars films. Even better, this film drizzled a lot of originality by dismantling the Star Wars cinematic formula.  Going against the grain of what Star Wars fans may expect makes this film such a surprising and refreshing viewing experience. If you couldn’t tell by now, I absolutely believe that this was better than The Force Awakens. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]If you’re considering to watch this film in 3D, feel free to do so. The movie is visually stunning and there are a number of intentional visuals to keep the 3D popping in various scenes. Personally, I’d recommend seeing this film in Dolby Atmos if your local theater provides that. The sound effects and musical score are something to experience in a theater setting. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an absolute must watch in theaters. Go see it and may the Force be with you! (You know I had to slip that in somewhere.)

"Jan 31, 2019",positive," In 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm in a $4 billion dollar deal that had the potential to change the entire entertainment landscape overnight. Five years and three movies later, they are on the cusp of making back that initial investment, in a resurrection story for our times. Star Wars was a spent, moribund franchise, one with no foreseeable future, other than endless re-releases. It has been rebirthed as 21st-century mythos, with a new set of films. Our original beloved trio of characters grew up to become the elders we respect, while our new characters give fans a new set of archetypes that respects our intelligence. This winter’s ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" directed by Rian Johnson, may be the most divisive film in the canon so far. Some of those who hate it claim that Johnson’s film ""killed their childhood."" And guess what? They’re right. When the original trilogy came out in the 1970s and 1980s, many current fans were children. Childhood was a time for simple answers. Good and bad were unequivocal, wins were forever, and everyone lived happily ever after. When someone felt a decent impulse and followed it, they automatically became a “good” character (i.e. Han Solo). When a “bad” guy felt a decent impulse and followed it, they were no longer “evil” (i.e. Darth Vader in ""Return of the Jedi""). But that’s not the way life works. Good people do terrible things, and bad people do small acts of kindness. Heroes aren't perfect — they can be as weak and small as everyone else. There is no such thing as happily ever after. When the prequels ended in 2005, Star Wars was all but dead. The reviews and fan reaction to the turn of the century films had been scathing. The only ones who had enjoyed them, it seemed, were those aged 7-14. Without meaning to, Lucas had taken his original, childlike trilogy, and made it a series that really was for kids. This reorientation of Star Wars for children wasn’t a complete disaster for Lucasfilm. Together with Warner Brothers, they followed up with a cartoon film, ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"" that begat a TV show of the same name, which then begat the current ""Star Wars: Rebels"" cartoon. But in the world of 2012, where ""Star Trek"" had just been rebooted, ""Game of Thrones"" had solidified its position as HBO’s new flagship show and ""The Avengers"" had opened to worldwide box office success, a few children’s cartoons weren’t going to cut it. Enter Disney. Their first move was to establish the new trilogy as successful. It needed to be familiar, but not too much. They turned to J.J. Abrams, who had proven his rebooting talent by remaking Star Trek for a 21st-century audience. Some complained that the result, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" was a little too familiar; an on-the-nose a remake of the original 1977 film. But 2015's ""The Force Awakens"" was an out-of-the-box success that brought in $2 billion dollars at the box office. Most importantly, it established a new model to build upon. Star Wars has always been, at its core, a story of archetypes. There’s a hero, a princess, a scoundrel and a villain. Our new protagonists had these features, and were diverse to boot. The Chosen One was finally female, heralding a wave of women taking the forefront in long-standing fantasy properties. But these weren’t the clear-cut archetypes of the original films. Rey wasn’t a spoiled kid with dreams of adventure. She was an orphan whose need to survive accidentally leads her to the Resistance. Finn wasn’t the scoundrel with a heart of gold, but an abused kid trying to learn to be brave. The villains — Kylo Ren and his sidekick Hux — were just angry young men playing with fire. (Not all the motifs were so changed, of course. Leia was the Mon Mothma-like Wise Rebellion Leader, Luke was the Yoda Jedi master, and Han Solo grew up to be, of all things, the next generation’s Obi-Wan Kenobi.) Abrams’ setup of this complex world allowed the franchise to branch out. The first stand-alone, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" took the next step. Back in 1977, characters didn't die in films, other than a few extras. The 21st century changed all that with bloody, high-turnover ensemble shows like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Walking Dead."" ""Rogue One,"" directed by Gareth Edwards, gave Star Wars a chance to prove it could do the same. This was a big risk, and there were many at Disney who feared the audience response. As a result, the movie was a mess: a mash-up of six partial films with far too many cooks. Still, the ending maintained the new model's main lesson: Changing the world is a slow process, and although most of us won’t live to see the ultimate victory, the forgotten fallen are still critical rungs on the ladder. Our new characters once again rebuff easy categorizations. Just because two of our heroes undertake a daring mission doesn't automatically mean they’ll succeed. Just because the rebellious character thinks he’s right doesn’t mean he knows what’s going on. The smuggler doesn’t have a heart of gold, but his pockets are lined with it by the end of the film. This time our older heroes are allowed complexity too. Luke is a man of many sides, a hermit in the middle of nowhere who chose to go to a place where fish caretakers wait upon the Jedi like a luxury hotel. He’s self-righteous, yet has made mistakes with galaxy-level consequences. The simple hero he was all those decades ago was always a myth, one he even bought into — to his everlasting regret. Leia is still a self-rescuing princess, but now she’s showing layers of Jedi ability we’ve never seen, and putting down mutinies from her sickbed. In May of 2018 the next Star Wars standalone will arrive, focusing heavily on the backstory of Han Solo. Then in 2019, Disney will follow-up with the now-moved-to-December “Episode IX,” which will complete Lucas’ original Skywalker Saga. Will these movies continue to push this more mature narrative forward? Like ""Rogue One,"" the ""Han Solo: A Star Wars Story"" film is trying to change something about the originals, something that made Disney executives nervous all over again, to the point that they replaced directors midstream. Abrams will return for ""Episode IX."" We can only hope the result is slightly less messy than ""Rogue One,"" and at least as subversive as ""The Last Jedi."" Meanwhile, Rian Johnson has been put in charge of creating the next trilogy, the first not to feature Skywalkers at all. Johnson's ""Last Jedi"" killed our childhoods because 2017 wasn’t a good place for children. But it’s likely the next decade won’t be either. We have to grow up and take our place in history. With Johnson at the helm, it seems like Star Wars could finally be coming along with us for the ride. It may not be the reboot everyone wanted. But it’s the one we deserve.

"Jan 30, 2019",positive,The film is a great reminder to listen to your elders. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Jan 30, 2019",positive," For 40 years now, Star Wars has been an icon of blockbuster filmmaking, both for good and bad. At its best, it delivers deep emotion and spectacular action. At its worst, it delivers bungled dialogue and nauseating set-pieces. But the shackles of the past were thrown away with 2015’s The Force Awakens, and the franchise was back to its best. With the introduction of a new writer/director, Rian Johnson, there’s a sense of trepidation going into the latest chapter The Last Jedi. You can rest easy. He’s delivered the goods. The franchise is in safe hands, with Johnson crafting a bold, new vision for the saga unlike anything we’ve seen before. While pushing further towards a future free from the constraints of its history, the film still wisely keeps one foot firmly placed in deep admiration of the past. You can’t make a Star Wars story without respect to what’s come before. An enthralling and gripping piece of cinema that’s both sublimely moving and visually beautiful, The Last Jedi, while flawed, is a breath of fresh air you will want to experience again and again. So how to summarise this film’s plot without spoiling anything too major? Well, it’s best to stick with what you probably already know from the trailers, expand on that slightly, but leave the biggest surprises for your own viewing pleasure. Picking up shortly after the events of 2015’s The Force Awakens, the dastardly First Order, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, continuing to chew every piece of scenery), is now in the midst of an all-out assault on the dwindling Resistance, led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher, may she rest in peace). After a swarm of Star Destroyers discover the rebellion’s secret location, right in the middle of their mass evacuation, Leia and her rebels find themselves sitting ducks out in space, and quickly running out of fuel. Meanwhile, on the island where we left Rey (Daisy Ridley) and long-lost Jedi legend Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Rey is desperately attempting to recruit Luke to restore hope to the Rebellion cause and join his sister Leia in her fight against Hux and the evil Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). But our dear Luke has long parted ways with The Force, after his failure to stop Kylo Ren/Ben Solo (Adam Driver) from turning to the dark side left him broken and defeated. And yes – the island happens to be populated by the Porgs you’ve seen in the trailer and at every toy store lately. I’m happy to report they are devastatingly adorable, sparingly used, and not at all the franchise’s new Jar Jar Binks. Phew. As for our other heroes, Rebellion fighter Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and his brash and bold ways (i.e. he can’t follow orders) are causing clashes with Leia and her new offsider Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), a purple-haired senior member of the Resistance who takes a particular disliking to the trigger-happy Poe. Defected stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) has awoken from his coma and quickly made a new friend in Rose (Kelly Marie Train), a scrappy Resistance pilot who’s rather dazzled by Finn’s heroic reputation. As the pair head off on their own side-mission, they may just be the key to saving the day for the desperate Rebel fleet. That’s really all one can say without giving too much away. You can pretty much guess there’s plenty of huge space battles, dazzling lightsaber fights, epic moments of joy and sadness, and a whole swag of genuine shocks and surprises, all woven into these barest of plot details. For those concerned writer/director Rian Johnson would cheaply deliver a simple remake of The Empire Strikes Back, rest assured that is not the case. At all. Johnson has crafted something that of course pays deep tribute to the original films, but boldly carves its own path, stamped with the director’s indelible and unique style and vision. With films like Brick and Looper, Johnson has shown his flair for a more avant-garde style of filmmaking, doted with off-beat humour. Surprisingly, Disney has allowed him to inject the Star Wars franchise with plenty of moments of his surrealist talent. One scene involving Rey, a mirror-like alternate dimension, and a simple click of her fingers is truly beyond what we’re used to from these films, and yet, it somehow works completely. The humour can feel somewhat trite at times, and a little unusual for a Star Wars film. But in a narrative with a rather bleak tone, it’s desperately needed, and the jokes thankfully work more often than they don’t. In saying that, the screenplay is far from perfect, particularly around the film’s middle act where the action almost grinds to a halt, and plods along rather frustratingly. Of particular frustration is a rather unnecessary sequence involving Finn and Rose travelling to Canto Bight, a casino-esque city where rich and glamourous citizens gather to be…rich and glamourous. It’s here the film gets a little preachy, as it rather pointlessly attempts to provide biting commentary on notions of greed, excess, class status, and even animal cruelty. It’s admirable to see Johnson exploring themes unfamiliar to this franchise, but it feels so jarringly out-of-place, ultimately briefly pulling you right out of the story. If it doesn’t, I suggest you check out Netflix’s Okja, which handled these very themes far more cleverly. But all is forgiven with the film’s incredible final act, featuring some genuinely gripping and tense moments and a beautifully-filmed battle on the planet Crait, with its surface covered in crusted salt over crimson-red soil. The blood-coloured trails created by the action on the planet’s surface are downright stunning, and leave an impression like few other visuals in this epic film. For all of Johnson’s quirky storytelling, he still knows how to deliver the action and the spectacle. The mix of CGI and physical production is seamless, and the space battles are thrilling and spectacular. The lightsaber duels are some of the best we’ve ever seen, all choreographed with such wondrous precision and intensity. As a visual piece of cinema, it’s another triumph for this franchise. The action is terrific, but the focus on character is the film’s crowning glory. Johnson’s screenplay creates multiple narratives within narratives, but he’s a filmmaker who knows how to handle them perfectly, and nothing with our returning cast ever feels underdeveloped. As a writer, he’s taken the foundations of our characters set by J.J. Abrams, and takes them into deeper (and sometimes darker) territories. The evolution of the strange connection between Rey and Kylo Ren is a particular highlight, and both Ridley and Driver take their characters to wonderful new levels. Ren is still heavily burdened by the deep conflict he feels between his past and future, and Driver superbly handles the psychological torment his character constantly struggles with. For those who had reservations about his performance in The Force Awakens, prepare to be blown away by the film’s conclusion. Poe is given far more to do in this film, and Isaac runs with the opportunity to take his character further, particularly towards the film’s climax. His comedic interaction with General Hux is another of the film’s highlights, and Hux himself gets far more great moments than he did in the first film. Finn suffers with the least character progression, which is a damn shame, as Boyega has proven he is worthy of a great storyline. Maybe next time. And sadly, once again, Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) is completely wasted. While we may find these characters in the same place we left them in The Force Awakens, they all ultimately wind up in very, very different places over the course of the film, setting up an incredible closing chapter to this trilogy in two-years time. And then there’s our beloved original siblings, Luke and Leia. As difficult as it is to watch, knowing it’s her final performance, the film is a beautiful tribute to both Carrie Fisher (the film is dedicated to her, which elicited huge applause from my cinema) and Princess Leia. As always, Fisher gives such gravitas to her performance, and Leia will always stand as her immense legacy to cinema. Hamill is sublime as the bitter and defeated old man Luke has become. His character arc is ultimately the film’s glory, and it’s a beautiful journey to travel on. He delivers such deep complexity and tragic pain to Luke, and it’s a staggering difference to the hero we once knew. When brother and sister finally reunite, it’s genuinely cinematic magic. Bring the tissues. Unfortunately the same can’t be said for the new additions to the existing cast of characters. Rose is rather adorable, both instantly lovable and endearing, but outside of a brief plot-line involving her sister, there’s barely any character development for our plucky new Rebel. Regardless, it’s impressive to see an Asian heroine front and centre in a Star Wars film, even if there’s perhaps a hint of ulterior motives behind it *cough* Chinese box-office dollars *cough*.  Admiral Holdo may be shrouded in mystery for most of the film, but she’s a fairly unnecessary addition to the story. And the less said about Benicio del Toro’s completely useless new character DJ, the better. Both actors, normally so great, are relatively wasted and underused, and they ultimately steal focus and screen-time from far more worthy characters. In terms of its technical achievements, it should come as no surprise the film looks and sounds phenomenal. Composer John Williams is his typical best, injecting his score with both nods to the past and creations of the future. It’s the kind of stirring score we always expect from the master film composer, and it never feels too familiar or overdone. Steve Yedlin’s cinematography is truly gorgeous, as is the production and costume design from Rick Heinrichs and Michael Kaplan respectively. The film is perhaps a little too long, and editor Bob Ducsay could have been a tad more generous with his trimming, especially around the middle portion of the film. But it’s a minor quibble in such an enjoyable and entertaining piece of cinema. For all its issues, Rian Johnson has delivered something entirely fresh to a franchise now in its eighth film. That in itself is a remarkable achievement that has to be admired. He’s taken great risks and made some incredibly bold choices to deliver something that feels both touchingly familiar and daringly original. It’s an evolution of Star Wars to new places, yet still remains authentically grounded in a universe beloved by so many. Every bit as enjoyable and entertaining as the original trilogy, The Last Jedi is not exactly perfect, but it gets damn close."
"Jan 29, 2019",positive," The stylish episode VIII of the Star Wars franchise, the second of a trilogy that began in 2015 with “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, was given the title of “The Last Jedi” and keeps dividing audiences worldwide. While its visual impact is undeniable, old and new characters work together to infuse zest and grittiness in an impetuous inspiration by Rian Johnson (“Brick”, “Looper”), who penned and directed with equal doses of passion and fascination. The director actually captured the tonal spirit of the preceding episodes and elevated it through bold and fresh ideas. However, this spacial opus could have run shorter than the two hours and a half without major loss. The spectacular battles between the dominant First Order, an evil military junta commanded by the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), and the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), are in the center of the attention. However, and because this is far from being a tacky tale, one can find a decent emotional side attached to it, as well as a winning humor, which associated to speedy action scenes, regales with an inviting diversion. In this episode, Rey (Daisy Ridley) travels to the secluded planetary island of Ahch-To, where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a Jedi master turned hermit, decided to hide six years before. She wants to convince him to join the Resistance. After the initial stubbornness and refusal, Luke ends up accepting the challenge and even teaches her the ways of the Jedi as he sees a lot of courage, righteousness, and skills in her that are so characteristic from The Force. However, Rey communicates telepathically with the venomous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), son of Leia and Han Solo, whose ambiguous behavior and sly intentions will drag her to Snoke’s den. On another front, we have the former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) teaming up with Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker for the Resistance that appears for the first time in the series. I don’t see her as a super strong character, though. Also, the often funny X-wing fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), does what he has to do for the sake of the Light with fearless bravura, even if he needs to confront his inflexible, stern superior, the Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern).  As a bold director, Johnson didn’t turn his face to risk or experience and his efforts become successful. The stunning tete-a-tete between Skywalker and Kylo Ren was the most exciting moment of the film, culminating in a sophisticated artifice of teleportation. It felt like I was in a video game without being able to control it. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” was dedicated to Carrie Fisher, who died of cardiac arrest on December 15. The last installment of the trilogy will be released in 2019, having J.J. Abrams once again in the director’s chair."
"Jan 26, 2019",positive," Hey, it’s time to review the new Star Wars, a movie you’re probably going to see anyway! As someone who really doesn’t hold much affection for the Star Wars franchise, my love of The Force Awakens really shocked me. Not only did it end up making my end of the year 10 Best Movies in 2015, but it also was what I still think of as a pitch perfect blockbuster – one that breathed new life into that universe, introduced nuanced and compelling characters, and looked pretty terrific while doing it. I couldn’t have imagined a situation where I found myself caring about where the plight of the Jedi and their ragtag companions could possibly go, but yet somehow JJ Abrams, Kathleen Kennedy and company all pulled it off. In the between time, I had to suffer through Rogue One, but it was okay, because I knew Rian Johnson would be at the other end of that tunnel to cradle me in his bearded embrace. His The Last Jedi, which picks up literally within moments of the end of The Force Awakens, paints a picture of a struggle that never took a breath. The Resistance, led by General Leia, find themselves in the middle of a back and forth with General Hux’s First Order. Hux, truly the bitchiest member of this new iteration of the Empire, gets into a humorous bit of dialogue with a solo Poe Dameron scouting just ahead of a charge of bombers who are attempting to lay waste to the First Order’s colossal Dreadnought. While this event will set the stage for what drives Poe, Finn, Leia, a few new additions to the cast, and the entire Resistance itself, it’s also probably the last time audiences are held subject to the standard light and dark side debate that has populated these films as a rule. It was the accepted line of thinking that the guys dressed in black are bad, and the scrappy underdogs in white, and various lighter shades are the good guys. Well, Mr. Johnson was going to have none of that, as The Last Jedi is a film all about the debate of what lies between those two extremes. Not every character necessarily approaches moral grey tones, but even those characters that are what we deem to be inherently “good” or “bad” are faced with conflicts that drive a question into the morality of their cause. A daring choice for the world’s most popular blockbuster series, but when Johnson (who both writes and directs here) centers in directly on that theme, The Last Jedi does something that is all too rare for the Star Wars series: introducing new notions within the sphere of its seemingly impenetrable worldview, and new ways of how we might conceive the two warring factions and the people that have to work for them and the little people who find themselves under their boot heel. But, as a caveat, the further away the filmmaker gets from this novel approach, the less effective the film becomes. This can be seen clearly in the division of narrative between the three major protagonists of The Force Awakens. Each hero from that last outing, Rey, Finn, and Poe are given their own slice of the film within which to work, and it’s clear where in each of the three that Johnson’s interests chiefly lie. Rey’s storyline, the most effective of the trio, finds her making contact with the long-lost Luke Skywalker in an attempt to bring him back into the fold of the Resistance, and in turn determine her own place within it and The Force itself. Additionally, this is where Kylo Ren, the wayward son of the now deceased Han Solo and Leia, is directly involved – and if this series does nothing else, it absolutely, 100%, proves to me that he is the most unique and well-developed character of the Star Wars universe. Here, he is basically the mouth piece for Johnson’s vision of this struggle, and every scene he and Rey share outshines everything else that surrounds it. We knew Adam Driver was a compelling and nuanced actor, even before this film began to roll, but the surprise here is just how well Daisy Ridley is able to match Driver’s well-known intensity. Luke plays a sort of middle-man between them, and it’s not a stretch to say this is surely Mark Hamill’s best outing in the role. He’s given a good deal of meat to chew on as a bearded, reclusive version of the previous trilogy’s central hero. The most welcome element on hand is just how effectively Hamill carves out this elder version of the character and stands separate from any temptation to make him the “Obi Wan” of this entry. From the emotional beats he presents, and the general sense of stubbornness throughout, you can conceivably believe this is the man that Luke grew into. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron gets a lot more to work with this time around. Rather than just being the very likable, handsome pilot guy, he’s now the Commander of the Resistance fleet and our POV within the machinations of their operating order. Through his story, we spend most of our time with Leia, as well as Lauren Dern’s purple-haired Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. In this way, Poe’s end of the tale works as a counter-point to the ongoing struggle between Hux and Kylo Ren. In both cases, we see the inner-workings of office politics and their respective power struggles. Poe is faced with issues related to the chain of command, especially in times of crisis – there’s a not too subtle influence of Battlestar Galactica present here. It is an arc that is mostly effective, though somewhat truncated by its proximity to the least compelling storyline of the film. Which brings us to poor old Finn. Finn, who occupied an exciting space within The Force Awakens (that of the faceless Stormtrooper turned hero), is saddled with what is basically a gigantic fetch-quest and the on-boarding of a new character in Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, a member of the Resistance who volunteers to help him on this side-mission that feels like it lasts 10 years. Not only are the sequences they are involved in the least exciting of the entire affair, but they also are the stretches that rely the most on green screen and iffy special effects, neither of which are Johnson’s specialty. One of the troubles here is that Finn basically is static throughout, and he’s grafted to what is basically a non-entity in Rose. A character, who in theory, fits right alongside the themes that are being developed in all three storylines to some degree, but the execution of the character is the thing, and Rose never seems to grow beyond “earnest” with a connection between these two that feels rushed to say the least. There’s a lot of tell here, and nowhere near enough show. And to briefly get back to the subject of Carrie Fisher, her return here is bittersweet, as her passing last year does indeed echo within every scene she appears. But thankfully, she is the centerpiece of two of The Last Jedi‘s most touching moments, one that is especially artful and the other overflowing with emotion, striking a nerve in a moment that is sure to choke up audiences. Despite the script’s occasional lapses, there is at least some worthwhile study for the cinephiles in the crowd, as the stark contrast between the Abrams approach: with his wide environmental vistas and shots that are mostly at eye-level with his actors vs. that of Johnson who takes a slightly more “up from the ground” viewpoint, with much of the action occurring inside somewhat claustrophobic settings, makes for a unique point of comparison between two very different filmmakers. It’s not that I expect much auteur imprint, but it’s nice to get a hint of the artist behind the camera, which is apparent in both instances, and likely where a lot of the rewatch value will be found where this reviewer is concerned. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a tale of one really great “A plot” and character progression, and a pair of solid and undercooked storylines, respectively, that are tied together as a sort-of “B and C plot”. The good news is that by the time the movie enters its climatic final moments, it hits a pretty good groove before the credits, though the way it comes together isn’t exactly graceful. On the whole, it’s an outing that could have done a little more with less, and while Johnson and company are bursting with ideas (some of which defy expectations), they don’t all work and the overly bloated running time of 152 minutes is a testament to that fact. The truth is, there’s an entire segment of the film that could have been excised completely from the script and not much would have been lost. When it works, it really works, but the fat overwhelms it all too often. Johnson acts as a sort of caretaker to the concepts and characters introduced in 2015, and to his credit, he gets them from one end of the film to the other without any major hiccups (save for Finn); but with that said, I find myself far more enthused to see Abrams pick the baton back up for Episode IX and close out what he started. They should have gone with the novel approach in the sense of setting the trilogy in the existing movie and novel canon that already existed. Give us new Legends ! I’ll see it anyway, to see Carrie Fisher one last time, and for Hamill in a meaty role. No idea if I’ll see any more SW. I have no interest at all in the “young Han Solo” movie. I figured reviews like mine are deep in the minority, as I’m seeing a lot of effusive praise in my immediate sphere (and a pretty high Rotten Tomatoes score fwiw), though I haven’t had time to go scouring to really get a sense of the consensus.  Thought my tastes must be the inverse of yours when you said you love TFA but didn’t like RO, but I saw TLJ last night and couldn’t agree more. Finn’s storyline is actually pretty dire. Comparing the pretty awesome into sequence to the pointless nonsense of the casino planet is like night and day.  Also, the constant sappy mottos (“The spark that will relight the rebellion”) and inorganic dialogue relating to good vs evil seriously hurt the conversations. Both the serious tone and jokes worked well, but sometimes the comic diversions got prequel trilogy levels of silly. The inconsistent flow of time was a constant irritation. Some plot details, like Rose’s medallion, or Holden’s withholding of her plan, were frustratingly stupid. I never cared about the stakes, and it’s a film with no ending.  Some amazing parts, too. The intro and the storylines of Rey, Luke and Kylo were ace, and the final battle was in parts quite cool. Overall, though, not a great film. There was a good hour in the middle that I wouldn’t want to watch ever again. I don’t know why anyone would be surprised that “The Force Awakens” is a really good movie. It’s essentially a remake of the original and that is a flat out great motion picture. Not a great sci-fi or nerd flick. It’s a legitimately masterful exercise in storytelling. “The Last Jedi” can be no worse than the fifth best Star Wars flick because there’s some genuinely good stuff in it and none of the bad stuff is shoved down your throat as hard as it was in the prequels. This movie is not going to age well, though, and it’s so fundamentally flawed that I cannot comprehend the amount of worshipful praise it’s received from a lot of critics. Saw it yesterday. It’s a good but not great movie. Hamill is excellent, the frail-looking Carrie Fisher is touching, all the acting was at least competent. Rose was a good addition to the cast. I was glad that — SPOILER ALERT — Ren’s parents turned out to be nameless nobodies. That was realistic. Maybe now people can stop speculating that Luke is her father. I was pretty satisfied overall. I could probably nitpick over things, and probably will later. At least it was better than Rogue One (2 hours of boredom, capped by an exciting battle). I was never bored during Last Jedi."
"Jan 26, 2019",positive," It’s 2017 and it’s time to write about Luke Skywalker being a show-stealing character… It’s one of the many weirder things about Star Wars being back, but I’m happy to see the character get to put in another great appearance. The film overall can be summed up like this: Great opening, great ending, dull middle. Two out of three ain’t bad! Let’s take a closer look then! Only General Leia Organa’s band of Resistance fighters stand against the rising tyranny, certain that Jedi Master Luke Skywalker will return and restore a spark of hope to the fight. Rey (Daisy Ridley) – Rey has come from obscurity to realise she has a strong connection to the Force. She has found the legendary Luke Skywalker and hopes he can help point her in the right direction. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) – Luke failed his own nephew Ben Solo and has since ran off to hide, wishing to die amongst the ruins of the first Jedi temple. Can the recently visited Rey change his mind? Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) – A low-tier member of the Resistance who idolizes those at the top. The First Order took everything away from both her and her sister, and she is happy to help fight them any way she can. Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) – A vice admiral (GASP!) in the Resistance. She can be a little standoffish, a little hard to crack, but does have the Resistance’s interests at heart. The first thing that pops into my mind is Luke Skywalker’s arc. Mark Hamill has never been better, which is good because the material he’s been asked to act has never been more complex. Luke’s a broken and bitter man when Rey first meets him, and to eventually hear him talk about the old Jedi order and himself as arrogant, short-sighted and pretty much stupid was an eye-opener. He was right though! He momentarily had a moment of weakness when he felt Ben Solo’s darkness growing and thought to kill him in his sleep, and this lead to Ben waking, seeing what was going on and eventually go crazy. Just one, tiny thought, and it cost him everything. Instead of blaming Snoke (who was manipulating Ben’s darkness) and fight him, he ran in shame. Heavy stuff, not very Luke Skywalker-like as I mentioned in Force Awakens, but writer/director Rian Johnson made the best of a bad situation. When Rey goes off to fight, he gets visited by Yoda, who pretty much tells him he was right, mistakes have been made in the past, but forget about the old order and use your mistakes to teach. Oh what’s that? The rest of the movie? Right, well, the relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren was great in this. The two become connected via the Force, able to speak and even touch each other halfway across the galaxy, despite everything the two form a bond, with Rey believing that Ren can be saved. She goes off to meet him and ends up in handcuffs and brought to Snoke, who for the record orchestrated all of this. This plays out almost exactly the like the scenes between the Emperor, Luke and Vader in Return of the Jedi, except Ren sneakingly kills Snoke and then battles his guards alongside Rey. It was a great moment, mostly because of how Snoke “felt” Ren about to ignite his lightsaber and “strike down the one he wants to kill”, but didn’t realise his apprentice was manipulating Luke’s old lightsaber that was on Snoke’s throne rather than his own one, leading to his end. A very clever scene, and the battle between Rey, Ren and the guards was great! Sadly for Rey, Kylo Ren now claims he’s going to tare down everything old and rebuild it anew and wants Rey by his side to do it, which of course Rey wants no part of. The two fight over Luke’s old sabre before being blown backwards. Rey escapes and rejoins up with the Resistance and Kylo Ren becomes the new Supreme Leader, setting up a big battle between the two in Episode IX. It’s a very fun dynamic. One of the best scenes has to be Vice Admiral Holdo and her suicide ship ram. Basically Snoke’s impossibly gigantic ship is looming over the remains of the Resistance fleet, so she, alone on the cruiser, points it at the super-large vessel and light-speeds through a good portion of it. It was so beautifully shot as soon as it happens all sound cuts out and your treated to a light show as the ship explodes and nearby star destroyers are lit up by it. It’s such a great moment. I also have to say that this film does a great job of making the Resistance out to be against the wall, that’s for sure. They lost their entire governing body in Episode VII, here they lose a bunch of ships and soldiers in the opening battle, including Admiral Ackbar (no!!) and every other high-ranking general in the Resistance barring Leia, and eventually are down to one ship, then just a group of them in a small factory on a salty planet. Talk about underdogs! Okay, so this film isn’t perfect. It really sags in the middle, after the Resistance start to pull away from the enemy fleet, they two sets of ships get into some sort of… space… lock… thing, where the First Order can’t catch up to the Resistance ships so just slowly barrage their shield for the hell of it and wait for them to run out of fuel. This is the set up for, like, over an hour of the film, possibly an hour and a half. During this we get some good Luke and Rey training scenes, but we also get a subplot of Finn and Rose going to a casino planet and trying to find a codebreaker, then freeing a bunch of tamed and mistreated animals, make their way back, get on board Snoke’s ship, get caught, and escape… all of which has no effect of any of the plot. It’s complete filler, with the possible exception of getting Rose and Finn close, for presumably romantic purposes in Episode IX, but you could literally cut that whole thing out and it would make no difference. Captain Phasma, who literally did nothing of note in Force Awakens returns! … and gets swiftly beaten by Finn and seemingly killed in minutes. Jeez… why bring her back at all?! Although I get you needed someone to manipulate Ben Solo and command the First Order, but Snoke in the end was pretty pointless. He was a means to give Kylo Ren powers and then thrown to the side when it was time for Ren to take command. I’m sure he’ll have a good backstory in expanded media, but still… seems like a waste. Especially since I actually liked his cheesy evil ways in this film, even though I liked his death scene… Hmmm… kind of a mixed bag, this one. Well then, as I summed up in the opening paragraph, this film starts off great and ends great, but sags in the middle. That being said I’m almost tempted to give it 5 stars for giving such a great send off to Luke Skywalker (although I’m sure he’ll be back as a Force Ghost!), and throw in the great Rey-Kylo Ren stuff… Erm… Hmm… Nah, I still can’t quite give it 5, during the dull middle I was metaphorically checking my watch to see how much time had passed, waiting for something exciting to happen. No matter how fantastic the bread is, I can’t forgive a disappointing filling. Still, well worth your while going to see! I didn’t quite buy Luke drawing his sword. When he did so in return it was under a much more intense situation, and Luke would have likely developed at least SOMEWHAT more control as time passed. I can see the thought crossing his mind but there’s a difference between that and ACTUALLY drawing your weapon. All in all it just didn’t work for me."
"Jan 19, 2019",positive," Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Rogue One were both box-office successes and heralded as the return of the blockbuster franchise king, but both have a similar long-term problem: They hang onto nostalgia for the 1977 classic for dear life. My review of The Force Awakens called it the first “OK” Star Wars movie; Aly’s review of Rogue One called it “flawed but enjoyable.” I still rewatch them; the characters in Awakens especially are dazzling. But after two movies that so directly called back to Star Wars: A New Hope, it was natural to start wondering if Disney only had one trick up its sleeves with this new set of films. So … Star Wars: The Last Jedi has the unenviable task of proving whether the Star Wars franchise still has meaning, and it manages to with tremendous success. Deeper, broader, funnier and more thrilling than its predecessor, The Last Jedi isn’t only the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, it’s the first Star Wars movie in 30 years to truly feel like an evolution of the franchise. It may also prove to be one of the most controversial films in the series. The story picks up where Awakens left off, separating our core trio of heroes — Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Rey has travelled to the ancient Jedi temple Ach-To to meet Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in hopes of luring him back into the Resistance to retaliate against the evil First Order, led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Finn is unconscious in a medical bay after a battle with Kylo Ren, and Poe is helping lead the Resistance evacuation. In classic Star Wars fashion, their stories separate and converge at different points. It creates an odd, but not unfamiliar, pacing dynamic that writer-director Rian Johnson navigates as gracefully as he can, slowly building thematic resonance between their separate adventures. Strength of theme is where The Last Jedi separates itself from the other movies and where it is most similar to The Empire Strikes Back. While it moves the overall story of the trilogy further, it also exists within a self-contained unit of story that explores several specific ideas: the nature of war, the meaning of the Force, what legacy means. Each of the characters’ individual stories play off these ideas, and all of them contribute to the film’s final statement. Yes, there are space battles, lightsaber fights and other dramatic reveals, but beneath it all is a story of a galaxy at war and doing the absolute best you can do under the circumstances. It’s a much more contemporary understanding of war than the original trilogy ever provided in that it understands conflict is perpetual and difficult to definitively divide into “good” and “bad.” As the originals reflected World War II and the prequels reflected Vietnam and Iraq, this tale borrows from our globalized, millennial understanding of war as a condition and collapse as ongoing. It is marvelous. The performances are all as good as they’ve ever been — particularly Hamill, whose reprise as Luke is everything you can ever expect, and maybe more. Ridley, Driver, Boyega and Isaac also bring real humor and depth to their characters, given far more nuance here than in Awakens. The standout here, though, is the late Carrie Fisher, whose General Leia more than gets her due. It’s a stark contrast from J.J. Abrams’ direction of Fisher in The Force Awakens, in which he seemed unsure how to light or even shoot the actress. Johnson knows what Fisher can do, and he lets her do it. It’s a tragedy that we will never see another Star Wars film with her actually in it, but it’s also a wonder we ever got this one. There are many plot twists in The Last Jedi that I’m hesitant to spoil, but it’s worth addressing how deeply controversial many of Johnson’s decisions may prove to be. The fact is that the Star Wars franchise has always been, and may always be, about that core mythological story contained in the first three movies. A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are the great 20th-century American mythology. Their prequel films are meant to be watched after them (that whole “machete order” bull about watching them between Empire and Return misunderstands how storytelling works) and their “expanded universe” of novels, comics, games and TV shows all are meant to be enjoyed in the orbit of those three movies. The new Disney era has so far churned out a remake of and a direct prequel to A New Hope. The prequels were three movies all leading to A New Hope. The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars movie in years to feel like it exists in a moral and philosophical universe that expands upon, rather than takes comfort in, that first movie. It takes its time in the middle, doing the hard work of setting up stories for every character that all pay off in the final act. Part of this is because The Force Awakens did a genuinely poor job creating threads for this movie to pick up; another is that Rian Johnson is interested in telling a story that echoes through each individual arc. It’s a movie that wears its ideas and cinematic influences on its sleeve, a movie that aims for something higher. It’s about hope in the darkest of times — you could argue that’s the core thesis of the original trilogy and certainly Rogue One, and you would be right. But it’s more than just that. It’s about the legacy of hope, the imperfection of heroes, the passing of knowledge down from one generation to another in the name of something better. It captures the eternal struggle — not between good and evil but within the lived experience of individual people, faced with their own conflicts and hurdles. Beyond Skywalkers, Vaders and redemptions, Jedi, Sith and Empires. “Legacy” is the buzzword for reinvigorated franchises these days, and many use it as an excuse to ramp up the same old stories with mere window dressing. The Last Jedi is something new, something beautifully realized that plays off what came before while finding a new direction. You can’t destroy the past. You can only learn from it. For the first time, it feels like the Star Wars saga truly has."
"Jan 10, 2019",positive," It is a fair criticism to say that Star Wars: The Force Awakens is very similar to the original Star Wars and there was some concern that its successor would be a repeat of The Empire Strikes Back. While the two films share some of the same themes, for instance, The Last Jedi is certainly a much darker film than the first in its trilogy, and it offers a different and much-needed perspective on the Star Wars Universe. However, it is still a fun and wild ride that could leave the viewer breathless depending on how willing they are to embrace a new kind of story in a much-loved world. With a running time of 2 hours and 31 minutes, it is no surprise that a lot happens in The Last Jedi. There is very little filler and the story is jam-packed with character development, long-awaited reveals, and story progression. The film takes place over only a few days and it is tightly focused on giving a full accounting of all aspects of the story. The film picks up where The Force Awakens left off, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) handing Luke (Mark Hamill) the lightsaber while elsewhere the Rebels flee the impending threat of the First Order.  While I don’t want to give away any plot details, I will say there are some very satisfying answers given regarding character backgrounds and motivations that may be divisive among fans, but I found most of them appropriate for the time we are living in and this version of the Star Wars universe. The original cast members play bigger roles than in the previous film, but they are for the most part passive and allow for the next generation to take up the mantle of leadership. The Last Jedi is visually beautiful with incredible detail and tastefully used CGI, but even the most fantastic of the many fights and space battles take a backseat to the character-driven story. Where The Force Awakens dipped its toes into the pool of diverse casting, The Last Jedi makes a spectacular dive and provides a wide range of characters. Most of the new people who are introduced are people of color and/or women and they are given the roles of heroes and villains instead of sideline supporters. Carrie Fisher’s Leia is finally given the scenes she has always deserved, showing her skill at leadership and giving us a hint at how she has kept the Rebel Alliance together all these years. The subtle complexity of Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) is the perfect example of how this film is an expansion of all the previous entries in the Star Wars universe. Rian Johnson’s script uses several callbacks to both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but subverts them in a way that is rarely seen in franchise films. Instead of using them as nostalgia triggers, The Last Jedi reminds viewers of what has come before and then purposefully diverges from those choices to illustrate the danger of repeating our mistakes. Our three main characters, Rey, Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac), drive the story with their hope, their failure, and their desire to make the world a better place. That is where the difference between this film and all the others is the most striking; it explicitly states that their struggle is not just about defeating the bad guy, but about forging something new and better for those they love and those who will come after. The Last Jedi is by no means a perfect film, and your enjoyment of it will vary depending on your reactions to the plot and certain changes that are made to previously established rules, but it is told with an incredible skill and is riveting to watch. The information that has been revealed allows for intriguing possibilities and the implications for future installments will provide ample fodder for discussion. The Last Jedi is Disney’s best contribution to the Star Wars canon so far and we can only hope that the final film of this trilogy will live up to the new standard.

"Jan 8, 2019",positive," Star Wars: The Last Jedi has finally hit theaters. But who is the Last Jedi, really? And what to make of the longest running Star Wars film in the franchise’s history? One thing is certain: regardless of how much you enjoy the film as a whole, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is designed to wring out every possible emotion from its audience that it can. There is much at stake and director Rian Johnson knows this, knows that the film’s emotional core is going to be the primary takeaway no matter what happens on screen. He does everything possible to make certain that there is always something to feel, even if there isn’t always something to track logically. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that there is far too much packed into it. The longest Star Wars film before Episode VIII was Episode II: Attack of the Clones, which was mired with pacing issues, and Last Jedi is unfortunately no different. It somehow manages to have even more story threads going than any installment of the prequels ever had, and is incapable of shepherding each of them to a satisfying conclusion. There are a few diversions too many while the central storyline (surrounding the fate of the Resistance and Rey’s time spent with Luke Skywalker) needs a sharper focus. The new characters that Johnson introduces us to shine brightly, but need more time to grow. Laura Dern is spellbinding as Amilyn Holdo, but the character’s history needs more context for her overall role in the film to make sense. (She is featured heavily in the YA book about Leia’s early days in the Rebellion, Leia: Princess of Alderaan, but you barely get a sense of that past with her role in the film.) Kelly Marie Tran flipping sparkles in her role as Rose Tico, Resistance maintenance worker who sticks to Finn’s side, but she deserves more attention than the film is capable of giving her, particularly given how important she is to the overall plot. Benicio del Toro’s mysterious turn as “DJ” is an odd extra bit of casting that reads as though Johnson just really wanted the guy in the movie and basically let him do whatever he wanted. He’s fun to watch, but it’s still a bit confusing as to why he’s there. There are some clever curveballs that Johnson throws into the tale. While much early speculation from fans spouted the common suggestion that The Last Jedi would likely mirror The Empire Strikes Back, there’s far less of the movie in there than one might have anticipated. Instead, there are several places where this film holds narrative hands with Return of the Jedi, often in the most unexpected ways. Occasionally the pieces where you can spot connections to the original Star Wars trilogy are incredibly jarring, but Episode VIII has far too much going on in it to feel like a solid rehashing of previous films. Most of the overstuffed issues of Last Jedi come down to extra locations that we don’t need or attempts to lighten the tone that don’t fully succeed. It reads as though Johnson was concerned about leaving the film without enough laughs, but many of the jokes are oddly out of place. (The much-anticipated porgs are cute and actually pretty fun to watch on their own, but why they needed to be in this film in particular is anyone’s guess.) The detour to Canto Bight, the casino world full of high-rollers that was previewed heavily by Vanity Fair before the film’s release, is a very distracting B-plot that fails to pay out dividends in the film’s larger scheme, making it a confusing and lengthy diversion. But despite the unevenness of the film overall, The Last Jedi succeeds in the places where it needs to the most; specifically, in reintroducing audiences to Luke Skywalker, giving more background on Ben Solo’s fall to the Dark Side, and allowing Rey to continue to continue her journey in this story. Mark Hamill has been waiting for this since he stood on a cliffside in The Force Awakens and didn’t say a word, and he gives everything to the performance. Luke Skywalker’s presence carries the weight of this massive tale in most respects, and that presence forces the audience to ask important questions about the nature of this galaxy far, far away; the idea of what balance in the Force truly looks like, the difficulty of inhabiting a legendary figure who is still a flesh-and-blood person, the true purpose of owning one’s failures. The pain that comes from bearing the Skywalker name (for both Luke and Leia) is not made simple for the purposes of this story—Anakin and Padmé’s children have suffered dearly for their legacy, and it’s clear that the galaxy over-relies on them to that end. The knowledge that Carrie Fisher is gone is the sharpest sting of watching The Last Jedi, and it can’t help but stand out in light of the movie’s arc; when these films started, the plan was to have Force Awakens focus on Han, Last Jedi focus on Luke, and the final film focus on Leia. The events of Episode VIII offer a perfect bridge to that arc, begging questions about Leia’s way forward and the extreme personal sacrifices that can accompany being a leader and a literal embodiment of hope. The greatest loss that we suffer in The Last Jedi is the knowledge that we will never see the Episode IX that could have been. We will never watch our general complete her story. Still, the saga continues, and this chapter ends with the sensation of a freshly opened wound. It’s hardly surprising for the middle chapter of a three-part story, but all pain is unique. The Force Awakens came for your heart, but The Last Jedi is here for your spirit. With stakes that high, Episode IX is a frightening prospect indeed.

"Dec 17, 2018",positive," Two years after The Force Awakens, Star Wars is back with The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson’s take on the franchise and the eighth instalment in the saga. Given Johnson’s penchant for character-driven movies and his sharp eye for a beautiful visual, anticipation was high for what he could do in the galaxy far, far away – and given the incredible success of the marvellous The Force Awakens, the pressure was on and the stakes were high. The Republic has been decimated and the ragtag Resistance is on the run from the actually massive First Order and their deadly duo – Kylo Ren (Driver) and Supreme Leader Snoke (Serkis). Having secured a huge victory and then suddenly suffering a massive defeat, General Leia Organa (Fisher), Poe Dameron (Isaac) and newcomer Vice Admiral Holdo (Dern) are left to rally the beleaguered troops. Elsewhere, having found Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Hamill) in exile, Force strong Rey (Ridley) struggles to convince him to return to the battle for the galaxy. The depressed and lost Master is struggling to reconcile his failures in resurrecting the Jedi Order, and now questions the Jedi religion as a whole. Speaking of struggles, Kylo Ren is struggling to let the Dark Side consume him fully – with Snoke in his ear and Rey having a larger than expected effect on him, the conflicted ex-padawan (and filthy Han Solo murderer…) is desperate to find his place in the galaxy, just like Rey. Finn (Boyega) returns from his spine-slashing during The Force Awakens and buddies up with Resistance technician Rose (Tran) in order to infiltrate the First Order and give the Resistance a chance to simply survive, let alone win the fight – and with the shady DJ (del Toro) and murderess Captain Phasma (Christie) in the picture, nothing’s going to be simple. My first concern going into The Last Jedi is Star Wars movies without Han Solo tend to fall more on the side of average (Rogue One aside) and secondly, would this just be The Empire Strikes Back in a new hat? Thankfully, both of these concerns have been well and truly dashed. Are there similar beats? Of course, but there are similar beats to many other movies out there too – one criticism that cannot be levelled at The Last Jedi is that it’s a duplicate of Empire, in the same way that The Force Awakens riffed off the Original Trilogy pretty heavily. It’s also the longest Star Wars movie of the saga, leaving Johnson enough time to squeeze in as much story and beats as he possibly could, and for the vast majority of the time, it all works.  Compared to previous instalments, this movie certainly takes a lot more risks – in terms of the perceptions of the Jedi and the Force, visually it’s strikingly different, the non-standard narrative flow, character motivations, it feels a lot more ambitious than what’s come before (certainly since Empire) and it’s refreshing to see a new direction being taken. It’s fair to say that The Force Awakens was a more ‘fun’ movie, more of a crowd-pleasing movie, though The Last Jedi has plenty of levity attached to it throughout. Performance-wise, the level is staggeringly high for a franchise not always associated with high-class acting. After recent appearances in Kingsman and Brigsby Bear, Mark Hamill delivers the finest performance of his career as the embittered and exiled Jedi Master and Carrie Fisher (RIP) also hasn’t been better before. The returning cast – Ridley, Boyega, Driver - all show greater signs of maturity in their abilities and have grown significantly into their characters, whereas Oscar Isaac is generally always good. Of the newcomers, Kelly Marie Tran shines brightest as the technician thrust into the fight and bright lights of casino city Canto Bight and is highly endearing with her performance. Andy Serkis is bad-ass as Snoke. Period. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. Similar to The Force Awakens and Rogue One, this movie is jam-packed with stunning, memorable shots and some fantastic (as per usual) visual FX. The space battles pop with colour, fire and expansive wide shots of massive Star Destroyers/Dreadnaughts and the more meditative moments allow for greater nuance in cinematography. As a motion-capture creation (as opposed to a huge hologram), Supreme Leader Snoke looks unnervingly genuine here as Andy Serkis works his wonder once more. The sound design is also impressively handled, especially in the stranger moments within the movie – as is John Williams score which feels more accomplished this time around compared to The Force Awakens. In terms of story, The Last Jedi is full of twists and turns that will surprise and engage you in equal measures. Again, the vast majority hit their mark as intended, though a couple don’t quite connect as well as Johnson maybe intended (space floating, anyone? It’s not bad, it just looked slightly bizarre) – the heavier, emotional beats were delivered brilliantly, however. There’s no one moment that steals the movie a la “I am your Father”, and the revelations are sprinkled through and the major reveals are handled just right (especially within the third act). With so many plot points being covered it’s inevitable that some moments weren’t as compelling as others and the casino arc was probably the weakest moment in the movie, whilst still remaining a strong component. Some of the humour was ill-placed at times and could take viewers out of certain moments, but the vast majority is great. Also, the Porgs (have I mentioned them?) aren’t the new Ewoks, thankfully, and their small screentime is utilised just right. There are some great space battles and incredible fight scenes also, one especially that is a joy to watch – choreography-wise and the location create a rewarding action scene. Crucially, the stakes feel high as well, it doesn’t really ever feel guaranteed that the good guys will prevail – it certainly puts the war in Star Wars. The Last Jedi is certainly an adventure that will pull you this way and throw you that way but never ceases to be anything but Star Wars – as different as it is in comparison to the previous efforts, it stills retains the core essence of the saga. It certainly will prove to be divisive, but hey, so was The Empire Strikes Back when it was released way back when. Buckle up and get ready for a wild ride."
"Dec 13, 2018",positive," The themes of this film are layered and have multiple facets to them. One of them is to let the past die. This message goes for the film but also the audience. The Last Jedi respects its historic past, addresses the legends of it’s lore, and takes into account the events of the previous films but makes you think about them in a bold new way. Over the last two years, we’ve heard every fan theory, speculation and prediction possible for this film and Rian Johnson accomplishes to circumvent all of them and give the audience a film they weren’t expecting. The second the film picks up from where The Force Awakens leaves off, it instructs you to expect the unexpected. From Luke Skywalker’s demeanor and actions, to Rey and Kylo Ren’s arcs, everything is given room to breathe and isn’t spoon fed to force you into one particular way of thinking. What Rian Johnson did is challenge these characters and challenge the audience of their pre-conceived notion of these characters like any middle point of a trilofy should. Rian Johnson did not give us Empire Strikes Back 2.0. Instead, he took what made Empire special, it’s unpredictablity, and used it well for the middle point of this Trilogy. The characters all impressed in this film. This mostly extends to three characters above all. Luke Skywalker, Rey and Kylo Ren. All three were used well and serviced in a way that adds to the lore of Star Wars and history of these iconic characters. Mark Hamill’s performance as Luke is nothing short of spectacular. Starkly different from his joyful and unyeilding hopeful nature of the original trilogy, we meet Luke in a broken state. Haunted by the past and afraid of the present. While audiences might be wary of seeing an iconic character like Luke in this state, it is precisely why this characterization was so great. It was a challenge to the audience and a challenge to the character to find his way back to the light. Luke had an arc that impressed me and his legendary status in Star Wars lore has resounding development. Without spoiling, my favorite scene in the film was one involving him. Rey and Kylo, two sides of the same coin, are developed well in this film. Both go through a soul searching arc that arrived to an interesting and unexpected destination . Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are impressive and have developed right alongside their respective characters. Both moved significant steps in their respective arcs and I’m very excited to see where Abrams and Terrio take them for the final entry of this trilogy. Poe, Finn, Rose and BB-8 are all serviceable and did their required jobs in the story as secondary characters. While I felt the story thread with Finn and Rose in particular dragged a bit, it didn’t hinder the film much. Poe was developed well and is on a clear emotional arc in this film that will surly be developed and concluded in the final entry of this trilogy. Original Trilogy icons, Leia, Chewy, C-3PO and R2-D2 showed up in true form and Carrie Fisher’s Leia gave a resonant, powerful and emotional performance as the Princess/General. It was a bittersweet but inspiring to see her and she had some of the best moments of the film. R.I.P Rian Johnson filmed one of the most beautiful films in the Star Wars saga. Filled with impressive, striking and beautiful shots, The Last Jedi is a constant eye pleasing beauty, all backed behind John Willaims’ iconic and powerful score. Overall, The Last Jedi is great. It challenges the characters, challenges the audience and challenges the actors. In the end, it transforms into a film that will stand the test of time and rank right up with Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope. Rian Johnson has proved his potential with this franchise and I look forward to what he does with a clean slate trilogy. The Last Jedi is the best way to handle the middle point of the trilogy, where The Force Awakens is feel good and nostalgia filled start, The Last Jedi breaks new ground and moves the story in a bold direction that is healthy for the franchise. In short, The Last Jedi is a powerful, emotional and ambitious film that makes for one of the best films in the series."
"Dec 8, 2018",positive," Here we are again. For the third Christmas season straight, moviegoers have been treated to what once seemed unthinkable: more Star Wars. Last year, we were treated to the Gareth Edwards-directed Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the “lost story” that told of how the Death Star came to be and of the Rebels who fought to find a way to destroy it. I reviewed that film for Geeks Under Grace, and love or hate the story, it undeniably allowed a trip back into the look and feel of the original films that hadn’t been done for decades. Two years ago, we picked up decades after the original trilogy ended with The Force Awakens (Episode VII, for those keeping count), directed by J.J. Abrams. Whereas Rogue One filled in gaps between the prequels and the original saga, The Force Awakens plotted the course of a new trilogy of films with both familiar and new characters in a tale that was also both familiar and new (how forgivable that sense of familiarity was depends on who you ask). In it, we found out the whereabouts of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, and more, but we learn those things through a new tale focused on new characters like Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren, General Hux, Captain Phasma, Supreme Leader Snoke, and, lest we forget, BB-8. Seen by most critics as a fun return to the universe we love, it ended with many unanswered questions. Now, two years after that, we begin to get some answers from Episode VIII, directed by Rian Johnson. I’ll begin by saying that this film has no problem with bucking conventions. Reacting to the line we hear from Luke in the film, we can correctly infer that surprises are aplenty. With a fanbase locked and loaded with two years worth of theories and ideas of where things are headed, Rian Johnson iced most all of them down like a Hoth battle. And just when you think, “Oh wait! This film has a snow-covered Hoth battle too!”, he explicitly has it stated that the similar look is only that, and that it is all salt instead. I’m sure that salt will be a good descriptor of the reaction of many who have their feelings hurt after their theories are torn to shreds, but only time will tell. Anyway, I won’t delve into the plot, other than saying that all the primary players are pushed into new, more complicated directions. Trailers divulge that Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeks the tutelage of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), now embittered and in self-imposed exile for mistakes of the past. Those mistakes center around his past instruction of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), himself now struggling further under the direction and expectations of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Finn (John Boyega) has recovered from his wounds, but after reviving, he is sent covertly by a desperate and disgruntled Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) with another Resistance enlistee, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), to find a way to destroy the tracking mechanisms of the First Order. Without these systems disabled, the Resistance leadership, including General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), will be effectively neutralized by the pursuing General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) and company. While that may sound like too much information, please know that I withheld far more than that, and within those plot threads, many, many secrets will be answered and new questions will be posed. While The Force Awakens played very closely to what came before it, not just in look and feel but in actual storytelling elements, The Last Jedi is very refreshing for the saga. There was a boldness that came within those original films of fighting against conventional thought on what a sci-fi film could be. Here, we see that coming against what we think a Star Wars film can be. Does every new introduction land flawlessly? No, but that boldness to try is a great thing to see play out. One can tell that Rian Johnson is a true fan of it all, and knowing that he is now entrusted to tell a new set of tales in a future trilogy is an incredible thing to look forward to. I felt in this film that anything could happen, and in this age of spoilers, it’s quite the feeling. Do all you can to keep secrets just that, and enjoy this film on its own terms. Back to Johnson: he crafts shots and sequences that feel unique to what we expect of Star Wars. That will likely divide people, but no one can fault the beauty of it all. The “middle films”  tend to deal with some dark themes, and that does find its way into the look of the films as well; the same holds true in The Last Jedi. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous here, and whether it be a lingering shot or a frenetic action sequence (there are many of both extremes), it is all a moviegoing pleasure to witness. I watched the film in 3D, but I am certain that the richness and “pop” lies more in the choice and execution of shot-framing than it does in any post-production tweaking for the 3D-effect. We go to new locales here that feel truly special. The opulence of the space casino of Canto Bight, in particular, is like no place we’ve seen in a live-action Star Wars film. I can’t wait to revisit those scenes again and again. Crait, the red crystalline planet blanketed with white salts, provides the basis for contrast that has featured so heavily in the film’s marketing, and really, those colors extend into the themes handled here. As warfare ravages the surface, the white is disturbed to reveal the red, and it is effective symbolism like this that runs throughout. This is a film that will be watched again and again, as we expect of the saga, but I do believe that we will appreciate these touches more and more as time goes on. Now, watching the film again and again might prove to be a problem in ways for many. Up to its release, it was reported that this was the longest Star Wars film yet, and I have to say that it does feel like it as well. That’s really too bad, because long films don’t always fall victim to this. Had the film been engineered a little differently in ways, I believe that it all could have clipped a little better for audiences and avoided critique in this area. Still, I hesitate to say that because it would have likely truncated or eliminated some of the new characters in the film, each of whom, including the quirky slicer DJ (Benecio Del Toro), contribute important pieces to the tale being told. Even with the bloated runtime, this film, with all of its philosophical eccentricities and complicated motivations, really does have things to say. Alongside some other relevant messages, there is a central one of hope and heroism amidst dwindling circumstances that comes through strongly; sure, it is as on the nose here as it was in Rogue One, but it all does seem to be about inspiring some kind of social or societal outlook in ways that I haven’t seen before in any of the other films. Moreso than The Force Awakens, there are some bold new points made that will surely inform all the films following, and the Force, seemingly felt to be known and understood inside and out by the audience, is shown to be even more surprising than we ever realized. These elements will likely be divisive amongst fans, but all in all, it’s exciting to go along for the ride of it all. All of the primary actors returning from The Force Awakens step up their game here, and the new additions all do their part as well to make impressions alongside them. Ridley and Driver are becoming the center of it all, and each are making this new saga more and more interesting. Boyega and Tran develop a connection that is fun to see and follow. Isaac is such an able actor, and seeing him so desperate to lead and protect as Poe is great, knowing that the original intent for the character was to die early on after his introduction. Sadly, my favorite new character from The Force Awakens, Maz Kanata, is used so inconsequentially here that I would have rather not seen her at all. John Williams brings all the right musical cues here with his score, even if, like The Force Awakens, it isn’t all exactly groundbreaking. I do hope to hear him at least conclude this trilogy, but at this point, we won’t likely hear sounds that approach his earlier works’ quality and inventiveness. Content-wise, we get about what you would expect from prior installments: some mild language, intense sequences, moments of violence, chaotic warfare explosions, and death (mentioned or played out) throughout. That said, these are films made to inspire audiences, young and old, and amazingly, those qualities come to the forefront in this film in particular. It leaves us with exciting possibilities moving forward, especially as characters are played by actors and actresses of multiple ethnicities. For Christians in particular, though, I must say that some elements of the film may rub some of us wrong. The Jedi are referenced as a religion here, and while that inference is nothing new, it does invite critique to our belief system, as well as others. The film examines a questioning of ideals held throughout the ages, a deconstruction of what we know and hold dear. I believed this to be so long before release, and I even wrote a piece on it then when the first trailer hit. While this can open up some great faith-based discussions, post-screening, with believers and non-believers alike, be prepared that the film operates as critique and go from there. As always, people will draw out or read into this film lots of religious parallels, as is often the case with the Star Wars mythos. Still, the messages I highlighted earlier are good for our time, where many feel hopeless and inconsequential. All in all, I was entertained greatly by this film. It did feel long, but so many huge things occur that it all feels somehow justified. With the crazy things we see done by starpilots and Force users, now is as much of a time of discovery, as it is enjoyment. I, along with millions, eagerly await the continuation of the stories of these new characters, as they have taken their place as the primary players in this saga now. They are inspiring children of all ages now, just like the characters of past films have done before, and that’s an amazing legacy to see come about. I eagerly await J.J. Abrams‘ conclusion to this trilogy, knowing that Rian Johnson raised the bar even higher than what Abrams had set. Until then, I have a few more theater visits to plan and a Blu-Ray to preorder! Oh, and yes: Porgs are awesome."
"Nov 19, 2018",positive," Star Wars: The Last Jedi changes up the franchise formula. It’s longer than any of its predecessors and its uneven tone sometimes doesn’t fit the series itself. However, the excitement remains with a plot that works commendably well in moving this story in a different direction. In 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens ended on a cliffhanger. Literally. The film concluded with the idealistic Rey (Daisy Ridley) meeting the elusive Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The latter character appeared only for a moment before the credits rolled, failing to utter a single word. The anticipation about his character’s evolution has only grown since then and The Last Jedi resolves that cliffhanger with unexpected results. It was inevitable that some fans would be disappointed with the follow-up installment of this series considering the build up to it. Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which featured some great new characters and a strong story, struck more of a familiar tone to long-term fans. In many ways, it was very similar to A New Hope which launched the franchise in 1977. The Last Jedi, which also introduces some great new characters, features some major twists that fans likely won’t expect. In that way, director Rian Johnson takes this series in a new direction while keeping with some of the well-known Star Wars story beats. Rey’s storyline, for instance, features her training under Skywalker (similar to how Skywalker trained with Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back). At the same time, she communicates secretly with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The sequences featuring the duo communicating through the Force create an intriguing dynamic between them, showing the dichotomy between the good and bad sides of the force. Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), a new character here, has a solid storyline as well. One of the rebel leaders, she faces off against hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who was introduced prominently in The Force Awakens. The introduction of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) as a young rebel also adds a new hopeful tone to the story. In many of the individual stories though, there are tonal distractions that stand out as obvious miscues. An early scene featuring Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) after an attack feels like it was ripped from another film. Scenes featuring Luke surviving on his planet (and milking an animal) also has an effect of distracting the audience. These are moments that never fit nicely into their stories and feel unnecessarily silly. One of Johnson’s strengths here is also one of his weaknesses. It oftentimes feels like he doesn’t want to hew that closely to the stories that came before. A common and valid criticism of The Force Awakens was that many of its story points were reminiscent of ones from A New Hope. The Last Jedi avoids that criticism by surprising audiences, especially in the dramatic third act. The Last Jedi isn’t what you would expect in the Star Wars universe. Characters that once seemed domineering fall to the side. Concepts that were planted in The Force Awakens are short-changed. These elements are interesting because they show that this series won’t only go in expected directions. But not all of the choices that Johnson makes work. That’s why even though the story works well enough, this latest installment isn’t the home run that The Force Awakens was."
"Nov 15, 2018",positive," The wait is over for Star Wars fans everywhere! As is tradition, join us for over an hour of our initial impressions of The Last Jedi, and stay tuned for part 2 dropping early next week!"
"Nov 13, 2018",positive," If J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens was an exercise in nostalgia, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi is an experiment of expectancy. It pushes the boundaries of its characters, its audience, and the franchise’s capacity, upending our expectations even as it fulfills ones we never knew we had. There are new worlds, new characters, and important new questions both raised and answered. To put it simply, this is a hopeful film; it is moving into the future of Star Wars even as it honors the past. The Last Jedi picks up right where The Force Awakens left off, with ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) recovering from his battle with the darkly unstable Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) as maverick Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and his Resistance fighters try to make their escape from the nefarious First Order. All this occurs as the intrepid Rey (Daisy Ridley) hands a lightsaber to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in an attempt to bring him back to spark hope in the rebellion, even as she eagerly desires to learn the ways of the Force from the Jedi master-turned-hermit. For all its parallels to The Empire Strikes Back in structure, themes, and existential crises, The Last Jedi is the funniest of all the Star Wars films (not including the unintentionally funny Star Wars Holiday Special). It’s also the most narratively complex, with a cast of new significant characters, including Laura Dern as Resistance leader Admiral Amilyn Holdo and Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, a Resistance mechanic who finds herself caught up with Finn in an eleventh-hour plot to save the Resistance from total destruction. A few of these narrative beats feel like they elongate the plot too much. One such sequence on a casino planet (think Mos Eisley meets Las Vegas), frankly, doesn’t affect the final outcome of the plot machinations, though it does provide for some humorous action sequences and character development. Still for all the narrative threads and various characters, Johnson has crafted a well-paced, thrilling Star Wars film filled with interesting characters and some rich ideas to explore. There are a number of surprises and twists here, ones which don’t feel hokey or a ploy, but which genuinely add to the development of key characters. It’s not only the characters who grow in their capacity–the mythology around the Force expands as well. At one point, Luke asks Rey what she really knows about the Force. Her answer, though innocent and simple, also proves her naïveté, and ours as the audience. The Force truly was awakened in Episode VII in ways we can finally experience, crossing the planes of time and space with a sense of purpose. Johnson utilizes the cinematic language to frame these Force awakenings, particularly in the editing and framing of characters in various conversations. The planetary environments are also unique and interesting, from the casino planet mentioned above to the red-and-white salt flats of a Rebel base. The cinematography is also rich and well-crafted; some shots still linger in my mind even now, and one actually made me gasp in the theatre at its brilliance in the midst of silence. With both visuals and sound–the John Williams score is as wonderful as ever here–The Last Jedi certainly leaves its impact. The Last Jedi also raises the question of politics, economics, and justice in ways previous Star Wars films haven’t broached as deeply. While the political procedurals about trade routes in Episode I are still painful in memory, the politics I’m speaking of here have to do with class structures, markets, and systems of power and oppression. We get to see just what the Resistance are resisting, and why the First Order might be “orderly” only for those who wield power through wealth and violence. We know why they’re rebelling, and we can see the impact when liberation occurs for those enslaved. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is more than a shadowy hologram; we see him in the flesh (albeit CGI flesh) sitting on an enormous throne with a long golden robe. These ostentatious signs of extravagance and greed, along with the First Order’s military quest for power and snuffing out any sense of a republic, and one doesn’t have to do much mental gymnastics to make the leap to present-day political realities. As one character quips, “It’s all just business.” In contrast to such notions, Johnson has crafted a sympathetic and affecting film, one which truly values and humanizes the characters (even the non-human ones). Did I mention BB-8? Or porgs? Or the other residents on Luke’s island? Or the lightsaber battles? Chewbacca? The Millennium Falcon? More porgs? They’re all here in The Last Jedi, and they’re wonderful. I haven’t delved into the film’s specific plot details, and I won’t for now, apart from one: Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa is far more present in The Last Jedi than I anticipated. With her tragic death nearly a year ago, and the ghastly CGI Leia in Rogue One, I was hesitant that her role would either be too brief, or CGI-infused. I can say that not only is Fisher a significant character here, but she gives a remarkable performance–to the last, she’s fully alive. Hamill is significant here too as Luke, and imbues the character with a weightiness and maturity not yet seen in Star Wars. I’d be hesitant to say its his best performance as Luke, but one could argue for it, and I wouldn’t disagree. Indeed, The Last Jedi is one of the better additions to the saga; in terms of form and direction, it’s the strongest since Empire Strikes Back. As a cinematic experiment of expectancy, it met, then far exceeded all my expectations."
"Nov 6, 2018",positive," Granted, you’ve probably never heard of the 44-year-old director unless you’re an ardent fan of his indie noir feature “Brick” or his time-traveling, action adventure “Looper.” But moviegoers everywhere are familiar with Johnson’s latest work, the long-awaited eighth episode in George Lucas’s space opera epic “Star Wars” series. “The Last Jedi” has brought in over $220 million domestically since it opened Thursday, making it the second highest grossing film on an opening weekend of all time behind 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” It’s easy to nitpick such a broad, bombastic film series, but “The Last Jedi” seeks to please many masters, most of whom have widely varying opinions about what a “Star Wars” film should be. Some will say it’s too long, that it tries too hard to be humorous, that it isn’t funny enough, that there are too many characters or not enough of “insert your favorite character here.” Everyone is right, and yet everyone is wrong at the same time. More so than any other film franchise, “Star Wars” is a series widely open to interpretation. As moviegoers, we are allowed – and outright expected – to make each and every installment our own, that there is a place for all of us in the “Star Wars” universe. It’s the same notion that makes us question whether or not we like “The Last Jedi” because it isn’t what we dreamed it would be. And that’s okay. The eighth episode picks up right where “The Force Awakens” left off, with Leia and her Resistance fighters on the run from The First Order and emerging leader Rey seeking out a now mythical Luke Skywalker to turn the tide of the war. In what will be likely her final appearance on screen, Carrie Fisher gives a measured, layered performance as former princess turned rebel general Leia. The warmth and gravitas she’s able to bring to the role grounds “The Last Jedi” in a firm sense of place, giving Johnson’s film unanticipated but much appreciated emotional depth. The same can be said of Mark Hamill in his return as Luke Skywalker. Like Fisher, Hamill’s performance in the role gets better with age and his reluctant mentorship of Daisy Ridley’s Rey provides several of the film’s best moments. For as iconic of characters as Luke and Leia are, neither has been portrayed as carefully or with as much forethought than in “The Last Jedi.” The three main heroes from “The Force Awakens” – Ridley’s Rey, John Boyega’s Finn and Oscar Isaac’s Poe – all return for this installment and do solid work. However, pedestrian storylines for Boyega and Isaac leave the talented actors with little to work with and marginalized compared to Ridley, on whom the franchise has rightfully placed all their hopes. While Ridley does solid work as the young defender of the light side of the force, Rey’s dark side counterpart Kylo Ren proves to be more than formidable in the always steady hands of veteran character actor Adam Driver. Given more to work with in his second time as the heir apparent to Darth Vader, Driver does the best work of the entire film as the eternally conflicted, yet increasingly evil son of Leia and Han Solo. Johnson serves his film well by removing Kylo Ren’s Vader-inspired mask, allowing audiences to see the external and internal scars on Driver’s face. There’s so much rage in pain within Driver’s eyes; his complex performance leaps off the screen at every turn. While Ren projects strength and brash self-confidence, the conflict within betrays him. The nuance displayed by Driver, especially when paired against Ridley is stunning. It could very easily be the best cinematic villain since Heath Ledger’s sinister Joker in 2008’s “The Dark Knight.” Johnson’s film could rightly be accused of needing some extra time in the editing room. “The Last Jedi” races off in several directions all at the same time and ping-pongs back and forth between them at a frantic, haphazard pace. Many of Johnson’s unique visual choices, however, will soon go down as iconic moments in the history of the franchise, most notably a stunning battle sequence inside a First Order ship and the film’s climatic ending, which may leave viewers simultaneously in awe and in tears. It’s highly doubtful that “The Last Jedi” will make much of an impact come awards season, though this doesn’t mean at the latest Star Wars film isn’t a contender for one of the year’s ten best. In the hands of a decorated auteur like Johnson, “The Last Jedi” is proof positive that cinematic creativity in blockbuster filmmaking can enhance a film’s quality without jeopardizing the bottom line. Audiences will laugh, they’ll cry and they may even complain a little (or more realistically, a lot). But this isn’t to say that “Star Wars: Episode VIII” doesn’t deliver on the promise that “The Force Awakens” started."
"Nov 3, 2018",negative," Synopsis: Rey (Daisy Ridley) attempts to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to train her in the ways of the Jedi, while various Resistance fighters try to stay out of the clutches of the First Order. Review: Although not plumbing the anomalous depths of Rogue One, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi (the eighth episode in the grand saga) is a serviceable Star Wars yarn at best, and, I’ve a strong hunch that when the hype dies down in the months and years to come, it won’t be viewed in the same league as the original Star Wars trilogy and possibly even its predecessor, The Force Awakens. One potential criticism that The Last Jedi by and large bypasses is in being overly manufactured as a direct homage to the original trilogy’s middle child, The Empire Strikes Back (just as The Force Awakens seemed a very canny repackaging of A New Hope). There are some visual motifs and pictorially similar scenes to The Empire Strikes Back, but they’re different enough, in a chronologically jumbled order, and completely inferior anyway, so comparison feels by the by. Where The Last Jedi suffers more is from its plotting and structure. It features at least one act too many, has a surplus of action sequences, and arguably loses its sense of denouement with that elongated feel. A problem that carries over from The Force Awakens and becomes more evident here is the sense that the villains, and villainy in general, have been weakly determined. It’s even betrayed by the way this trilogy’s plot arbitrarily accelerates the First Order into a position of complete dominance from the off. It’s an admission of a lack of confidence in suggesting the rise of the villains’ malevolent stranglehold, plus that the producers wanted a dialectic exactly like the Empire versus the Rebels from the original trilogy. Snoke is a terrible villain in visual conception and dramatic execution, and perhaps these issues with Snoke are inadvertently acknowledged by a surprise scene midway through the film. Also, Kylo Ren, though a good character in his own right and well incarnated by Adam Driver, is too aligned sentimentally to the Resistance from the get-go to have the same purely evil gravitas of Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader – two characters or spirits that this trilogy sorely lacks. My final quibble would be that The Last Jedi‘s use of flashbacks and outright telepathic conversations feels like the sort of narrative cheating that the original trilogy would never have done in its similar moments of Jedi-mythic exposition, and the use of Yoda is particularly contrived and shallow here."
"Nov 1, 2018",positive," Star Wars is and always has been an underdog story. An action-packed intergalactic odyssey about small legions of rebels rising against seemingly insurmountable adversaries, Star Wars is rooted in an idea of hope against all odds, and you don’t need C3P0 on hand to butt in for that calculation. After the politically-charged prequels, The Force Awakens (and Rogue One) returned to this central conceit of a Sisyphusian struggle – toil in the face of utter improbability – depicting new characters taking their turn against a tyrannical empire, its limitless armada and impossibly supercharged firepower and with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, hope has never seemed so out of reach and victory so unachievable.  Starting back on the cliff that J.J. Abrams hung his last shot (in the most on-the-nose cliffhanger of the century), The Last Jedi picks up exactly where The Force Awakens left off. The new-fangled core trio of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Fin (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are as splintered as its legacy characters, of whom Han is now no more. As Fin recovers from battle wounds sustained in the prior chapter, Poe finds himself back in the cockpit proving his title as the “Rebellion’s best pilot” but taking unnecessary risks for the sake of macho heroics, think Luke running his T-16 down Beggar’s Canyon chipping at romp rats, much to General Leia Organa’s (Carrie Fischer) chagrin. Meanwhile Rey tries to convince a cantankerous and unwilling Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to give her some much needed training in the ways of the Force so that she can face down Sith patricide Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). While The Last Jedi isn’t a mirror image of The Empire Strikes Back in the same way that The Force Awakens was to A New Hope, there are intentional parallels between the sophomoric chapters in these respective trilogies. With Rey training with a reclusive Jedi master on a largely abandoned planet and our other heroes on the run from the Empire’s imposing star fleet, the similarities are obvious. Fortunately, writer/director Rian Johnson (Looper, Brick) exploits our expectations as often as he can, feeding an also decidedly on-the-nose narrative about destroying the past to make way for the new. Though dynamics look similar, beneath the surface Rian is often busy turning the norm on its head and here The Last Jedi succeeds. We see glorious plans end in failure, great hopes dashed and familial reveals that can be painful for all the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, The Last Jedi has almost as much Attack of the Clones as it does The Empire Strikes Back in that it’s overlong, under-edited and has at least one particularly long-winded CGI flurry of a sequence that harkens back to the darkest days of the franchise. There’s no whining about sand getting everywhere and the acting is really strong across the board (Hamill is particularly great back in Jedi robes, ham and all) but The Last Jedi could definitely have used a second editorial pass. More than one character is treated to a subplot that amounts to nothing more than a drawn-out red herring, with a copious amount of wasted time invested in easily edited-out dead ends. A scene in an opulent casino is easily the most painful yet in this new generation of Star Wars flicks, eliciting images of the green screen busy set pieces of the early-2000 franchise additions, enticing to the youngest members of the audience who need their stories overly padded with shiny spectacle. There are a handful of new characters, including scoundrel code breaker/Lando-stand-in DJ (Benicio del Toro), Laura Dern’s headstrong Vice Admiral Holdo and the low-ranking but high-spirited Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), who makes the biggest impression of the new arrivals, embodying the youthful glimmer of hope and rebellious spirit that once characterized a young Luke. Even at over two-and-a-half-hours, The Last Jedi doesn’t have the room to do all of its characters justice, with some internal transformations happening in a slapdash manner at plot convenience light speed. The further stretching of the character stable comes at the expense of others, usually on the villain side of the equation, notably the pock-marked, pink-faced Raisinette Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), Domhnall Gleeson‘s puckered, snarling and shouty General Hux and chromed-out bureacrat Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) all of whose potential is again left wholly unrealized. Driver’s Kylo Ren becomes an even more complicated character but even his true intentions remain a bit hazy and impossible to parse when all is said and done. Unlike previous installments, The Last Jedi splits from its predecessors in taking a decidedly more nuanced approach to good and evil. In the feature film continuity, the Jedi and the Sith stand as polar opposites, the later being a tempestuous pull towards absolute power, but The Last Jedi further erodes the wall behind the two sides and brings to light the inherently problematic nature of the Jedi order standing as some kind of moral superior. Luke goes so far as to call the notion of good and bad merely words. Questioning ethical supremacy in interesting and thoughtful ways that have only been hinted at in past installments but never to this level, Johnson proves more interested in the grey area than the stark light and darkness. The exact divide that the Jedi would like to prescribe to the breakdown between their kind and the Sith. Morally ambiguity defines critical moments in The Last Jedi, which makes for exciting and totally unexpected turns of tide, but also draws characters to make shocking decisions that don’t necessarily hold up upon closer scrutiny. There are a handful of gotcha moments peppered through The Last Jedi that I wouldn’t dare reveal here. And though they make for huge, audible gasps in the moment, some left me wondering if they weren’t cheap solutions that only partially make sense in terms of character motivation. A bond between two unlikely characters becomes the focal point of the moral ambiguity though the way that it’s ultimately resolved left me cold and unsatisfied, as if Johnson had written himself into and out of a corner by the skin of his teeth and then just left it to hang like a recently limbless Luke dangling with little hope of rescue below. Though Johnson tries to reach the emotional pinnacle of Kylo betraying and killing father Han, he just can’t manage the same goosebumps-inducing heights of the best moments in The Force Awakens, much less the most iconic reveals among the franchise’s greatest hits. Thinking back on The Last Jedi less than 24 hours later, there are really only a handful of scenes that stand out to me, some glaring and unnecessary, others wowing and extraordinary. The new cast is generally more developed – it’s nice to see Isaac get a much bigger character arc, Rey remains a standout and Fin finds something to believe in – and fan service is kept at a manageable level but all and all, The Last Jedi only has a handful of epic moments and they’re not enough to overlook its many shortcomings. Yes, John William‘s score is powerful as a hug from a Wookie  and the special effects are as stunning as hologram chess for the most part (an apt blend of practical and digital) but outside of the cold open, I don’t think anything really punched me in the gut the way that it was meant to. Like bantha fodder riddled with kyber crystals, The Last Jedi is a jumble of really good and kinda bad, with some rather harebrained plot holes and a saddle-bagged second act that keeps it well outside the upper tier of Star Wars offerings for me. Expectations are a bitch and even though I tried to keep mine in check, I couldn’t help but expect more from a Rian Johnson-directed Star Wars movie. J.J. Abrams, for his film’s many faults, teed up what could have been a doozy of a sequel and though The Last Jedi is by many accounts a fine addition, one with no shortage of laughs, a bundle of warm fuzzies (the divisive Porgs are as adorbz as the Ewoks without being anywhere near as narratively intrusive) and ooh’s and aah’s that moves the story forward in some genuinely compelling ways, I can’t help but express my genuine disappointment in the overall product. But Star Wars is an underdog story, Disney overlords or not, so I’ll always be there rooting for it to turn towards clearer seas.

"Oct 31, 2018",positive," 2015’s long-awaited return to the galactic delights of the world of the light and the dark evoked a sense of unparalleled euphoria akin to no other cinematic experience. A nostalgia machine it may be, but The Force Awakens was exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed – a loving nod and reminder of why we still look to the stars 40 years after the first entry in the series. The main criticism of Episode VII was its glaring similarities to A New Hope‘s plot – a sweeping statement but fair all the same. However, first time Star Wars director Rian Johnson is clearly one with the force, as his bold, fresh and ingenious ideas shine through this exceedingly better powerhouse blockbuster. With the nefarious First Order tightening their grip across the Galaxy, Rey (Daisy Ridley) desperately tries to learn the ways of the Jedi under the hesitant tutelage of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). While Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), under the forceful command Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), seeks vengeance against Rey and the Resistance, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Leia (Carrie Fisher) must work to prevent their obliteration. Immediately following from The Force Awakens, Johnson demands your allegiance to the franchise, in the sense that your hyperdrive should be primed to jump straight back in. Episode VII left us on an island with Rey and Luke, the latter forlornly staring at his former saber. The resolution of this moment is delightfully unexpected, ringing true to the quote from the trailer: “This is not going to go the way you think”. This could be applied to the entire feature, as from the get-go we’re thrown into a cataclysmic, explosive space battle with an iconic dreadnought, which emphasises the Wars in the title in haunting fashion. From here it’s an unpredictable, emotional jump to light speed. The set-pieces throughout are elegant, extravagant and exquisitely shot. The lightsaber battles are kinetic and glorious to the eye, Johnson showing a keener aptitude for creating an epic bout, utilising both extreme crystal-lit close ups and wide, full body shots. Despite the problems with George Lucas’ sacred prequels, it’s a throwback to the exhilarating saber battles in those entries, such as the legendary Darth Maul’s. It’s not bloody, but it’s beautifully violent. You feel the sizzle of every saber slash, sometimes decapitating the opponent which brings out a joyous “Ohhh” in the audience. Any sequence in Snoke’s lair is a captivating red dreamscape that wouldn’t be out of place in a Winding-Refn picture – the bravery in Johnson’s direction paying off in huge dividends through each scene, whether it provokes intrigue or a smacked gob. The anticipated, proper return of Hamill as the infamous Jedi is a remarkable feat. Johnson takes the character in a surprising direction, which in turns brings out a fantastic performance from Hamill. The Force Awakens‘ use of Han Solo fuelled romantic memories, but The Last Jedi‘s use of Skywalker is more similar to Blade Runner 2049‘s use of Deckard Shaw – he’s central to the narrative, with a few little nods here and there, but mostly a beloved character whose tortured past is never in doubt. Driver’s villainous Kylo is developed far further, surely becoming one of the finest foes in the series. His performance perfectly captures his inner conflict, the pull of the light and the uncontrollable rage of the dark, leading to some unforgettable displays of emotion from the terrific actor. When it comes to Snoke, the less said the better – not because he’s bad, but his presence is menacingly significant, radiating terrifying power immediately. Johnson tackles a lot of narrative throughout the 152 minute runtime (the longest Star Wars movie ever – yeeha). Rey and Luke’s relationship is a gripping focal point, as is a new dynamic between her and Kylo. The plight of the rebels glows with hope, with Isaac playing a far deeper role this time round and turning into a firm leader. It’s also a fitting tribute to the late Carrie Fisher, whose inclusion here is mostly well executed. Boyega is a loveable hero, and her new compadre Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) is a nice addition. However, as much as it isn’t overbearing, their entire sub-plot is when the adventure loses steam. This moves the film away from where all the interest is – Luke. At this point, it becomes a little disjointed and unnecessary, never reaching a point of excitement required for a chunk of plot of this degree. After this half hour passes, and you desperately try to forget a momentously nonsensical Leia scene, The Last Jedi flies into perhaps the finest final hour in Star Wars history. As much as it may be wonderfully different from the franchise norms, it still feels unequivocally and truly Star Wars. Johnson gets it – whether it is through the both comedic and thrilling return of the charming BB-8, the excruciating cuteness of the Porgs, or the visually poetic red dust from the salt landscape – it’s all an absolute treat, wrapped up in a very tight package which gives nothing away for Episode IX."
"Oct 31, 2018",positive," There’s one line in the film, “Let the past die,” that defines The Last Jedi’s internal struggle. One could look at that as a fairly ironic utterance considering The Force Awakens was essentially a remake of A New Hope and that Disney’s Star Wars seems quite poised to never die, but there is a sense of truth in this character’s statement. As the franchise tries to figure out its identity in a post-George Lucas world, Star Wars may look to its roots for narrative inspiration, but it isn’t quite sure what course to plot for its characters. The Last Jedi does not have much of a plot. Without diving into too much detail, the main conflict between The Resistance and The First Order bears more resemblance to O.J. Simpson’s slow-speed car chase than the asteroid field that Han & friends had to navigate through in Empire Strikes Back. Rey’s visit to Luke’s island Dagobah fairs much better, but there’s still lingering questions as to what exactly happened to the world post-Yub Nub that is never really answered. I initially faced pushback for being critical of The Force Awakens’ lack of plot explanation from people who suggested that the film already bore the unenviable task of “resetting” the franchise after the prequels, and couldn’t be bogged down with too much exposition. Supreme Leader Snoke can be added to the list of things that are literally never explained. The audience is never once told who this man is or how he came into power, and yet the film goes on as if viewers should be expected to fear a villain who serves as little more than a cardboard cutout version of Emperor Palpatine. Darth Vader is one of the most menacing villains in cinematic history. While Emperor Palpatine’s Machiavellian mechanics were largely saved for the prequels, Return of the Jedi Palpatine had the luxury of existing in a Star Wars world where the Empire was the only “big bad” in town. The Last Jedi is the eighth movie in the main series and yet it doesn’t really have a single compelling villain. Kylo Ren is neither scary nor convincingly evil, Captain Phasma is the most useless character in the new trilogy, and Snoke is barely anything at all. Part of the problem is that The Last Jedi has a lot of characters, but it never really seems all that concerned about doing anything with any of them. Original trilogy characters are used as little more than window dressings, which I’d be more okay with if this new trilogy had big plans for its new leads. Director Rian Johnson has commented publicly on how this is Rey’s hero story, not Luke’s, but this trilogy has never really been able to answer the question of what this story is supposed to be. The basic questions that some people don’t think need to be answered in The Force Awakens carry a lot more weight if this next film is the conclusion of this newer story. It seems very possible that this new incarnation of Star Wars could end before the audience was ever given a reason to care. We live in a world where big franchises are always playing for the next movie. The Last Jedi forgets to live in the present. Audience members may identify more with the suave Han Solo or the powerful Leia Organa more than the whiny kid from Tatooine, but the original Star Wars trilogy belongs to Luke Skywalker. This new trilogy does not make Rey the focal point in quite the same way, but its reluctance to commit to its new heroes forces one to question how old icons like Luke and Leia were deployed to serve the film’s purpose. Carrie Fisher delivers an emotionally satisfying send-off in her final role, but Luke’s place in all of this is still treated in a fashion that “it’s not his story” never really satisfies. Some people waited thirty years to see this character on a screen again. Rian Johnson tosses this notion aside without fully considering how fans might react in the absence of an alternative nucleus. As someone who grew up a Star Wars fanatic, who bought a Sega 32X just to play Star Wars Arcade and wrote poetry about Chewbacca not getting a medal after the Battle of Yavin, I’m increasingly okay with the fact that this Disney version of Star Wars isn’t ever going to be the thing fans spent decades speculating about. Rogue One served as the benchmark for how to enjoy a movie in a franchise I used to obsess about. I won’t be buying the expanded universe novels, or eulogizing them should Disney ever decide to retcon them again. These are movies. Sometimes, that’s enough. Despite this fairly harsh assessment, I did enjoy The Last Jedi. I had fun sitting in a movie theatre for two and a half hours while some explosions happened and some people did some things, a low bar that Star Wars can’t help but hit. When Solo: A Star Wars Movie comes out, I’ll go and see it. I’ll write my review, if only to reflect on the time in my life when this franchise meant something to me. I’m not the person who needed every single incarnation of Han Solo action figure and Star Wars isn’t the franchise that spurs debate over the ethics of blowing up the second Death Star. The person in me who still puts Boba Fett in my mother’s terrarium can still enjoy the franchise that still has a place for R2-D2. I like that there are new Star Wars movies being told, even if I’ll spend my review point out the very legitimate issues. As C-3PO might say, wonderful! Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things. Thank you to everyone who’s listened to the show over the past half-decade! We don’t do as many new episodes as we used to, but it’s always fun to catch up. "
"Oct 31, 2018",positive," Star Wars is back and it’s probably not going away any time soon. As much as both The Force Awakens and Rogue One have received praise for recapturing the magic of the original trilogy in ways the prequels never managed, they have also been criticized for relying too much on nostalgia instead of carving out their own identity. As a result of this, The Last Jedi has an incredibly fine line to tread on; it has to move the franchise forward whilst maintaining that classic Star Wars feel. The final result is probably not the movie you wanted, but one that makes you realise what you wanted probably wasn’t the best idea. Picking up right where The Force Awakens left off, The Last Jedi wastes no time in getting the ball rolling on an extended but exhilarating and tightly paced adventure. Despite being the longest film in the franchise to date and filled with plenty of emotional character moments, the film never feels like it comes to a complete halt. Much like The Empire Strikes Back, the film follows a multi-strand narrative with our heroes off on separate adventures, but all the storylines parallel and converge with each other much more smoothly; they compliment each other in a way that makes the narrative feel more cohesive. The second act is perhaps stretched a little too far, especially in regards to Finn and Rose’s storyline, but the movie knows when to cut away and progress another story when things start to drag. But what really makes The Last Jedi stand out is how it plays with the core tenants of the Star Wars franchise, making strong use of canon and nostalgia but twisting it to its own means rather than just making cute references. It lovingly questions what fans know and have come to expect, making it the first film in the franchise since Return of the Jedi where I genuinely didn’t know where it was going. You could almost say it’s intentionally unsatisfying in how it plays with your expectations, but what it delivers in return is superior upon reflection and is ultimately what you really came for: Star Wars for a new generation. Though some get more focus than others, every major character in The Last Jedi gets a moment to shine and the entire cast puts in everything they have throughout. Daisy Ridley gets ample room to explore the character of Rey, giving her an internal conflict far more intricate than any previous Star Wars protagonist and dissuading those Mary Sue arguments that erupted from The Force Awakens. John Boyega continues to excel as Finn, and pairing him with newcomer Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico makes for a sweet new double act. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron is given a more important role here and the character now feels fully fleshed out, with a character arc unique to the franchise so far and promises that Poe will continue to be a key player throughout. Adam Driver really gets to sink his teeth into Kylo Ren, proving himself to be easily the most complex villain in the franchise thus far; not necessarily the most imposing or badass, but that vulnerability is what makes him so fascinating. The Last Jedi looks and feels like a classic Star Wars movie, but Rian Johnson more than injects his own unique flavour into it. The film offers far more new elements from a design perspective than its predecessor with unique planets, new ship and creature designs, and other aesthetics that feel fresh but still very much within the Star Wars brand. The film’s cinematography moves and breathes on a different wavelength to previous films, bathing the visuals with richer colours and playing with the camera work in a more modern but controlled way. The sound design is absolutely fantastic, using and revitalising classics sounds from across the saga whilst also creating new ones that slot perfectly into the canon. John Williams’ score this time around reuses a lot more themes from the previous films, but they all have a new edge to them and all the new tunes are more memorable for the most part than his compositions for The Force Awakens. Star Wars: The Last Jedi does what no film in the franchise has done in 34 years: it genuinely surprised me. The film breaks many franchise traditions on all levels, but it does so with a lot of respect and with the ambition to build something new and exciting from what remains. It really is the Empire Strikes Back of this new trilogy, but not in the same way The Force Awakens was essentially A New Hope. It is structurally and tonally similar to that movie, but the meat of it is wholly new material to the franchise. It’s certainly the best film in the saga since Empire, and perhaps with time it may even surpass it. Rian Johnson sets a new precedent for what you can do with a mainline Star Wars film, one I fear JJ Abrams won’t live up to in the next instalment, but I’m excited for it all the same simply because we are now moving into uncharted territory. The franchise no longer feels burdened by the traditions of the past and, in a sense, now feels truly reborn."
"Oct 31, 2018",positive,"If Awakens was about The Resistance and The First Order repeating the cycle of The Rebellion and The Empire, this one is all about how they have to become their own things and what the proper way to get there is going to be - and that's exciting."
"Oct 31, 2018",positive," With Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the most signficant franchise in popular culture awoke from a deep slumber. However, it did so with a sense of familiarity that, while perhaps necessary, hurts the film in hindsight.  But Star Wars: The Last Jedi takes another necessary step, that of subversion of the very things that The Force Awakens hinged on. And in doing so, The Last Jedi breathes urgent purpose into the new trilogy, purpose it had yet to prove. What’s immediately evident about The Last Jedi — through a nailbiter of an opening sequence, which includes an absolutely hysterical bit that tops Poe’s opening of “who talks first?” in The Force Awakens — is that this film is interested in people. While some large scale action films focus on the spectacle, writer-director Rian Johnson and cinematographer Steve Yedlin’s camera situates us with the fighting, the sacrificing and the dying that fuel those battles.  When it comes to his focus on our main characters, Johnson succeeds in giving them all heavy, deeply personal character arcs. Finn needs to learn how best to fight for the Resistance. Poe needs to learn leadership that thinks ahead of the enemy, that thinks of everyone that a potential failure in leadership might affect. And John Boyega and Oscar Isaac inject the same kind of charismatic vigor into their characters that made them so lovable in the first place. But Johnson’s portrayal of Luke Skywalker, this mammoth figure in pop culture, is the film’s most dynamic feature. And that’s because Johnson takes him out of the familiar, out of what we know him to be. Essentially, Johnson dissects “the legend” of Luke Skywalker, questioning that title by focusing in on Kylo Ren’s turn to the dark side years prior while at Luke’s Jedi school. It gives Mark Hamill new space to explore, as a rehash of pure heroism would’ve failed to be profound, and Hamill offers up a hilarious, pained, tired and tender performance. Though the trilogy jumps decades, we still get to feel the weight of those decades because Hamill bares it tangibly and beautifully. Johnson intertwines Luke’s arc with those of Rey and Kylo in a way that challenges Rey’s almost original-trilogy-Luke sense of purpose, and in a way that cuts straight to the heart of Kylo’s light-dark conflict. It’s a brilliant framework, as the film adds new layers to Kylo, not only in the context of his turn but in the context of his purpose moving forward. Adam Driver ingrains those emotions deep into his performance, rendering him as one of the more complex villains in large scale cinema.  The framework also places Rey at the forefront, mainly through her search for identity now that she’s been thrust into the world of the Force. The film’s answer is decidedly feminist, fitting into Johnson’s overall idea of who heroes are, and Daisy Ridley capitalizes on the material, delivering a performance that is, appropriately, searching, yet also gripping in its painful anger and raw vulnerability. The film is truly an ensemble piece, even more so than most typical ensembles as there’s a sense of individualized growth within nearly every character. And the performances of the rest of the cast are wholly committed, including vibrant work by newcomer Kelly Marie Tran, a towering presence from Laura Dern and a brave turn by the late Carrie Fisher.  This is, however, where the film slightly falters, as it becomes, at times, too stuffed with so much character work happening at the same time and in different places, which impacts the film’s pacing. Certain moments, such as when the plot needs to catch up, happen too quickly or conveniently and other moments, such as those of thematic significance, feel a bit too drawn out. The film also has four acts, which is not unusual, but it requires an extremely careful sense of flow and progression, perhaps exemplified by The Dark Knight. And while the flow from the third act into the fourth isn’t terrible, it’s unbalanced. But the film, despite its flaws, is genuinely stunning. Johnson choreographs action — both in space and on the ground — with such rhythmic intensity and fluidity, but also with an underlying grit informed by the film’s humanism. And the settings within which that action takes place are so singular and transfixing, often due to Rick Heinrich’s spellbinding production design and Steve Yedlin’s soaring and awe-striking cinematography, especially in his long shots.  The story, while not perfectly executed, also holds beauty. As said before, this film is about people. And Johnson engages with the political, shedding light on the First Order’s impact on the poor and forgotten, on those that come from nothing but a little bit of hope. Fascinatingly enough, however, Johnson, while portraying the Resistance lovingly, doesn’t shy away from critiquing the larger notion of the “machine” of the Resistance.  But it’s those like Rose Tico (Marie Tran), someone who works alone in the dirty underbelly of a Resistance ship and is not really a part of any “machine,” who can embody a heroism in the face of tyranny that leaders of the Resistance have yet to fully understand. It’s heroes like Rey who can represent the greatest that hope can stand for. In that sense, The Last Jedi is a new kind of Star Wars story. Along the way, the film challenges a lot of what we’re familiar with, especially in regard to the mythology of the universe. At points, the film almost feels satirical in how it critiques what we expect a Star Wars film to be.  Therein lies the film’s value. More of the same, especially in a wasteland of traditional, unengaging hero stories, would’ve been a shame. It was necessary for The Force Awakens, for that film to care about what we thought of it.

"Oct 31, 2018",positive,"More than merely a continuation, The Last Jedi is in many ways an ending to the Star Wars we've known. And like many endings, it's anarchic and frustrating and poignant."
"Oct 30, 2018",positive," After a couple of years of growing anticipation and rampant speculation, Rian Johnson’s highly hyped installment of the brand new Star Wars trilogy comes to the screen in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The sequel is a whole lot of movie, with a number of shocking moments interspersed between a lively and sometimes moving space adventure that builds upon George Lucas’ modern mythology while forging its own path for that galaxy far, far away. Whereas The Force Awakens leaned heavily on nostalgia with a story structure that mirrored the original Star Wars, The Last Jedi sets its own distinct tone and structure that makes it entirely its own thing. Just to be clear, I’m not going to give away any of the major revelations that occur within The Last Jedi. If it’s included in this review, you can rest assured, dear reader, that it is not anything that will affect your enjoyment of Rian Johnson’s thrilling spectacle. In The Last Jedi, The Resistance is struggling to survive as the nefarious First Order led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is preparing a deadly offensive that could lay waste the band of rebels. Snoke orders General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to carry out the offensive while lambasting his Sith apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), basically negging the young villain in order to better manipulate him. The Resistance is given a chance when ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) leads a daring counter assault, but the ensuing loss of Resistance ships and pilots leaves the struggling rebels in a perilous situation. With the First Order tracking the ragtag Resistance fleet across the universe, there are few options for our heroes in order to survive. The losses from the counterattack leave General Leia (Carrie Fisher) no other option but to demote her ace pilot, and later he will butt heads with Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern). In order to stop the First Order’s tracking of the Resistance fleet, Poe dispatches Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a young and eager mechanic, to travel to a distant planet and secure a codebreaker who can help the Resistance free themselves from the shadow of the First Order. Elsewhere, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has discovered the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), though the once-legendary Jedi is disinterested in the ways of The Force. Rey is attempting to pressure Luke to come out of hiding and aid the Resistance in their fight against oppression, but the Master Jedi has no interests, as he’s haunted by the horrible events that led to the creation of Kylo Ren. As Rey learns more of The Force, her raw power frightens Luke who sees the parallels between her and his nephew, and those fears grow as Rey and Kylo interact with one another. Of course, all these characters in different corners of the universe will find themselves colliding. Rian Johnson wastes no time in establishing the tone that he’s going to use for The Last Jedi. The film opens with a sequence that is humorous in parts and absolutely thrilling visually, providing us with a stunning star fight between the forces of good and evil. What stands out about The Last Jedi is the way in which the film feels truly epic yet its story retains a certain intimacy. The Last Jedi takes us to new worlds within the Star Wars universe that are fresh and lively, rarely if ever mirroring places we’ve been before over the course of the previous eight films. But the story is really contained; keeping the Resistance fighters on the run while Rey and Luke examine the nature of The Force. As much as we see old faces from Star Wars past, the film never relies on nostalgia to make these moments work. It creates new scenarios and conflicts that they must confront. And the new characters continue to leave a lasting impression. Rose is a welcome addition to the sprawling cast, and Kelly Marie Tran gets some of the film’s most moving moments. Poe, Rey, and Finn are all added layers of complexity to their characters as they progress forward. Once again, Kylo Ren continues to be the best Star Wars villain in the series history, a character of uncontrolled rage amidst and ongoing internal conflict. The characters go through significant changes over the course of the film. They’re challenged and pushed into unexpected directions. And then there are the delightful Porgs and BB-8 expands his skillset as a fantastic droid full of personality. It’s important, though, to avoid any and all spoilers for The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson takes the story in a number of unexpected directions, often with jaw-dropping results. So much of what occurs in the film carries great weight for the present and future of the series. Whatever the future holds for Star Wars, The Last Jedi will leave a lasting mark on this legendary series with numerous moments that are shocking and powerful with just enough humor to cut the tension. Rarely, if ever, does anything in The Last Jedi feel predictable. If J.J. Abrams set the table, Rian Johnson has delivered the feast. Now it’s up to J.J. to return to this series and deliver the dessert. After such a satisfying meal as The Last Jedi, J.J. Abrams has got a lot of work to do satisfy the appetite of Star Wars fans. An absolutely spectacular entry in the Star Wars saga, Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers a thrilling experience full of eye-popping action, moments of levity, and shocking moments that will have people talking for years to come. This here writing represents a symbol of Sean Mulvihill's individuality, and his belief in personal freedom. He's also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls."

"Oct 29, 2018",positive," The ""Star Wars"" franchise kicks into high gear with ""The Last Jedi,"" the second installment of the reboot trilogy, with director Rian Johnson taking the reigns from J.J. Abrams and delivering one of the best films in the series. Johnson, best known for the Bruce Willis/Joseph Gordon-Levitt time-shifting thriller ""Looper,"" grabs the audience from the very first scene and doesn't let up, guiding viewers on a thrill ride that will have audiences gasping, laughing and perhaps even shedding a tear. ""Last Jedi"" picks up where ""The Force Awakens"" left off, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeking help from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a remote planet. Rey has been sent to find Luke by General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) to help assist the Resistance's fight against the First Order, led by Supreme leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his protege and Leia's son, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The rest of the story is best left unmentioned, with ""Jedi"" taking fans on twists and turns that are both nostalgic and full of wonder and discovery. Ridley continues to shine as the center of this trilogy, a calm anchor in a universe full of chaos. John Boyega is also back as storm trooper-turned-ally Finn, making the most of his increased screen time. The same can be said for Oscar Isaac's swashbuckling Resistance leader Poe Dameron, with Isaac bringing a little of Harrison Ford's Han Solo into his performance. ""Star Wars"" veteran Hamill's increased role is welcome as well, while Fisher's scenes take on an added poignancy, since filming of ""Jedi"" was completed just before her death in December 2016. ""The Last Jedi"" will draw plenty of comparisons to ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" and not just because both happen to be the second act of their respective trilogies. Like ""Empire,"" ""Jedi"" explores some of the darker sides of the universe's mythology, with Johnson (who also wrote the film) using the same creative arc that so perfectly connected ""Empire"" to the original ""Star Wars"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" You can tell Johnson has the same deep affection for the ""Star Wars"" universe as Abrams did in ""The Force Awakens."" Johnson fills his film with nods to the original trilogy, but also offers surprising humor and a beautiful scope – from the battles to the details on the various planets (including a sequence that pays homage to ""Empire's"" ice planet Hoth.) Johnson's visual flair, as well as his ability to create tense, taut action sequences, really gives ""The Last Jedi"" its kick. The cinematography is perhaps the best of the series, with Steve Yedlin's color schemes and details in every planet an incredible sight to behold. At 152 minutes, ""The Last Jedi"" might seem overstuffed on paper, but it's because the film has so much to say and so much ground to cover. Johnson does it almost effortlessly, setting up the trilogy's final chapter in fantastic fashion. It's easy to see why Johnson has already been inked to do a new trilogy in the ""Star Wars"" universe after seeing ""The Last Jedi."" It's a world full of imagination that Johnson knows his way around. If ""Force Awakens"" was the franchise's revival, then ""Last Jedi"" finds the series back in full swing, with Johnson delivering the best ""Star Wars"" entry since ""Empire."" – To get Micheal Compton’s review of “The Shape of Water” visit his blog at bgdailynews.com/blogs/reel_to_reel or follow him on Twitter @mcompton428.

"Oct 29, 2018",positive," Big, bold and beautiful. It’s hard to describe Rian Johnson’s achievements here any other way. This is the kind of Star Wars film that lives up to the grandeur of the title: high stakes galore, with whopping intergalactic conflicts, no clean moral divides, and drama within an inch of all lives depicted. It’s a madder, trickier vision than what J. J. Abrams devised for The Force Awakens, eschewing the nostalgic retreads that made that movie a little too familiar for its own good. The Last Jedi decides to chart its own path, oftentimes into territory this franchise has barely dipped its toe in. Most significantly, the legend at its centre is no longer a tidy beacon of exalted heroism in his old age, but a disillusioned hermit who knows he’s responsible for a lot of the ill plaguing the film’s current climate. I guess longtime fans would have reason to quibble with this “sacrilegious” treatment, but these risks are warranted if this trilogy is to hold up down the road. Among the other things to like here: the fact that the Resistance is imperiled and on the brink of defeat for a good 95% of the film, making it clear that they’re not impervious; the interplay between Rey and Kylo Ren, which gives the latter more development than simply being a Darth Vader wannabe; Laura Dern headlining the film’s defining moment; those fabulous space nuns; powerful women cutting Poe Dameron down to size (though I still love Oscar Isaac’s portrayal); Snoke’s Cries and Whispers red chamber; the red salt planet, whose bloodlike imagery feels like the perfect analog to this film’s métier; and really those final 30 minutes, which are so incredibly played by all involved. Like most, I’m not a big fan of Finn and Rose’s side adventure, which has the air of a spinoff story being tacked onto the main narrative (probably to give Finn a purpose, since Rey is doing her own thing with Luke). Apart from showcasing the power of hope on a younger generation, it’s not as well integrated into the seams of the larger story as it could’ve been. Does it derail the film? No, it doesn’t, because the characters involved are still interesting, and it advances Finn’s personal development in a satisfactory way. And, truthfully, I’d rather have Finn do something than be incapacitated for an entire film. Another great thing about The Last Jedi: it doesn’t make guessing at Episode IX’s plot any easier. The only certainty is that Carrie Fisher won’t have new scenes in it, and that’s still a tough pill to swallow after her wonderful performance in this one. A Star Wars film without its original three heroes is going to be a strange sight. I’ve no doubt J. J. Abrams will pull it off, though."
"Oct 15, 2018",positive," In 2015 the dormant Star Wars franchise was reawakened by J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Force Awakens (read the Movies In Focus review), a gloriously faithful movie to George Lucas’ beloved original trilogy. The film featured many of the same beats as A New Hope, but it introduced a wealth of new characters to sit alongside fan favourites like Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The film ended with Daisy Ridley’s Rey standing on a cliff top on planet of Ach-To (bless you), arm outstretched, offering Luke Skywalker his long lost Lightsaber. The sequel was open to all possibilities – which brings us to Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson’s film manages to be both brilliant and terrible at the same time, a mix of classic mythos and insipid story telling. The opening action sequence featuring Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron is stunning, a wonderfully presented piece of intergalactic battle, illustrating that Isaac’s Dameron is the heir to Han Solo’s laid back heroics. We cut back to the finale of The Force Awakens, where Luke Skywalker takes his lightsaber from Rey and quickly tosses it over his shoulder. Like Luke says: ’This isn’t going to go the way you think’. Skywalker is to The Last Jedi what Yoda was to The Empire Strike Back – a quirky loner who doesn’t want to train a young apprentice eager to use the Force. Hamill gets to deliver a lot of great work here, hitting comedic and dramatic notes with ease. I would happily sit and watch a movie about Skywalker’s lonesome existence (Space Survivor, anyone?) Away from Ach-To, the Resistance fleet is on its knees, running out of fuel and pursued by The First Order and the dastardly trio of Snoke (Andy Serkis), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). It would seem that the plan for Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo is to keep on running – something Poe Dameron doesn’t do. He sends John Boyega’s Finn on a mission to sneak onto Snoke’s ship and decommission a tracking device so they can make the jump to light-speed and lose their pursuers. It’s Finn’s mission which takes the film off on a diversion where it didn’t really need to go. Finn is joined by Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, a plucky mechanic wanting to fight the good fight against the First Order. Together the duo visit a Monte Carlo type world (freeing space Llamas in the process) before hooking-up with Benicio Del Toro’s mysterious criminal. There’s a lot of comedic hijinks involved in all of this which George Lucas would have excised from the first draft of anything he ever wrote. Rey and Kylo are also having some force-fulled telepathic conversations – you know the type: ‘I know there’s good in you’, ‘You will turn to the dark-side’, ‘Join me’ etc. Most of this works and there’s some nice stuff aboard Snoke’s ship (shade of Return of The Jedi) which really works, but sadly an editing fumble means that the pay-off doesn’t ring-true. In a film with a lot of extraneous scenes it feels like a disappointment when we don’t get to see how Rey escapes, covering up a silly line like ‘She stole Snoke’s shuttle’’. Speaking of Snoke, he’s offered very little back story and the character isn’t really developed further that he was back in Episode VII. Hamill’s Luke Skywalker is the highlight of The Last Jedi, anchoring the film in the same way that Harrison Ford steadied The Force Awakens. The late Carrie Fisher is given more to do this time around – but there’s a moment in the film which could have been used as her swan-song. This wouldn’t have had much of an impact on the main thrust of the story and it would been a powerful way to have her exit the franchise. John Boyega, one of the highlights of the last movie is given a pointless plot thread that really has nothing to do other than keep ILM busy and Isaac’s cocky flyboy is grounded for most of the movie, booking the movie with his piloting skills. As a character, it feels that Ridley’s Rey is spinning her wheels a bit. She gets some good moments with Adam Drive Kylo Ren (a great villain) but ultimately it feels like she spends every other scene being drawn to the dark side/light side of the force. There’s more humour in The Last Jedi than previous Star Wars movies; some of it hits, some of it doesn’t. The much publicised Porgs work for a moment or two, but they outstay their welcome. The film drew to a halt too many times to show-odd cute creatures. I didn’t care for the crystal wolves during the climatic battle and the aforementioned space Llamas feel like they belong in a Disney movie (wait, this is a Disney movie!) The Last Jedi has some great moments (some of the best in the series) but it also has some of the worst. It’s better than Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (read the Movies In Focus review), but it doesn’t match-up to the original trilogy – or the much derided prequels. In fact, Rian Johnson commits many of the same crimes that George Lucas did in those movies (plot diversions, silly humour, CGI creatures) but Lucas handled it much better. At 2 1/2 hours, Star Wars: The Last Jedi could have been tightened-up in the editing room, cutting out that bloated middle section and removing things like Maz Kanata’s cameo and the cute slave kids which feel like they dropped in from a totally different movie. When it works, it really works but when it doesn’t, it feels like bad fan-fiction with a million dollar budget. It will be interesting to see what J.J. Abrams brings to the table when he returns for Episode IX."
"Oct 11, 2018",positive," Synopsis: Having taken her first steps into the Jedi world, Rey joins Luke Skywalker on an adventure with Leia, Finn and Poe that unlocks mysteries of the Force and secrets of the past. How about this take: The Force Awakens is one elaborate “Schrödinger’s cat” experiment. As “a bridge and a kind of reminder,” per the film’s director J.J. Abrams, the first rodeo in the galaxy far, far away after a decade-long slumber sees two contrasting forces working in tandem – future and past, new blood and old guard, delicious uncertainties and foolproof guarantees. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is both facing Luke (Mark Hamill) and her own reflection at the end; it is both the studio’s new hope and A New Hope that rouse the Force. By that logic, a viewer can be pleased and displeased with Episode VII. But The Last Jedi isn’t another lesson in science-fact. In every aspect conceivable, the film no longer operates between two realms, and the result is the most gratifying big-screen Star Wars experience thus far. While we’re at it, shut down the “another The Empire Strikes Back” line of thought, too. Abrams, in the same interview, suggested the new trilogy’s remainders will be full-fledged pioneers, the ones to see what the saga’s to-be-charted space of setting and storytelling has to offer. Now that is a seductive plug line, one that is gladly not exclusively so as the decision to let Midas touch-ready director Rian Johnson be in total control of the writing process (he receives sole credit) can attest. Personally, the magic begins right after the opening crawl, with a member of cinema’s most-obscure demographic – Asian (Vietnamese, to be specific) – spectacularly prevents the First Order, under the command of familiars General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and holographic-philic Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), from expunging the Rebels in the middle of a mass evacuation. Surrounding this sliver of refreshment are others, too, including measured givings of a traditional-but-effective brand of wit – fired first with gusto by waggish pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) – a palpable sense of desperation and – as the formers’ byproduct – an unwavering kind of giddiness that is borderline stratospheric. One-hundred-and-fifty-two minutes, The Last Jedi’s runtime is, but all are flashes once you completely let Johnson be your guide. Other than the expected lift to great heights to flaunt the bread-and-butter interstellar duels, Johnson takes us down – literally, at one point – to Star Wars’ most universal and oft-referenced core: the spirit. While far from being an anomaly narrative-wise, this aspect has always left a vague, and ultimately blank, impression. That ends here in wholesome fashion when Rey’s search for the means to take down rage-drunk Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) in Luke uncover startling revelations (as if a disillusioned Jedi Master isn’t shocking enough!), when the resolute Finn (John Boyega) grows increasingly so as he teams up with the spunky Rebel mechanic, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), and when the directorships of both lavender-laced wonder of a newcomer, Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), and ever-impassioned General Leia (Carrie Fisher) reach the pivotal hour. In perfecting the element Lucas conceived and Rogue One fleetingly depicted, Johnson may have end the franchise’s search for a bona-fide creative force. Emphasis on “may” – let’s not take Star Wars down Harry Potter‘s one-director-allowed route. Eye-opening, too, is the film’s sets and look, having been respectively built and photographed by newcomers to the Star Wars universe. Under Tim Burton’s go-to production designer, Rick Heinrichs, there is more than just splendor-upon-splendor in the locale; the variety prevents whatever dominant mood susceptible to diminishing returns. The island of Ahch-To, house of the first Jedi temple and perfect-for-self-exile conditions, needn’t the eyes of Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong’o) to be seen as solemnly mystical, but just as prevalent here are endearing joys – one in the form of indolent, upright-sitting maybe-sea cows and whimsical flying porgs that interestingly screech in every medium shot. The coastal city of Canto Bight, despite its glamorous Monte Carlo-lights and credit-draining games, is where abuse runs rampant, a fact Rose revealed to Finn while they’re locating a tech-savvy HVT (Benicio del Toro, with a stutter). And regardless if it’s time for a stroll or a run, Johnson’s regular d.o.p. Steve Yedlin keeps the flair high throughout, an attribute that goes into breathtaking overdrive in Act 3’s three-way battle for three separate causes – survival, hope and purpose. Cathartic is the prime directive here, and so committed to that cause are the cast and crew that you’ll be hard-pressed to not let out a clap, a “whoa,” a cheer, or a “yes” as everything unfolds. Maybe a “I want one,” too, when the crystal foxes of Crait, a planet whose thematically apt crimson-colored soil lies under a layer of blinding-white salt, scurry to not become war casualties. If there is a flaw, it would be Bob Ducsay’s editing that, especially in the beginning, stops key moments just milliseconds short from their emotional zenith. But if this is a flaw, it amounts to stardust. Much like what The Cotton State did last night to the fabric of decency, The Last Jedi is a, if not the, much-needed adrenaline shot to the state of tentpoles. In that spirit, forthcoming Star Wars and what they have to share (Abrams with XI and Johnson’s returning for a new trilogy) deserve to be greeted with open arms, Murphy’s Law be damned, for finally the tale can go where it hasn’t gone before."
"Oct 10, 2018",positive," If you ever saw a kids show during the Aughts you’ll be familiar with the educational tactic of repeating a message over and over again throughout an episode before repeating that episode each day of the entire week. This was a huge component of “Blue’s Clues” because it was proven to work. There’s no better way to ingrain a theme than by hammering it in until the viewer can no longer ignore it if he/she tried. But while this is an appropriate technique for children with short attention spans not yet versed in the art of nuance, the practice can be excruciating for any older siblings or parents made to sit and endure it too. That’s unfortunately the feeling I had while watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi. While this statement sounds damning, however, I enjoyed Rian Johnson‘s latest entry to George Lucas‘ Skywalker Saga nonetheless. My issue is that it still finds the need to beat us over the head with the same emotional arcs we’ve experienced throughout two other trilogies despite being the eighth installment: the internal battle between light and dark. When will we be able to watch characters exist in this world as already drawn? Why can’t we escape the repetitive excess and build something that acknowledges what it possesses without constantly reminding us as though anyone is using this specific Star Wars movie as his/her introduction to the franchise? I love that Johnson accepts the challenge of a ton of moving parts, but every character’s trajectory is more or less identical. So even though the dude two seats over from me sounded like he was peeing his pants in excitement every time something “awesome” occurred, what was the purpose of those awesome things? I wish it was merely to be awesome—and some moments are (I’m looking at you bad ass, tenuous allegiance lightsaber fight). But they aren’t. They are instead a means to teach a lesson, as they should. But while it used to be just Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Han (Harrison Ford) doing the learning or just Anakin, Padmé, and Ben Kenobi or just Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) in The Force Awakens, everyone is attending class this time around. And the mirroring involved can be quite tedious. Because here’s the thing: The Last Jedi is a bridge between beginning and end in a way that Empire Strikes Back wasn’t. It is quite literally the manifestation of moving pieces on the board to take them one step further than where they were. And that’s okay. I don’t have a problem with that. We need to know what happens to the Rebellion now that the Republic has been destroyed. We need to know what Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) will do to crush them with his apprentice Ren and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). We need to know if Rey’s power will be enough to bring Luke out of exile and help the cause. But while the content of these story threads is dark, the execution feels like “Blue’s Clues”. Rey is on a mission to discover who she is in the grand scheme of all things “Force.” Kylo Ren is too and they are psychically connected to do exactly that. Finn is on a quest to find the courage every hero needs to keep going with hope rather than despair. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is too, only conversely because he must find the caution to stop fueling his heroism with hubris rather than guts. Luke is forced into making a decision that will necessitate owning his failures and confronting his fears to teach Rey what she needs to know through a grouchy grimace just as Leia does the same to Poe with a knowing smile. It was all so obvious and convenient in its efficacious bluntness. Thankfully Johnson is a master at supporting roles because he complements these six leads with a humorous bunch of misfits, rogues, and martyrs. He’s so good at them that I can only wonder what The Last Jedi might have been with Finn and Poe taking a backseat (like how the latter was absent for three-quarters of The Force Awakens) so thirty minutes could be cut and the “important” stuff made tighter. Because there is a great film within what’s ultimately a good one. It has the elements needed in a Star Wars film without being little more than a virtual remake of a past chapter (cough, J.J. Abrams, cough). It subverts the crucial plot points seen in Empire perfectly. It just shows its strings way too often. The standouts are Kelly Marie Tran‘s loyal rebel with a purpose Rose Tico as the foil to Finn’s “I’m loyal to Rey first and the rebellion second”; Benicio Del Toro‘s untrustworthy yet effective burglar DJ and his disarming stutter; and Laura Dern‘s Vice Admiral Holdo who delivers strength and regality despite her role being reduced to a teachable lesson. In some way or another all three of these characters are teachable lessons, but they entertain and/or touch our hearts along the way. It’s something I can’t say about Gwendoline Christie‘s Captain Phasma or Gleeson’s Hux, however, since they are formidable presence and sniveling sycophant respectively yet again. They’re there to gaze at and despise as two-dimensional villains much like the Porgs and crystalline wolves are there to coo. And every single one of those characters bolsters and/or conflicts with Finn or Poe—the lesser of the leads set upon their wartime journeys of the heart and plot threads of distraction. At the end of the day, however, Johnson’s film lives or dies by Rey and Ren and that’s why I can look past the noise and call it a success. These two are phenomenal, their captivating dynamic as dueling entities of light and dark discovering their place in a world that holds both equal proves more crucial than repetitive. They are linked in a way Vader and Luke never were just as their idea of “The Force” is presented as a metaphysical/spiritual one rather than based in science. They could change allegiances and it’d feel real. That is Johnson’s greatest achievement. No matter how righteous and evil Rey and Ren were in the last film respectively, we could feasibly believe those roles might flip or join together on one side or the other. The anger and sense of abandonment they share is etched on their faces when engaged in battle or pleading with the other to join him/her. Things are muddier this time around and it leads to memorable surprises even if only briefly before the status quo returns. Ridley and Driver are carrying this franchise on their backs whether Boyega and Isaac have their roles expanded by largely unnecessary subplots or not. Maybe that’s why I feel as I do. Rey and Ren are so good that we’re keenly aware when they’re absent. It all leaves The Last Jedi in a precarious position of unfolding in a matter-of-fact way for children with heavier content that might very well scare them. It’s therefore just as much a piece of the family-friendly franchise Disney’s homogeneity machine spits out as it is a Rian Johnson project of singular intelligence, pathos, and wit. The latter enhances the former just as the former waters down the latter—thus is the state of cinematic universes embracing auteurism only as far as it benefits the bottom-line. Johnson epitomizes that push and pull with enthusiasm and artistry. He has put his stamp on the franchise and was rewarded with a trilogy of his own to craft. If nothing else his work here has me excited for what’s coming next."
"Aug 28, 2018",positive," Despite its setting in a galaxy filled with life, both the original and prequel Star Wars trilogy – beginning in 1977's A New Hope, and ending in 2005's Revenge of the Sith – were surprisingly more or less about one bloodline: the Skywalkers. George Lucas improvised some of it along the way, bending to the whims of fans by pairing Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han (Harrison Ford), making her Luke's (Mark Hamill) twin. On the other hand, the sequel trilogy that began with J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens in 2015, has been making the case for a different kind of family as it pushes into the saga's inevitable future. All the main characters – Jakku scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley), distressed villain-in-making Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and First Order defector Finn (John Boyega) – in addition to the supporting cast of returning Starkiller Base hero pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and new entrant maintenance worker Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) - lack parental figures. They've either grown up without a family, felt abandoned by their parents, or lost them early on. It's why Rey is so obsessed with finding the truth about them, and why Kylo Ren is drawn to Snoke (Andy Serkis), and it has laid the foundation for the new Star Wars. The questions about Rey's past have also plagued the fans for the last two years, who have wondered where she fits in the Star Wars universe, and whether she's related to someone we know. The Last Jedi – the second chapter in the sequel trilogy and the eighth instalment overall – doesn't shy away from tackling those demands head on, while exploring and deepening the dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren. The two share some touching moments through the film, that hit upon the shared loneliness, fear, and lack of direction, in addition to the bickering of their opposing ideologies. And those wishing for a revisit to the abrupt end of their lightsaber battle from The Force Awakens will be served a Return of the Jedi-inspired treat with a clever twist. Abrams played it safe with his opening chapter, partly because the Star Wars franchise couldn't afford to have another failure after the prequel trilogy, and because it had to set up the new characters the story was about. But now that that's out of the way, his successor, Rian Johnson (Looper) can be bolder with The Last Jedi in many ways, which allows him to push the saga in unexpected and wonderful new ways. At the same time, the film realigns expectations of fans who loved the original trilogy, which were flawed and regressive in their own ways. In fact, there are moments where Johnson nearly rewrites the rules of Force-related capabilities, which will no doubt be the cause of intense fan debate and uproar. At the same time, Johnson's script takes narrative shortcuts, and has a background plot mechanic that makes the First Order feel stupid at times, instead of the all-powerful entity that it's made out to be. When you get time to reflect on what you've seen – The Last Jedi is the longest Star Wars film at 152 minutes, and it packs a lot in – you'll inevitably be left puzzled or slightly disappointed by certain choices, or in one extreme case wonder the implausible nature of the moment. But his direction is steady and focused, imbuing each scene with emotional resonance that the film carries you wonderfully from moment to moment, while having the sense of making it an enjoyable ride with well-earned laughs drawn from new creatures (yes, Porgs), droids, heroes, and even villains, in addition to a sprinkling of cool action moments for nearly every primary character in The Last Jedi. BB-8 is probably the winner overall. Star Wars films are expected to deliver on the visual spectacle, and Johnson handles that expertly in The Last Jedi, providing big space battles that allow you to feel the might of the First Order and the nimble nature of small fighters. The film is also inventive with lightsaber duels that showcase the clever side of the characters we admire and root for, be it co-operation and outsmarting your opponent, or a fitting tribute to Luke's legendary powers late in the film. In all this, Johnson is smart enough to reserve time for personal moments for the secondary characters as well, letting old favourites such as Leia, and new ones such as Rose, shine whenever possible. It's easy to see why The Last Jedi runs close to two and a half hours, since it has the widest focus of any Star Wars film, with three different narrative threads for most of the runtime. Unfortunately, the film is unable to properly serve most new cast members, bolstered by the likes of Laura Dern – who plays Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, and leads the Resistance in dire times – and Benicio del Toro as DJ, a codebreaker (Star Wars' version of a hacker) with no alliances. Both serve a part to the plot, and though their actions have dire consequences, it doesn't make them memorable in any way, which is a shame with such talented actors. Their under-utilisation does give the film more time to enrich and add layers to its two protagonists – or two halves of the same protagonist, as Johnson prefers it – Rey and Kylo Ren. If Star Wars fans were worried The Last Jedi would hew too close to The Empire Strikes Back after Abrams copied the structure of A New Hope for The Force Awakens, Johnson instead ends up delivering a chapter in a galaxy far, far away that borrows from both Empire and Return of the Jedi. The film closes storylines and provides catharsis in a way that would normally be reserved for the concluding episode of a trilogy, which is currently in the works by Abrams for a 2019 release. That's why the characters in the film too talk about putting the past to rest over and over, discarding everything they've known and pushing into a future that's shaped by them, and doesn't carry any of the baggage from the original trilogy. It's almost as if The Last Jedi embeds Johnson's view of the Star Wars saga into literal dialogue, smartly speaking to the millions of fans through a mighty-expensive studio vehicle for which nostalgia has always been the cornerstone, all the way back to its origins, when Lucas infused goofiness into his admiration for Akira Kurosawa's samurai movies. To that end, The Last Jedi forges a new path for Kylo Ren, whom The Force Awakens made too easy a comparison to Darth Vader, due to the filmmakers' construction of him as a black-robed guy in a mask who worships Vader's burnt helmet and barks that he wants to finish his grandfather started. Here, when Snoke mocks him for his failures and the Vader-inspiration in The Last Jedi, he smashes the mask into pieces. Johnson shows that Kylo Ren is unlike both Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker. He's neither fully-formed like the former, who was a calculating and menacing individual, nor is he a man who's lost sight of what he's trying to be, and gets pulled towards the dark side. Rather, Kylo Ren is always in between the two. He's a flawed human being, who's always conflicted about what he must do and what he wants to, being pulled in different directions by his mind and his heart. To understand him is to understand that villainy isn't a switch, and that realistic characters are driven by internal logic that results in what appear to be objectively good or bad choices depending on the circumstances. The writer-director brings that lens to the rest of the cast too, though with mixed results at times. In studying Rey's need for guidance, and the deeper underlying issues owing to her upbringing, The Last Jedi hits at the futility of running from what you've always known. But she doesn't have any moments of utter vulnerability that plagued Luke in Empire, and you might be left with the feeling that you don't see her character grow enough. Poe Dameron's hero complex is given a much better dressing down thanks to Leia and Amilyn, and Luke's broken-hero state and myth status gets a deserved deconstruction. The Jedi Master has lived more than 50 years and knows a lot about the ways of the Force, but he's still no match for the infinite wisdom of say Yoda, who spent nearly 900 years living and learning. Moreover, the audience hasn't been around for much of his middle life, and The Last Jedi's exploration of his world-weariness and his guilt are not just crucial to the plot – you know Luke has to pull himself for the sake of advancing the story – but for answering the question posed by the film's title, and why its characters and the Jedi Order must move on, for wisdom is in knowing that knowledge is ever-evolving. For Johnson, the writer-director charged with designing the next step of Star Wars, that lesson can almost feel a little on the nose. But The Last Jedi is so much more than that. It's proof that well-made franchise stories – even in a studio that's been quite heavy-handed with its directors recently – can deliver a new engrossing chapter that respects the much-loved past while slowing closing the lid on it, and steer the ship in exciting, mature ways that push the boundaries drawn by its predecessors.

"Aug 28, 2018",positive,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi works. It's macro and micro stories entertain, either if you're predisposed to like what it has to offer, or at least not actively resistant to it."
"Aug 27, 2018",positive," Within hours of The Last Jedi’s release, a lot of internet discourse about the film turned hostile. If you loved the movie, you were a fake fan who you didn’t understand Star Wars. If you disliked the movie, you weren’t smart enough to get it, or you dared to have expectations and got upset that they weren’t always met.  The fact that online discussions get ugly is hardly new, but this was especially crushing given that one of The Last Jedi’s themes is the folly of full-throatedly insisting you’re right all the time. Sometimes you’re right, but sometimes you’re wrong, and it’s sheer hubris to insist otherwise. Failure, as one unexpected character tells another, is an incredible teacher.  Writer-director Rian Johnson’s Star Wars debut is a little of everything. It’s long and cluttered and sometimes feels like two films mashed together. It’s also emotionally resonant, a beautiful vision of a more diverse galaxy — and a film that improves on second viewing, when you’re unburdened from any hopes or fears or expectations and can just watch the pieces slot together or, in some cases, jar and bruise.  Johnson’s story expands on a notion The Force Awakens emphasized: that the heroes of these stories can come from anywhere, including the belly of a Star Destroyer. But he takes it a step further, asking us to dispose of (or at least reconsider) the notion of heroes, and heroics, altogether.  Luke Skywalker is back — a surly, resistant Luke, who tells Rey (Daisy Ridley) to go away. (This is some of Mark Hamill’s best work; his expressions and body language often say more than the dialogue.) General Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) quietly demonstrates leadership to the young punks. Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) makes choices so contrary to the supposed behavior of heroes that hotheaded Poe (Oscar Isaac) can’t understand them.  The actions that we’ve come to understand as heroic are called into question; sometimes a grand sacrifice or risky plan works, and sometimes running is a better idea. What are the actions of heroes? Do we value them too highly? As Leia’s Resistance shrinks, battered by the greater might of the First Order, that question grows in the background: Why do we fight? What are we saving? The answer, more even than in Rogue One (despite its repeated line about what rebellions are built on), is hope. These characters act on hope — not the sort of tragic hope that led Rey to insist her parents would return, but the kind that sent her off-planet to help Finn (John Boyega). Hope leads Rey to darker places this time, and it brings her back when Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) misunderstands what drives her. When Holdo says they’re the spark, it’s a spark of hope. Much of the Canto Bight sequence feels unnecessary, but Rose (excellent new addition Kelly Marie Tran) and Finn’s actions there pay off in a reminder that the Resistance isn’t just its leads. It’s everyone in the galaxy who has something to fight for. And so hope spreads. The Last Jedi wants you to think about that: about actions and consequences, responsibilities and failures, what you do and what you say and why. Sometimes the messages are muddled, and not every narrative or thematic choice works. But on many levels, The Last Jedi is the antithesis of the virulent discourse it generates: a reminder that flaws can give way to strengths, that being willing to be wrong is a strength, and that doing the work, not getting the credit, is what matters."
"Aug 27, 2018",positive,"Whereas the first half is a sort of a convoluted mess. ""The Last Jedi"" becomes a dark and exciting sequel that becomes the film you've been looking for by the 75-minute mark."
"Aug 27, 2018",positive," “It doesn’t help, either, when the film makers go out of their way to protect the good guys from lethal laser beams and sophisticated weapons that could easily have done in an army.” Before the 94% Rotten Tomatoes score, before the 81 Metacritic rating, the above quotes are what was initially said about The Empire Strikes Back. Empire was not fully embraced or understood until The Return of the Jedi was released, which effectively fixed most of the plot holes, editing mistakes, made the character inertia into grand character turning points, and put to rest nagging questions. The success of The Last Jedi, like its father before it, will most likely rest on the conclusion of the trilogy. As a film, in its own right, Last Jedi is often weighed down trying to serve too many masters, sometimes not fully developing characters, pushing the boundaries of the force, and has a few too many forced jokes, yet manages to subvert the genre and add greater color to what’s mostly been a paint by numbers universe. The film is “balanced” through three separate plot lines: Rey/Kylo/Luke, Finn/Rose, and Poe. If I had to rank the effectiveness of each, I would say that the Rey/Kylo/Luke portion was the most. Rey (Daisy Ridley) arriving to Luke’s (Mark Hamill) island, waiting to be trained, and encountering a moody and broken “legend” reminds us that characters aren’t static. Effectively, Last Jedi is set around 25-30 years after the conclusion of Return. Bad shit happening to Luke, and Luke not wanting to talk about it, is one of the many examples of director Rian Johnson thrusting these characters beyond their pure archetypes (Luke being the equivalence of hope). Kylo (Adam Driver) is also further developed from a sycophantic shrine building “why the hell do you have that mask” villain. For the most part, Kylo offers the most character development in the franchise’s history. Mind you, this is the same franchise whose original idea of character development was taking a scruffy nerf herder and making him into a heroic scruffy nerf herder? Still, Kylo’s “will he turn/won’t he turn” subplot is the major drama of the film and probably inhabits the best portions. This is in sharp contrast to the Rose/Finn combo. Finn (John Boyega), as a character, was definitely the most interesting of this new crop in Force Awakens. Here, it mostly feels like, between riding inter-galactic horses, trashing high stakes poker games, and having little chemistry with Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), the writers are buying time and laying light groundwork. Additionally, Rose’s character needs more fleshing out, and the success of the Finn/Rose storyline is really contingent on the events of the final film. Lastly, we get to Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Leaving the theater, I thought Poe was the worst handled of any of the characters. In a way, he is more reflective of Solo’s role in Return, where it feels like Lucas had run his course with the character. Scenes between him and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), a Leia stand in (Carrie Fisher) who was given no backstory, are some of the more awkward portions of the film. Too much of this section is trying to teach Poe a lesson, while sacrificing exposition. The disappointing part is that I think this is the one portion of the film that can’t be improved by a wait-and-see approach. Nevertheless, this Star Wars may be the most gif worthy, especially the Yoda-I’m-trippin-balls scene. The rest of Last Jedi is filled with callbacks and gimmicky, sometimes, forced jokes (especially the Porgs). However, my favorite portion of the film has to be DJ (Benicio Del Toro). The slivering stuttering code breaker who provides what the previous incarnations lacked, ambivalent villainy. He’s one more step toward evil than either Solo or Lando, who at least had semblances of consciousness, and in the end, were only looking to protect themselves. DJ is an example of Last Jedi pushing the paint by numbers colorization of the universe. As I said, I’m a full believer that the success of The Last Jedi will be dependent upon the final installment. Yes, the film is probably 10-15 minutes too long. Yes, Snoke (Andy Serkis) was not given near enough explanation and Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) was wasted. Yes, the hyper jump scene was amazing. Blasphemy, it was very Star Trek-esk. However, this film could easily become the best film of the trilogy or the worst. There is still plenty of time before anyone makes grand judgments or pits themselves into a corner. As the above quotes should prove, there’s always time to turn."
"Aug 25, 2018",positive," While it is indeed a Star Wars movie, The Last Jedi is unmistakably Rian Johnson’s work. The stakes are smaller and more tangible than in The Force Awakens – this is more about the emotional toll that war takes on the characters. The Last Jedi takes care to show the small moments of heroism and sacrifice that light the spark a rebellion like this requires. In this sense, it shares a lot of connective thread with Looper. Both tackle structures of power, cycles of violence and its effect on different classes (yes, really), while toying with our perspective of heroes and villains that we know and love, or hate. If there had to be one criticism, it’s that the running time can feel like a stretch when you wonder where all this is going – but the pieces come together, and Johnson sticks the landing. This is all within a film that is the most visually striking that the series has offered to date. There are weirder landscapes and locations, bold splashes of colour and new perspectives of space battles, and some of the most cheer-worthy moments put to film this year. Speaking of which – Ridley and Driver continue to be the most compelling new characters, putting in fantastic performances as Rey and Kylo Ren move into territory previously uncharted by the other films. Mark Hamill and the late, great Carrie Fisher get more substantial roles, and we’re better off for it – both carry an air of wisdom and sadness from battles fought long ago. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for. Refreshingly idiosyncratic, it could almost be called revisionist in the way it takes a torch to our expectations of a Star Wars movie. The Last Jedi is weird, wild, and really fucking cool. And yes, you’ll love the porgs.  SYNOPSIS: Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers. Meanwhile, the Resistance prepares to do battle with the First Order."
"Aug 24, 2018",negative,"It's a two-and-a-half hour movie. It needs to be good in its own right, not just setting up for the next episode. A two-and-a-half hour, $200 million set up?"
"Aug 22, 2018",positive," We see the familiar words scroll up the screen, stars in the background and notes of a recognizable tune blast — indicating that the saga of the Empire versus the Rebellion continues in ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (Episode VIII). As soon as we see the new characters we quickly have grown to love and the old ones we hold dear, we are pulled immediately back into that galaxy far, far away. If only the trip wasn't so long! We pick up right where ""The Force Awakens"" left off. Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a remote island, asking him to come back with her as he is the Rebellion's only hope. Meanwhile, back on the Rebellion's planet, an attack is becoming evident, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), under Supreme Leader Snoke's (Andy Serkis) direction and Kylo Ren's (Adam Driver) lurking approval. Amid an onslaught of explosions, zipping TIE Fighters and X-wing aircrafts dodging blasts, the heroes begin to meet their fate full force. Finn (John Boyega), our newest hero, is awakened, and Poe (Oscar Isaac), the blast-happy fly boy who ignores Princess Leia's (Carrie Fisher) orders, recklessly attempts to be the solar system cowboy and save everyone. Rey, Finn and Poe, along with his trusty sidekick BB-8, are the team to give it their best shot at fighting the evil, dark forces of Kylo Ren, Snoke and Hux. For fair-weather fans of the original and all of its many, many sequels, prequels and prequel to the prequel, it would be beneficial to rewatch ""The Force Awakens"" (or at least read a synopsis). Who is related to whom easily can be confused. Rey's haunting need to find her parents while also becoming a Jedi awakens The Force within, although Skywalker resists teaching her. (His last attempt turned out to be a bit of a failure, aka Kylo Ren.) The connection between Ren and Rey builds as we see the strong yet blurred lines of good and evil. We also find our own connections to all the old, familiar characters such as R2-D2, C-3PO, Yoda and more. The story builds as new characters and connections add a bit of zip and spice to the film. We meet Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), DJ (Benicio del Toro) and Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern). Similar to ""The Force Awakens,"" an effort was made to have a plot line featuring strong female leads, and this sequel continues to bring women to the forefront. Fisher steps up to the commanding leader's position, but her real-life tragedy seems to cast a constant shadow on her performance. Ridley remains just as strong, smart and brave in this version. But it is Rose that shines with personality. She exudes humor and timing, and I anticipated seeing her in each new scene. Holdo, of course, has a strength and wisdom about her character that radiates trust. Driver as Kylo Ren has stepped up his game and is a standout. His portrayal of the betrayed son of Han Solo and Leia is evident in every interaction; we see his conflicted thoughts surface to his impulsive outbursts. Gleeson's talent is immeasurable as he can fluidly transform himself from portraying the ""Winnie the Pooh"" author, A. A. Milne, in ""Goodbye Christopher Robin,"" to an evil and frustrated understudy to Ren. He can almost elicit sympathy for his situation as he just can't seem to get ahead in the bad guy game. While this sequel keeps the saga alive — and I give great credit for the strong female and minority leads — the story is just way too familiar and repetitive. Initially, humor was laugh-out-loud, but that concept must have been sucked into a black hole as the laughs quickly disappeared. And with four different storylines taking place at the same time during the full 152 minutes, the familiar paired with nonstop, blasting explosions is jarring. Where the film truly shines is in the CGI and makeup departments — both absolutely stunning and mesmerizing. Serkis, once again, is completely unrecognizable as Snoke. His off-set eyes, creviced forehead and pocketed cheeks showing bones, tendons and muscles are wonderfully distracting. Of course, the film has a ""party"" scene, as it always does, to showcase bizarre creatures, and this time it's in a casino. And let's not forget the puffinlike bird creature that will be showing up on every toy shelf just in time for Christmas. Yes, it's adorable and it's Chewbacca's sidekick. Need I say more? So, here's the skinny on this 2-hour-and-32-minute Star Wars sequel. If you're a fan, you're going to appreciate the story continuing (on and on). If you're into makeup and CGI, you'll appreciate every minute of it. If you haven't loved the sequels recently, avoid those comfy recliner seats for obvious reasons."
"Aug 21, 2018",positive," A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, myths about good and evil are being rewritten. The eighth canonical installment of the Star Wars series winks and nods at the mythos that the franchise has been building for decades. Like Princess Leia giving an order to Poe Dameron, it corrects course firmly but kindly in the direction of a more expansive and theologically interesting universe. The Last Jedi picks up where the previous movie, The Force Awakens, left off. The First Order has destroyed the Republic and subjugated the galaxy. A scrappy band of resistance fighters struggles to keep hope alive. An emissary has been dispatched to find the last Jedi to rally people to the light. We saw variations on this story in the first Star Wars film (A New Hope) and again in The Force Awakens. The cycles of the generations are hardwired into the Star Wars mythos. Luke Skywalker, son of Anakin Skywalker (later Darth Vader) discovers his parentage and becomes Anakin’s only chance at re­demp­tion. Where Anakin had turned to the darkness, his son chooses the light, marshaling the power of his bloodline while resisting its weakness.

"Aug 21, 2018",positive," I’ve been waiting all year for a film that would make me want to stand up and cheer—a film that would renew my joy in cinema, as well as my faith in Hollywood. Wonder Woman was exciting and inspiring, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri blew me away with its outstanding performances and nuanced craftsmanship. But finally, along comes Star Wars: The Last Jedi and I am left in wonder, awe, and yes, even joy. Now having told you that, I can’t tell you much more about the movie, because a big part of the enjoyment of the film comes from discovering everything on your own. To even hint at a spoiler would be robbing you of the ultimate Star Wars: The Last Jedi experience. What I will tell you is that it’s fun for the whole family. Even the little ones, who might not be able to follow the plot, will be dazzled by the wonder of the special effects. And there are several new adorable creature breeds for them to fawn over. Blatant merchandising plays be damned, the big eyed Porgs, the crystal fox Vultpex and the equine Fathier are wonderful—at least they don’t sing, so you won’t have to listen to the same tune over and over as the kids play with them. As for the more communicative characters, both human and otherwise, let’s just say many of your old friends return, and you will be delighted by the new ones. You will also be justifiably outraged at the evilness of the villains, both old and new, although the line between villainy and heroism is a bit blurry at times, which is one of the film’s best features. Surprises abound. Along with non-stop action, there seems to be more wonder, whimsy and humor in The Last Jedi, some of it (like a scene involving a household appliance) deliciously subtle. All hail writer/director Rian Johnson, who is also responsible for Looper (one of my favorite sci-fi flicks, as well as some of the best episodes of Breaking Bad, one of my favorite TV series). I will say no more, other than you absolutely must experience it for yourself. What are you waiting for? Go buy tickets now. You will thank me later.
