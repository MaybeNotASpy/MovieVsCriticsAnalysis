Apr 5 2024,positive,why do people even hate this
Apr 5 2024,positive,its fun and action packed with an underrated monster design this movie needs more love sometimes you just need to turn off your brain off and have a good time
Mar 31 2024,positive,i kind of feel bad for this movie it is bad for a godzilla movie and the only way i can compliment it is if i pretend it is not a godzilla movie if you want to watch a monster movie then id say its pretty good however the expectations of a godzilla movie were too high for it the best part of this movie in my opinion are the opening scenes and music i do like they stayed with the original roar and honestly i dont hate the redesign
Mar 31 2024,negative,not the best how are gonna turn godzilla into a tyrannosaurus rex
Mar 31 2024,positive,i am overly bios about this movie because it was the first godzilla movie i have ever seen but i understand why people dont like it so 4 stars
Mar 30 2024,positive,this may not be the best godzilla of all but it was my very first godzilla movie in my childhood the roar is classic
Mar 29 2024,positive,my favourite i have watched it a few timesit is a good adventure with a social commentarymany of the others get too dramaticenough drama
Mar 29 2024,neutral,yeah it was pretty good just not a huge fan of the iguana design
Mar 16 2024,neutral,personally this film is a guilty pleasure of mine as i will admit there are some good stuff in this like the effects are pretty good even for 90s standards and the godzilla design while it doesnt look like the godzilla we all know and love is still a cool design and roar it makes sounds pretty intimidating and i also thought that the robert ebert cameo in the film was pretty funny
Mar 9 2024,positive,one of my favorite movies as a kid and i still believe its an amazing movie i really dont get how people think this movie was terrible obviously theyre the ones who grew up eating rotten tomatoes  still a classic and they should make more of these it would be cool to see godzilla vs this godzilla
Feb 28 2024,positive,this movie is sensational but this godzilla is nothing like the original godzilla but its still a very good godzilla movie why does this movie deserve so much hatred not a bad movie
Feb 26 2024,positive,just rewatched it for the first time in years and its still as good as i remember personally i dont understand all the negative reviews  in my opinion this is the only godzilla plot that remotely makes sense combine that with two hours of  90s action and its a solid movie
Feb 25 2024,positive,i thought it was great ive never seen so much action in a movie in a long time i dont know why people seem to think that its such a bad movie ive seen a lot of five star movies that quite honestly dont even deserve to be on the screen let alone receive that rating
Feb 24 2024,negative,its not as bad as some people say but its definitely a pretty horrible godzilla film it might be fun to people who arent too familiar with godzilla but that doesnt make up for the films horrible writing
Feb 17 2024,negative,this movie is just a mediocre jurassic park ripoff using the godzilla name
Feb 15 2024,positive,one of the best godzilla films ever i know people hate his model i love his model 10 10
Feb 11 2024,positive,i know this godzilla gets alot of hate but hey i love it not because its got a great script or superb acting but just because this is one of those feel good summertime movies that ill always tune in if i find it when im flipping thru the channels on a laid back sunday and it doesnt hurt that maria pittillo was a cutie pie in here
Feb 9 2024,negative,i dont like the look for him i dont like how he doesnt have atomic breath this movie was sad not the good kind of sad i do like the fact the godzilla had a family ready to cause trouble but they didnt make it out the bombing speaking of which how did godzilla die to basic missiles what godzilla eats missiles for lunch and nukes for dinner 210
Feb 6 2024,negative,fuck you roland emmerich you ruined godzillas image in the west
Feb 4 2024,negative,godzilla in name only    nuclear testing mutates a lizard into a giant firebreathing monster after attacking a japanese ship it makes its way to new york where it wreaks havoc the creature is dubbed godzilla by a japanese survivor    from imdbcom roland emmerich admitted that he did not like the original godzilla and only agreed to the project after being promised to be able to do what ever he wanted with the series    a director who doesnt respect a legacy a cast who are either too good for their roles or should never act again a beloved cinema icon reduced to a gimmicky cgi monster all these and more contribute to this disasterpiece skip it and watch the original    prop i want top secret vhs tape  most punchable face audrey  favorite quote youre going the wrong way man youre going the wrong way  animal
Feb 1 2024,positive,i am shocked with the vast majority of poor reviews of this movie  i find it an interesting and entertaining film  im not comparing it to any other of the large number of godzilla films   this film was a hollowed special effects offering  and the comedic timing was perfect addition  the interaction between matthew broderick and jean reno was also a huge part of the overall story
Jan 22 2024,negative,not as terrible as some people would say but still pretty mediocre with the exceptions of hank azaria and jean reno the cast seems uninspired or lost at the fact that theyre doing this movie yes its a monster film but things just dont make sense the cgi is an easy target for this film but im sure it was passable in 1998 whats something that aged well since then in a nutshell this movie is 2am sci fi channel worthy and is easily bottom of the barrel when it comes to godzilla media 
Jan 22 2024,negative,not as terrible as some people would say but still pretty mediocre with the exceptions of hank azaria and jean reno the cast seems uninspired or lost at the fact that theyre doing this movie yes its a monster film but things just dont make sense the cgi is an easy target for this film but im sure it was passable in 1998 whats something that aged well since then     in a nutshell this movie is 2am sci fi channel worthy and is easily bottom of the barrel when it comes to godzilla media
Jan 12 2024,positive,yes its dumb and in 1998 i thought it was real dumb but now 25 years later its a relief to see something that is just silly entertainment these days that aint all that bad
Jan 11 2024,positive,i love this movie i grew up with it when i was a kid in my opinion best godzilla kaiju movie ever
Jan 6 2024,positive,this is my all time favorite godzilla movie the acting was great along with the graphics have watched this movie many times over
Jan 4 2024,negative,this movie sucks dudeall the boring parts of early godzilla films is still theregodzilla looks stupid and its not even a good monster filmi like films a lotbut this film genuinely made me go to sleepits that boringit was probably a very disappointing film for every american that was looking forward watching a godzilla moviethey had so much potential but noinstead of a big indestructible fire spewing lizard we all know and lovewe got this stupid iguana that cant even take rockets to the facethankfully just 2 years later americans got a real taste of godzilla with godzilla 2000if you wanna watch this moviejust watch jurassic parkits a better monster movie in almost every regarddont even bother with this disappointment of a film
Jan 2 2024,positive,so when you watch a godzilla movie what are you expecting  great dialog  emotionally moving  a godzilla movie is a godzilla movie  its the same as a zombie movie being a zombie movie  expecting witty repertoire  i like this movie  i like it in the context that it is a godzilla movie  i have never seen a good godzilla movie  you are always starting out with an outlandish concept that usually gets more outlandish   a godzilla movie will not stimulate your intellect  with that in mind this movie is pretty standard  its what i expect in a godzilla movie  as a young mankid i watched them because they had remote controlled toys running about  story was always asinine  i would say this was a step up from those japanese flicks  i particularly enjoyed the side story of the french trying to make up for past mistakes  not a bad movie to while away 2 hours  is the acting good hmmmmm  well it is for a godzilla movie  i have very low standards for any godzilla movie  im basically watching to see what the creature does and the people play a secondary role to that  i have watched this movie several times  its my fav godzilla movie
Jan 1 2024,negative,if i could give this a zero i would  this movie is garbage
Dec 31 2023,negative,godzilla 1998 is the definition of a studiomade movie
Dec 17 2023,positive,i dont remember much from this movie other than seeing the scene of zilla chasing the people but hate on the design all you want but it my opinion it looks good
Dec 16 2023,neutral,oh goodie another roland emmerich film where characters are bland the only good thing about this movie is the special effects for the 90s john azaria and the fact that the baby godzillas are cute and more terrifying than the original other than that the nick atopolis last name is just a running gag and fails to be an american godzilla movie if you want to watch a godzilla movie with builtup characters and how a godzilla would actually act this is not it
Dec 15 2023,positive,my first godzilla film although now i see this is not really godzilla at all the dialogues are so bad and with the acting in this movie they mightve been going for a fullon comedy ebert and siskel dig was fun now that i can understand that overall its a dumb fun monster movie
Dec 15 2023,positive,610  69100   the first half is actually pretty good i like the jurassic park feeling and everything but it falls apart at the last half
Dec 5 2023,negative,a wasted opportunity
Dec 3 2023,neutral,i mean its all right
Nov 10 2023,positive,loved watching this on vhs as a kid i used to play along in the movie at the part where the baby zillas chased the people
Nov 9 2023,positive,i had little reference of godzilla when this film came out  i saw it as a child with my father at the old cheri theatre in downtown boston near back bay  i thought it was great then and on my rewatches since then i enjoyed it every time  i like roland emmerichs popcorn flick style of filmmaking  i though his last one with the moon killing earth was good too  yea the film is dumb but what were you expecting social commentary like the original  ive spoken to kaiju film lovers who just ish on the film because of the monsters size  i thought the dinosaur was cool regardless  the first is the best but i liked this one more than the new remakes except kong vs godzilla  i hope this gets more appreciation over time  its almost as good as the first independence day    rating 7510
Nov 4 2023,negative,hollywoods first big attempt at taking on tohos godzilla franchise may have translated into a decent enough haul at the boxoffice but critics were much less enthusiastic and a sequel never saw the light of day a reboot was finally put together a full 16 years later    following nuclear tests in french polynesia a japanese fishing boat is attacked by an unknown creature the sole survivor identifies as gojira a scientist nick tatopoulos matthew broderick is promptly brought in by the us army to look into the matter and lend his expertise the armys initial plans to get rid of godzilla backfire and despite nicks warnings that the giant reptile has probably laid dozens of eggs in the city the scientist is eventually fired due to a leak it becomes up to him the french secret service his exgirlfriend audrey maria pitillo and her cameraman friend victor hank azaria to try and track down godzillas nest and find a way to destroy it    to say that the marketing for this godzilla movie was inspired would be an understatement as it focused primarily on the carnage and destruction never really showing godzilla himself this was enough to get butts in seats but watching the film itself it becomes clear that this wasnt so much clever marketing as it was hiding the actual movie as much as possible roland emmerich on paper seemed like the perfect choice for a movie like this and indeed he handles the action sequences well whether its godzilla stamping on new york cabs or getting caught on the brooklyn bridge theres a movie in there that works but the movie that doesnt work is just too big and too strong to let it happen    every step of the way this godzilla film makes weird choices and it all adds up to a thoroughly messy experience godzilla himself is about as ugly and as far from the original design as it gets the supporting cast is an odd mix of simpsons veterans siskel  ebert impersonators and french character actors the second act is mostly just a sluggish claustrophobic jurassic park ripoff and the plot is full of holes the performances are rather patchy as well with hank azaria chewing on a notsoconvincing thick new york accent throughout and maria pitillo awkwardly attempting quirkiness as audrey but in all fairness the lazy writing is really mostly to blame here     jean reno and matthew broderick are endearing enough however and even though this feels like a generic big dinosaur movie that decided to slap on the title godzilla at the last minute its hard to deny it can be entertaining this is the kind of dated trashy event movie you catch on tv late at night and find yourself not hating despite the many complaints bubbling around in your head as you sit through it its a disaster but its an ambitious expensive one and as such it delivers just enough for you to not spit out your popcorn andor beer it fails to impress on just about every level except the special effects which were quite good for the time but at least it never aimed to be anything more than just good fun and it almost gets there    when it comes to godzilla films or even mindless hollywood blockbusters you could do a lot better than this cartoonish underwhelming and bloated mess its incredibly silly and misguided but as a late 90s effectsladen spectacle movie with its cheesy comic relief and mindless action it has its charm    notzilla
Nov 2 2023,negative,although zilla this monster not classic godzilla doesnt fully live up to his name he still is a cool monster but just not godzilla
Oct 21 2023,negative,this godzilla laid some rather large eggs this movie laid a larger one
Oct 15 2023,positive,as a life long fan of godzilla movies  i enjoy this for what it is  a retelling  much like the hammer films put their twist on dracula  the wolfman  etc this was never meant to be a remake  it was  at that time  a brave move to make a monster movie and they tried successfully in mt opinion  to give a more plausible story line  with some wonderfully fun performances from  broderick  reno  azaria pitilloetc and a wonderful soundtrack featuring artist like green day  foo fighters  p diddy and the wallflowers not to mention how much more screen time they gave to the actual monster compared to the more embraced 2014 godzilla in which you barely see the monster this film deserves more respect    one more thing  when people tell you it was a flop remember it made 379 million world wide on a budget of 120 to 150 million  id like to be that kind of flop 
Oct 11 2023,positive,very overhated in my opinion its a pretty good movie although zilla was not a good godzilla for this movie still a pretty interesting take on that godzilla design though but hey i recommend this instead of the godzilla anime trilogy one
Sep 8 2023,negative,this movie was a super flop no storyline terrible cgi and a stupid godzilla
Aug 14 2023,positive,i personally loved this movie still remember watching this at the cinema and a real popcorn movie not to be taken seriously just to be enjoyed would of liked to of seen a more original godzilla look which is its only downfall the special effects are better then some movies we have today
Jul 19 2023,positive,this is my favorite godzilla movie i saw this as a child and till this day remains one of my top favorite movies people definitely are hating just to hate this movie has better graphics than 2023s the flash no seriously
Jul 17 2023,neutral,the nostalgia is great this movie was advertised so much youd see godzilla things everywhere as a kid around its release  the beginning feels a tad like og jurassic park in a good way of course  about an hour in the story shrinks into small bits its hard seeing movies that could have been better  still will watch every few years 
Jul 13 2023,positive,thats a lot of fish
Jul 11 2023,neutral,typical of this genre monstrous pun intended budget bitesized storyline but still a pretty fun flick  btw what happened to tokyo isnt that godzillas home turf
Jul 2 2023,negative,i remember watching this movie as a kid growing up the newer ones are better dated special effects decent acting in this one lame plot
Jun 12 2023,negative,its effects are the only thing saving it from half a star no plot no storyline not even a good monster this barely counts as a kaiju and dont call it godzilla thats ugly ass zilla right there
Jun 11 2023,neutral,should have just been a new kaiju movie with the same kaiju but not with the goji name
Jun 8 2023,positive,i feel like this is one of those movies where everyone hates it to feel cool like its genuinely a fun  realistic take on  godzilla its like crying and moaning that the christopher nolan batman didnt have enough 1960s dance montages like the originals like come on can we not look at it objectively as its own film heck idk how this got worse reviews than the most recent godzilla film where everyone stood up for the pledge of allegiance at the as the thing that just slaughtered their whole city went into the water as if it needed an american flag planted on its back or the fact that bryan cranston got more screen time in the trailer than the actual film id watch this one twice over
Jun 5 2023,positive,one of the most underrated movies of the 90s in my opinion i know there is a lot of hate towards godzilla himself but i like the different take on it yes it does have its problems but the action is great and the characters are good enough 710
Jun 1 2023,positive,i really loved this movie it was one of the first godzilla movies that got me into godzilla the effects both cgi and practical effects were amazing i did like the characters i really wished it got a sequel although it might not be liked by everyone but i think its a good monster film
May 30 2023,positive,the greatest 02 hours and 18 minutes ever
May 23 2023,negative,i expected better from you
May 22 2023,positive,hmmm good and what the f
May 21 2023,negative,the script of the movie was changed that is not the original story of the japanese creators here they show godzilla as a monster that irrationally attacks humanity and must be destroyed at all costs regardless of collateral damage and the worst thing is that they show a biologist without personality who instead of preserving the life of this formidable creature to study and understand it dedicates all his efforts and scientific knowledge to destroy it they make biologists around the world look bad
May 19 2023,negative,i would say this it doesnt deserve to be called godzilla it should have been called the beast from 20000 fathoms remake
Apr 28 2023,positive,i dont get the hate except for the storytelling i actually like godzillas design
Apr 24 2023,positive,first trans lizard ever put to film truly ahead of its time
Apr 19 2023,positive,this movie has obviously gotten bad reviews from critics but for a single individual like me there are parts of the movie that got some of godzillas facts correct for example how it evolved by nuclear radiation but the cgi in the film is best at times unfortunately some of the close ups has lowered the quality of it especially in the tunnel scenes however id like to say that this movie has bought the godzilla franchise from its knees ever since the final film in 1995 in which we thought would be the ultimate end for the creature
Apr 17 2023,negative,even though it has uncompelling characters and a slow story those are not the reason that this film flops the real reason this film gets its bad rap is because of the main monster himself having the wrong look and not not having enough screen time    rating 16
Apr 14 2023,positive,this was the first godzilla movie i ever saw and its pretty meh rewatching it was kinda fun but was not what i remembered
Apr 3 2023,negative,godzillas somewhat intriguing new design is about the only halfway decent thing in this movie wooden acting a predictable story and cheesy action sequences make this seem more like a spoof than an actual godzilla film
Mar 27 2023,negative,pretty badly made nothing much to it
Mar 25 2023,negative,theres very little about this film that is worth watching i saw it in the theaters and trust me just avoid it id rather watch those terrible 70s godzilla maninasuit films where hes sliding on his tail and friends with children than watch this film ever again
Mar 18 2023,positive,this movie is thoroughly underrated  perhaps its not entirely faithful to the original concept of godzilla but this was nevertheless an excellent attempt to modernize the big g  maybe the story is sometimes a little weak but the characters are funny and the editing music cinematographyall were well crafted  in the end its a silly monster movie  its not meant to be a high work of art  i urge you to give it a chance and enjoy it on a saturday night with friends
Feb 20 2023,positive,the movie is not too bad i had fun memories watching the movie in theaters when i was 10
Feb 3 2023,positive,i loved it and dont criticise me and i even got the full body puppet  such an underrated film
Jan 30 2023,negative,one of the stupidest movies ive ever seen brilliant plot thoughhave a 300 foot lizard travel to nyc to lay its eggs and if youre going to secretly lay your eggs in nyc why not use madison square gardens as a giant nest absolutely brilliantnot to be undone the acting is every bit as bad as the plot broderick spends most of the movie looking like a deer caught in the headlightshes so far out of his element its not even funny
Jan 25 2023,positive,many times i watch this motion picture godzilla 1998 film which is the best of godzilla series ever viewed before    an american monster film directed and cowritten by roland emmerich    the film was dedicated to tomoyuki tanaka the cocreator and producer of various godzilla films who died in april 1997    casting is strong covering a french actor jean reno
Jan 20 2023,neutral,really good kaiju movie not a good godzilla movie
Jan 6 2023,positive,the design of godzilla was terrible but if you look past that you will have a good time with the movie
Dec 13 2022,negative,terrible worst godzilla film ever made the only part of this film that i liked is the seqeul animated series that show was actually good
Nov 13 2022,negative,this came out during an era were movies were all about making disaster movies both figuratively and literally were the formula is to make your characters as bland as possible then have some cgi monster or cgi natural disaster that has god awful cgi make the challenge of the movie to survive and not to overcome have just the most overused stereotypes for your characters to make it seem like they have personality and the acting has to make you cringe like never before and that was the exact formula that was used to make this disaster of a disaster movie
Nov 11 2022,positive,while sometimes tonally mismatched this is a criminally underrated film that is loads of popcornfun dont expect to have the deepest characters despite broderick and reno giving it their all but do expect to have a great time picking apart the bad cgi mixed within the solid direction by emmerich
Nov 2 2022,positive,is like a ripoff version of jurrasic park but with much incomplete cgi while the japanese version is better than this remake the reason why i like this film is how silly and how ridiculous the film was 7510
Nov 1 2022,neutral, independence day meets jurassic park but with godzilla it has a ton of action but manages to be boring as well
Nov 1 2022,negative,this movie is not a godzilla movie it simply shouldnt have the godzilla name attached to it ive only seen it twice and that is all i need to see this godzilla is weak it dies after only a couple of missiles godzilla in the orginal took a weapon of mass destruction to make it die also this looks like someone attached spikes to a trex and called it godzilla
Oct 29 2022,positive,a good not too great movie the best of this movie was the visual effects the casting wasnt good even the lines or writings but godzilla 1998 makes a good destruction monster kaiju movie
Oct 29 2022,negative,this movie is so bad its just sad and funny
Oct 24 2022,negative,what was that supposed to be godzilla
Oct 18 2022,negative,godzilla running away from planes for 1 hour and then dying to basic explosives lol
Oct 5 2022,positive,just an average action monster movie i can understand why this is hated by fans of the toho franchise so adamantly but im going to judge it based on its merits as a action movie as it clearly isnt trying to be canon to the original series the biggest problem here is the acting which is just ok and boring one dimensional characters matthew broderick is clearly miscast and has no charisma at all no performance is bad but none are memorable either the cinematography is solid overall with well framed shots and nyc being memorable the music is just ok with it being forgettable overall the editing is ok also sometimes especially in the middle there is a lot of jumping around and it gets tiring with so many stories to keep up with the pacing is ok overall with the first 20 minutes being very well done  doing a very good job of building tension of what godzilla looks like than it kinda slows down with spurts of action until the last 20 minutes the action scenes can feel very over the top at times lacking any real tension worth the 2 hour investment of time and the special effects in the latter half of the movie are very dated with poor cgi that take you out of the experience on top of not really caring for generic characters overall the story is also just kind of forgettable even with all the over the top action at the end once again because of generic characters but it doesnt do anything terrible at all but nothing is phenomenal not even close it lacks any charm overall its just a average action movie that is perfectly harmless and at its worst boring and not worth the 2 hour runtime id say see it only if your really curious or super die hard godzilla fan
Sep 26 2022,negative,they almost ruined godzilla luckily he is still alive and kicking in cinemas today
Aug 27 2022,positive,i loved this movie as a kid especially the action scene hersheys bars
Jul 31 2022,positive,first let me address the critics of this movie wow there are a lot of pretentious sheep on this bandwagon have any of you ever seen a godzilla movie this one checks all of the classic boxes bad script check over the top acting check rampant destruction check melodramatic characterizations check man as the ultimate villianculprit check fun to watch if you arent an academy voter check get a grip people this movie is fun to watch for what it was meant to be move along now
Jul 21 2022,negative,widely panned on release roland emmerichs creature feature is no less destructive than his usual efforts this time its madison square gardens that feels the brunt of his wrath in the last quarter of the film many dinosaurs need to be exterminated to prevent new york being overrun and theyve taken refuge in the famous venue it might seem a step down after blowing up the white house in independence day 1996 a film that incidentally became the first film to gross 100 million in less than a week godzilla isnt a patch on independence day but it is vastly superior to its sequel the stunningly dreadful independence day resurgence 2016 thats not to say that godzilla is good film the second half especially drags terribly every time matthew broderick and co think theyve thwarted the threat more reptiles pop up to the point where the destruction and chasing become a real chore its way too long at almost two and a half hours but it has to be said up until the discovery of the eggs in madison square garden the film is reasonably entertaining strangely enough the special effects are pretty effective when confronted with godzilla close up but at longer range can appear creaky and haphazard its not terrible but by the time the brooklyn bridge gets a thrashing two hours in youve stopped caring
Jul 19 2022,positive,is this a flawed film yes is this godzilla no its zilla does it have bad writing for the actors another yes is it an enjoyable kaiju film yes    this was the very first kaiju films i ever saw and while the monster in this film is not godzilla it opened the doors for me to go and discover the true godzilla and other kaijus but my love for this film isnt just for it simply showing me the world of kaiju movies but if you just take away the title of godzilla and his big reputation as the king of monsters youve actually got a enjoyable kaiju film    its good run of the mill kaiju on the loose film i can put it on any day and get great enjoyment from it
Jul 15 2022,positive,this movie isnt as bad as the viewerscritics made it out to be its not the best movie but it certainly doesnt deserve the extremely low ratings it received 
Jul 10 2022,positive,sorry attempt at realism but still fun
Jul 1 2022,positive,the scene with the baby godzillas was cool
Jun 28 2022,negative,the worst mistake in godzilla franchise
Apr 22 2022,positive,this movie changed my life better than morbius this sold 1000 morbillion tickets at the grand cinema of morbius it caused me to explode into morbillion moneys and kill the establishment death and sorrow now is all i am i weep
Apr 5 2022,positive,this american reimagining of the famous japanese monster may leave fans of the original disappointed but it works well if you think of it as its own thing the movie is fun and decently paced a true popcorn flick the special effects are a bit dated but fantastic for 1998 if not for the title i honestly believe godzilla would have been better received
Mar 31 2022,positive,not a good godzilla movie but considering godzilla as zilla in this movie it was fun watching
Mar 2 2022,negative,complete garbage godzilla suffers on every level imaginable from its bad screenplay to its horrid acting to its cheeziness and terrible cgi to finally its lack of action in a freaking godzilla movie along with that godzilla doesnt even cool his design is awful and he doesnt look intimidating in the slightest thats probably the reason why nobody in the movie seemed to take the situation seriously everything seemed like a big ol joke     ill leave you with this godzilla isnt a movie its an experience take that as you will
Jan 3 2022,negative,im not the biggest fan of monster movies but honestly this movie gets way too much hate even though its a product of its time
Dec 16 2021,negative,there were quite a few good little moments of both action and tension as well as genuine nods to the original godzilla fans but this is ultimately a somewhat terrible movie  the main reason for this is that the movie has a large number of characters and every one of them takes extended turns playing the comic relief character resulting in a movie with massively jarring jumps in tone  this is a shame as this movie has several slowburn moments of tension and these are genuinely good and while the godzilla cgi itself is uneven the animation is solid as is the cgi of nyc itself and its destruction  and while it feels completely opposite of what we want as godzilla fans the moments of godzilla running away from military helicopters is quite a thrilling ride or at least it was in 1998 on the big screen  but the movie has aged rather poorly from a technical perspective and combined with a sloppy and overlyquick climax with the main godzilla monster itself theres just nothing left to recommend this movie for  its not particularly well written or well directed the acting is acceptable and even the better cgi looks standardissue today  honestly id just skip it
Dec 7 2021,negative,watch this if you want to see japans iconic monster reduced to a chump animal hack roland emmerich cynically rip off jurassic park by having the king of monsters lay a gazillion eggs that hatch velociraptor clones and beloved actorsharry shearer hank azaria matthew brodericksoullessly cashing in reciting vapid brainless lines under painfully inept direction warning watching this movie may drain you of the will to live choose life and watch anything else note from my 10 year old son 99 poop  all godzilla fans this is nothing like the real godzilla this fakezilla is hunched over  puny enough to walk across bridges go through subway tunnels  get killed by tiny missiles shot from helicopters i hate this movie
Dec 6 2021,positive,very underrated easily the best godzilla movie and design
Dec 1 2021,positive,one of the most silly but fun movies of all time the vfx hasnt aged that well but i dont think the characters are boring and i follow their journey in the film and am happy for their victory
Nov 19 2021,positive,i watched this movie when it came out at the cinema when i was a 12 year old boy and loved it i have strong memories of this movie and of that time having watched it whilst on holiday in singapore with my mum and brother   this really is one of the last great blockbusters before cgi took over and practically ruined cinema   a real gem first third of the movie is a little slow and predictable but after that its hollywood blockbuster entertainment at its very very best
Nov 14 2021,positive,i was four when this movie came out it was one of the few vhs tapes we had in my house and i remember that i watched this movie at least once a week or more as a kid eventually i stopped watching it and i grew up i realized that everyone else hated this movie i figured that maybe i was just nostalgic for being a kid but earlier today the soundtrack came up on youtube so i listened to it and it brought back a lot of old memories so i watched it again if for no other reason than to confirm the movies terribleness  and you know what  this movie is great go revisit it now that weve seen what people claimed they wanted in godzilla 2014 and tell me which one was better   im sticking with 1998s version i dont need to follow events through the eyes of gi generic
Nov 13 2021,positive,my first godzilla film outside of the home i had been watching godzilla on the small screen since i was born but loved getting to see a kaiju on the big screen and really enjoyed the new take on him making it more saurian while keeping with the radioactive mutant theme
Aug 27 2021,positive,sorry its not the remake you always dreamed of but its a fine movie for what it is
Aug 16 2021,positive,not a good godzilla movie but an entertaining movie nonetheless 
Jul 1 2021,positive,not really the original godzillastory more just another monstermovie but okay and i love jean reno  give me the popcorn 
Jun 18 2021,positive,i love it i could have been better but it feals like its 1 of the most respectful to gojira 1954 all in all i love it and i think its well worth it
Jun 1 2021,negative,godzilla  410 godzilla the 1998 version is one of the best guilty pleasure films that ive ever seen is it a good film absolutely not considering this came right off the heels of the mega blockbuster that was independence day its quite astonishing how far from the target that director roland emmerich and writer dean devlin missed with this film in id4 they created a great over the top alien invasion film which put up some great action set pieces and some great hammy acting in the case of godzilla the casting is some of the worst ive ever seen in a big budget film matthew broderick is a good actor and one that is great in lighter type of roles having him as the lead of a film like this is a huge miscalculation he does a good job with what hes given with but you just dont feel any connection to his character and the film hank azaria is probably the best character in the film and hes relegated to being the comicside relief jean renos character is an interesting throw in character but the way his character and his associated characters enter the storyline just feel a little forced as a movie godzilla has entertaining aspects i for one actually liked the character design for zilla and loved the action scenes in the film especially the madison square garden sequence which is a lot of fun even with its blatant inspiration from jurassic park making godzilla into a nesting mother was a nice spin and interesting way of moving the story in a different direction but the film falters really hard with the really cheesy acting and badly casted roles when it dedicates itself into being a fun action film it succeeds to a certain extent but its a weirdly made movie one moment feels like a film dedicated towards a younger audience and family audience whereas the next moment makes the film feel like a more serious movie when watching the movie as a kid i appreciated it and still do till this day however i understand the fact that it is a bad film but as a guilty pleasure film it succeeds really well definitely one of the best worst big budget films of all time
May 30 2021,positive,this has always been labled the embarrassing red headed stepchild of the godzilla franchise but as time has gone by you can really take this movie for what it is an actually pretty decent daikaiju film if it had gone by any other name than godzilla it wouldnt have done near as bad or gotten near the flack over these last 23 years  thanks to toho in the films  01 godzilla mothra king ghidorah giant monsters allout attack  04 godzilla final wars was officially said the 98 kaiju was not godzilla but a subspecies named zilla so i take it like this so that zilla  this film can exist in the universe that everyone in the movie had a case of mistaken identity that way you can take the movie for what it really is  not just a bad godzilla movie attempt i would actually love to see a godzilla subspecies alah zilla in future monsterverse films
May 22 2021,positive,this is a ok movie i dont why it has bad ratings i love godzillas roar 1998 but the movie should not be called godzilla it should be called zilla
May 17 2021,negative,terrible movie id rather watch the old cheesy looking godzilla movies from the 60s
May 11 2021,positive,not as bad as the rating  popcorn flick
May 10 2021,positive,this is an awesome movie i dont know why they called it godzilla its not godzilla  this is a misunderstood and underrated classic once you get past the fact that its not godzilla
May 5 2021,positive,its too much of a jurassic park wannabe its too long the humor falls flat most of the time most of the performances are not very good godzilla does not look like godzilla and despite a budget of 130150 million the cgi is pretty bad but i have to admit i actually got some enjoyment out of it i felt some of the action scenes were pretty entertaining and it wasnt too boring despite its lengthy 139minute runtime though i think i have a little bit of a soft spot for cheesy 90s action movies so i understand why a lot of people hate it its definitely a guilty pleasure for me as a godzilla movie its a bit of a fail but as a cheesy 90s scifi action monster movie summer blockbuster its still not really good but i had some fun
Apr 25 2021,positive,i loved this film great acting and a really cool take on godzilla its really a more realistic rendition of the story of godzilla i thought it was pretty fun i love godzilla and all the movies and lore and lets be honestthis version of godzilla looked really cool
Apr 22 2021,negative,fucking cringe movie
Apr 20 2021,negative,it is a huge garbage an insult to everything that is the godzilla franchise i hope that roland emerich is ashamed of this abomination
Apr 13 2021,negative,truth is if they would have called this anything but godzilla and had not tried to pass it off as the iconic monster i would have added another star but this film is an insult to that franchise and i wish it was never made
Apr 4 2021,positive,watching this as a kid was cool dope twist for godzilla 
Apr 1 2021,neutral,it is good only in the first half then it becomes meh
Mar 23 2021,positive,its not that bad its maybe 40 bad but not as bad as people make it sound
Mar 4 2021,positive,i think the movie is quite enjoyable for what it is  much more entertaining than the 2014 one in my opinion  at least its got some comedy to it
Feb 20 2021,positive,funne moment actually love animal and jean reno
Feb 10 2021,positive,i dont understand the critics this film deserved much more it is amazing almost a masterpiece it was the first film like this ever created absolutely amazing
Jan 30 2021,negative,i look at it as a monster film not a godzilla film but i find this film so boring and really stupid the zilla scenes are fine but sometimes it looks dumb
Jan 29 2021,positive,i think i was one of the few people on the planet that actually enjoyed roland emmerichs godzilla my god was it too long 2 hrs 18 min and the characters were paper cutouts and godzilla looked like a freaking mutated dinosaur from jurassic park     but damn if it wasnt pure popcorn entertainment when godzilla finally starts stomping through manhattan
Jan 26 2021,negative,im sticking with expert testimony on this one  zeno has ranked 28 different godzilla films on letterboxd and this one ranks dead last i rest my case
Jan 11 2021,neutral,i dont think it is a bad movie but i think if it was not a godzilla movie and it on monster it would not get as mush hate
Dec 29 2020,positive,this was the first godzilla movie i ever watched and it holds a special place in my heart i really love this movie
Nov 28 2020,negative,only reason giving more than one star was the final death scene of godzilla which was unusually movingbut not worth the relative 2 12 hours to get to it
Nov 4 2020,positive,this movie really runs at a good pace thats why i like this movie and the action scenes are cool
Oct 10 2020,positive,this is clearly not as good as the original but i think this was better than the newer ones im not a big fan of cgi and this one seems to have less than the newer ones
Sep 26 2020,negative,look at the gallery
Sep 16 2020,positive,this is not godzilla and for that i understand why so many people hate it its unfortunate people cant look past that and accept that this is one of the best giant monster movies ever made its long but almost constant bigbudget wellfilmed action not the cgi shaky cam noise we mostly get today the special effects were and still mostly are outstanding it was the greatest on screen depiction of monster vrs military might until pacific rim all those years later the cast is mostly fantastic jean reno and hank azaria one of the only movies in this genre where you actually care about the band of main characters plus theres godzillaraptors its a nearly flawless film they nailed everything except for the title and for that godzilla 98 gets crucified
Aug 1 2020,positive,for daring to take on a japanese classic this film took on a lot of flak however for our family the film was a perfect combination of comedy and suspense as a family film it works brilliantly and there are some genuinely hilarious moments  especially those involving jean reno all shot on sound stages and locations it is far more watchable than the machismo and heavy cgi of the other hollywood attempts at this subject for those who are serious devotees of the japanese films this is obviously not the same thing at all but there is no reason why it should be
Jul 10 2020,negative,this movie isnt very good the main characters arent that interesting and some are kinda rude like one character uses her ex to get a story and reports classified information on air gets him fired and he forgives her and they get back together i mean thats absolutely ridiculous and the fact that they somehow lost godzilla is hilariously absurd you mean to tell me given how massive godzilla is they somehow found a way to lose it time and time again thats utterly ridiculous and its funny that this movie tries to make it seem not as silly as it actually is i mean i have a hard time believing a creature that big can somehow evade the military and godzilla isnt very terrifying or menacing  this movie isnt very good and honestly the only fun i had was laughing at how silly it is
Jul 7 2020,negative,not a good watch wont watch again and cant recommend unless youre just a kaiju fan which i am not    i have a noted bias for liking stories of shrinking down or involving small people like 6 inch people and not liking big character stories bfg godzilla pacific rim cloverfield probably the best for me but i like found footage  something about being too big to fit into society not being able to hide  get away being accidently destructive just has zero appeal to me    i do respect the genre and in some waysmaybe more than the people that made this movie  godzilla is supposed to be the main character whether its a villain or hero and america has trouble understanding that sometimes so they turned godzilla into a force of nature that nested inone of the new york islands and had it make babies as additional antagonists  this allows for late 1990s cg work with the jurassic park reject practical effects being one of the best things about this movie    there just isnt a lot of tension as godzilla wrecks new york maybe there is some with the babies but really youre just supposed to ooh and awe at the effects for way too long until you realize you dont care and by then theyre supposed to have something else to dangle in front of you    think of it as shifting the goalposts but with focus while nothing of any real meaning happens  the most touching part of the movie was at the end which was just confusing because we should have felt triumphant and not sad the movie fails to lead our emotions in that regard    no idea why matthew broderick touched this one he must have always wanted it and go to live out a dream  he was by far the most famous person there with jean reno behind him    maybe im just not a fan but there just isnt enough action  effects to make me like this one
Jul 5 2020,positive,its pure cheese but cheesy fun i will take that any day over the self serious view obscured characterless messes we have gotten in recent years
Jun 29 2020,positive,i dont care what anyone says godzilla was a very good movie it was exciting and when godzilla arrived to manhattan it was fun however the acting with some actors was a little off but still roland emmerich did a well job i give the guy some credit
Jun 19 2020,negative,what a terrible movie the whole thing was just like vomit     what a disgrace to the godzilla franchise
Jun 7 2020,positive,i found the movie to be quite entertaining  while others may decry its departure from the original godzilla concept i found the acting  story and cinematography quite entertaining  yes it was quite campy in certain areas but that just added to the entertainment value  dont believe the disparaging comments this is a very entertaining movie
May 23 2020,positive,the first time i watched this movie was on video tape i loved it very much i still re watch every now and then and never get bored
May 18 2020,positive,i really enjoy the 1998 movie godzilla i do think its a pretty underrated movie i find it entertaining i personally think its a pretty gooddecent movie i am a fan of matthew broderick hes a very good actor hes very good in the flick where him and the rest of the guys in the team is trying to attack the huge creature in the city of new york pretty good one in my opinion this is a movie i dont hear anyone talk about
May 15 2020,negative,the action is bad and the plot is boring this movie should have been more then what it was i find it hard to get through the effects werent too bad and godzilla looked cool not even your kids will like it sad
May 13 2020,negative,unlikable characters terrible visuals and a lack of originality its ultimately a great disrespect to the franchise
May 10 2020,negative,this ruined godzillas image
Apr 16 2020,positive,ah yesthe 1998 american version of the classic japanese monster icon when i was younger i enjoyed it i still do now as an adult but its clear that there are many flaws that prevented this movie from being so much more it is entertaining nonetheless the ending was sad because at the end of the day the monster was just a parent trying to protect his children 
Apr 11 2020,positive,the best godzilla movie lively characters good enjoyable acting and well designed godzilla what the critics said is so untrue i find the newer movies in the franchise boring compared to this matthew broderick shows great performance and the french secret agents a brilliant one of the few monster movies that one can watch repeatedly
Mar 21 2020,positive,enjoyable and easy to watch good special effects for 2014
Mar 3 2020,negative,completely inconsistent with the source material and devoid of characters with any likable qualities or logic godzilla is one dull monster movie d
Feb 24 2020,negative,nasty design of godzilla 
Feb 22 2020,positive,kids n i love dis movie its great is there a better movie
Feb 9 2020,neutral,its good for a hollywood film  bad for a godzilla movie truly gino
Feb 5 2020,negative,first time seeing this disaster of a film i can see why godzilla fans were so up in arms at the time this takes everything that godzilla represents and craps all over it what we get is a mindless story with an emotionless monster whos cgi becomes laughable several times during the movie the acting was bad to atrocious broderick was a strange choice as a lead character and shows zero range during the film i laughed so hard when they decided a human pregnancy test would work for godzilla too   the last half with the jurassic park raptorserr i mean baby godzillas was entertaining but in a campy terrible story way   i was hoping with little to no expectations that this movie would surprise me and it did i cant believe how bad it really is
Jan 27 2020,positive,i actually really enjoy this movie its rather surprising to me that people hate it in my opinion its the best of the godzilla movies 79
Jan 24 2020,negative,scenes are extremely dumb and irrational every character has an iq of a tenyearold action scenes are a mess dialogues are cheesy direction is bad just badddd and this is supposed to be the director that gave us indepdence day
Jan 22 2020,negative,hollywoods first crack at godzilla was a colossal dud  from juvenile humor to dull and bombastic action to sappy kitschy melodrama this misguided attempt by roland emmerich puts all of the directors worst tendencies front and center
Jan 21 2020,negative,this is quite possibly the worst movie ive ever seen all of the actors are just horrible and watching them interact with the low quality cgi is painful every time i thought the movie was over because it had been going on for an ungodly amount of time it somehow managed to surprise me but figuring out how to draw itself out even longer horrible wish i could give 0 stars
Jan 18 2020,negative,as a godzilla fan this left me really disappointed and it didnt really feel like a godzilla movie its nothing like godzilla at all and no atomic breath what in the actual f the reason i rated this too low is because it disrespects the original japanese design and story the acting is very bad especially in scenes that were supposed to be comedy in order for this movie to impress me is just remove the god from godzilla and then you got a decent monster movie
Jan 15 2020,positive,awesome remember people respect godzillas looks especially the one from 98
Jan 11 2020,positive,still a favorite years later
Jan 4 2020,negative,i remember watching this movie as a kid and thought it was amazing yeah it isnt     its really really bad in everything the entire movie but you know what it sure is entertaining thats why it gets a star instead of a half star
Dec 19 2019,positive,so bad its actually pretty good
Dec 14 2019,positive,dont judge me i dont know why i like this movie but i do
Dec 2 2019,negative,godzilla in its own universe
Nov 29 2019,negative,my all time top terrible movie its so bad in so many ways that one cant even be bothered to write about it captive on a bus to mexico watching this all i can remember is wondering when this horrid movie would end please dear god let this giant lizzard die  just when you think its finally dead and your misery has come to a merciful end it comes back to life and not just for five more minutes but another half hour of mind numbing soul destroying dino carnage one could torture people by playing this on repeat now that i think about it i was treated to this on my plane trip just before the bus ride no wonder i have such fond memories of this disaster on film  a real tour de force dont miss it
Nov 16 2019,positive,i do not care what anyone says i love this movie  lots of action entertaining and good effects for 1998 give it a watch and form your own opinion
Nov 6 2019,negative,just awful jean reno is slumming in this grade z remake and how did mathew broderick ever have a career his nerd schtick is as insufferable as it is egregious with the exception of ferris bueller i tolerate him at best this movie is something to be endured rather than enjoyed
Oct 30 2019,negative,gives godzillas revenge serious competition as worst godzilla movie
Oct 26 2019,negative,godzilla tries to use annoying character tropes that are just as thin as the script to make this very poorly plotted and executed monster movie stay afloat  the plot can just be told as godzilla stomps all over new york city for an hour or two and for some people that might sound fine but the action and cgi are horribly outdated and anything that could be remotely entertaining is weighed down to the depths of the deep blue sea by the crummy characters
Oct 22 2019,negative,to everyone who said godzilla king of the monsters is crap this movie is still way way worse  ferris bueller leon the professional and several of the voice actors from the simpsons save new york from a giant marine iguana and the ending theme is a terrible puff daddy song that sampled led zeppelins kashmir
Oct 21 2019,negative,this movie is really awful
Oct 18 2019,negative,this is not godzilla this totally disrespects the japanese character of the same name
Oct 10 2019,negative,i heard some rumors about this movie sucks 
Oct 7 2019,positive,for 1998 this movie definitely did its thing compared to all the other godzilla movies that have come since 1998 this one tops them all frankly storylines about supersized monsters dont need to be over complicated they sell themselves 
Oct 5 2019,negative,roland emmerich took the god out of godzilla even if you werent grading this movie as a godzilla movie it would still suck with all the bad acting wooden characters repetitive action and horrible dialogue 110
Sep 15 2019,positive,a good monster movie with an intense story lots of action good humor this movie would be a hit except one small thing its called godzilla the monster in this movie is an insult to godzilla i can see why japan was offended once you past the whole bad naming of the monster it is a very enjoyable movie
Sep 8 2019,positive,well the rating on this movie is no surprise the 1998 godzilla was defiantly box office fail as far as movies go but was it really a bad movie sure godzilla dies from a few fighter jets and doesnt look anything like the real king heck he was even renamed zilla taking the god out of his name however the movie itself isnt that bad and before you go flinging your drinks and popcorn at the screen let me explain why yes the characters arent the best but they arent terrible and yes zilla is an atrocity as far as the look of godzilla goes but hes not a bad monster and yes the baby zillas are jurassic park raptor ripoffs but theyre kinda cool tristars godzilla isnt a good godzilla movie but its an ok monster movie godzilla fans need to lay off a little hate for this movie and get past theyre first reactions besides this movie gave rise the awesome tv show godzilla the series which was way better than this and used this godzilla making him more like the real king of the monsters    
Sep 4 2019,positive,its enjoyable but its not quite the godzilla i remember
Aug 26 2019,negative,the problem is that the mutated iguana is named godzilla
Aug 22 2019,negative,one of the worst godzilla movies ever made toho summed this movie up beautifully they took the god out of godzilla
Aug 19 2019,positive,most certainly not the best godzilla film but there are a few good moments and i still enjoy it in the so bad that its good kinda way
Aug 17 2019,negative,oh ya its bad the acting horrid the special effects brutal and a story that makes no sense at all but its now in the cult classic category for how bad it is so every so often ill watch it 
Aug 16 2019,positive,pure popcorn 90s fun love it
Aug 8 2019,positive,the best godzilla film i have seen great actors acting funny film great scenes and good cinematography 45 stars out of 5
Jul 29 2019,neutral,the focus of this movie was not to make a monster movie rather to compete with jurassic park and to make godzilla not a monster but an animal and toho hated it so much they forced the team of this movie to rename godzilla zilla and eventually killed him off     but i do like the design
Jul 26 2019,negative,this movie avoided all source material granite the only source material is goodwill shows up smashes buildings and other monsters but is that so hard to recreate
Jul 14 2019,negative,shaky cam strobes and a director who seemingly waved his arms randomly making grunting noises
Jul 12 2019,negative,why this was absolutely garbage this with out a doubt gets an f
Jul 4 2019,negative,negative stars if it was possible nothing remotely resembling godzilla in sound shape appearance mythos or personality nor the spirit of any prior godzilla movie movie should have been titled completelrandom monster
Jun 29 2019,positive,im just going to go ahead and say it i dont think this movie is as bad as everyone says it is yes its cheesy yes they changed the design of godzilla a lot but honestly i dont care too much the characters are a lot more relatable and cheerful than in a lot of other godzilla movies and i saw the more realistic approach they were trying to give godzilla the effects werent too bad for the time either but i do understand why people hate this film so much i think it just depends on what your tastes are for whether you want to watch this movie or not but i dont think its horrible its up to you what your opinion is
Jun 27 2019,negative,oh godzilla how the mighty have fallen its incredibly inept that you have to watch it to believe its so unbelievable your eyes cant fathom it the militarys not too keen with how they destroy godzilla let alone they blow up everything for shock value the main characters arent interesting the main antagonist is an asexual predator and to think from getting to one ocean to the opposite ocean in a matter of days it is far better you would think that jaws the revenge could do to top it all with godzilla doesnt look like godzilla they shouldve called it something else since he looked like an iguana id prefer to call this iguanadon and it would be a better movie its so dumb founded that i cant comprehend it avoid this train wreck
Jun 26 2019,negative,there is one reason this is two stars and not half a star the monster design is good for a monster but not for a godzilla design and there are also the baby ginos gino is godzilla in name only are clearly supposed to be like the raptors from jurassic park the acting is pretty bad most of the time they just stand there with their mouth open
Jun 20 2019,negative,what in the seven hells was tristar doing in there this movie is a total mess the plot is unorganized the story is poorly written the characters are super unlikeable and godzillas apperal is so bad i cant even call this a proper godzilla movie the whole movie feels less like a godzilla movie and way more like jurassic park it looks like a cheep lowbudget ripoff of a dinosaur movie and to this day 21 years later im still pissed what roland emmerich offered to me
Jun 18 2019,negative,godzilla looks more like he was made with cheap straws and cardboard than with professional artists its so bad that the original creator of godzilla probably wasnt invited to the screening out of fear of embarrassment  
Jun 11 2019,positive,love love love this movie  jaja i know its not the real godzilla and everyone hates it but i dont  i love zillas look i love how clever he is and the story and the jokes and everything me is entertained every single time i watch it
Jun 7 2019,positive,its the worst movie ever but its also the best movie ever
Jun 7 2019,negative,horrible terrible absolutely horrible 
Jun 7 2019,positive,they tired there best to make a godzilla movie  
Jun 3 2019,negative,what a load of rubbish and the worst part is godzilla doesnt even look like godzilla so why call it godzilla call it giant iguanavelociraptor hybrid or something else 
Jun 3 2019,negative,remember this movie ya its still bad
Jun 2 2019,negative,this new direction for the godzilla franchise farfetched to it more as a disaster film but do appreciate its familiar atmosphere
May 29 2019,negative,what were they thinking
May 27 2019,positive,this movie may be disappointing to some but growing up it was an amazing film that combined the godzilla films with the beauty of jurassic park i loved every act whilst there are some cheesy moments in the acting department and the cgi isnt where it shouldve been its a godzilla movie its suppost to be cheesy i recommend this for people who want to sit down and watch a fun movie
May 25 2019,negative,not a great movie absolutely terrible 
May 25 2019,negative,1998s godzilla has really cool buildup but the payoff comes across as either lame or cheap
May 23 2019,negative,whos idea was this let me at them 
May 20 2019,negative,this film is so bad that makes toho liked to blow zilla in kingdom come on godzilla final wars well at least it has a good soundtrack and running greek surname gags
May 17 2019,negative,i might have liked it when i was little very little
May 14 2019,negative,the worst remake of all time
Apr 21 2019,negative,it takes a lot of elements of jurassic park series like zilla having lots of kids and she can be taken out by missiles and doesnt breathe atomic breath and 1 more thing shes a mutated iguana not a mutated trex
Apr 8 2019,negative,did the director found the storyline in the trash or somethin
Mar 23 2019,negative,it has a good soundtrack too bad the movie is garbage it is dull without either good action or logic the characters are poorly acted generic and clueless the effects were weak the monster looked lame and the execution has really stupid dont waste your time and money watching this junk
Mar 16 2019,negative,trying too hard to recapture the magic of both jurassic park and independence day having effects that im sure were revolutionary at the time but now come off looking outdated and clumsily handled case in point gino keeps changing size just because the action sequences require that to be the case flat acting with the notable exception of jean reno unexciting action and the most hilariously unsubtle take that critics youll ever see  shouldve killed them man if youve already gone to the trouble of portraying roger ebert as a buffoon of a mayor and gene siskel as his asskissing sidekick  godzilla 98 just might be the definitive low point of roland emmerichs film career though this did introduce a lot of people who lived outside of japan to the original kaiju flicks so i guess this piece of trash was good for something
Mar 14 2019,positive,godzilla 7 out of 10 godzilla or someone pretending to be godzilla attacks new york and only matthew brodrick and the french secret service can save the big apple     this is not the worst godzilla film ever made not by a long shot the lack of endless little boys in short pants put this effort ahead of much of the filmography overall it is an entertaining if often painfully dated film like three kings after the second iraq war godzilla today is a different viewing experience with todays eyes     let us ask and answer some questions    were special effects really that bad during the nineties you know i am unclear on that as well i always thought the dinosaurs in jurassic park looked really good and that was five years earlier than this film in 1993 and the matrix came out only a year later than this in 1999 i recently resaw godzilla in 4k streaming on netflix and yikes should have gone with a guy in the suit    why did they redesign godzilla the story is they wanted to make her more realistic honestly the new one is even sillier i mean to support that kind of weight you are going to need big thighs it just looks all kinds of wrong and the movie doesnâtmt help matters by having her seemingly change size throughout the film    the look is not the worse thing mind you it is godzillas new specialâ iâtmm going with ability she is apparently a master at hide and seek yes the 278 foot five hundred ton godzilla plays peek a boo with the american army the movie really tries to sell this hard it does not work     wasnâtmt it was nice of those helicopters to fly low enough for godzilla to eat them i know right i mean their regular flying ceiling is twenty thousand feet but let us fly at 100 feet between buildings that btw look nothing like manhatten     and those submarines in the hudson seemed to have an awful time trying to find her yeah i was wondering about that as well i mean the hudson and the east river are about 40 feet deep in most place i have no idea where they were even long island sound at its deepest wouldnâtmt hide godzilla facts and logic were not this films friend    overall i enjoyed my revisit with this godzilla the nostalgia was nice and i liked the fact brodericks love interest the very cute maria pitillo was probably one the evilest femme fatale in the history of movies and still takes her back at the end    it has been common recently to revisit this film and declare it not that bad i tend to agree it is not that bad not that good as well mind you but at least some form of godzilla shows up in this one
Feb 25 2019,negative,i was on a transatlantic flight in 1999 when this abomination was the in flight movieif i had a parachute jumping would have been the preferred option instead myself and a number of other passengers raided the drinks trolley
Feb 2 2019,neutral,thats a lot of fish i dont know why but i actually enjoy this movie not as a godzilla movie but as a giant monster movie if this was called zilla the movie would probably not be as hated it should have been zilla they took the god out of godzilla this is just zilla
Jan 22 2019,negative,awful characters dated 90s talk and a disrespectful reimagining for the king of monsters make godzilla 1998 feel like a project nobody really gave a shit about
Jan 12 2019,negative,mightve had some traction if theyd simply titled it gigaiguana or something
Jan 5 2019,negative,there is nothing here to recommend absolutely nothing this wasnt godzilla this was just any old generic monster attacking manhattan all the human characters were absolute morons matthew broderick spends most of the movie with his eyes bugged out and mouth hanging open the effects were surprisingly bad for a post jurassic park movie you would expect better and what was with all the rain
Dec 28 2018,negative,due to the horrible design of godzilla we forget how godzilla look like at first  tristars did a bad job in godzilla
Dec 11 2018,negative,this stupid piece of shit film was insulting to watch for godzilla fans that giant creature was totally not godzilla it was just zilla completely unworthy of having god in its name this was just a stupid ripoff of jurassic park the worst godzilla movie of all time and the worst liveaction monster movie ever made i absolutely hate the way godzilla was treated and portrayed in this atrocity his cgi design even sucked he looked like a dinosaur from jurassic park godzilla looked awful i hate matthew brodericks character and his dumb characters stupid annoying exgirlfriend theyre names arent even important thats how horrible and unlikable the characters really are i honestly wanted matthew broderick and maria pitillos characters to die i hated them so much they were annoying unlikable and obnoxious people who like this godawful movie are morons its beyond me how anyone can like this dumpster juice fire it should have so much lower than that this is one of the worst movies i have ever watched godzilla ends up getting killed by four missiles at the end four missiles alone were enough to kill him in this stupid movie i hate this movie so much i wish every dvd bluray disc and vhs of this trash film was incinerated this movie is literally garbage and should not be seen by anyone every copy of this garbage movie needs to be burned asap    rating 0710
Nov 12 2018,neutral,godzilla is anything you wish it to be cheesy camp atrocious b movie with a movie budget it depends on the circumstances you see it in as a kid i loved it and it always reminds me of late 90s nostalgia but now that one sees it they see what a flawed one this is for starters the whole film seems to be either aping or paying tribute to the then recent jurassic park the lead played by mathew broderick is a wimp and the leading lady was so bad i dont remember anything about her expect that she was a tv journalist of sorts the effects of godzilla romping through nyc are decentespecially for the time but this isnt anything special nowadays still if you want to watch a monster movie this can be given a shot

Mar 20 2018,negative,why does this even exist
Mar 11 2018,negative,i would like to say that godzilla 1998 was bad godzilla movie with no heart lets be crystal clear here godzillas design had to be accurate godzilla should look like godzilla no excuses
Jan 29 2018,negative,i really wanted time to kinder to this movie since i havent seen it in almost 20 years i love broderick and jean reno and even though they got the spirit of godzilla totally wrong he still looks cool for the most part the baby godzillas thought nope too much like the raptor scenes from jurassic park reading the interviews with emmerich prove he was completely wrong for the job devlin didnt help matters but he shouldve been the bigger voice here since he at least understood the material godzilla is probably japans most popular and beloved export hollywood did not pick the right people because said people didnt love godzilla in 2014 they finally got it right
Jan 28 2018,negative,a shame to the fan community zilla this is no god
Jan 13 2018,negative,running woud be a good idea    godzilla     it seems like a parody of the jurassic park and that too not funny or in a good way its a no go from the first frame to the last even though they may try to make it convoluted it is not
Nov 23 2017,negative,meh godzilla looked like a trex from jurassic park the story was weak and the baby godzillas were another ripoff from the jp velociraptors 
Sep 19 2017,negative,terrible cgi   terrible plot  terrible creature  terrible idea  ok soundtrack  d
Jul 28 2017,negative,some might call it a mixed bag but let me tell you what kind of mixed bag its a trash bag thats had a bad day like say your mom cleans out the cat litter fresh and stale doody pebbles go right in the bottom of the bag and then your sister throws out her used tampons and where do they go in the same bag and then your brother comes home drunk just upchucks pukes right into the bag now im not trying to be disgusting but that is a realistic situation and what it all comes down to thats a nasty bag
May 2 2017,neutral,what a stupid movie if you want to see dinosaurs chasing people then watch jurassic park

Apr 15 2017,positive,its just a fun block buster
Apr 9 2017,negative,not even a godzilla movie looks nothing like godzilla maybe if they named it something else it would have been better like zilla its not worthy of god
Apr 1 2017,positive,the best godzilla movie by far a little corn thrown in purposely fun
Mar 24 2017,positive,since the original godzilla is waaay before my time im pretty loyal to the 98 version i loved this movie and despite the terrible lighting its horribly dark throughout the movie   i think this godzilla is much better than the original the japanese original was cheesy and unappealing to me i couldnt even get through 10 minutes of the original instead of looking like a mutated lizard looks more like a fat guy in a mutant teddy bear suit i know its from the 50s though i think the 90s godzilla was more believable and more appealing i know the original has one hell of a cult following and thats why most people were not open to it but i still love the 98 godzilla i think to say it was complete crap is unfair especially considering that the 90s version does have a following as well i think its good that someone improved on the design but if someone thinks its crap their welcome to go back to the original
Mar 19 2017,positive,the godzilla looked like a overgrown trex  but everything else like dialogues and performances from actors were good
Mar 17 2017,negative,this movie is shit dont watch it
Feb 10 2017,negative,start my weekend by rewatch this again unironically this is the first godzilla movie i ever seen back in the day  yes sure it is not a godzilla movie but as  a standalone monster movie it still has its own merits   the first 30 minutes is entertaining and the rest of it just a jurassic park independence day knockoff
Dec 15 2016,positive,i really did like this movie
Dec 9 2016,negative,absolute shit almost ruined godzilla thank god for godzilla 2000 acting is poor and bland plot is meh godzilla sorry its just zilla not worthy of god doesnt even represent himself here its just eyecandy thats boring forgettable and almost raped godzilla and toho what an absolute anal atom bomb of a film

Oct 24 2016,positive,godzilla lives up to the energy and excitement ive always saw it as
Oct 18 2016,negative,would love it if godzilla was the real godzilla and they didnt die so easily  they just roped off jurassic park
Sep 10 2016,negative,itll make you want godzilla to destroy your tv instead of nyc
Sep 5 2016,negative,you need to fix the title of the movie    and when hank azaria is the most entertaining part of a movie with so many big namesthats horrid  loud and unnecessary movie
Sep 3 2016,negative,people said that the 2014 film didnt have enough godzilla this one however was lacking one completely
Aug 16 2016,negative,what a bad americanized look at a franchise that meant everything to my childhood
Aug 7 2016,negative,this started off well with some humor  then when you see godzilla the film is ruined  it continues to be entertaining but it should have been called something else  this is not godzilla  this is a movie about a giant asexual lizard that hatches velociraptors
Jul 5 2016,neutral,ehhh matthew broderick has a not so great performance
Jul 4 2016,positive,oh hail the one the only zilla
Jul 3 2016,negative,this movie is more like jurassic park theme than godzilla and is a disgraceful to the source material has no respect no love and no justice for the original godzilla heck godzilla 2014 did more justice than godzilla 1998 does    grade f
Jun 20 2016,negative,ferris bueller youre not my hero dear sweet baby jesus this was a bad movie the lead track from the soundtrack was a p diddy rap sampling led zeppelins kashmir song that even was laughable godzilla terrorizes new york city we find out he is really a she dont make fun or pc principal will get you builds a nest in madison square garden and has babies that are like jurassic park velociraptors this movie is so so so bad
Jun 5 2016,negative,this film is so bad i know its meant to be good but seriously i wouldnt die to see this film godzilla starts okay but then carries on horribly wrong i would rate this film no stars if i could not kidding dorset is a lovely holiday for me but watching the film made me sick and i mean literally i was sick before anyway dont watch this film as its so bad
Jun 1 2016,positive,not exactly everything id look for in a typical godzilla movie but a decent story and awesome design
May 20 2016,positive,good movie and good effects
May 14 2016,negative,dean devlin and roland emmerich followed up their huge success with independence day with this weak american remakereboot of godzilla the film starts out promising with scientist matthew broderick being scooped up by the government to help them investigate the effects of radiation on what is likely a new monstrous creature the cast is solid with jean reno maria pitillo hank azaria kevin dunn michael lerner harry shearer vicki lewis nancy cartwright richard gant and my favorite 80s90s stuntman al leong and you even have gretchen mol in an uncredited role as a reporter however the film is a real slog at nearly two and a half hours when this film came out it was a direct attempt to show up jurassic park with an even bigger dinosaur creature and took the same serious tone i think where devlin and emmerich went wrong is that they forgot the playful tone they brought to the action and adventure they had in their previous films like stargate and independence day emmerich is a solid action director but hes no spielberg maybe if this film was edited down to a tight 90 minutes it may have worked better
May 13 2016,negative,a laughable attempt to bring a great japanese icon to the american audiences
Apr 18 2016,negative,godzilla is huge and destroys everything in his path but apparently he can live in sewers
Apr 8 2016,positive,i like that movie not that bad i really like the movie atmosphere
Apr 3 2016,negative,thats a lot of fish
Mar 23 2016,negative,why was this even made
Mar 22 2016,negative,cashing in on and blatantly ripping off the megasuccessful jurassic park roland emmerichs film is an insulting transmogrification of the original godzilla parable into one of historys least engaging disaster films
Mar 9 2016,negative,this is one of guilty free movies that i enjoy  the story is cliche so what  godzilla looks like the trex so what  baby godzilla looks like velociraptors from jurassic park so what  i like this movie
Feb 28 2016,negative,in my opinion this is the worst godzilla film godzillas revenge has one entertaining quality how stupid it is this movie contains creature that has no relation to godzilla crappy cgi meh acting and godzilla gets killed by missiles
Feb 13 2016,negative,the batman and robin of godzilla movies complete with a monster who lacks   with the exception of his 160 foot stature nearly every one of his iconic characteristics physical or behavioral top that off with pisspoor performances from matthew broderick who i normally like and maria pitillo brainless popcultural references siskel and ebert star wars the simpsons and scenarios and images borrowed from the far superior jurassic park franchise and you get a motion picture that will disappoint godzilla fans critics and frankly all but the most undiscerning filmgoers
Feb 11 2016,negative,f    terrible movie
Feb 8 2016,negative,hey i got a much better title for this film stzilla
Feb 6 2016,negative,a little bit of prehistoric fun
Jan 31 2016,negative,totell copy of of jurassic parks
Jan 23 2016,negative,i remember watching this flick as a kid during the late 90s and i really liked however as a grown adult who watched this film again i was very disappointed by how godzilla was this wasnt godzilla at all this was just a crappy rip off to a nostalgic franchise hell the 2014 flick is awesome despite some flaws yet it superbly surpasses this film
Jan 22 2016,negative,tried to be jurassic park ended up as more plan 9 from outer space
Jan 15 2016,negative,how bad can a movie get
Jan 11 2016,negative,what a shitfest of a movie this is pure popcorn with plots from jurassic park the beast from 20000 phatoms and independence day all rehashed into one huge piece of crap that for no reason whats or ever is called godzilla
Dec 14 2015,positive,yes its corny formulaic overdramatic and makes about as much as sense as hiring a worm guy to fight a huge radiation monster its also lots of fun
Dec 13 2015,neutral,not as good as it should of been very little to remember but a few nice shots of new york destruction the cast were boring and godzilla wasnt as fierce as it should of been and it was too predictable that it was hard to really enjoy but they did try a few new ideas like the babies but they werent much of a threat to really take seriously its worth a watch but you will feel let down more than wowed
Dec 9 2015,negative,terrible drawn out plot with countless gratuitous clichés jurassic park wanabe
Dec 9 2015,negative,a piece of shit of a godzilla film its just an insult to the original godzilla
Nov 21 2015,negative,having seen the japanese godzilla movies and even the 2014 hollywood remake i can safely say this movie is a blight on humanity i can definitely see what they were going for and the hype behind it was insane back in 98 but it just failed in almost every possible way almost no redeeming qualities to speak of ill give you one thing though jean reno is in it thats about all it has going for it if you need your godzilla fix and dont want to watch the old japanese movies check out godzilla 2014 it does a much better job
Nov 18 2015,positive,great movie exceptional special effects
Nov 8 2015,negative,plain awful i say his design is basically a giant mutated female trexhello that is not godzillaweird details are everywhere such as how zilla can fit into a subway tunnel but not a regular tunnel that is much largerand why is he so tiny if size does matter
Oct 22 2015,negative,matthew broderick sucks
Oct 18 2015,positive,not as memorable or as classic as the original but it is still a fun movie to watch
Oct 12 2015,positive,i love this godzilla 90s film
Sep 24 2015,negative,weak effects poor acting and story with a terrible pandering to the jurassic park fanbase
Sep 16 2015,positive,classic fun 90s action blockbuster nothing outstanding some much needed comedy relief dotted throughout the action sequences that held onto the last thread of my attention matthew broderick is a cutie the other characters are forgettable
Sep 14 2015,negative,mathew broderick killed two people this movie killed my soul
Aug 24 2015,positive,it messed up the character really really bad but this movie is more of a popcorn movie rather than a serious movie
Aug 21 2015,negative,it was the worst movie ever it sucks i had to walk out after 1 hour
Aug 12 2015,negative,this is not a godzilla movie it was not made by toho and the acting is terrible do not watch this
Aug 9 2015,positive,liked it if i recall correctly
Jul 26 2015,negative,this is a really stupid movie but i guess one could try to enjoy it if they think of it simply as a popcorn movie sold tickets but it lacks in quality why couldnt this live up to the fun provided in independence day    the first thing this film lacks is a solid cast the only actor i really liked in this film was jean reno and i guess since his character was quirky matthew broderick did an okay job i cannot stand the actress who played audrey nor the character itself her character has no depth whatsoever and seems to be placed into this movie simply as a love interest to nick broderick she is a really stupid character asking bluntly if nick is still mad for her leaving him crying like a baby seriously it is so childish when nick leaves after she steals his tape and offering the least sincere apology i have ever seen and why are there 3 or 4 simpsons voice actors in the cast hank azarias character can be funny at moments but he definitely does not belong in this action flick    the cgi looks really bad which is disappointing since independence days effects didnt look too bad thats all i have to say on that aspect    as for the pace of the film while this movie brings godzilla into play sooner than the more recent version this movie is overly long for a monster movie it takes forever for the movie to get to the second big fight with godzilla where they fight him in the waters of manhattan this could have happened 30 minutes earlier and the film would have been on a good pace but this movie insisted on playing things slow between each action sequence though the action sequences can be long especially when they get to madison square garden and somewhat fun to watch however if you examine the sequence with the babies hatching and attacking nick and crew it rips off a lot of shots of the velociraptors in jurassic park the only difference is that these dinosaurlike creatures are taller    this movie had potential but fell very flat compared to that potential i wish i could laugh at this movie like other bad movies but to me this movie was just plain bad
Jul 18 2015,negative,rating 23  godzilla has poor performances from the cast fakelooking cg and a silly plot that fails to reignite the spark of the long dormant franchise
Jul 16 2015,negative,there is not one single positive thing that i can sincerely comment on about this film this is easily roland emmerichs worst film to date the cast of actors try to make the best out of this situation but they never had true direction to succeed in addition the screenplay and writing only get worse and worse the further one gets into the film i could go into more depth about how little this film makes sense but then again i that needs to be said is this godzilla is a giant mutated komodo dragon
Jul 2 2015,negative,i had to reedit this movie to 53minutes in order to make it enjoyable i took out all the ferris beuler zoomins the ebert character the news storyline the eggsmother story and most of the wisecracks since it is most of the dialog just bad joke piled onto bad joke there are a lot of topdown helicopter shots but i left them in i also put the original godzilla theme back in and removed that horrible puff daddyled zeppelin song at the credits  still if youre willing to do the work i did its a watchable movie but i would never wish someone to watch the real edit until i hated them
Jul 1 2015,positive,i dont understand the hate for this movie i for one think its a great summer blockbuster monster movie this movie doesnt get a 5 star rating for me because theres one problem wrong wit the film and thats matthew broderick hes a horrible actor to me and i didnt buy his chemistry with his ex girlfriend but other than that i really enjoyed the film and fuck all the assholes that dont godzilla rules
Jun 30 2015,negative,the idea that this film could be in the least bit good is mindblowing this film takes everything anyone may have loved about godzilla and throws it out the window the action is bland the plot is nonexistent and the characters are downright unlikable except for jean renos character everyone else i wouldnt mind if they got stepped on
Jun 29 2015,positive,i like it as zilla if i view it as godzilla it did everything wrong but as zilla its a pretty decent monster movie
Jun 19 2015,negative,its 2015 im still trying to recover from this garbage
Jun 18 2015,positive,not great but i cannot say that i didnt enjoy the movie
Jun 15 2015,negative,what a waste of effort
Jun 10 2015,positive,this movie is my guilty pleasure loved the ending on the brooklyn bridge
May 31 2015,positive,i love this when i was 5 years old and i still love it now people need to relax about this movie honestly if it wasnt called godzilla people would enjoy it more
May 28 2015,negative,interesting movie but not a good film this godzilla was not well thought out
May 28 2015,negative,its so bad its laughable i was extremely disappointed i grew up watching all of the old ones and i loved them so when this came out i was stocked and then i saw ithuge disappointment
May 26 2015,negative,i dont know why im giving it one star i dont even know if theres anything i liked about it its batman  robin bad
May 13 2015,negative,great special effects but what a crappy overall movie
May 9 2015,positive,ok movie and have to wait 1 hour to see godzilla matthew broderick does a great job and makes this movie ok godzilla himself looks super fake too much cgi just like the japanese version but in english hope that theirs ni sequel
May 9 2015,neutral,despite this movies flaws i actually enjoyed it how did i enjoy it exactly easy i didnt think of it as a serious godzilla movie i just thought of it as a silly little monster movie the characters for the most part are tolerable and there are some laughs to be found in this flick if you arent a godzilla fan you wont enjoy this movie but if your just a guy looking for a monster movie to watch on a rainy day you will like it
Apr 30 2015,positive,they dont come much bigger and louder than godzilla though not the special effects spectacle it once was roland emmerichs creature disaster movie remains a severely flawed but thoroughly entertaining popcorn movie that might be the sort of thing thats nominated for razzie awards several in fact but its also the sort of thing people go to see in droves at the end of the day its just fine for what it is and wants to be and in that light godzilla is a success on its own playing field
Apr 26 2015,negative,besides the beautiful line thats a lot of fish delivered by matthew broderick the 1998 godzilla movie doesnt have much left to offer making it one of the most boring monster movies ever made
Apr 12 2015,negative,where to startlol half the cast of the simpsons ferris bueller just mailing in a nerdy performance and a stuttering army sergeant the beast looking like a giant iguana lizard with no atomic breath the military just blowing sãâ up while constantly missing their target certain gags played off with a wa wa wa waaa kind of tone maybe it could be so bad its good still avoid watching this waste of potential
Apr 6 2015,negative,dreadful script cartoonish supporitng actorr performances and the failure to establish godzilla as either a threat to be destroyed or a misunderstood marvel of evolution      and when they kill the young onesgodzilla becomes the only sympathetic character in the movie      added bonus the soundtrack is horrible
Apr 3 2015,negative,silly unintelligent and scientifically inaccurate all mixed at once roland emmerichs take on godzilla proves that the godzilla franchise might have hit a new low
Mar 26 2015,positive,this is a remake that is better then the original this is the best godzilla movie this have got to be the best scenes fiction movie i have ever seen see it it will blow your mind
Mar 25 2015,neutral,i liked this movie much more after watching all the godzilla movies besides godzilla himself  or in this case herself  the movie is more loyal to the franchise than the 2014 movie many of the things critics complain about are things borrowed from the toho godzilla sequels if youre expecting a remake of the 1964 movie youll be very disappointed this monster retains enough of godzillas traits to consider it a downgrade of the real godzilla everything is there just on a much smaller scale its a fun monster movie with no real ambition nothing more nothing less its made for people who wanted to see more trex destruction in jurassic park 2
Mar 22 2015,negative,i cant stand it any longer couldnt even finish this one not just bad but nearly fraudulent
Mar 20 2015,negative,needs no explanation it sucked thats a lot of fish
Mar 14 2015,positive,very much an epic family adventure of sorts that focuses much on the human scientists and particularly the military on how to defeat the famous giant lizard
Mar 1 2015,positive,this godzilla should be watched with a sense of humor for sure
Feb 14 2015,negative,clunky and silly  even godzilla deserves better than this heavy on special fx mess
Jan 29 2015,negative,the action is pretty fantastic but the story is a long way removed from its allegorical beginning full review later
Jan 16 2015,negative,an american attempt at a japanese classic emmerich has completely missed on the significance of the original story and aims for thrills and effects albeit typical for emmerich
Jan 10 2015,positive,please let me see it
Jan 9 2015,negative,awful movie a disgrace to the japanese version of godzilla this is roland emmerichs worst movie not even unintentionally hilarious
Jan 8 2015,positive,overall best in my eyes
Jan 1 2015,negative,dont worry gfans the real godzilla got his revenge in 2004
Dec 30 2014,negative,most mediocre film ever
Dec 21 2014,negative,that is a lot of fish
Dec 16 2014,negative,glorifies killing of animals and things we dont understand silly plot and silly acting there are better movies out there
Dec 9 2014,negative,im on a roll with these roland emmerich films now  any who as ive previously stated in some of my other reviews im not the one to rage on films or hold grudges against directors while ive enjoyed many of emmerichs films this one strikes me as being particularly bad i like monster movies especially in large cities but this movie is just really fking stupid i would like someone to explain to me how the hell you lose track of a massive mutated lizard hell spawn in a city of 8 million people or how highly trained military folks are worse shots than stormtroopers at literally point blank range against a target the size of a building  how  aside from that the story lacks any tension and logic in general im a fan of popcorn films but this one had me questioning its logic way too often for me to be absorbed into the plot the acting was okay and the computer effects were at about the same level jurassic park made big dino monsters look real in 93 but whatever  this movie aint too good not gonna rage on it being that all it is is a movie but damn is it stupid as hell
Nov 28 2014,negative,the movie was horrid but you gotta love the godzilla in this movie
Nov 20 2014,negative,terrible acting terrible effect terrible plot terrible everything this movie take the greatest movie monster of all time and turns him into a chicken legged boxed jawed no atomic breath breathing piece of crap
Nov 5 2014,negative,horrible godzilla film  should be renamed giant iguana and i it would be 112 stars
Oct 27 2014,negative,stupid and filled with cliches godzillas first american movie surprises audiences with the fact that its possible to fall asleep during a monster flick
Oct 26 2014,positive,heavy action kept me locked and loaded and ready to go off at any moment
Oct 25 2014,positive,honestly i think this is highly underrated     this coming from a hardcore fan of the originals they shouldve went ahead with the sequel they planned for this     this isnt classic godzilla obviously but its a nice new perspective on him
Oct 24 2014,negative,godzilla is trash and if anyone tells ya otherwise theyre lying to ya
Oct 21 2014,positive,for all its campy faults its soooo much better than the 2014 version thats for sure
Oct 18 2014,positive,i would never defend this as a godzilla movie because it isnt one as long as you feel a certain nostalgia for the conventions of 1990s action films less gritty charmingly not quite reallooking computergenerated effects lots of not quite funny but not quite not funny dialogue a shoehornedin impossibletoapplytoreallife environmentalist message i think its entirely possible to enjoy godzilla 1998 on its own terms    
Oct 16 2014,negative,if i would not have been smack in the middle of the movie theater at the time i would have ran out and went and seen deep impact again i didnt like deep impact either
Oct 10 2014,negative,roland emmerich really turned the godzilla franchise to rot by making this film it consists of a bucketload of lazy acting and a poorly written storyline
Oct 6 2014,negative,not only is the entire concept nothing like the original godzilla it looks nothing like godzilla as a godzilla fan this disappointed me very much
Oct 4 2014,negative,oh you mean zilla it was dinosaur turd
Oct 4 2014,positive,if not for the fact they butchered godzilla and cast a horrible crew and maybe didnt spend much time with the special effects music acting arguably plot and possible even the direction this is rather a good film
Sep 29 2014,negative,a travesty a crime a holocaust
Sep 22 2014,negative,my god what a bloated piece of crap
Sep 21 2014,negative,not a very strong plot and it all falls apart when you actually see godzilla even if the visual effects are good which they are
Sep 17 2014,negative,the legendary gojira is reduced to a poorlyrendered cgi firebreathing iguana
Sep 3 2014,negative,28  loud incoherent and largely dull godzilla is a sizable flop
Aug 24 2014,negative,godzilla is a strange experience to sit through and once it was over i wasnt quite sure what to make of it to start the first half of the movie is very so bad its good not smog monster levels but just enough to be fun this part feels like a bad friends knock off from the late 90s that coincidentally also involves a giant monster attacking new york if you think that sounds hilarious then were in the same boat sadly this movie jumps off that boat in the next half first theres a lot of dumb stuff to laugh at everyone falling for matthew broderick the random siskel and ebert its all good bmovie material then when the previously mentioned second half comes in the fun goes down to zero the godzilla babies here are basically velociraptors and each scene rips off either aliens or jurrasic park two much better movies to make matters worse the movie shifts from horror to 80s comedy logic at the hit of a switch and its more frustrating than anything else basically the movie becomes a mess and never recovers from it overall it could have been a three but that mediocre finale knocks it down a score below good
Aug 22 2014,negative,this guy made independence day then made this who does this remind me of cough cough m night shamaland
Aug 20 2014,negative,never saw it in the theatres blind buy on the 4k bluray for 10  probably due in part to the hype from the 2014 godzilla  upon multiple viewings thanks to my 4yr old we got our moneys worth on this purchase  overall disappointing ride but if i could sum it up the one thing that made this film absolutely horrible isthe soundtrack  the music is just completely wrong and it creates zero suspenseatmosphere  for example at the end when the camera zooms into the last surviving egg amongst the ruins the music ishappy the entire film is riddled with this musical disaster  call it something other than godzilla and we have a mildly decent monster flick  what a shame
Aug 19 2014,negative,jean reno is the only redeemable thing about this movie
Aug 15 2014,negative,this is not godzilla roland emmerich has done a horrible job on making the movie because he is not fan of any the godzilla movies matthew broderick and jean reno were like the best human characters in the movie maria pitillo was okay but given a bad direction the acting was fine but most of them were given a bunch of bad dialogues i dont to keep going with this movie but all i got to say that this movie is not the godzilla that everyone remembers skip it
Aug 15 2014,negative,i enjoyed the rifftrax presentation of it was surprised at how incredibly awful it was as i didnt remember anything about it except the madison square garden raptors
Aug 14 2014,positive,my favorite godzilla movie of all time
Aug 9 2014,negative,terrible acting effect for its time looked nothing like godzilla the creators of the original masterpiece in 1954 hated this movie so much that they bought the rights to the monster renamed it zilla just to have the real godzilla kill it on screenthat just shows how bad the film isthe only redeeming factor is thati got nothing 11
Aug 9 2014,negative,no respect for godzillathe actors are so boring  but only the destruction scenes
Aug 6 2014,positive,i stinking love this movie and i dont care try it with mcdonalds chicken mcnuggets then tell me you dont like this movie
Aug 6 2014,negative,forgettable godzilla tries to recapture the spirit of the original but fails due to an abundance of bad cgi cliches and a surprisingly boring monster
Aug 4 2014,negative,weak human cast weak storyline subpar concept design for zilla and a huge slap in the face ending mix that in with inconsistent sub plots and asexual reproduction and an irrelevant love connection between two human characters and a bunch of baby zillas still cannot save this 1998 reimagining from blowing up in your face
Aug 3 2014,negative,i could go on and on but i will leave you with this  godzilla aka the beast from 2000000 fanthoms is pure hollywood trash    hey dean says mr emmerich why dont we make a movie that rips off everybodys favorite monster and when they walk out of the theater will say gotcha gotcha
Jul 31 2014,positive,this is a mixed bag a very mixed bag on one point i love it its a great monster movie with a cool looking monster great special effects and great destruction scenes i love the premise and feel of it and the characters however its a terrible godzilla movie its not one bit of godzilla at all its nothing close but if you look at it as its own thing its great
Jul 28 2014,negative,firebreathing monster or stupid idiotic characters   disproportionately bad effects or cutrate acting  this movie is not nearly the tribute godzilla deserved
Jul 27 2014,negative,it wasnt even godzilla the movie was cruddy it should be called zilla
Jul 25 2014,negative,had this film not been named after the legendary kaiju it would have fared better  that said the performances are all laughable the exception being the purposely funny yet stereotyped performance from jean reno  the cgi holds up very poorly and is cringe worthy to look at today
Jul 20 2014,negative,i hated this godzilla movie was it godzilla or was it just another jurassic park movie this movie is poorly constructed and idiotic
Jul 16 2014,negative,as a mindless popcorn movie its okay but as a godzilla film its awful this movie is titled godzilla purely for money the monster looks and acts nothing like godzilla and is far too weak the acting is really bad and the story is very generic had they named this movie something else it would be passable because the monster itself is pretty cool but since its called godzilla and doesnt feature godzilla it failed at everything it was trying to do
Jul 14 2014,neutral,oh come on it isnt that bad
Jul 14 2014,negative,i mean it had good special effects
Jul 11 2014,negative,welcome to creature feature week were i ethan tweeter review 7 days of movies starring animals or creatures who take over the worlddestroy a townbe nice etc the first creature feature review will be the 1998 wreck godzilla so you guys might have read my godzilla 2014 review if you havent check it out before reading this one anyway on with it this version stars matthew broderickhank azaira kevin dunn etc mrbroderick plays drniko and he falls in love with an old friend the biggest problem people have with this one is godzilla is just cgi baloney i would agree with that but however this movie is way better then godzillas revenge which i talk about someday i n creature feature week soon the characters in this flick are horrible drniko is the worst of the bunch since people will just confuse his name in a funny way like satopolus all though godzilla is a hailrious cheesy 90s film that has aged well for me at least the acting is laughable in the flick the actors do such a poor job i mostly laugh at it including hank aziaras character being the most one that gets the laughs out of me because hes so bad you cant help but laugh at him though without the movie has huge problems like first godzilla is horrible in this movie hes just a cgi mess that destroys the town less then the military does thats another problem with the film the military destroys most of the town like i said earlier the military is so dumb in this they think that godzilla eats fish like seriously he justs destroys towns and kills people with his foot then comes my favorite line from the movie quick is and i put in quotation marksthats a big pil of fish ok that line cracked me up so hard that i thought i wouldnt stop giggiling well what else there to say but i just laughed at the movie it has its really big flaws sure but its just a film that if i want a good laugh ill watch it over and over again next time its for dragon wars until tomorrow everyone
Jul 10 2014,negative,a cheesy scifi movie stuffed with cliches and jurassic park references worst of all failed to honor the the movie it paid omage to
Jul 7 2014,positive,oh man if this isnt the flat out best movie ive seen in a while man the new godzilla is nothing compared to this masterpiece in movie historycough it sucked cough yeah it was great
Jul 7 2014,positive,7 7 2014  not so bad actually
Jul 6 2014,negative,one of the worst movies ever made does godzilla no justice
Jul 4 2014,positive,this was a great movie what was wrong with this movie
Jun 29 2014,negative,the worst remake of all time
Jun 29 2014,neutral,this movie has nothing to do with godzilla in both technical and thematical levels but as a standalone monster movie theres some brainless spectacle to enjoy still that doesnt save this reboot from being a complete dissapointment for hardcore fans of the japanesse series
Jun 28 2014,negative,this movie sucks roland emmerich has given us a lot of boring to terrible films after indendence day and this is no exception the acting is bland the story is cheap theres no terrifying build up the effects rip off jurassic park and its not even a godzilla film in comparison to the 1954 original the only credit i give to this film is the awesome rage against the machine song on the soundtrack but it still isnt enough to help make this film any better
Jun 22 2014,negative,me quick say everything you know about godzilla   you he breathes fire he is a tall and skinny lizard he cant be destroyed by missiles or bullets  me well if you were expecting any of that from this movie youre going to be very very very disappointed
Jun 21 2014,negative,a goddamn waste of time i rather watch the new godzilla instead of this shit
Jun 20 2014,negative,this movie has more to do with the simpsons than it does about godzilla  i wish i was kidding
Jun 17 2014,positive,graphics wasnt good enough
Jun 16 2014,negative,this film is a horrific assed up excuse of a film the cgi was terrible the acting was awful and the whole thing was cliche the monster didnt even look like godzilla roland emmerich messed up horribly with this film plus it felt more like jurassic park this film is proof that roland emmerich hated japanese culture
Jun 16 2014,negative,this movie has it all  bad cgi bad acting forced morals and awful dialogue such as thats a lotta fish
Jun 15 2014,negative,babies everywhere lol oh man that was terrible not even the good kind of bad i cant help but like matthew brodericks character a bit but he really needs to get over that xgirlfriend
Jun 14 2014,negative,the dialogue is horrendous the characters are lame the special effects are laughable and the plot is filled with inconveniences and unnecessary scenes that dont add anything to the overall plot godzilla is overlong  dull and uninspired and not even mathew broderick can save this terribly written piece of cinematic trash
Jun 13 2014,positive,its a grate movie but most people hated it because it looks nothing like the japanese one and the size seems to change throughout the movie  if you like the over exaggerated low budget japanese films then you probably wont like this one but if your new to godzilla then give this a watch
Jun 10 2014,negative,this isnt even godzilla
Jun 10 2014,negative,it was somewhat of  a decent godzilla movie
Jun 8 2014,negative,okay im going to re review this thing again in a calm manner unlike last time but to all respect this is a horrible movie and very insulting to the country it came fromthere are few good things from this movie but not enough to save it though but here we go  the characters for starters are awful there not very smart dont act all that well and most are just more cliche stereotypes though one character i do like is jean reno for his very heroic feel and hey he fights for his country i was gonna say the same to matthew but due to the director who does not into character depth its kind of sad and to be honest i think he would have been good 2014 no offense aaron taylor i could say the to military and i will their dumb those the beast in ways that dont make sense and they due way more damage and are not even trying to hit him proving way before the end that you could murder him with just one pistol and how does that blind maybe but instant kill no  godzilla the character its self a force of nature a fabled horrific memory of the past the terrifying impact but yet has his own surprisingly powerful personality that makes kind of human they due not follow the monster is nothing more then a gopher like creature that destroys building all just because he cant control his waging tail while eating fish and just laying eggs while ripping off jurassic park and to less care and too little character there is no reason for him to be there worst of all they make godzilla pregnant thats by far the worst re image or concept of a character that had so was so much more that its like down right insulting they literally make jokes about it in the movie like there trying to kill the character itself   lastly the worst thing that this the movie has done is the story setting plot and the theme godzilla was also just a character but he was the main point or idea of the flick so he reflected all emotions characters and the entire setting and theme its self which dark tragic serious realistic and brings out a strong powerful story making him one of the best movie characters i have ever seen that was godzilla which why im a fan of him but they didnt do no such thing the setting was more comicalromance and the story was all over the place not focusing on any thing and the theme bad really bad it was more of that old common naturalistic style theme where the monster is evil until the end mankind is evil for kill to make us wonder what have we be what there was no bad mankind trying to find a way compromise with issue even though despite gojiragodzillas godly strength and invulnerability he had no dealing with them but post world war 2 there was a fear of control power and the risk of nukes they treated him like one making us wonder if there is a right answer or not  one last thing i did like was the introduction of zilla though it was not done well but the guy look like he wouldve had an character that was smart clever and very protective over love ones but never got that until toho made a tv show for him and amped his abilitiesbut for know that i have say i give this film a 5 out of 5 stars because you know why
Jun 8 2014,negative,godzilla is a mess the characters are all very one dimensional and the story is very weak the effects range from pretty believable to very bad its extremely predictable with dozens of plot holes that bring the movie down how did godzilla fit in the sewer how do the military keep losing this huge monster the dialogue is laughable more so than the comic relief that i never found very amusing the movie is poorly constructed but some fun can be had with it the last couple of scenes are stupid but fun with some ok action that you can enjoy if you turn your brain off after the conflict is resolved the movie drags on for another 20 minutes with pointless action the third act completely ripping off jurassic park overall the plot makes no sense whatsoever some fun can be had with it but overall this movie is quite bad godzilla gets 155 stars d
Jun 7 2014,negative,i always thought that matthew broderick was a much better actor but it seems i was wrong
Jun 5 2014,negative,godzilla 1998 is a movie that i loved as a kid and it still holds nostalgic purpose for me but after over ten years and reading all over the web about how emmerich ruined godzillas reputation i cant disagree the storys ok but ridiculous the actings meh aside from a fair few too much is relied on cgi especially given that animatronics was a huge thing back then   the worst of it though is they gave the beast the name godzilla when in reality heshes nothing like godzilla heshe runs from the army and is killed by a few missiles heshe doesnt breathe fire heshes small compared to the actual godzilla and is not indestructible  final consensus as an actionpacked explosive regular monster flick its okay for its time but as a godzilla movie hell no
Jun 5 2014,positive,fun i liked it just not as much as pacific rim
Jun 4 2014,positive,this is a movie which is generally thought of as the typical lowestcommondenominator brainless soulless hollywood blockbuster of its time its curious to watch it with todays equivalents in mind such as transformers or most relevantly the new godzilla film because theres a major difference in ethos theres a sense of humour fun and humanity which is wholly lacking in many of todays blockbusters and particularly godzilla 2014 you could make a case for todays culture in some way robbing us of the lighter touch and bludgeoning us with the sense that a film or show needs to be hyperearnest and gritty to be relevant g98 is not a film in which main characters die or suffer emotional trauma its one in which a wannabe journalist gets hit on by her egomaniac boss and is led by the worm guy with a name nobody can pronounce  so i really do think that big dumb films like this can make for a telling barometer of cultural progression and fundamental filmmaking principals over time    anyway none of this means its a great film obviously it isnt its hugely derivative of king kong and the first two jurassic parks some peripheral characters are 100 superfluous to the plot and waste any screentime they occupy some of the cg rendering looks decidedly ropey  godzilla drops out of the plot for an extended sequence involving its offspring resulting in a seemingly endless chase from obviouslynotreallythere and thoroughly unlikeable critters the films pacing is mostly better than many of todays movies but that particular section kills the film in my opinion    theres also a very weird sense of ambivalence regarding what were supposed to feel zilla tohos recent retcon is a very likeable monster and is treated sympathetically we have extended eye contact with it it seems reasonably friendly and smart its main motivation seems to be a love of fish and its not intrinsically malevolent  its main sin is just being way too big for the environment when it arrives at the city its appearances are called attacks when its actually just wandering from a to b at which point it vanishes underground and doesnt hurt anyone they even point out in the film most of the damage to the city is caused by the military in team america style  so then we have the human contingent nobody points out the issue of calling zillas strolls attacks and nobody  not even the reasonably likeable lead cast  suggests an alternative to killing this new and awesome species of creature the military are gungho and killkillkill but thats not portrayed as the stupid or shortsighted thing to do    it feels like the writer and director couldnt make up their minds about what they wanted the film to be and came up with a confused screenplay this ambivalence reaches a crisis point in the ending scene in which the characters emotions are polar opposites of the audiences gut reaction or mine at least leaving a very sour final impression    still its quite a fun movie i enjoyed it more than godzilla 2014 and a little more than pacific rim      sidenote  g98 has a soundtrack album which i have always found utterly baffling because its filled with songs that i cant hear anywhere in the movie kept waiting for jamiroquais deeper underground to pop up somewhere then finally resigned myself to thinking itd be in the end credits but no thats puffys horrendous come with me and a boring bowie cover were these songs originally used as temp tracks somewhere does anyone know so confused
Jun 3 2014,negative,bland and boring jurassic park ripoff which insults a movie icon by using his name only to leave him out
Jun 2 2014,positive,although i watched this movie as a 16 yr old in the theater alone while onvacation at my grandparents maybe happy to have a bit of a break i really liked it had me on the edge my seat the whole time and i left the theater buzzing like a bee really dont see why everyone hates it so much but its my fav godzilla way better then the 2014 remake i just seen
Jun 1 2014,negative,the only good thing about this movie is that it has some impressive action scenes smoothly edited and the first time a monster of this size was ever so realistically depicted  but everything else is awful  the human storyline is utterly worthless the acting and dialogue is embarrassing and cringeworthy and godzilla himself is the worst of all  they took the most iconic movie monster of all time and made him unrecognizable  a wimpy skinny boxheaded ugly iguana who shares none of godzillas trademark characteristics aside from being big  it would be like if they remade superman but depicted superman as a gorilla who cant fly and can be killed with bullets  but since he is still strong and we call him superman everyone should be okay with it right  well no  see the 2014 movie instead and forget this one ever happened
May 29 2014,negative,disappointing    there are good things about this film but the bad definitely out weighs the good in this situation
May 29 2014,neutral,sighs okay i thought with the new and way superior american godzilla movie out i should say some stuff about this film firstly this is not a godzilla movie the creature in this film is not godzilla he is zilla toho renamed him thats a fact he doesnt look like godzilla act like godzilla or have atomic breath and the films rips a lot off of jurassic parkthat being said the film is an okay monster movie and while not great is a fairly entertaining film if you can get over the fact its meant to be a godzilla movie it was my very first giant monster movie and for a long time this was godzilla to me hell i even felt genuinely sad and cried as a kid when zilla dies at the end but ive seen the real thing figuratively speaking and cant turn back still i do have a bit of a nostalgic attachment to this film that wont let me fully hate it
May 29 2014,positive,this movie surely isnt the best godzilla some people said it was absolutely teribble and i understand why it does have kindof a weak story i think the only reason why i like this movie somewhat is because i grew up with it as a kid little kids dont pay attention to stories and scripts they just want to see a gigantic lizard destroy an entire city as far as mass destruction goes this movie succeded in that area at least
May 28 2014,negative,this version sucked glad they rebooted it in 2014
May 28 2014,negative,at the turn of the century hollywood made several movies playing on peoples fear of the millennium bug this was one such effort basically americans misidentifying a nuclear mutated giant iguana as godzilla it would late be retconned as another beast following this movies poor reception starts well with a neat homage to the original but soon falls flat a waste of money and talent  i dont think i have ever seen jean reno again
May 27 2014,negative,a terrible and very flawed take on the iconic monster godzilla this film takes the bare minimum of the kaiju formula a giant monster and a cool name thats it no special abilities other than running really quickly from the military burrowing underground and inexplicably changing size from scene to scene     what were left with is a giant mutated iguana who runs from the military rather than annihilating them while the creature does maintain the iconic godzilla roar it lacks personality and a key trait  atomic breath instead were treated to an irradiated iguana with wind breath which blows around debris     aside from the fact that this movie is just not pleasing to fans of the classic godzilla films it is an example of squandered money and wasted potential i can forgive lowbudget films for lowgrade special effects and lessthanstellar acting but logic dictates that a film whose budget is high should be held to a different standard     nowretired actress maria pitillos performance is cringeworthy as is matthew brodericks jean reno did all right but his performance couldnt put a dent in just how bad this movie is     clearly director roland emmerich was out to make a mindless popcorn movie aimed at bubble gumchomping preteens with short attention spans
May 26 2014,negative,no dragon breath a little too cheesy to offset and plusses
May 26 2014,positive,while the story may seem like it is a hollywood sequel thriller this godzilla is fascinating in how entertaining it is and how nicely the main characters were actually developed  the characters are quite fun and give the movie a nice atmosphere  jean reno is as usual a real presence on the screen matthew broderick is also quite skillful in his role      as for godzilla he is obviously different from the toho original in many ways but this doesnt make him unfit for this film at all  on the contrary it adds a nice variation to godzillas story one that actually works     i saw this movie 16 years ago from the time of this review and recently realized that it has stood the test of time  with the exception of those little critters who hatch and wreak havoc in hockeyland madison square garden  i think the movie works well until the unfortunately shallow and predictably hollywood ending the death of every descendant should have followed that of godzilla himself   this way a sort of hopelessness would be the message of the film the kind of hopelessness which demonstrates the monstrosity of humans in destroying all in their wake without stopping to think what they may have done differently to prevent such tragedies from recurring
May 25 2014,positive,not what the king of all monsters deserves but still an entertaining effort i figure if thered been a less jurassic parky design and no french involvement this movie would have been treated a lot better
May 24 2014,negative,screen time for simpsons voice actors is the films only quality
May 24 2014,positive,dont care what people say i enjoyed this movie
May 24 2014,neutral,its a rather decent albeit very dumb monster movie but the problem is that even though it features good creature design this just isnt godzilla
May 23 2014,positive,it may lack in story structure and is far from what a godzilla movie is really like the special effects and the likable cast hold the film together i like godzilla1998ill admit it
May 23 2014,neutral,roland emmerich reenvisions the king of the monsters in the big dumb action film godzilla  when new york city comes under attack from a mysterious monster the military calls in a team of experts to discover what it is and how to defeat it  starring matthew broderick jean reno maria pitillo and hank azaria the casting is rather peculiar  but even more bizarre is the lampooning of film critics siskel  ebert as an ineffectual mayoral team  the script is just terrible in all kinds of ways but its almost made up for by the exciting and dynamic action sequences  while its incredible cheesy and stupid godzilla kind of works as a mindless popcorn film
May 21 2014,positive,i cant believe the g movie with matthew broderick got  such bad reviews when it had a plot that moved along witty dialogue oh wait in that movie the main character was a boo marine biologist instead of  a yay buff military guy when you have military guts you often have stilted dialogue and stereotypes but they can be heroic they shootrun around find a solution to the threat marine biologists study care about the environmentboring this new godzilla is marginally okay theres kinda a disconnect between the humans and  monsters like where is something new dang i love monster movies seen every one i wanted to really like this but for all the cgi and family momentsits just oki think the critics are reading things into thisgodzilla is not jesus christ
May 21 2014,negative,zilla is an interesting monster with a lot of potential but this movie simply is not it was radically different from the real godzilla and it being an americanization is no excuse for that a failed attempt for an introduction to godzilla in the west the film is not much more than a pop corn movie that godzilla fans will only like when you forget that its called godzilla and the general public would still dislike for poor writing and acting random plots that dont fit and so much else
May 21 2014,negative,this 1998 cash grab on the postjurassic park craze with its stupid characters mediocre cgi questionable decisions and poorly written dialogue yes broderick that is a lot of fish is not even worth bearing the name godzilla
May 21 2014,positive,its fun as a bad movie and i love the redesign lean and realistic
May 20 2014,neutral,roland emmerichs godzilla has been met with a lot of hatred from the godzilla fandom but honestly the franchise hasnt been all gold in fact some of them have been downright terrible and as a big monster movie it can be fun thats not to say its a good movie its a badly written story but something about the film does have more than a few charming moments the film follows dr niko nick tatopoulos matthew broderick a scientist who studies mutations and new species created by nuclear radiation he is called in to help track and destroy a creature dubbed godzilla the giant lizard has unfortunately decided to make new york its home as nick informs us its perfect for him and despite their best efforts the military are having a really hard time getting rid of it along the way nick encounters some secretive french special forces and his exgirlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo any chance he can get to kill the monster and get the girl  why dont we just get all of the bad stuff out of the way and then i can tell you why i have some affection for the movie alright when i tell you this is a badlywritten story i really mean it on the surface this is just your basic giant monster on the loose plot it begins with the scenes where no one knows whats going on we see unexplainably huge footprints boats getting wrecked the ground shaking as godzilla makes its approach the middle is your usual military tries to take on the monster but cant manage to get a legup on it and at the end of the movie well i cant tell you that but basically every kaiju trope is in here those stories have worked before though its the unexplainably shoddilywritten details that are the real nails in the coffin our main character nick is an overly nerdy type who studies worms and wears thickrimmed glasses so he can be an underdog and get kicked around by the authorities while secretly hes the only one that knows how to deal with the threat as a scientist this guy doesnt particularly shine as being that intelligent and is mostly included to have a main character that can be the butt of cheap jokes and can be in on the action without being an actual soldier notice by the way how by the end of the movie those glasses are gone and those ferris bueller good looks have returned just in time to reconnect with the lady friend speaking of audrey shes another underdog for us to cheer for shes trying to break through as a big reporter but never gets any chances meanwhile her boss is a sexist pompous fool who cheats on his wife no subtlety or need to develop our characters in order for us to like them theyre prepackaged moving on to the story whenever the humans have to interact with godzilla or evidence of godzilla there are a lot of plot holes take for instance the scene where nick is flown to a scene and told to study the giant footprint he is standing in the joke is that the camera zooms out to reveal that the hole he is standing in is actually a giant footprint meanwhile nick is totally bewildered as to why hes been brought over until the camera zooms out the audience gets the joke and then we cut to him running to the commanding officer to tell him that was a giant footprint my question is did no one debrief him on the way were they just so bored with their jobs they decided to pull a trick on this guy by not telling him what his job was going to be did he not have to sign any documents of secrecy that would tell him what he is about to study and did he never think to look out the window as he was flying above the island seems to me like those giant footprints would be pretty easy to spot while flying in a helicopter his character goes on to do some really unexplainable things like test godzillas blood for hormones no one would think of testing and yet hes surprised when the tests turn out to be positive and some crucial military secrets to a girl he hasnt seen in nearly a decade as for the military forces in this film they are truly incompetent there must have been at least three times where godzilla shows up and just disappears without a trace i dont care if the creature can burrow underground or swim in the river it isnt that hard to follow the footprints in the concrete streets it trampled not only that but i am not joking when i say that the military forces in this film damage the city more than godzilla does theyve got terrible aim poor eyesight no peripheral vision and nonexistent strategies whenever its convenient for godzilla to get away see what i mean about being lazy  the film is plagued with bad jokes sure i laughed at the french forces complaining about the bad american coffee and the lack of croissants but even as a funny moment i couldnt believe that the lead guy chose and elvis accent as his way to blend in with the americans we also get a recurring joke where no one can pronounce nicks last name and thats not funny the first or fourth time worst of all is the truly embarrassing inclusion of parodies of the film critic duo siskel and ebert in the film im sure a lot of filmmakers dream of getting revenge on the critics that have savaged their films even if they are doing so rightfully but at least have the characters appear quickly at the beginning of the movie and then get eaten or squished or something dont make them recurring characters throughout its a movie you can tell was written quickly and moves fast enough that you dont notice all the flaws at first like godzilla being able to know exactly when to punch through a building in order to knock down a helicopter  so why in the world is this movie not one of those that just leaves you angry mostly its because while the beginning of the story is weak it gets better as the film moves along and the climax while being totally ridiculous is quite exciting godzilla is a fastpaced agile creature that looks believable i love the toho godzilla design but you have to admit that it doesnt really lend itself very well to quick action and the special effects used to create it are overall pretty good most of the giant monster movies weve gotten over the years have featured miniatures dated special effects and arent particularly convincing but this one does have some really cool shots of skyscrapers being toppled over tanks blasting and helicopters furiously pursuing godzilla through the streets of new york there are more than a couple of shots that are really iconic and well made as well take for example that first shot of an egg that will presumably hatch into godzilla the camera zooms in we hear a cracking sound and then the shot cuts to a bolt of lightning thats a really good transition because the lightning looks like a crack in the egg and lets you know that what is inside ready to be born is much more than just a radioactive little lizard like all good monster movies the film also has a well made buildup of teasing what the monster looks like first a footprint then claw marks then the dorsal spines jutting out of the water a foot crashing down on the city a shot of the tail and finally the big reveal a development during the climax where the heroes are down on their luck and forced to confront hundreds of new monsters ones that are more manageable but still plenty deadly is also a lot of fun to watch and uses practical effects extensively theres that fun mix of cute and deadly at the same time it also helps that the scene resembles a lot one of the greatest quasimonster movies of all time jurassic park this film would have been a complete disaster if it hadnt been for this third act which does pay off and have a bit of an emotional moment at the end too as a bonus a scene during the credits leads into the far superior and very satisfying godzilla the animated series which picks off right after this film ends dispenses with the bad humour and delivers a slew of creative and interesting monsters id go so far as to say that just on the basis of the series alone this film deserves to be seen because it makes for a decent prequel story  im not saying this is a great monster movie im certainly not saying its a good movie a film thats memorable or even that good i am saying that if you think this movie has some charms to it youre right yeah the beginning is rough but at least the movie ends on a high note and it does deliver what it promises when it comes to the monster stuff by bringing a bigbudget monster to the screen if youre a fan of the godzilla franchise you have to admit that there are far worse films in the series looking at you king kong vs godzilla and that this film is officially part of the godzilla cannon with the monster from this film being referred to or included in at least 2 later movies and like i said a mustsee if you want to get into the tv series call it a guilty pleasure but i say you can have some fun with it on dvd may 18 2014
May 20 2014,positive,more like a sequel to jurassic park given the look of the giant lizard however it is entertaining albeit a bit too long
May 20 2014,negative,this was the worst monster movie ever nothing wrong with the monster itself
May 20 2014,negative,you dont need a dictionary to find the definition of the word crap just watch this movie
May 19 2014,negative,just no godzilla 98 as ill be referring to it was one of the worst film expectations ever and for a good reason its boring and theres hardly anything exciting in it   awful casting and brodericks just awkward not even much of a plot except brodericks trying to kill godzilla only reason people saw it was for its clever advertising which made godzilla unviewable and only described it to the public so people had to see the film to see godzilla which was smart the film not so much with odd choices like casting simpsons voice actors and spoofing siskel and ebert for some reason i have no clue godzilla has too many reasons to count to skip it 16 years later is another story quite similar to it
May 19 2014,positive,if this review was back when it release little kid me would say this is very fun and entertaining
May 19 2014,neutral,ignoring the films title this is your typical mediocre monster movie with a mediocre plot weak characters and the films saving grace goodish special effects and action scenes that are fun to watch
May 19 2014,negative,i hope roland emmerich dies in a fucking fire
May 19 2014,negative,how can you make godzilla boring
May 19 2014,negative,gigantic reptile destroys new york      godzilla is a 1998 monster movie by ronald emmerich independence day white house down and is a sort of american reboot to the popular japanese movie films starring a gigantic reptilian that destroys a metropolis i like the effects and some elements of the storyline but i hated the many flaws and mistakes that were made in the movie how big is the sewer system of new york or why was its offspring standing at the main entrance instead of going out destroying buildings concrete roads and even choppers is no problem for godzilla but one measly car slips out of its jaws sigh the film is entertaining its characters annoying starring matthew broderick wargames the producers hank azaria the smurfs the simpsons maria pitillo true romance dear god and jean reno mission impossible the da vinci code the best thing about this movie next to its cgi was the soundtrack     after a japanese fishing vessel is attacked and only one man survived nrc scientist nick tatopoulos broderick is called in by the government to investigate the matter a gigantic reptilian monster is the cause of it all and is headed to the city of new york as the creature sets foot on american soil journalist audrey timmonds pitillo and cameraman victor animal palotti azaria witness the destruction it causes as audrey is nicks exgirlfriend she tries to reach out to him to gather more info about this creature they call godzilla it seems that the monster has come to the city to nests its young can godzilla be stopped and what has the french philippe roché reno got to do with it
May 18 2014,negative,despite some good ideas godzillla is a boring jurassic park ripoff the cgi hasnt aged well
May 18 2014,negative,this is why ive avoided foreign takes on godzilla
May 18 2014,neutral,good for its time but doesnt live up to anything now
May 18 2014,negative,horrible i could not wait for the  spoiler alert  husbandfather nuclear engineer to get killed off horrbile overacting every typical hollywood story line the movie drones on for over 40 minutes of plain blah blah blah before betting any monster action most of the monster scenes  of the very few there are  are shown on the tv screens of the ators watching it in the movie the omly way i would have found this movie passable is if i had walked in from another movie and caught just the last 30 minutes or so ridiculous plot line bad actingdark and spotty special effects  wait for hbo it will be there very quickly
May 17 2014,neutral,the least impressive in the ever continuing godzilla movie franchise this is no masterpiece but it sometimes is unfairly judged    definitely the more comical of the recent editions of godzilla  the acting isnt the films strong point either    the cgi is a little patchy but it was in its infancy in 1998 i found regardless of its many flaws  advertising it is an entertaining film that is fun to watch
May 17 2014,negative,i dont remember much lets put it that way
May 17 2014,negative,where do we begin  a monstrous waste of talent with broderick and reno leading said charge  the scale is altered throughout the movie no pun intended  its comedic or light moments are hardly entertaining  its not that a giant velociraptor is tearing up new york  its that they dont make it funny entertaining or even curious to see whats next   the little bit of surprise towards the end only begs the question  is this the best you have  and this films best is a rotten tomato
May 17 2014,negative,before i launch into my review of the new godzilla film i think its a good idea to first take a look back at the worst godzilla ever madenamely roland emmerichs 1998 adaptation of the king of monsters starring matthew broderick and of course a lot of fish emmerich has never been known for his layered characters or intelligent dialogue but he has always been known to be a pioneer in terms of special effects which is what makes this movie so damn confounding how did the director of such visual marvels as independence day or 2012 approve such horrible cgi in this movie the prerequisite for a bad action film is that it at least have good visuals and boombooms so when the visual thrills are taken out of a roland emmerich film what do we have left apparently nothing because this haphazard emptyheaded and truly boring mess of a movie fits that description perfectly    this version of godzilla takes the great original monster movie and basically neuters it i was wondering recently why everyone has been nervous about the new american godzilla movie but after seeing this film i fully understand why the themes of the original film which are so numerous that i wrote my midterm essay for my history class on them are completely lost in this one instead of being a walking metaphor for japans fear of the atomic bomb godzilla is now instead a chickenlegged iguana with a craving for fish that rampages through new york city and eventually gets taken out by a couple of missiles oh no spoilers not like anyone gives a shit this is not what godzilla is supposed to be hes gone from being a vindictive force of nature to the protector of tokyo but never was he supposed to die like a bitch what eluded the makers of this film is that godzilla is not a generic movie monsterhes iconic hes more of an omnipotent force than anything else and the fact that this movie misses that point so hugely has been a subject of discussion for years    then theres the acting hoo boy look i didnt go into this film expecting great character development even the one roland emmerich film i like independence day and i will defend it to the death has some pretty generic characterization this film however doesnt even try its got every cliché in the book man getting off of helicopter and being met by military guy check scientist who knows the truth stuck in the middle of the chaos check helicopters flying through the streets of new york generic love interestreporter who always seems to find her way into important scenes when the plot demands it dumbass cutesy little lines of dialogue that probably sounded funny in the storyboarding room but are downright cringeworthy when actually seen in the film check check check this is lazy filmmaking at its worst and represents everything wrong with hollywood movies especially ones that adapt or more accurately rip off foreign films to make them more palatable for american audiences the dumbing down of great cultural landmarks like godzilla is something that hollywood should have to answer for     but then theres the cgi oh my god its gutbustingly bad im trying to be as serious and professional about this film as i can but nothing could have prepared me for how truly bad the special effects in this movie are theres a scene where godzilla a massive creature that i can only assume weighs about as much as the empire state building leaps from the streets into the hudson river and slides in slowly making only a ripple my description of this does not do it justice and it truly must be seen to be believed in short though the physics of this film are worse than in the core and thats seriously saying something godzilla himself herself is extremely poorly rendered with skin that looks straight out of a firstyear cgi students summer project this movie might have been passable if it had been made in 1985 but it came out after jurassic park theres no excuse for this normally i wouldnt have such a big problem with something as throwaway as the special effects but when the whole movie rides on the audiences enjoyment of the visuals and the visuals suck you know youve really fucked up as a filmmaker    final score for 1998s godzilla 110 stars this movie is laughably painfully bad from beginning to end i try to pay rapt attention to every movie i watch but i seriously could not focus on this one i found my eyes glazing over numerous times and had to keep saying to myself oh shit im still watching this turd and whats so grueling about it is that it just goes on and on and on this movie is 142 minutes long patched together with an incomprehensible mess of unrelated scenes and identical action sequences i never shut my eyes while watching movies because im grossed out or because theyve offended my puritanical sensibilities lol but i did have to look away a couple of times from this film simply because it was so ugly and infuriating nothing good can be said about this atrocity but no description can truly explain why its such a chore to sit through my only advice is dont find out
May 16 2014,negative,a laughable and painful misfire that i wish we as a society could just scrape from our memories the world would be for the better
May 16 2014,negative,emmerich strikes again with his crappy movies this is by far the worst godzilla movie to be ever made and god doesnt even know why this film was even made     acting is ground zero script is just way too cheap plot is also very cheap the oneliner jokes are nowhere near funny and its cheesy    i personally wouldnt call this a godzilla movie instead zilla because godzilla doesnt die by just missiles     overall its a crappy film with a crappy director with crappy actors and basically everything involved in this film is utter trash
May 16 2014,negative,its just an all around bad movie but not quite to the point that it becomes fun camp  the movie just tries to force unfunny humor into a pretty bad take on godzilla
May 16 2014,negative,terrible movie all together
May 16 2014,positive,i loved this movie  lots of action funny jokes really good acting good story line  best of all it wasnt one of those stupid godzilla movies where it was 80 dialogue and only 20 action  godzilla is an action movie  not shakespeare
May 16 2014,negative,some of the cg and special effects look impressive for the time and it runs on some of my childhood nostalgia unfortunately its not enough to save godzillas cheesy writing mediocre acting lack of destroyed buildings and the king of the monsters is replaced by an oversized iguana and theres a lot of fish
May 16 2014,positive,dont hate like it better than the new one
May 16 2014,positive,i loved this movie big it is but it never was boring it felt like you were part of an adventure and a complete family monster disaster movie
May 16 2014,positive,in my opinion this is what godzilla was made for to destroy cities and generally be a movie like independence day  i found it hard to believe that it received such bad reviews when you look back at the originals and they were crap  either godzilla was on the side of the humans like the 2014 one which lets face it wouldnt happen as its a giant mutated lizard or its fighting another monster  overall i think this is a decent film it has some flaws but then so does every film
May 15 2014,neutral,the graphicseffects and acting were really bad but the plot and intensity were really good
May 15 2014,negative,the only thing more enormous than this lizard is its failure
May 15 2014,positive,i hope the 2014 one is as good as this one
May 15 2014,negative,this is pretty much an insult to godzilla its laughably bad the plot is cliche the cgi is not that good it rains continuously throughout most of the film and it rips off better movie like jurassic park and aliens worst of all godzilla doesnt fight other monsters i really hope the new one coming out will be much better than this crap
May 15 2014,positive,not as bad as people say but this movie should of never been called godzilla because it isnt
May 14 2014,negative,the laughably bad script thats even cheesier than the showa films of the 60s and 70s plot elements directly ripped off from jurassic park such as dinosaurs reproducing asexually and the horrible acting from mattthew broderick and marin pitello makes this failed first attempt at bringing the king of the monsters to the west so bad that not even a halfassed simpsons reunion of actors hank azaria and harry shearer david arnolds admittably great score and a funny parody of siskel and ebert can save this radioactive pile of shit
May 13 2014,negative,thats a lot of fish pure and utter shit
May 13 2014,negative,its the king of the japanese monsters versusferris bueller does that make sense to anyone out there you know when i first saw the trailer for this as a little kid i was completely hooked but then again the director roland emmerich always had a way of luring people in with these great looking commercials and trailers with his movies thinking you are going to like it however when you go to see his movies in theaters your excitement goes a complete oneeighty making you regret your decision and the 1998 version of godzilla is one of those movies now i will admit that when i first saw this in theaters that i thought it was completely awesome watching my very first godzilla movie i even bought the movie soundtrack cd to this as well however this was 1998 and i was elevenyearsold at the time but i digress as i got older and watched this movie several times since then this was one of those regrets as it turned out this movie was the first godzilla movie that was filmed outside of japan and in the united states and the only way you can lure people into a movie like this is with lots and lots of advertising i remember billboards that would say his head is as big as this screen or his foot is as long as this bus and with this being 1998 and all not everyone had the internet to see what he looked like so the only way they could see this behemoth was to go watch it in theaters brilliant strategy there too bad it did not pay off for them now i myself have not seen all of the godzilla movies but if i did there is no doubt in my mind that this is most definitely in the top three worst films for the big green guy     the dialogue in this is either really bland or really shitty at times and none of the characters are interesting with the exception of jean reno matthew broderick is the main actor in this and yet he is both absolutely uninteresting and unfunny spewing off jokes here and there which makes you want to punch him in the face the rest of the cast are just your standard group people that you see in every monster movie which makes this even more boring theres even a side joke throughout the film where two actors are spoofing siskel  ebert where one of them portrays the mayor and his aide the reason behind this was that roland emmerich wanted to get back at the two critics as they always gave a thumbs down to his previous movies but they never this movies takes of these two annoying characters even gene siskel once said after watching this if youre going to go to the trouble of putting us in a monster movie why dont you let it squash or eat us my thoughts exactly but the most disappointing part in this film was godzilla himself or should i say herself but ill get to that in a minute godzilla looked pretty generic in cg and looks nothing like what he was in the previous films i mean im all for updating the image of a classic monster and making him more realistic and awesome for todays standards what we have here is something that did not fit the requirements and none of his trademarks were incorporated and dont get me started on how he dies otherwise this review will go on a lot longer than it should but what is even worse about this and yes i am spoiling this part because this film is sixteenyearsold is that godzilla lays eggs in madison square garden to where they hatch and begin this shitty chase scene with matthew broderick and the french special forces its also an obvious knock off of the jurassic park movies where the babies act and hunt exactly like the velociraptors overall this movie is just two hours worth of filler sure it is a little entertaining if you watch it the first time but you will soon forget about it ten minutes afterwards which is why i give this only one and a half star
May 13 2014,neutral,godzilla is much better from memory as a kid this movie was incredible but now watching it on the eve of 2014 reboot this movie is just okay still it provides the excitement you recall from growing up and the cgi was ground breaking then but is still good 16 years on with roland emmerich you know your going to get a decent disaster movie which  will be explosive witty and be a complete popcorn flick godzilla is no different theres a great quantity of action and screen time of this truly impressive creature is the star of the show what certainly does let godzilla down is the obvious lack in talented acting however even now i cannot deny godzilla is a fun watch
May 12 2014,negative,this is as bad as it gets  at least there are some campy moments to be treasured in retrospect  this is definitely an embarrassment for the franchise
May 12 2014,negative,all right this onesigh ive seen this one from time to time and yeahits kinda is bad as a godzilla movie but its good a film itself this movie could have been almost everything kaiju related but not godzilla this film was a plan to introduce the king of monsters to western audience but backfires in a cringing way this godzilla isnt scary it dosent breath atomic fire it just blows on cars it runs away from the military and gets killed with 3 missiles  it lays xenomorphvelociraptor hybrid babies at a famous land marked building yeahmadison sq garden who wouldnt guess and most of all it  disappears in the middle of the city sewers  this is a film that has offended japan before dragon ball evolution and tekken combined this makes tomoyuki tanaka sleep un peacefully in his grave but however that man will sleep peacefully on may 16 2014 this friday when this film will be wiped out from our brains with gareth edwards new masterpiece but maybe im going a little too harsh on this one i mean if it werent for this one we probably would have never gotten a film from wb and legendary so for that i might actually say thank you  but you still get a 15 out of 5 
May 11 2014,negative,the  king of monsters because  the king of shit real fast horrible cgi unbearable acting dumb dialogue and a loathing plot but it all generated a great comedy
May 11 2014,positive,this movie was so amazing that i totally understand why it took forever to develop a sequel to it how do you live up to this spectacularf movie
May 11 2014,negative,thats not godzilla
May 11 2014,negative,just bad its a lot of fish
May 10 2014,positive,i grew up watching this movie and i still think its awesome to this day does not deserve such harsh hate towards it
May 9 2014,negative,though it boasts a cool looking monster and some interesting camera work calling an allosaurus godzilla was the least of this movies crimes horrible acting horrible dialogue horrible script horrible plotting horrible effects inconsistancies up the wazoo a ripoff of independence day and jurassic park at the same time and all the 90s plagues that we are glad to be rid of not a recommended film
May 7 2014,positive,as the nickname implies its godzilla in name only despite that and all its other flaws however it is an entertaining monster movie
May 2 2014,positive,while this film has no respect for the sorce material it was based off of it is still a pretty good movie it has good special effects for the time and is just simply fun popcorn entertainment i would recommend it to most non godzilla fans
May 1 2014,neutral,the corny but thrilling sequences towards the end of the film arent enough to save it this movie is incredulously stupid from start to finish i feel like the people are causing more damage than godzilla him her self this is even pointed out in the movie that was dumb also the characters are all completely flat and uninteresting and i didnt care for any of them i might be biased because i really liked the 2014 version but i still think this a bad film regardless the effects are dated the situation is silly the dialogue is weak and the movie is honestly boring until the third act basically if you are around the ages of 1012 you might love this movie but more sophisticated film goers that this is not a good movie emmerich pounds the audience with exaggerated explosions and unexplainable science that makes this an unintelligent and ultimately bland film
May 1 2014,negative,what that a godzilla  that a bullshit monster
Apr 28 2014,negative,i tried to sue this movie for using my dick as godzilla without my consent  seriously though where is my money

Apr 24 2014,positive,godzilla 1998 is an entertaining monster movie as long as you treat it as a film on its own and not relate it back to the other godzilla movies  i saw godzilla when i was a kid and was not familiar with the original films  i just saw this film by itself and had a good time  it has some good effects and good action  i did like some of the characters too  matthew broderick i think does a good job  he gets a lot of hate but i did not mind him  i also like jean reno who plays the french soldier named philippe  there are several problems but i did ultimately enjoy the film    the plot is quite simple  due to nuclear testing from the french one lizard mutated into a giant creature that comes to be known as godzilla and is wreaking havoc across the globe until it finally reaches new york  the military enlist a scientist named dr niko matthew broderick to help them stop the monster  meanwhile the french military work under the radar to stop the creature in an attempt to makeup for their mistake    i already stated the things i really like about the film  i like the effects including the design of godzilla  many people hate the design but i like it  i like the action scenes especially the ones in the nest  i also like matthew broderick and jean renos characters  however the film also has things i do not like  firstly i do not like audrey who is nikos love interest  she comes off as annoying and unnecessary  the same can be said for her fiends victor the camera man and his wife lucy  they also come off as annoying and useless to the overall story  they are just the comic relief that was not that funny  secondly i do not like how seemingly incompetent the military seems to be here  they attempt to take on godzilla in the middle of the city which they can easily kill countless people and cause much collateral damage which is exactly what they do  in fact the military causes more destruction than godzilla half the time  they cannot seem to land a hit on godzilla with all their firepower even though he is the size of a skyscraper  nottomention godzilla gives them the slip on multiple occasions despite his size  a lizard the size of a skyscraper should not be that hard to spot  overall godzilla is a fun actionmonster popcorn movie  it has great effects great action scenes and a couple decent characters  there are several moments that require you to suspend your disbelief  but if you can you should be fine  if you do not compare this to the original godzilla films you should have a good time
Apr 21 2014,negative,possibly the greatest waste of money ever
Apr 20 2014,negative,this movie sucks they didnt even respect the name of godzilla they just took those guys who made independence day and made another shitty movie with smart addvertising and thats why people saw it the plot sucks ass and godzilla itself the creature the reason why im watching this flat out sucks he is just not godzilla he is a lizard that looks stupid the roar sounds stupid and they way they kill him off is horrible i wont  spoil it if you havent seen this abomination but heck what am i saying dont bother watching this when its on tv go watch golf because thats much better then this
Apr 15 2014,negative,yuck abysmal is almost every category
Apr 13 2014,negative,i cant even fucking believe that film got critically panned
Apr 12 2014,negative,terrible but when you consider that emmerich was going for the world record for number of times a movie can rip off jaws its pretty impressive
Apr 3 2014,negative,im a big godzilla nerd ask any one of my kind about this movie and they will simply turn away in shame    the only thing this movie had to offer was decent special effects and mediocre acting  the biggest issue i had with it is that it didnt even have godzilla in it it was just some shallow dinosaur that came out of nowhere it felt like it drew more from jurassic park than it did godzillait was so disloyal to the actual product that even toho refused to accept it as an actual gfilm they even snuck a joke about it in a 2004 movie the mere fact that it exists is a disappointment itself  if you feel like watching this hollywood disaster make sure you bring buckets because this will leave you hosing slop out of your throat
Apr 1 2014,neutral,the creature and destruction of new york effects still stun over ten years on however after a strong slow suspense filled start the movie doesnt take long to fall apart into a cheap looking jurassic park rip off
Apr 1 2014,positive,this movie is awesome  but it could just have a little bit more action
Mar 30 2014,positive,though drastically modified from the original 50s classic design this 1998 update benefits just enough from its wellenhanced visual effects and a decent performance by matthew broderick to mask its thin ineffective story
Mar 23 2014,negative,a ripoff of a good godzilla movie
Mar 21 2014,negative,just gonna pretend this doesnt exist
Mar 12 2014,positive,a nutshell review  my childhood
Mar 9 2014,positive,loved this movie and i can care less about  the original story behind godzilla this was awsome
Mar 7 2014,negative,when oh when will a remake be worth the watch almost no remakes are worth it and this one falls under that category its pure trash and it has nothing to offer but mindless eye candy and inept acting truthfully i think this movie wouldve been better if it had been dubbed in japanese
Mar 3 2014,negative,even though the us messed up the franchise by redesigning godzilla the movie isnt bad if you dont pay to attention to the bad acting it makes out to be an ok popcorn movie
Mar 2 2014,negative,terrible just terrible i hope godzilla 2014 will save godzilla from this abomination without matthew broderick hovering over the damn movie with his huge glasses his annoying voice and his terrible acting and his joke that no person ever will get and also without the dinosaur sized lizard godzilla that was the biggest let down due to the huge eye and the huge foot of the monster as seen in the trailers and tv spots
Mar 1 2014,negative,man i really need to review some good films ive been mostly reviewing crap for the last few months but i guess its a little easier to find the flaws in a bad film then praise a great movie that every one has already talked about but this time im gonna keep it short godzilla is a train wreck its awful     basic plot is matthew broderick stars as a worm scientist brought in to help stop godzilla they do he dies no monster fight no atomic breath no fun     the whole movie hinges on the buildup and reveal of godzilla the lackluster effects poor designs and odd size proportions he somehow breaths underwater with no gills and is as tall as a skyscraper and somehow fits into the sewers for all the buildup his reveal makes porno film effects look amazing look at the effort in jurassic park five years before and try to tell me this movie had good effects for its time     all we are left with is bad characters and lame humor i like broderick but who thought he would be good in an action film hes a comedy actor for such an action driven film the choice of having broderick as the lead is odd the humor he brings isnt even that funny as most of the jokes boil down to how he has a funny name and that he knows a lot about worms hilarious and whats the emotional center of the film the destruction left behind by godzilla the ethics of atomic experimentation the destructive power of nature vs humanity nope nope and nope its the relationship between him and his exwife because it was apparently an unwritten rule in the 90s that a couple had to be divorced and then get back together in most action movie     this movie is just a colossal bore with no real depth or fun i was a kid when i saw this and i fell asleep so i dont have an lingering nostalgic love for it watching it again just reminds me of how much i wasnt missing out on      out of 5
Feb 26 2014,positive,while this movie doesnt please fanboys what ever does this movie is actually good nice special effects and decent action keep the moving flowing the baby zillas was a nod to jurassic parkwhy this version gets so much hate is unknown to this day
Feb 26 2014,negative,i hate this movie so much
Feb 26 2014,negative,31  its pretty lame and filled with bad acting nice effects though but not nearly as good as it should have been thats a lot of fish
Feb 25 2014,negative,it is the worst movie in the history of worst movies of all times
Feb 22 2014,negative,terrible movie its roland emmerichs last airbender
Feb 21 2014,positive,i loved this movieidk why everyone else didnt of course its a typical monster movieit is one of the original monster movies i grew up watching this every weekend renting to from the movie gallery it will always have a place in my heart
Feb 5 2014,neutral,performances were a letdown and cgi looked bad at times just big dumb action but thats about it
Jan 31 2014,negative,one of the top 5 worst films ever made id rather snort turkey shit than watch this abomination
Jan 25 2014,negative,i loved it as a child but when i rewatched it i realized just how bad it is still think jean reno is a badass though
Jan 24 2014,neutral,to be honest this movie was ok in my opinion but because the real godzilla is indestructible compared to the other monster i rather call this movie zilla
Jan 11 2014,negative,this isnt godzilla it should be called giant iguana the movie starring ferris bueller
Jan 7 2014,negative,well i guess they tried making a godzilla moving but still it sucked
Jan 5 2014,neutral,as the legendary monster is celebrating its 60th anniversary with a new film thats looks extremely promising not being familiar with godzilla i stayed up super late to watch this american remake directed by action filmmaker roland emmerich i have not watched the original 1954 japanese classic ever since it was first released in 1998 the american godzilla has received a ton of hate from classic godzilla fans though im not that super smart when it comes to this legendary monster this godzilla is not that great though its not as bad as i thought it was going to be    the monster godzilla is born due to some french nuclear testing soon afterwards godzilla creates ginormous footprints in different islands sinks different ships and starts goes loose in new york city intending to grow the population there with his newborn babies its up to biologist tatopoulous matthew broderick and french secret serviceman philippe jean reno along with other help along the way to defeat godzilla before the monster goes out of control    godzilla also stars maria pitillo as audrey brodericks former love interest and reporter wannabe hank azaria as a tv cameraman harry shearer as a news anchor kevin dunn as colonel hicks and michael lerner as mayor ebert in an obvious nod to the greatest movie critic who ever lived    godzilla is one of the most popular movie monsters in all of film history with the japanese 1954 classic being regarded as the best in the franchise i have a strong feeling that i should have watched that film instead cause this godzilla was not that great getting the good parts out of the way the visuals for godzilla and the baby monsters are pretty good considering how similar the effects look to the superior jurassic park roland emmerich is known for handling action sequences pretty well and thats what he does here scenes with godzilla on the loose are pretty fun particularly in a familiar setting as new york city but godzilla is just a monster and there has to be those willing to defeat him and that where the film loses its steam the characters in godzilla are some of the dullest characters ive watched ever the only character that was actually fun was mayor ebert cause of his references to the real deal but he had very little screen time jean reno was ok but ive seen him in far better material than this everyone else involved was either dull or just plain terrible with the worst offenders being hank azaria maria patillo and especially matthew broderick and extremely bland actor whos role is one of the biggest miscasts ever i did not care at all for any of the situations the characters face and was wanting more of godzilla in action even the film score by david arnold is extremely forgettable only spending its time trying to imitate john williams music which doesnt work    while the visuals are good scenes of godzilla in action are fun and the mayor ebert character is hilariously put to good use when needed godzilla is not a great remake at all the characters are flat the acting is horrendous and the film score is a dud for those trying to find a good introduction to godzilla this is not the answer i will try to watch the original before the new one which promises to be much much better comes out later in the year its not a terrible film its just something that i wouldnt want to watch again
Jan 5 2014,neutral,i do like a good monster movie and godzilla was always a childhood favourite of mine this 90s version has a lot of potential but really doesnt match the expectation sure there are some nice scenes i like the scene where our scaly antihero surges underwater towards an angler fishing from a new york jetty but theres no real heart to this film and the attempts at comedy are rather lame in short this does feel like an off the shelf blockbuster riddled with cliché and lacking originality matthew broderick is kind of charming but doesnt make an engaging lead and jean reno looks embarrassed to be involved in the whole affair harry shearer seems to be playing a sendup of himself and only hank azaria seems to actually know what hes doing amongst the cast the special effects here are good and the monster himself is well realised however godzilla always had a personality in the japanese movies and this is really lacking as here he really just becomes a big lizard that happens to be trampling over the manhattan skyline for no real reason roland emmerich generally does do good disaster movies but sadly godzilla is not one of his better pieces a more serious scary and original take on this genre came from cloverfield which really showed how good a monster movie could be and it is to be hoped that the 2014 reboot of godzilla reestablishes this monster as the cinema icon he deserves to be
Jan 3 2014,positive,i was entertained but just barely  its an average film   lots of problems in this flick
Jan 3 2014,negative,the script is weak the acting is bad in some places and the only positive feature were getting here are some cool cgi godzilla is another example of a bad roland emmerich film
Jan 2 2014,positive,cgi   not that good   06 12   own vhs
Dec 31 2013,positive,yeah its pretty stupid in parts but when i was younger i remember that i enjoyed watching it just for sheer entertainment
Dec 28 2013,negative,im very positive nobody involved in this movie even watched a single godzilla movie even as a film on its own its not very good
Dec 26 2013,positive,it was good but i found myself asking when is this going to be over i have to say this was one of my favorite movies of all time as a kid
Dec 24 2013,negative,awful  watching godzilla destroy stuff was entertaining but a that was not godzilla and b i spent the whole movie wishing it would stomp on the human cast  horrible unlikeable characters
Dec 24 2013,negative,a joke of a movie and the worst godzilla movie ever japanese version godzilla is basically indestructible and this version dies with one airplane shot
Dec 23 2013,negative,meh justmeh thought this would be a fun popcorn flick cause come on its godzilla how hard would it be to make that entertaining well apparently to roland emmerich its not only difficult to make a monster movie its difficult to make a good movie period not an impressive filmography at all anyway back to the filmits extremely lame just boring not a lot of godzilla in the movie godzilla just boring characters dumb storywhich i dont expect anything special in a godzilla film but at least something lame action scenes and hashed in love story nothing new that hasnt already been said about this movie it just sucks it gets only one star because when i was a kid i kind of got a kick outta it while watching it with my cousins 15 stars
Dec 19 2013,negative,size clearly doesnt matter
Dec 19 2013,neutral,while really not the best movie in fact its awful i think its somewhat enjoyable  what ruined it for me though was that it was supposed to be godzilla and it wasnt
Dec 16 2013,positive,aside from broderick who could have been a cardboard cut out in this film the special effects and the rest of the cast do deliver a decent monster flick probably the most physically realistic version of godzilla yet i have no clue why purists like the rubber suit better
Dec 7 2013,neutral,i got bored after a while then i snapped  out of it and it was the end the movie was ok
Dec 4 2013,negative,its mostly so bad because it has a title of something it isnt it should just be called zilla
Dec 3 2013,negative,horrible disgrace of a classic series that shows exactly why japanese concepts should remain out of american hands  dbz evolution and speed racer would soon follow
Nov 29 2013,negative,they need to do a 20th century reboot
Nov 27 2013,negative,i had never seen a film about godzilla yet i had heard much about him and played video games based on him so i figured it would be a good idea to witness him on the cinematic screen unfortunately at the time the only film i could get my hands on was the golden raspberry award winning addition to the series directed by roland emmerich still i was interested    as it turns out i was more interested in the idea of the gozilla movie than the actual film itself because the plot dynamics in godzilla are ridiculous why is there romantic drama in a film about godzilla and why is a man that works for the nuclear regulatory commission interrupting his studies of a city destroying monster during its rampage to make tea for the woman that dumped him in high school godzilla will make you ask yourself that but it never bothered to ask it itself  there isnt enough godzilla or enough disaster in the film to constitute it in being a disaster film and the crappy script and subplots overshadow the importance of a giant monster destroying the city seriously roland emmerich how did you mess that up well there is a lot of ways with the casting being one of them  matthew broderick is wrong for the lead a disaster story like godzilla requires a lead character that is serious and intelligent with a comedic character like his as a supporting figure but clearly screenwriter and director roland emmerich disagreed matthew broderick couldnt play the character right and roland emmerich couldnt see that when vicki lewis says to his character you may be the wrong man for the job its what were all thinking for his role as the lead  maria pitillo is stuck with the worst character and the poorest lines in the script and so of course she has nothing to do with them and just ends up failing like they do but her cheap line delivery plastic crocodile tears and the fact that she fails to convince us that she is anything more than a teenage girl trying to prove herself ensures that she is golden raspberry award material   hank azaria and harry shearer prevent godzilla from being taken seriously its not their fault but considering they are both members of the simpsons voice cast and harry shearer constantly sounds like famous animated news reporter kent brockman it just doesnt prove to have any benefit to godzilla  from a technical standpoint godzilla is mostly a success   godzilla makes use of a good production design and costumes as well as some stable and strong cinematography with good editing and lighting and the visual effects would have been powerful for the time of godzillas release in 1998  but the flaw in godzillas technical side is the fact that godzilla does not look like he is supposed to despite me not being the best person to be critiquing this as i have never seen any of the godzilla movies i know that he is not supposed to look like a mix of a spiky lizard and a velociraptor he may have been a decent monster movie in a story about a mutated dinosaur but this is a story about godzilla its not a good one and the design of godzilla is essentially the nail on the coffin that ensures that  godzilla is an excessively boring and long disaster film that is poorly directed and only really has the mild benefit of a few explosions and good visual effects even though it was wasted on a terrible design for the titular creature
Nov 26 2013,positive,average monster movie at best could have much better had it shown more love to its source material as opposed to just making a run of the mill monster film still entertaining to watch zilla destroy things
Nov 25 2013,negative,a newborn baby would crackup at this do i need to say more its called godzilla youre gonna get what you hear crap
Nov 24 2013,negative,roland emmerich never cared for godzilla but when offered to direct an american movie version he agreed for no other reason than an opportunity to make a film and a few bucks and also to take a cheap shot at gene siskel and roger ebert for panning his earlier works  it shows in every frame  the least i can say about the film is that emmerich was fortunate enough to find supporting actors with enough talent to at least pretend to be interested  imagine what could have happened if a more qualified filmmaker had been offered the project
Nov 20 2013,positive,some corny parts and bad acting but still pretty zalama overall lots of great action throughout and godzilla is a beast
Nov 18 2013,negative,after seeing independence day i would think that action maniac roland emmerich wouldnt drop the ball on this onebut he did this movie is just disappointing in every way is the acting good no not really except for jean renos performance is godzilla designed right no he looks like a cross between the alligators in lake placid and the beast from 20000 fathoms how about the plot there isnt one overall you can appreciate it as a monster movie the combat scenes are cool but it cant save the films unfaithfulness to tohos iconic film 2 out of 5
Nov 17 2013,negative,this is not godzilla and this is not jurassic park  this is just a ripoff made by a group of fanboys who love silly action silly humor and silly plots  not only this is a so called ripoff but its also a movie with bad acting bad dialogue and bad character development  the only reason it has a star its because its entertaining  there i said it lol hate me
Nov 15 2013,negative,you know its sad that one of my favorite monster of all time ends up in a bad movie such as this
Nov 12 2013,negative,godzilla is not at all good the cgi is really bad and the acting sucks
Nov 8 2013,negative,godzilla is overblown boring and the script is so poorly written
Nov 3 2013,positive,this move wasnt great and not perfect but movie been work so hard to godzilla in america but i could called godzilla 98 or zilla
Nov 2 2013,negative,how are movies this bad even allowed to be made
Nov 1 2013,positive,a somewhat disappointing remake of the classic japanese monster movie still its not all that bad the effects are good the characters are played with some dignity so its not a total loss
Nov 1 2013,positive,i know this is a hated movie of many godzilla fans but i have to admit its not that bad i know they do rip off jurassic park at the end of the movie and the acting may be crappy and the fact that the movies called godzilla even though the real godzilla isnt in this movie but other than that its still an entertaining popcorn flick like most of roland emmerichs other movies
Oct 26 2013,negative,it is the godzilla movie without the bigg himself  the thing that makes it worse is that it is dedicated to tomoyuki tanaka  it is a shame that the movie isnt  even about godzilla the genius who made this piece of crapaka godzilla 1998zilla gino etcshould go die in a hole for dedicating this to tanaka and not putting godzilla in this movie
Oct 19 2013,negative,packed with wooden acting slightly cheap cgi and scientific errors roland emmerich doesnt do much justice to the original godzilla character
Oct 19 2013,positive,cinematography is fantastic as is the lighting and editing making for a great looking movie three fishing trawler scene is of particular brilliance as is the script that is well portrayed by the actors wiggly fish add to the fun details as the sets portray godzillas nest enjoy the french getting there own back on nyc  nibbles french fries
Oct 18 2013,positive,awww when matthew broderick was a cutie i wish they bring this movie in theater
Oct 17 2013,negative,since the upcoming hollywood remake is coming out in 2014 i think its time to review this turd of a monster movie godzilla 1998 was americas attempt to bring tohos classic monster onto the big screenand it sucked major balls the story is terrible the dialogue is godawful the destruction is pretty average when it comes to monster movies it obviously a nod to the jurassic park movies rather than the actual title of the movie it is not only a disrespect to the fans of godzilla but it is americas way of saying screw you japan let us show you how a real monster movie is done well i guess i shouldnt be saying that because it seems that hollywood is learning their mistake with the character by giving him more of a classic look in the upcoming remake if you havent seen any stills of concept art of the remake you will be thrilled but i am not talking about the remake   everything about this movie is terrible but what makes it terrible is godzilla himself he looks and acts nothing like godzilla the advertisements made this movie a mystery to the appearance of godzilla those ads didnt help the film because the reveal was disappointing it was just a trex only a few sizes bigger also godzillas primary weapon aside from being taller than the empire state building is that he breaths nuclear fire in this he is just blowing fire from a source of fire godzilla is the god of monsters and this is not godzilla in any way shape or form he needs to be big and i mean biiiggg he also should have the powers of a god like breath out fire and being indestructible the only thing that can kill him is another monsterthat is fact people i really hope that hollywood proves their worth with this upcoming remake of this legendary being overall dont see this movie go see an americanized dubbed japanese classic godzilla film or wait for the remake to come out i am giving this turd 25 stars
Oct 14 2013,positive,better than most reboots  you can really tell this is a us bigbudget flick
Oct 10 2013,negative,0 out of 5 if i could i cant stand this movie the only good part was the babies and the build up and even that isnt even that good
Oct 8 2013,negative,basically godzilla goes to manhattan to lay eggs and eat free fish from the military     this is the movie that turns a motherfuckin 200 meters tall mutant iguana into an unbearable bore fest how can you fuck this up its a motherfuckin 200 meters tall mutant iguana wrecking shit up and fighting other giant atrocities thats the main thing of godzilla jesus    oh theres people around acting like retards doing unbelievable and laughable stuff even that they didnt get right this couldve been a mildly entertaining flick if the director was actually interested in entertaining us wreck shit up put godzilla firing his dragon breath against something throw giant centipedes onto the mix just do something for fucks sake
Oct 6 2013,positive,i think its ok its bad a a godzilla movie but ok as a zilla movie
Oct 3 2013,negative,decent but unremarkable monster flick takes itself seriously but without enough substance to carry itself especially with the original godzilla 1954 in mind
Oct 2 2013,negative,worst movie ive ever seen nah that spot is still reserved for halloween resurrection however this is a close contender certainly as offensive to it preceding source material as halloween resurrection
Sep 25 2013,positive,it was good but not what i expected
Sep 25 2013,positive,watched this as a kid and loved it and i still do
Sep 21 2013,positive,size does matter according to the studios marketing team but it turns out that a man in a rubber suit stomping on miniatures is an altogether more entertaining experience with the inconsistently sized computergenerated titular beast reigning terror on the city that never sleeps theres enough fun to be had to sustain most  not all  of the the films gestation matthew broderick is an unconventional hero for this sort of fare but is his usually likable self though the plot involving his rekindled romance with maria pitillo isnt compelling or interesting enough for us to care and the final act plays out more like a poor mans jurassic park 1993 however theres some terrific action sequences here and a scenestealing hank azaria and jean reno are also highlights
Sep 12 2013,positive,you guys may hate it but i for one loved the movie and the monster zilla oh yay  dont forget this is the very first kiaju not put as a costume or puppet
Sep 8 2013,negative,wish this was never made
Sep 3 2013,positive,this was huge monster actionpacked fun  the special effects were amazing for its time
Aug 30 2013,negative,this is about as bad as it gets when it comes to stupid monster movies
Aug 16 2013,positive,this movie may have took the hearts of godzilla fans at the time like myself and smashed them into millions of peices but now after giving it a second watch its pretty good its not a masterpiece but its great popcorn entertainment thats worth a solid c
Aug 12 2013,negative,ahh americaonce again being disrespectful and even insulting the japanese culture why give this kind of movie to someone like roland emmerich to direct hes like another michael bay stale characters and nothing but shit getting destroyed and the results speak for themselves this american version of the king of monsters is pure underwhelming stuff with bad cgi bland characters lack of credibility plot holes asspenis pacing and even average acting great elements to do a monster movie right    the buildup is not interesting the story has not that many interesting moments godzilla is treated with no sense of wonder or any sense at all actually it also lacks that nuclear weapon message that made the original standout insteadit simply shows godzilla being both fasty  effective and incompetent and slow seriously it can destroy ships helicopters and buildings but not a single car also its defeated by some missilesso it can survive a nuclear explosion but not some missiles that didnt even pierce him or blow him to shreds they did it they made this monster even less credible it simply doesnt live up to nothing the sequences are entertaining and even provoking but after they end they feel empty and lackluster like every emmerich movie its dumb inconsistent stupid and average to the end well it didnt dissapoint there    i really hope this years new version does justice to the king of monsters it shouldnt be hard the least it needs to be is entertaining and that is where this movie failed its just bad and underwhelming and even overlong it ripsoff almost every single movie save any of the godzilla movies and they are a lot avoid this crappy version of the monster yeah a computergenerated monster is worse than the rubberish suit one
Aug 8 2013,positive,this wasnt actually a bad film contrary to what many have said its got a reasonably small budget and a pg rating which caused much of the negativity around it feels abit like jurassic park in the middle of nyc and instead of the usual roland emmerich fanfare it would have seemed to many as another spielberg film hopefully the new upcoming reboot will fix the budget issues and hopefully it gets a 15 rating the characters were a bit meh and godzilla himself just looked like a standard dinosaur from jurassic park but despite the films many flaws it was quite an entertaining film
Aug 5 2013,neutral,scary but obviously you can see just how fake godzilla is haha 
Jul 31 2013,negative,this film just doesnt know when to end for me it ended right when the cgi mess came up from the depths of the hudson
Jul 30 2013,negative,this movie is as griping seeing a rubber dinosaur fall of a  statue of king kong
Jul 28 2013,positive,in this movie godzilla is a mutated iguana but i still liked it so did my mother
Jul 27 2013,positive,if you shut off your brain from acting storyline and script and just see the explosions and action it would be a good movie but based on that fact it wasnt good if you do not
Jul 24 2013,negative,this movie is terrible yet amazingly still roland emmerichs best movie
Jul 21 2013,positive,i enjoyed this remake enough to look past the fact that emmerich payed no attention to the franchise he tried to pay homage to
Jul 20 2013,negative,i wanted to see this remake of godzilla but if it aint broke dont fix it i really hated this roland emmerichdean devlin crapfest of godzilla because there wasnt no monster vs monster fans desperately were hoping for godzillas signature roar is missing godzillas disfigured character design was pretty much to blame and just by adding insult to injury the cgi effects were wrong that project just alienated longtime fans of the japanese legend not even poor matthew broderick cant even save this nuclear celluloid because the film also suffers from laughable bad acting bad script special effects werent that special dumb characters a decent but mediocre film soundtrack terrible comedic jokes and sometimes i might have to call this one of the most overhyped movies of the 1990s but its still overhyped it reminds me of watching siskel  ebert a long time in 1998 and how bad the move was unless its a mismatch which emmerich version is the worst godzilla or 2012 i would rather watch reruns of independence day rather than watching a 10 buck vhs copy of godzilla at taco bell still the 98 godzilla is full of crap dont even think about buying it on other formats
Jul 20 2013,neutral,i dont hate this movie as much as other people do since this was one of the first godzilla movies i ever saw as a kid however there is a lot of problems like too much human interaction and not much godzilla also in the japanese films godzilla never ran from a fight and always destroyed everything in his path and no missiles could ever phase him in this movie thats how he dies really disappointing
Jul 16 2013,positive,this american remake of the 1954 classic has many faults and missteps but is nowhere near as inept as its reputation makes it out to be i actually find it to be better than the two most recent transformers movies sure it suffers from basic dialogue and stiff performances but these things while not excusable are practically a given with this genre one cannot dwell on them too much the real problem is the portrayal of the monster lacking any real sense of menace despite these and the obvious throwbacks to jurassic park it still manages to be an entertaining blockbuster mostly due to some impressive shots of the creature and a fast paced climax
Jul 11 2013,negative,the main reason why i decided to finally watch this movie again on top of reviewing it is just to find out what id think about it compared to when i saw it the first time because while everyone talked about how it was crap over the years i just remembered being scared as heck to go see it audience snickers hey i was only 7 years old audience goes ooooohhhh and nods at each other going that makes a little bit of sense but anyway with one scary memory faced with realizing a movie that was just crap this in my review for godzilla    plot a nuclear test in french polynesia causes a lizard nest to be destroyed from the blast of the atom bomb but one egg survives only to be mutated causing the baby lizard to to develop atavistic traits of ancestral reptilian species eventually this turns it into a giant lizard that attacks a japanese fishing vessel and eventually new york so the military is trying to stop it while dr nick tatopoulos is assigned to try to figure out what it wants and try to stop it    okay so heres the thing despite how scared i was to even think that my parents would have the nerve to make me see the movie my ohso young mind left me to believe that there was some sort of decent characters and storytelling that i saw while being oh so super scared and yet here i am today almost 23 years old and have seen it for the first time since then and realizing that not only was i wrong about not having any decent characters or storytelling but all the rough exposition that i did remember was just thrown there and that was kind of it it turned out that this film focused more on explosions and chases and special effects then anything else i mean i knew this movie was going to turn out bad but i figured there would be at least a pretty good amount of characterstory development even if its bad development i particularly felt that way with the relationship between nick and audrey i thought there was more to their realtionship that i just didnt pay attention to the first time but it turns out that they barely talked about their past had only one scene together before they have their moment where one is mad at the other as theyre talking in the rain and aside from one or two moments the rest of the film was just them running from godzilla and his kids all that aside the action was a little silly with how easily the military kept not hitting godzilla  i mean sometimes it made sense because he somehow had some good agility or something like that supposedly but still oh and this is kind of the kicker this bad thing is unique but they do a  really crappy job at what they were trying to do the makers of the films were also the people who made stargate and independence day which rightfully got bad reviews but they seemed to be really pissed when famous critics siskel and ebert gave it bad reviews so in response to that they made satirized versions of both critics as two supporting characters in the movie to try to insult them but they didnt really take advantage of the oppertunity of making fun of the critics in fact siskel himself stated if youre going to go to the trouble of putting us in a monster movie why dont you at least take advantage of having the monster either eat and squash us so the really interesting yet completely messed up thing is that theyre trying to get back at these critics and they do a remarkably sloppy job at even doing that     and thats my review for godzilla what i thought was a scary movie that mightve had decent characters and story turned out to be a movie focused on just effects and explosions with all the possible exposition just thrown at but never really developed and its a movie thats bad in a unique way because they spend a portion of the time trying to get back at siskel and ebert for previous bad reviews but dont really take advantage of it which is both stupid and really sad its a very poorly done movie not worth your time
Jul 10 2013,positive,it lacks the ambition and political context of the japanese original but with a wellstructured story enthralling action and an interesting new design for the creature  as well as a heavy helping of fond childhood memories   roland emmerichs godzilla is a fun nostalgic and thoroughly enjoyable monster thrill ride
Jul 9 2013,positive,a decent roland emmerich film godzilla isnt awful thanks to its mildly entertaining action sequences and decent effects aside from a few shots of a mediocre looking godzilla and rolan emmerich trying to insert a plot that nobody cares about this is an okay movie
Jul 9 2013,negative,i liked godzilla when i saw it at 14 but now i realize how cheesy this film is this is cynical movie making bad bad baddddddd the worst film ever made 
Jul 1 2013,positive,even though a lot of people dont like this film i still enjoyed it as a kid
Jul 1 2013,negative,its not a razzie award winning film but it leaves very little of an impression theres a few laughable plot holes manhattan is not the perfect place for a skyscrapertall monster to hide and a few weird moments how exactly is thats a lot of fish supposed to be funny but other than that its an okay film which is arguably the worst thing a movie can be watch a different film instead but if you must catch it on television for free
Jun 28 2013,negative,no one really watches a godzilla movie and expects it to be good and true to expectations it wasnt good
Jun 27 2013,negative,i will say godzilla 1998 is not a bad monster flick but sadly that is not saying much as it misrepresents everyones favorite japanese nuclear powerhouse no that is not godzilla hes an mutated iguana dragon calling this movie godzilla like leaving a bunch of insane kids at your perfectly clean house
Jun 26 2013,positive,what was one of the most anticipated movies of 1998 godzilla turned into one of the biggest laughing stocks that year  and still is  what should have been a great action adventure turned into a geeky boring ripoff of jurassic park  the lizard is more of an animal rather than a creature hell bent on destroying tokyo  the fact that matthew broderick is the major player here gives no testosterone  it tries to be intellectual without having you think about a thing  half way through the lizard disappears and all the babies run wild like the raptors did in jurassic park but less terrorizing  directed by roland emmerich the day after tomorrow independence day 2012 godzilla fits his style of telling stories that have extreme circumstances but no substance  i remember it being something pretty cool to see as a teenager but now that ive seen much better godzilla isnt anything i want to praise  the only thing that was good was the design of the lizard but then again its a rip off of the trex  costarring jean reno maria pitillo hank azaria kevin dunn vicki lewis and michael lerner    610 stars  sure its watchable but that doesnt make it substantial which it should be  to metro for a godzilla movie
Jun 21 2013,negative,one of the worst movies i ever saw at the theater i dont know if it was because of the godzilla or matthew broderick luckily i dont remember much about it anymore but that i  hated this movie definitely not worth watching and dont know why there is even going to be a new reboot
Jun 19 2013,negative,even the japanese wouldnt be scared of this godzilla
Jun 17 2013,negative,forgettable godzilla tries to recapture the spirit of the original but fails due to an abundance of bad cgi cliches and a surprisingly boring monster
Jun 16 2013,negative,cashing in on and blatantly ripping off the megasuccessful jurassic park roland emmerichs film is an insulting transmogrification of the original godzilla parable into one of historys least engaging disaster films
Jun 10 2013,positive,one of my favorite movies growing up
Jun 8 2013,negative,roland emmerich at his worst
May 30 2013,negative,extremely convoluted and stupid
May 21 2013,negative,15 years since its release is it time to reassess the merits of this film to be far no it takes itself way to seriously and the plot is all over the place characters come and go and you get no real sense of peril yes stuff looks good as it gets blown up by the incompetent us military but you cant help but find yourself watching a collection of scenes lifted straight from other films jurassic park gets lifted wholesale in places i hope the new upcoming american version can remove this bad stain from gojiras good name
May 19 2013,negative,the writing is so embarrassingly bad its like a deservedly forgotten cartoon series from the 1990s flat and forgettable monster movie
May 11 2013,negative,nothing here you wont see anywhere else its quite bland and lacks in originality and character development that and its really cheesy with independence day the characters were really interesting and no matter how cheesy or goofy the film was the characters made up with it with their charisma and charm together in this apart from the main character and a bad french general no characters are really likable theyre all just annoying and dont really do anything the love story is rushed if anything and the acting is substandard i guess the action scenes are pretty cool but once again the effects take away from it overall a pretty bland movie but a fun watch
May 8 2013,neutral,as a kid i loved this film watched it for the first time in about ten years recently  i couldnt believe how bad it was the cgi is terrible and hasnt aged well at all
May 7 2013,positive,okay so it may not be faithful to the original famous godzilla series by toho  the acting in this film was at times stale or hammed most of the characters were painfully obnoxious but this version of godzilla is kind of a guiltypleasure to me since i enjoyed the special effects the story  how a monster lays waste to nyc when i meant story i mean it in the way it works on our terms  new city new look for the monster more destruction but i am on the side of godzilla fans because it just doesnt feel the same hate it or love it godzilla to me was pretty good  i quite liked it except for the aforementioned stuff about sticking to the original series  the acting oh i forgot one thing the rendition of puff daddy covering led zeppelins kashmir was horrendous he should have left the song alone the bastard   2014s godzilla was far more superior see my review history shows again  again how nature points out the folly of man godzilla
May 6 2013,positive,the movie started out kinda bad but it got better as i watched it  pros 1 i like godzillas new look  very realistic  2 the way the characters came up with the name godzilla wasnt great but it was probably the best possible way a movie could have  3 there was some good suspense that seemed a little jurassic park with a little aliens even though the suspense itself is nowhere near as good   4 some fairly touching scenes  5 the camera angles were mostly good    cons   1  he just keeps coming back  even in the animated series  whether its him or one of his kids   2 i think they shouldve made it a sequel to the 1933 king kong  maybe peter jackson would do that   3 the movies a bit longer than needed   4 though godzillas look was much more realistic the special effects could use a tiny bit of work   5  subplots arent that great   6  quite a few hokey elements    whether you like the movie or not is your choice i liked it though  the director was actually nominated for awards for both best director and worst director  so its an upsanddowns movie
May 5 2013,negative,godzilla the 1998 version is an americanized retelling of the japanese mutant that is mindless dumb fun and a pretty average action flick from the 90s there seemed to be an over abundance of these types of films its one of those movies that you love as a kid but when you look back at it you realize how stupid it was as a kid you would probably dismiss the flaws that this film is heavy with let alone not even notice them because they fall in love with the craziness that is resulted from a huge mutant lizard that is terrorizing a city however when you grow up you wonder about what you were thinking as a kid when you were watching this because of how unintentionally silly it is theres bad acting an abysmal script and tons of ridiculous laughably stupid moments that being said this is cheesy pointless fun with flashy decent special effects that do serve as a somewhat guilty pleasure its not a particularly memorable film either with tons of chaotic generic action sequences that may or may not give you a headache it feels way overlong and the acting ranges from being overacted to underacted like matthew brodericks role as dr niko     the characters feel very boring shallow and obnoxious and weve seen them all hundreds of times before the story is predictable and lazy albeit some minor thrills at parts and some creative ways that the characters escape from the situations that theyre in once godzillas eggs hatch and her babies attack dr nikos crew the film does become a tad more entertaining but not enough to really care about whats going on theres nothing very surprising about this movie and is pretty much a bland long continuous special effect that gets boring and stale after a while and does serve a small dose of entertainment and fun but ultimately feels like an effortless dumb pointless action flick i wouldnt be surprised if someone has a soft spot for this film because many people may have nostalgia from watching this as a child but i couldnt help but to feel annoyed by its obnoxious annoying and stale quality on almost every level
May 5 2013,positive,please dont hate me for somewhat enjoying this film one of the main reasons i think i enjoy it so much is because i watched it a bunch when i was a kid and it slowly became one of my favorite films  now cut to the present i cant say this film even reaches close to one of my favorites list but it still does hold up in certain aspects
May 4 2013,positive,i really liked this movie and the casting though strange works alright the star is godzilla of course reimagined as a large chinned long legged baby of a trex daddy and alien brood queen mother the last 3045 minutes of the movie looks and feels different than the rest and gets a lot ridiculous costarring nyc pre 911 makes for an interesting time capsule of when it was ok to attack nyc in a movie
Apr 30 2013,positive,pretty awesome love it
Apr 29 2013,negative,even though the old godzilla movies show their age they have huge appeal to me  this movie doesnt  yes i did watch this movie a million times as a kid and i remember seeing this in theaters  however its very boring and pointless  makes me want guys in costumes back
Apr 19 2013,negative,its not bad but it sure as heck is not good
Apr 18 2013,positive,what happened to godzilla
Apr 18 2013,positive,i enjoy this film from the first till the last time i see it its a great film to watch and is a must see
Apr 15 2013,positive,i loved it great movie and matthew broderick did a great job
Apr 15 2013,negative,worst giant monster movie ever made gets an easy 0 out of 0 from me my advice to my family my classmates and my dearest friends and to the rest of the united states of america watch an actual godzilla movie
Apr 11 2013,positive,i dont care what everybody else thought this movie was good to me
Apr 11 2013,positive,the big bastard rocks
Apr 9 2013,negative,violence  gore 510 lots of destruction disasters frightening images and some violence very little minor graphicalbloody scenes   sex  nudity 110 no sex or nudity just some minor sexual references   language  profanity 010 no profanity   age 11
Apr 8 2013,neutral,awesome however  there is one thing i would like to say  he breaths fire i know that the old ones stink  but he breaths fire if there is one thing i hate about this movie its that
Apr 7 2013,negative,basically its jurassic park but with one big monster and set in nyc  so just go see that movie and you will have seen this one  cgi on godzilla is pretty decent so thats why im even giving one star other half is for the remainder of the movie
Apr 3 2013,negative,this is probably one of the worst film i have ever seen the action is there the direction is efficient the cast is ok but it falls flat  feels completely ridiculous
Apr 2 2013,negative,let down by a bad script and pitillo whose acting is not up to the others
Mar 30 2013,negative,big giant expensive effects big name actors and a brand name cant help a poorly written story that insults a beloved series
Mar 26 2013,negative,absolutely horrible  dont bother even thinking about watching it
Mar 24 2013,positive,my inner 10 year old still loves this movie
Mar 24 2013,negative,syfy does it better  plot and science is unbelievable acting is hammy  character development is forced and slow  its essentially the same as watching gatoroids or crockosaurus but less enjoyable
Mar 23 2013,positive,contrary to critic ratings i thought this movie was very fun to watch although the visuals in jurassic park were a lot better then this i still enjoyed the movie cant wait for the 2014 reboot
Mar 23 2013,positive,godzilla 1998 isnt the worst movie i have ever seen the movie it self is very entertaining and with a great soundtrack but the only problem i had with this film is that they called it godzilla because the film isnt about him is the movie bad no  but is it the worst gozilla movie remake yes in fact toho renamed the monster zilla but if you want to check it out go ahead see what you think
Mar 21 2013,negative,a movie that drags on way too long
Mar 20 2013,negative,i can say the predator in this film has fangs and fingers but the fangs and fingers dont scare the preys very much
Mar 18 2013,negative,these people should of minded there own buisness and never made this movie it ruined my godzilla childhood from toho
Mar 16 2013,negative,the effects suck the characters are boring and it suffers from inconsistencies and illogical elements
Mar 16 2013,neutral,meh just meh it could have been a lot better
Mar 13 2013,negative,worthless pathetic horrible piece of raging shit
Mar 5 2013,positive,i enjoyed this movie despite some lame scenes and a silly plot
Mar 3 2013,neutral,not the greatest movie in the world its not even a good movie
Mar 2 2013,negative,im not a godzilla fan i havent watched many of the japanese films about the giant monster and i dont care whether the american version stays true to the original in look sound or theme what i want from a giant monster movie is fun which isnt what we get here i might dislike godzilla immensely but its not because it didnt stay true to the original its because its boring lifeless brainless gives you little reason to watch and for a good half hour stretch isnt even about the titular giant monster    heres how godzilla became the giant monster in this version a nuclear test a few decades ago mutated an iguana egg and it eventually grew up to be godzilla we dont see it grow but presumably it took a while because otherwise it would have started to wreak havoc earlier it destroys a couple of ships and then turns its sights on new york all while the humans are trying to figure out what it is where it is and how theyre going to stop it all in all its as generic a monster movie as you can get    that is save for the parts that suck which is almost all of it you can have a monster running around new york for a couple of hours and it will almost certainly be fun somehow director roland emmerich sucked all of the potential enjoyment out of the film its really really hard to do that you have a monster the size of  actually considering its shape and size change from scene to scene i dont know what to compare it to size does matter is a lying tagline  something big enough to destroy buildings seemingly impervious to bullets and other human devices and yet its not fun whatsoever how does that happen    well you set the majority of the film in the dark so nothing can be seen you dont make the monster do anything other than run around the city occasionally destroying a building or two and then you make the humans fight minigodzilla creatures for a half hour while the big one is doing nothing of importance and just for good measure you make the human story incredibly dumb and pointless while making the people involved unlikable or unimportant    some spoilers follow so if you somehow care that godzilla happens to be pregnant you probably wanted to stop reading after the previous paragraph he they still refer to it as a male after learning this eventually gives birth and after the eggs hatch the characters stop caring about the big one instead focusing on the little ones which look like worse versions of the raptors from jurassic park that is not what i want from a monster disaster flick    to be fair when you first see godzilla destroying new york city its kind of neat you like seeing iconic landmarks being destroyed and its fun for a little while that is until the humans start getting involved godzilla stops actually doing things and it gets progressively worse until the film finally comes to an end this mutated gigantic iguana could have caused so much destruction but it seemed very content walking around buildings so as to not inconvenience the humans    there is one scene in the film that i appreciated it involves a scientist and our lead character dr niko tatopoulos matthew broderick explaining that godzilla is just an animal and that its following its natural instincts we then zoom in on some fish flopping about on the concrete two things are told to us here the first which the film later explicitly states is that godzilla is hungry and that it eats fish the second which is implied is that its like a fish out of water  a creature out of its element    thats as smart as godzilla gets and thats the only scene with a bit more depth than whats at face value the rest is just dull its stupid its not enjoyable and i wanted it to end almost as soon as it began but it doesnt end not for 139 minutes did any of the japanese godzilla movies last for that long somehow i doubt it or if they did they at least had the characters do something in that time    none of the human characters or their relationships to each other matter theres brodericks character who has a history with a wanttobe reporter audrey maria pittilo theres a frenchman jean reno who may or may not know more about the situation than we think he does and theres a parody version of roger ebert michael lerner and gene siskel lory goldman which made me laugh for their first scene but not a single time afterward all of them are inconsequential and it would have been better had they all be excised and just let godzilla go around killing everyone    godzilla is a complete waste of time for you and for everyone who made it while it might not keep the same spirit of the japanese films that doesnt matter to me its a boring monster movie which is the one thing that it cant be you can forgive everything else in this type of movie as long as the monster and its destruction is fun thats not the case here and since everything else is just so terrible this is one movie you must skip
Feb 23 2013,positive,i was making out all through this movie so ill base it off of that
Feb 20 2013,negative,i loved it when i was 11 anyway havent seen it since
Feb 18 2013,negative,godzilla 98 is the type of overhype underwhelming effects driven tent pole crap that still run rampant today with the likes of transformers 2 or everything else team emmerich and devlin have crapped out this is a lumbering inexcusible butchering of the classic character
Feb 15 2013,positive,ive enjoyed this film ever since i saw it in theaters back in 98 if you dont like it thats fine i respect that that doesnt mean i have to hate it too i was never a diehard godzilla fan so i wasnt as angry about it as a lot of people were i feel that if it went by any other name people might have actually liked it
Feb 15 2013,negative,godzilla 1998 promised everyone a godzilla movie instead we got a movie with horrible acting characters and scenes ripped off from jurassic park the titular monster looks nothing like the original and is completely different the special effects are good and so is the score but all in all it fails to be a good godzilla movie
Feb 10 2013,positive,incredibly corny and cheap lines aside godzilla has much to offer for a turn of the century popcorn entertainment scifi flick
Feb 7 2013,positive,great but something is missing
Jan 25 2013,negative,i thought it was pretty bad the cg was pretty bad too i think even for 1998 standards it would have bored me when i was in middle school
Jan 22 2013,negative,what happened why didnt they just make stargate 2 instead
Jan 22 2013,positive,i caught this on tv the other day i actually enjoyed it more than i think i did in 98 way to go emmerich
Jan 21 2013,negative,watched it to be a hypebeast
Jan 20 2013,positive,the most underrated movie ever  ever i say
Jan 18 2013,neutral,this was worth seeing once and even then its not great the effects are well done but broderick seems out of place
Jan 16 2013,negative,wow longest 2hour experience ive ever had with truly awful dialogue terrible pacing and shady creature effects every character in this film lacks the emotion required for the situation theyre in and it seems like a paycheck film for every actor involved just a stupid stupid movie that will have you facepalming again and again wondering how this was released
Jan 16 2013,neutral,didnt really enjoy this one too much didnt like it how they made godzilla very dinosaur looking and with any godzilla there is not much you can really do with it
Jan 7 2013,neutral,a watered down plot and some bad humor hold back this movie from reaching its potential its decent if you look at it as a monster flick but its a terrible godzilla flick the latter need not apply because this movie doesnt feature the king of monsters but a giant iguana
Jan 6 2013,neutral,pure popcorn entertainment unrealistic wuth lots of inside humor worth it for the escapism
Jan 4 2013,neutral,hehe a cheap action flick
Jan 2 2013,negative,two things wrong with this film  matthew and broderick
Jan 1 2013,positive,i thought it was pretty good
Dec 31 2012,negative,a pretty terrible movie godzilla disappointed me in a lot of ways the plot is altogether stupid and the effects are absolutely horrible even for the 1990s the acting is average broderick and reno are ok but the rest of the supporting roles are pathetic in my opinion also the cheap setting doesnt mix with the story if you can call it that at all and the resolution still confuses me to this day this is a film that not only emmerich should be ashamed of but hollywood should be ashamed of too
Dec 29 2012,negative,why would you cast matthew broderick in this movie  nothing says summer blockbuster less than matthew broderick
Dec 29 2012,negative,a painfully blatant ripoff of the jurassic park series
Dec 27 2012,negative,i was so looking forward to seeing the big guy not in a rubber suit  i wish they had thought about writing a story
Dec 27 2012,negative,disgrace to my favorite monster movie   3310
Dec 27 2012,positive,could have been so good never mind
Dec 26 2012,negative,good idea terrible exection
Dec 26 2012,neutral,not as good as the original 1954 but jean reno gives a good performance
Dec 25 2012,neutral,its zilla cuz that aint no god if you ask me
Dec 24 2012,positive,mathew broderick stars in the remake of the legendary godzilla series were godzilla the classic guy in a suit turns into a computer generated monster i prefer the guy in the suit the remakes actors are not that good with exceptions of matthew broderick and jean reno and the story isnt the same as the originals
Dec 23 2012,positive,it was alright but nothing like the japanese godzilla movies had more of a jurassic park feel to it

Dec 12 2012,neutral,i didnt mind it up until the nest at the garden scenes then i thought it started to get rediculous  for its time i think the special effects were decent  though by todays standard would be condisdered pretty low
Dec 11 2012,negative,an example of why the usa should stop making remakes of other countries movies and instead just learn to be a little cultural less xenophobic nationalist and watch movies made outside the usa with original voices and not that shameful uncultural extremely lousy dubbing which completely destroys any movie except bruce lee but it would also be better in original
Dec 11 2012,negative,pdiddy killed an awsome led zepplin song
Dec 10 2012,positive,better than godzilla 1956 in my opinion with a cool story
Dec 10 2012,positive,the movie is fun to watch just like any godzilla flick should be
Dec 9 2012,neutral,is it stupid yes is the acting poor probably  is it fun to watch definately  i love the effects and the way they made godzilla look more like a lizardsnake thing
Dec 7 2012,positive,there are some fun moments but overall this one is pretty average
Dec 7 2012,negative,this is not good this is not good      omg it couldnt be more true    well its a remake of the fabled legendary mythical japanese creature godzilla      matthew broderick  dr niko tatopoulos    jean reno  philippe roaché    size matters the movies tag line well yes it does in fact especially when you take into account your dealing with a pile of steaming turd aka this film    there was a reason i got out of bed and godzilla is not one of them  jurassic park was good king kong the original godzilla cloverfiled this on the other hand is what critics eat for breakfast    matthew broderick needs to stick to worms or get a new agent  noted his career is on its way out  jean reno come on man pink panther with steve martin and this  your making a scene  poor france    the effects are good but its so been there done that it goes without saying  and as for little godzillas another drought in script writing    the plot the music its all senseless box office mush      roland emmerich shame on you for inflicting this on me when i was younger    thank god for independence day
Dec 5 2012,negative,i a die hard godzilla fan this waz hate love movie for me  1 this godzilla waz renamed zilla because toho was pissed that they didnt stay true to the real godzilla  2the cgi inthis film waz great  3acting waz good but could hav been better  4he didnt even hav atomic breath    5godzilla cant be killed by 2 rounds of f18 missles fires damnit
Dec 3 2012,positive,godzilla 1998 shows us how wild it is to have a giant lizard walking into the streets of new york
Dec 2 2012,positive,im thinking its jurrasic park meeting up with aliens maybe maybe about too light hearted in saying the beast is abit tamenone the less i think this is a great film and is a classic where is broderick nowadays
Nov 30 2012,neutral,i liked it when i was little but id probably hate it now
Nov 29 2012,negative,godzilla gets an american facelift but even we dont seem skilled enough to revitalize this giant monster
Nov 29 2012,positive,wonderful scenary good characters good effects trys in every way to drift apart from the japanese godzilla
Nov 24 2012,negative,really though just really avoid
Nov 20 2012,negative,pretty lousy movie with special effects that give the big guy no character whatsoever lame
Nov 14 2012,positive,best movie in the world
Nov 11 2012,negative,i was six believe it six years old when i watched it at the theatre and it was the first movie that ive ever watched in a theatre and instead of getting scared because of the monster because i was so young i fell asleep well you know what they all say children never lie
Nov 8 2012,negative,the worst cgi in the history of cinema mathew broderick and all the simpsons actors give the worst performances ive ever seen bland dialogue terrible ideas godzilla is a girl what kind of forced plot is that and lazy crappy direction bravo movie how can you eff up godzilla
Nov 8 2012,positive,the movie started out kinda bad but it got better as i watched it  pros 1 i like godzillas new look  very realistic  2 the way the characters came up with the name godzilla wasnt great but it was probably the best possible way a movie could have  3 there was some good suspense that seemed a little jurassic park with a little aliens even though the suspense itself is nowhere near as good   4 some fairly touching scenes  5 the camera angles were mostly good    cons   1  he just keeps coming back  even in the animated series  whether its him or one of his kids   2 i think they shouldve made it a sequel to the 1933 king kong  maybe peter jackson would do that   3 the movies a bit longer than needed   4 though godzillas look was much more realistic the special effects could use a tiny bit of work   5  subplots arent that great   6  quite a few hokey elements    whether you like the movie or not is your choice i liked it though  the director was actually nominated for awards for both best director and worst director  so its an upsanddowns movie
Nov 5 2012,neutral,i remember this not being too bad but being excited that matt broderick name in the movie was nick i was a child and easily amused
Nov 4 2012,negative,a drooling mess of a film which has dated ugly effects a contrived bumbling plot and laughable action definitely one of roland emmerichs low points
Nov 1 2012,positive,in my view this film is a bit of a classic i understand that i may be among a minority of viewers who agree but i immensely enjoyed the film no its not as good as the japanese films but the creature depicted here is a different creature altogether the film has a great cast excellent soundtrack interesting backstory and some welldirected action sequences why all the hate
Oct 31 2012,negative,not everything that comes from overseas should be amercanized and heres your proof
Oct 26 2012,negative,godzilla is a nice try its loud  energetic great for young boys looking for some gasps  thrills but it doesnt do its source material even close to a justice
Oct 26 2012,positive,oh my god when i was young i watched this several times cant wait for godzilla 2014 
Oct 24 2012,negative,if you want to insult any dead brain cells youve come to the right movie  a film that has absolutely nothing to do with the namesake it follows a radioactive iguana as it digs its way through new york city with matthew broderick chasing after it with dead fish  after the opening credits its all down hill from there
Oct 23 2012,negative,next time you want to make a monster in japan get japanese actors
Oct 22 2012,neutral,as creative as it is unenjoyable for better or worse
Oct 19 2012,negative,worthless insult to the king of monsters
Oct 14 2012,positive,october 2012  february 2017
Oct 14 2012,neutral,actually not that bad when you watch it and just watch  no big messages no superior posturing from anybody  just all out b movie monster and maybe if people would see it as that it might get less of a mauling in the media  the reason it got slammed was the cost but its all on screen  looks good just not enough substance to back up the premise  shame  still like it though for all its faults
Oct 12 2012,positive,the plot for this may be down under but the visual effects on the monster is outstanding
Oct 9 2012,negative,boring drawn out and filled with needless special effects couple that with a very bland performance by matthew broderick and this film destroys any chance it had at being decent watch the original forget this one exists
Oct 8 2012,positive,love this movie so much
Oct 5 2012,positive,i know i probably shouldnt but i really like this strong performances from broderick azaria and the wonderful jean reno
Oct 3 2012,positive,taken for what it isa piece of entertaining inanity its a fun way to spend an afternoon
Sep 30 2012,neutral,weakcant beat toho
Sep 29 2012,positive,seen this film ages ago back in 1998 and it was awesome back then  just watched it again and its even more awesome as  i remembered great stuff 710
Sep 29 2012,negative,what the hell did i just watch
Sep 26 2012,negative,not that bad to me entertaining in parts but a total dump on the sacred toho franchise
Sep 20 2012,positive,this movie gets hated on so much and i dont see why its big loud silly and a lot of fun whats wrong with that
Sep 20 2012,negative,i dont know what to say about this movie
Sep 19 2012,neutral,godzilla science fiction monster film cowritten and directed by roland emmerich considered loose remake of the classic film godzilla this proved another hit disaster saga in late 90s irrespective of its weak script the specialeffects and destruction in the film attracted mass audience i am talking about this part of the world nothing more surprising about this film other than that beast has hit the city
Sep 19 2012,negative,matthew broderick isnt a hero hes a poor mans john cusack it was pretty suspenseful but just not very good
Sep 19 2012,neutral,and people wonder why this didnt relaunch the franchise here in the united states
Sep 18 2012,negative,the only movie that i actually fell asleep watching
Sep 16 2012,neutral,this is the answer to why is jurrasic park 2  was trying to be a bad godzilla rip off of course the answer was that the godzilla franchise was making a bad godzilla rip off the fans deserve someone who cares to make these movies not just money obsessed whores and talentless hacks ready to defile anything in there way to trying to make a name for themselves
Sep 16 2012,positive,a fun cliche monster movie
Sep 15 2012,negative,im a huge godzilla fan and i was really disappointed that they didnt even attempt to make the creature look like godzilla this movie is popcorn entertainment nothing more though i can enjoy it for what it is i am always left wishing that it were actually a real godzilla movie
Sep 14 2012,positive,you know what it maybe a kind of bad remake but it wouldnt be a bad on its own monster movie either if you know what i mean
Sep 14 2012,negative,so emmerichs zilla is an animal trying to survive or an innocent creature who just wanted to be left alone so what does zilla do he destroys new york sigh this movie could have been good movie however the redesign was unnecessary but cool i still refuse to call the titular monster godzilla the characters are flat and kinda boring the lighting was too dark for the effects to be seen properly and godzilla died from a few missile shots gave this film two stars only because of jean reno and matthew brodericks performance which made the movie bearable and because the redesign looks kinda cool
Sep 13 2012,negative,is it really that hard to create a cgi version of the classic japanese kaiju monster  i guess roland emmerich thought it was
Sep 12 2012,negative,this completely ruined the image of godzilla america could have easily made a 10x better film
Sep 11 2012,positive,i honestly liked it i dont see why almost everyone hates it
Sep 10 2012,positive,this was a surprisingly good movie even if it didnt live up to the godzilla formula
Sep 4 2012,positive,a good american reimagination of the japanese monster  that had spawned a lot of films for at least a century  by the independence day director whod  done a good job on this monster film that contains rare somewhat emotions unmatched animation thats low sometimes and a formula hed started using on his future films it seems he also uses a formation of good pacing and good thrills that are comparable to jurassic park b    full review coming soon  requires another viewing probably
Sep 3 2012,negative,why couldent it have eaten broderick
Sep 3 2012,negative,a unmitigated failure for both fans of the 1954 classic and the unsuspecting movie buff the modernday american godzilla offers little more than stereotyped characters and bythenumbers plotting made worse by a lack of pace it is also a career lowpoint for roland emmerich who at the very least managed to keep audiences entertained with his previous films ie independence day one can hope that gareth edwards doesnt fall into the same traps when the newest installment premieres in 2014
Sep 3 2012,positive,viewed on 19804 thurs    i really enjoy the parts when godzilla goes on a rampage it is pure entertainment and i want to see more of that like a kid keep asking for more candies the movie does not disappoint in this aspect it is less talk and more sfx already i like this more than id4 and the day after tomorrow     i dont really buy the idea of godzilla trapped under the cables at the bridge how will they know the cables will trap it the bridge doesnt collapse given the sheer size of it it even jumped     nah looking for loopholes in this kind of sfx blockbuster is really spoiling the fun of watching it we should not take it so seriously so must the movie i think that is why bgrade horror films always has a huge base of fans a movie like this serve better with more visual thrills pump money in the sfx department and go all out to entertain the only way to blow it is to insert some human drama the actors and their stories are not at the centrestage we pay money to see godzilla only so omit the cheesy happy ending i will cheer when godzilla is dead but never for the characters comingofage     i also dont like them making fun of my beloved uncle ebert too it makes them look more like sore losers    the hint of a sequel is laughable now that we know so many hated this movie so much that they scrapped the idea     i think i will like this movie more and maybe many others if the movie takes itself less seriously and just enthrall us with those awesome awesome visual effects     rating b
Sep 2 2012,positive,an extremely underrated creature feature that sports some awesome special effects godzilla is hurt by its lack of physical resemblance to tohos iconic monster though its impossible to deny that emmerichs iteration is slick beautiful and even sympathetic this godzilla is an animal not a monster
Sep 2 2012,negative,the cgi ruins any potential godzilla contained and just like must others roland emmerich had to have a low point in his career
Aug 27 2012,positive,i like a little corn on the side of my ham n cheese sandwich
Aug 26 2012,negative,size does matter then why does zilla thats what toho renamed the the american godzilla gets shot down by the military the real godzilla never does have they ever watched a real godzilla movie
Aug 26 2012,neutral,if this wasnt a godzilla movie it would have then been a pretty decent film but because it bears the name and is indeed a godzilla film it suffers i did enjoy the film but did not like the fact it was godzilla this film is reccomended to those who like b movies but not so much to godzilla fans
Aug 24 2012,positive,i love the japanese versions but i actually liked this one too
Aug 23 2012,negative,great way to screw over godzilla no sorry zilla
Aug 22 2012,positive,it was one of those movies which i really enjoyed in my childhood 
Aug 21 2012,negative,watching matt broderick play hideandseek with a giant lizard around new york for a hour and a half was very boring star for effort
Aug 18 2012,positive,i know the acting is badawkward and the effects look dated now but its still a guilty pleasure for me jean reno kinda makes the movie
Aug 17 2012,positive,roland emmerich at his best imho another manhattan set with a dinosaur which stomps the magnificent skyline of nyc maybe this one would have been a great mocukmentary maybe there would have been more suspension of disbelief not such a great ending though better wacthed on tv
Aug 15 2012,negative,this movie was almost comicalpretty bad
Aug 15 2012,negative,cant touch the real godzilla this was a big lizard
Aug 14 2012,negative,i tried liking this one i really did it had genetics but the science was not even close it had action but poor thought processes helicopters wouldnt fly straight up to avoid being eaten really i even like broderick in most cases but here hes just a whiny kid with a dumb look on his face the entire 2 hours which mind you was way too long without having anything worthwhile to say
Aug 14 2012,negative,should of been named something besides godzilla
Aug 12 2012,negative,the worst godzilla movie ever created the cast was terrible and it was more like jurassic park crossed with independence dayjust terrible it pays no tribute to classic godzilla movies at all and doesnt deserve the name godzilla it shouldve been named jurassic park 3 or something i just watched it again for the heck of it and was reminded of the absolute terrible acting terrible tribute to staying true to godzilla and the overall pile of crap it is no idea how this final cut made it to the big screensterrible     the only thing this movie has done was given the japanese an extra monster to kill in godzilla final wars where he smokes this joke godzilla
Aug 12 2012,positive,dont understand the hate for his movie  the american version had to be different and the update i thought was good  people like to say oh you cant kill godzilla did you ever see the original movie where he dies at the end that was the best one and they killed him in it my only problem with the film is the terrible acting we see in it from time to time
Aug 9 2012,negative,this movie has aged horribly
Aug 7 2012,neutral,average bumped for nostalgia much like billy madison bumped further for general love of creature films dont worry im well aware of its shortcomings
Aug 4 2012,negative,watching now  worse than i remember and i remember it being pretty bad
Aug 2 2012,negative,godzilla is an incompetent clunky and brainless blockbuster with uninspiring visuals and wooden performances almost enters into sobaditsgood territory but is just dull and banal
Jul 31 2012,positive,nice visual effects
Jul 28 2012,positive,this movie was not that bad yes it was very different from the japanese films but that does not mean that it was a terrible movie to some extent it was kind of similar i am a huge godzilla fan monster movie fan in general and i was entertained it was a little too long though
Jul 28 2012,negative,not the godzilla i remembered
Jul 27 2012,negative,this movie is garbage the monster looks nothing like godzilla the military isnt supposed to kill him f
Jul 27 2012,negative,my favorite part was the ending i was glad to know that the terrible actors would probably die
Jul 23 2012,positive,like the music score a lil overated
Jul 23 2012,positive,should have been the remake for the beast from 20000 fathoms
Jul 20 2012,negative,theres a lot of fish theres also a lot of plot holes stale dialogue and annoying characters and a lame monster godzilla has never looked more shameful
Jul 20 2012,negative,this is not godzilla
Jul 19 2012,positive,it was a good film having a huge destructive lizard on the loose is completely barmy though but the special effects are decent enough to be a hit
Jul 19 2012,negative,i cant even express how horrible this was it had no charm or quirkiness with it at all  it never hooked me in like the old godzilla films do it isnt exciting at all
Jul 17 2012,positive,the most underestimated movieof alltime
Jul 17 2012,positive,as a generic monster movie its ok as a godzilla movie its crap
Jul 15 2012,negative,this was a desparate attempt to bring back the old movie  didnt work that well
Jul 9 2012,positive,a giant lizard mutated by nuclear fallout invades nyc
Jul 9 2012,positive,its a guilty pleasure
Jul 9 2012,positive,a radical redesign of the creature ran down this film
Jul 8 2012,positive,this is awesome and adventurous
Jul 1 2012,negative,not even close to the original godzilla franchise this is roland emmerichs halfass version of this movie with bajillion rip offs stupidest plot holes and much more very stupid and very bad movie
Jun 30 2012,positive,not my fav but it was fun
Jun 30 2012,negative,dedicated to tomoyuki tanaka    no seriously they have officially ruined the name of the great king of monsters    but at least we hope that the 2014 movie is faithful than this no wait its already faithful
Jun 29 2012,positive,lol fukin gr8 and am still waitin 4 da second lol
Jun 27 2012,negative,not quite so bad its good the french characters interrogation of the japanese cook is the most telling scene of the films quality
Jun 26 2012,neutral,very few parts stuck out some can call it an action movie others call it horror emmerich who is normally an over achiever took a lot of shortcuts in this remake im really not sure what it was to be honest
Jun 25 2012,positive,what tha fuck mang  why hate this film  this movie was fun  better than average
Jun 23 2012,neutral,yeah it is kinda stupid but i kinda actually liked it

Jun 20 2012,negative,holy shit that was awful
Jun 18 2012,positive,i thought the animation was good and the cast was fantastic it was my favorite godzilla just cuz it was in english and the animation was the best it has been
Jun 17 2012,neutral,better than the general consensus but its definitely not a good movie it is just ok the action and special effects are great but the characters are uninteresting and annoying at times its the type of film that while it doesnt suck and is completely watchable it is also forgettable
Jun 17 2012,neutral,some dirty words show americans cant create a good godzilla
Jun 16 2012,negative,so the god in godzilla is gone huh well awkward performances aside this is just lacking as an action film and the romance story sucks too
Jun 16 2012,negative,im sad he died at the endbrodrick awful casting
Jun 15 2012,positive,honestly im not sure why people hate this movie so much  it came out and was immediately panned and its heralded as one of the epic busts in cinematic history  it really wasnt that bad  it was fun even though it had a stupid ending and the cgi was good even though they made godzilla look kinda stupid
Jun 14 2012,positive,really cool movie enjoyed it
Jun 13 2012,negative,watched it when i was little thought it was cool but then after seeing every real godzilla movie and watched this again it sucked tristar didnt even keep any of the same traits as the original to me this is less of a remake and more of a different creature  ps the real godzilla is invincible and doesnt get killed by missiles like this thing
Jun 11 2012,negative,it isnt a godzilla movie this is an episode of sex and the city with the trex from jurassic park 2
Jun 10 2012,negative,completely unfaithful to the original godzilla
Jun 10 2012,positive,all i can say was that i loved it as a kid
Jun 9 2012,neutral,overdone story beast stalks a big city ie king kong or godzilla or dinosaurs
Jun 9 2012,positive,very good monster movie but shouldnt be titled godzilla    this creature isnt godzilla i really like the design though    the story and characters are interesting    3 new york in this
Jun 6 2012,negative,another roland emmerich disaster  could possibly be the most inconsistent movie i have ever seen  cast is just awful  within one minute you see the whole cast of the simpsons  matthew broderick is atrocious as always  special effects a horrid  just plain stupid  i laughed through the whole thing and i dont think you were supposed to
Jun 5 2012,positive,there is no getting around the fact that this movie is a huge mess but its still a nostalgic guilty pleasure for me
Jun 5 2012,neutral,special effects saved this movie  i enjoyed hank azarias character
Jun 4 2012,positive,i understand the hate this movie gets  being a godzilla fan like myself i know how far this movie deviates from the original story line and purpose just because its different doesnt automatically make it blasphemy it has action suspense drama and impressive sfx  considering the time it was released which is pretty much what a typical godzilla movies is all about  it was a very enjoyable concept and i am disappointed that it did not have a chance to produce a sequel 
Jun 3 2012,positive,its a very american version of the japanese monster but is still enjoyable and classic to me
Jun 3 2012,neutral,a cheesy monster movie that now feels dated but wouldve been an enjoyable exciting and engaging film at the time of its release with mediocre acting and a predictable storyline godzilla will come up as average to most
Jun 2 2012,negative,godzilla is privileged to occupy a special place on my movie wall of shame it is easily the dumbest movie of the 90s a decade where making dumb movies was a good career move and makes director roland emmerichs previous effort indepence day sound like oscarcaliber material the writing is so disjointed and contrived that it feels like any scene without carnage or explosions in it was left on the cutting room floor basically a group of scientists army officials and news reporters chase and get chased by the titular character who arrives in new york with the intention of stomping on everything in sight the special effects may be wellexecuted but there is more soulless filmmkaing present here than in the entire transformers franchise leading man matthew broderick makes a terrible action hero and looks embarrassed to be there jean reno a proven cinematic gunslinger also looks considerably out of his depth the point is this watching godzilla might simulate the effects of a lobotomy which i hear is not the greatest experience in the world
Jun 1 2012,neutral,i think that everybody is allowed to like one bad roland emmerich film godzilla has many flaws but manages to keep me entertained
May 30 2012,negative,thats a  lot of fish
May 30 2012,negative,oh so hilariously awful

May 28 2012,positive,awesome movie an old classic

May 25 2012,negative,this movie is miss titled it should be called nyc under attack this was a horrible lizard movie
May 24 2012,negative,thats a lot of fail
May 23 2012,negative,horrible actinghorrible movie horrible script just about everything about this film sucked
May 22 2012,positive,okay so the cg effects are borderline terrible and the performances dont ring inspiring but this movie will always be a childhood favorite of mine to me it doesnt convey the message of how harmful the effects of nuclear fallout could be in the metaphor of a monster but i look at this remake as a popcorn thriller all in good fun
May 22 2012,negative,people would gun down 100s of baby godzillas and a father one who only came to new york to live and eat fish
May 21 2012,positive,think i might be the only person in the world that liked zilla sure hes not the original but as a fan of monsters i loved his or her design rest of the movie isnt so hot
May 20 2012,negative,all monsters attack is probably the worst of the toho godzilla films but this is so much worse
May 19 2012,negative,thats a lot of fish
May 14 2012,positive,the monsters design really wasnt bad it just had the misfortune of being godzilla bringing shame to sweaty men in rubber suits everywhere ew stratch that last part i liked the idea of godzilla being an egglaying female and i believe cloverfield owed more to this movie than it would like to admit but broderick should not have been cast in the lead role and the monster shouldnt have been called godzilla
May 13 2012,negative,lo ãºnico bueno el soundtrack the wallflowers
May 12 2012,positive,wasnt as bad as everyone makes out i enjoyed it dont really know what people who liked the original expected a guy in a rubber suit
May 12 2012,negative,what a jurassic park ripoff piece of shit the japanese actors in the original were more convincing than any hollywood star slumming it here this is what happens when studios throw a bunch of money at a property they have no idea how to adapt
May 12 2012,negative,pretty bad matthew broderick sucks as usual
May 9 2012,neutral,not as bad as its reviews but still not a good film
May 9 2012,negative,i found it hilarious how they tried to scientifically explain everything  it makes the giant lizard seem far more real  at least he was reptilian and not a man in a lame suitright
May 8 2012,negative,flat dialogue and story plus bad monster cgi made this a popcorn flick  as in the popcorn was better than the movie
May 7 2012,positive,godzilla is a fun cheesy movie which i enjoyed a lot godzilla had a solid cast with lots of fun action scenes its just a fun horror action movie which though lacks scares it just really fun to watch roland emmerich is a really great disaster film director and just from start to finish i know it was him that directed it and i really think he is underrated in my opinion i enjoyed this movie and it was fun to watch although it lacked scares and it was chessy here and there and definitely unrealistic it was still fun to watch but it was flawed for sure
May 2 2012,negative,maybe the worst movie ever made
May 1 2012,positive,a great american version of the low budget graphic japanesse version
Apr 29 2012,positive,matthew broderick makes this godzilla feature absolutely fine for a laidback blockbuster viewing even if it admits its silliness a little at times
Apr 29 2012,negative,disappointing more than anything
Apr 28 2012,positive,really cool i wonder if theyre making a sequel
Apr 26 2012,negative,great soundtrack horrible movie
Apr 24 2012,positive,where is godzilla 2  i know this version wasnt a man in a rubber suit crashing through a scale model of tokyo but it was really good  i realize it was cheezy in places but have you ever watched an original godzilla film
Apr 22 2012,positive,i dont understand everyones hang up over this film its a solid blockbuster in the vein of id4 and far better than day after tomorrow or 2012
Apr 21 2012,positive,best godzilla ever for my money
Apr 19 2012,neutral,coulve been so much better
Apr 17 2012,positive,liked it as a kidi couldnt help it
Apr 16 2012,positive,very asome and better than the others godzilla movies
Apr 15 2012,neutral,an ok monster movie but this is not the real godzilla
Apr 15 2012,negative,all i have to say is that was no godzilla
Apr 15 2012,neutral,this halfbaked remake of the tried and true japanese godzilla stacks nowhere as high as the original gojira 1954 in terms of originality or story the human characters are really just there as filler with matthew broderick and maria patillo as annoying as they could be and the screenplay seems to chase itself around trying to make a meaningful story of itself not to mention it features morethanobvious ripoffs of other american science fiction films    not to mention that the writing was also quite cowardly to blame the french for this supposed terror on the us is just petty and emerich and devlin dont even take full advantage of their siskel and ebert parodies as much as i love the two whats the point of trying to get back at them if youre not even going to take   advantage of it  however if you can distance yourself from the idea that this is supposed to be a godzilla film its still a lot of harmless fun the creature designswhile a little too far from classic japanese monster fare are still quite interesting the effects are fantastic for their time and theres a lot of nice atmosphere with the rain and fogso while the film is far from original if you can just forget that its supposed to be a godzilla movie its still a lot of dumb stupid fun
Apr 15 2012,neutral,not emmerichs best but still a very fun ride
Apr 14 2012,negative,jurassic park with only one dinosaur and a lousy script  but still entertaining in its own corny way
Apr 13 2012,positive,ok its not the same godzilla that we knew and loved from the japanese series its poorly written its cheesyridiculous at times even but still was a fun ride while it lasted
Apr 11 2012,neutral,i actually kinda liked that they decided to make godzilla just an animal  he is the main thing that the characters are working against but it allows you to still feel bad when he ultimately dies  its not his fault he had to go down he just wanted to carry out his lifecycle and procreate  but we humans were here first and he was really fixin to fuck up the whole dominant species thing for us so we did what we had to do  come on at least emmerich and devlin didnt decide to make him a space alien right
Apr 11 2012,positive,i want to see this again so badly the best godzilla movie ever
Apr 11 2012,positive,it may not of been a rubber suit but not a bad americanized version either
Apr 10 2012,positive,saw only parts of it when i was 8 and now that i am older i saw the whole thing and liked it i now recognized the main actors who are matthew broderick and jean reno the most memorable scene for me from this movie is when hank azarias character nearly gets stomped on by godzilla
Apr 8 2012,neutral,this american adaptation of godzilla is not entirely horrible i mean matthew broderick does a pretty good job with his performance the cgi was actually grand especially when we get our first look of this creature but not scary enough to make it like other relating subgenre  although this version is not as good as the original japanese godzilla but this still was entertaining
Apr 8 2012,negative,simply an abomination
Apr 8 2012,negative,the movie from day one was meant to be just a big effects laden action movie its about comic book character
Apr 7 2012,positive,well i liked it it was silly nottakentooseriously entertaining fun and the graphics could have been worse clumsy and cliched and nothing special but a decent popcorn flick
Apr 7 2012,positive,roland emmerichs godzilla is just a lot of stupid fun what makes a film this stupid so enjoyable is that its constructed like a theme park ride its got flashy special effects for the 90s that is big name stars acting like fools a plot you dont have to think about and plenty of giddy thrills like all of emmerichs disaster pictures godzilla is mindless silly silly fun
Apr 6 2012,neutral,it could have been better i enjoyed parts
Apr 6 2012,positive,you cant say godzilla didnt look cool in this  nor can you say that the fight scenes between her and the army werent cool  and the guy with the camera was funny
Apr 5 2012,negative,the creature depicted in this film bears littleno resemblance to the japanese icon but thats not what makes this a bad movie what makes it a bad movie is the weak script uninvolving action scenes and terrible acting  seriously matthew broderick makes that kid from godzilla vs megalon seem like a master in comparison
Apr 5 2012,negative,being a fan of the original japanese films i think this is a horrible excuse for a godzilla film
Apr 5 2012,negative,they made a godzilla movie boring that should not be possible
Apr 5 2012,positive,if youre looking for a giant monster attacking the city type of movie then godzilla is alot of fun and thats exactly what this movie is 8 10
Apr 5 2012,positive,basically what youd expect from a godzilla movie
Apr 3 2012,positive,i loved it when it first came out but now that i am older and understand film better i must say this film was a wasted opportunity for what could of been a great film too much camp in this film to be taken seriously
Apr 3 2012,positive,why is it raining in every scene matthew boringerick  godzilla looks cool
Apr 1 2012,positive,i would like for the producers to do over the movie and make the graphics  better
Apr 1 2012,neutral,i have rewatched this movie after like 10 years and i have to say this movie is very repetitive its either godzilla or its babies chasing around the humans who are either running or driving i only give it a 50 because its fun to watch all the mindless action and the cgi from 1998 now we need an actual good remake
Apr 1 2012,neutral,at first i was ready to give it a good review but by the end i was waiting and waiting for the end because as it got on it just kind of wasnt working for me
Mar 31 2012,positive,my 1 favorite movie on this earth ive seen it 176 times
Mar 31 2012,negative,back in 1998 a new godzilla movie was promised to the world cgi was a booming technology and people were making big movies with it it still continues today ad infinitum but back in those days we hadnt become sick of it yet roland emmerichs big budget turd came and went but managed to snag a healthy amount of box office in retrospect its probably his worst film and thats saying a lot i mean come on matthew broderick as an action hero thats pretty absurd right off the bat it doesnt help much that hes surrounded by a lot of crap namely the story and the dialogue the special effects were pretty good for the time not great but pretty good so the movie itself is pretty awful but i did enjoy the recent rifftrax live show of the movie thats about the only way to enjoy it in my opinion
Mar 31 2012,positive,i liked it rewatched it after years still liked it its fun matthew broderick is fantastic so sincere really nice guy and i hear simba every time he talks this movie had a huge lizard new york city getting wrecked mini godzillas in the end and an amazing ensemble cast which really made the movie funny its a family film not to be taken too seriously and my god jean reno exceptional worth a watch if ya havent seen it and the soundtrack is pretty good
Mar 29 2012,negative,the geico lizard was more scary
Mar 29 2012,negative,another american remake that has failed completely  mathew broderick just seems out of place throughout the whole movie and adds nothing to the overall enjoyment of the film  the scenes where godzilla is present are ok but for the most part its just a giant lizard running through the streets while the army is chasing it  if your thinking about watching this movie dont  i suggest watching the original before going to this
Mar 28 2012,negative,garbage and not a real godzilla movie
Mar 24 2012,positive,an okay update of the original monster film
Mar 23 2012,positive,cool movie but what comes after the end  it sets up for a sequel
Mar 20 2012,positive,i can keep watching it  best scene trying to scape from madison square garden
Mar 18 2012,positive,its not as bad as they say it is
Mar 13 2012,positive,what this is easily better than the day after tomorrow
Mar 13 2012,positive,i can keep watching it  best scene trying to scape from madison square garden
Mar 11 2012,positive,for some reason i find this movie so lovable yes its stupid as hell but ill still watch it whenever its on
Mar 11 2012,neutral,as a godzilla movie its horrible the creature bares hardly any resemblance to the real godzilla and has a similar but still different back story as a monster movie though i thought it was ok the cgi wasnt too good in some scenes but in others it was fine the characters arent too great though but its a fun movie to make fun of and has some good scenes but isnt at all what i would have wanted from an american godzilla film
Mar 9 2012,negative,movie full of itself overdone lame act and directing not so great special effects a lot of cliches generic ingredients dialog lines and brodericks act is like a wet and beaten lost puppy shaking hungry in front of meatstore as i like reno here he was little help to improve overal bad taste of this movie
Mar 7 2012,negative,okay im probably the only one who kind of liked it
Mar 7 2012,neutral,the cast is likable enough but the movie feels more like a universal studios ride than a movie it also feels like roland emmerich expected a huge it by trying to make godzilla jurassic park meets independence day  while not trying to even make a faithful godzila movie
Mar 4 2012,negative,decent little movie a bit lame but worth watching  i felt so bad when godzilla died at the end i almost cried
Mar 4 2012,negative,one of the most overproduced overhyped misfires ive ever seen
Mar 3 2012,positive,i seen this show in high school this movie is alright
Mar 3 2012,positive,great movie amazing effects pretty bad story okay acting
Mar 2 2012,negative,if theyd have called it something other than godzilla i might have liked it more
Mar 2 2012,negative,hey remember when from like fall 97 to the spring release in 98 the teasers trailers tv spots posters and taco bell commercials never showed godzilla and we were all excited to see what hed look like yeah thats about the only great thing i can say about this shit    this movie is one big slap in the face
Mar 1 2012,negative,not worthy of the name godzilla
Mar 1 2012,negative,some good effects cant overcome the bad acting annoying characters lame story atrocious writing and worst of all a total retooling of the design of the titular monster to look just stupid such a shame an updated godzilla has always had such potential
Feb 29 2012,negative,way back i was so pumped to finally be allowed to see godzilla as a kid but even back then i was dissapointed though i didnt know why now many years later i realize that godzillas biggest flaw despite being not good in general is the lack of humor not a single joke to spice up things godzilla ends up taking itself way to serious
Feb 27 2012,neutral,its not really a big movie like the big monster in the film  but its still worth to watch thanks to the special effects
Feb 26 2012,negative,so emmerich appears to have seen jaws and jurassic park but unfortunately none of the godzilla movies the cgi holds up fairly well the actors performancesnot so much broderick looks terrified reno is embarrassing and all the rest just happy to be involved before scuttling back to cable tv if the original gojira had arrived in his rubber suit playing a tv reporter i think hed have had a shot at a more heartfelt performance woeful
Feb 25 2012,positive,look guys i know this movie is terrible but i have a soft spot for godzilla and this film is such a guilty pleasure i mean its loud dumb and action packed and its also unintentionally hilarious some of the dialogue is hard to not laugh at my favourite line in particular coming from a scene where a helicopter pilot is being chased by godzilla and says i cant shake him someone should have told the bastard godzilla cant fly xd
Feb 22 2012,negative,26 are you guys serious
Feb 20 2012,neutral,i saw it when  i was a child
Feb 19 2012,negative,godzilla was a movie i enjoyed when i was younger i watch it now and it is just stupid the effects suck godzilla looks like a dinosaur and the storyline and plot sucks it is a  very stupid movie and i think i overrated it terrible just terrible
Feb 18 2012,negative,they taunt godzilla and then kill it  typical environmentalist yahoo movie
Feb 18 2012,neutral,this doesnt have any of the things i liked about the original japanese godzilla films but taken on its own merits its not bad nick the worm guy seems curiously unemotional about everything thats going on but id rather watch that than people screaming at each other the romantic subplot worked reasonably well because theyd previously dated for 4 years so they didnt need to fall in love based on any events in here its rather odd that the us military had no ability to aim on their own relying on technology to do everything for them but never mind i thought that it was ending with an anticlimax but then the film kept going and had a better ending
Feb 17 2012,negative,i wish early on godzilla had killed every character in this film    still at least it allows the sequel to be made  son of godzilla or jesuszilla as it will be called      jesuszilla in which a 500 ft tall jesus stomps around the us destroying every postnazarene structure and bringing about biblical plague to revert humanity to a prescientific state    the emotional conflict will come from each character from apache pilot to politician as they decide whether to save their family or destroy their apocalyptic saviour    do you accept a short painful medicine and technology free life and hope for your reward in heaven  or do you hope that whatever jesuszilla is  its not the son of god    im writing all this while godzilla is still on  shit film eh
Feb 17 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time  highly under rated try watching it without expecting some shakespearean masterpiece
Feb 14 2012,positive,i love this movie i gets a lot of hate because emmerichs idea of totally changing godzilla was not well recieved by the fans the movie critics didnt like it because it has no character development then again this is a monster movie so character development is not required this movie is not meant to be taken seriously it is a popcorn movie just like other emmerich films people say this movie is stupid and yet must of them are japanese godzilla fans dont get me wrong i love the japanese movies as well but they are as corny and dumb as this movie the special effects here still hold today and matthew broderick did a great job as the nerdy guy i recommend this movie if you want an entertaining but silly movie
Feb 13 2012,negative,the film is an insult to the 1954 original film
Feb 13 2012,positive,for ste  a classic
Feb 10 2012,positive,this was a favorite of mine as a youngster and i havent watched it in a while so the rating 3 stars could drop that being said i thought this godzilla was a good one although matthew broderick may of been the wrong choice to headline it
Feb 9 2012,negative,some of the action is nicesometimes
Feb 8 2012,neutral,cgi cannot beat a guy in a rubber suit
Feb 8 2012,negative,was this even a godzilla movie bitch please hand it over to the japanese
Feb 7 2012,neutral,it souldnt be called godzilla
Feb 7 2012,neutral,there were some redemptions but it is a dump of a film why does jean reno do this
Feb 7 2012,positive,just another summer money making blockbuster with an epic trailer all showing the best special efects and nothing in between
Feb 5 2012,negative,lame and boring any giant monster movie that focuses on the humans is missing the point
Feb 3 2012,positive,as bad as this is i still get a kick out of it  the effects are dated and the acting is laughable but things go boom real nice  i am in the minority but ill still watch it every few years
Feb 1 2012,positive,yep another godzilla movie
Jan 30 2012,negative,what went wrongeverything
Jan 29 2012,negative,action packed but laughably bad in just about everything else horrbly bad and cliche filled script with lame and offensive attemps at humor
Jan 22 2012,positive,pretty cool but nothing like the classics
Jan 21 2012,negative,ill take the flabby rubber japanese gojiro over the high tech hollywood lizard any day
Jan 19 2012,negative,the classics are much much better
Jan 19 2012,positive,this movie could have been alot better
Jan 19 2012,neutral,a plot is predictable
Jan 18 2012,negative,thats a lot of fish
Jan 17 2012,positive,i know its a bad movie but i still love it itll always be a guilty pleasure for me
Jan 12 2012,positive,cool movie  loved seeing the huge godzilla running around the city being chased by helicopters etc
Jan 10 2012,negative,see the originals dont waste time on this one
Jan 7 2012,negative,a bad attempt at remaking a classic monster
Jan 5 2012,positive,one of my favorites believe it or not
Jan 3 2012,positive,its a good godzilla movie very fun and entertaining throughout its still better then the new one that came out the special effects are still good
Jan 3 2012,neutral,it just never felt fully cemented in terms of a big budget monster movie
Jan 2 2012,positive,love it as a kid but i loved anything with godzillas name slapped on it now adaysi just think its not a very good godzilla moviescrew that it just showed how you can make so much money can make with a pile of crap as long as it has a strong license attached to it
Dec 29 2011,negative,this is one of  the worst movies ive ever seen i clearly remember falling asleep in the theater in the middle of the movie waiting long for the dinosaur to appear nothing impressed me i was not surprised when i learned that this film was nominated and awarded as the worst movie of the year at that time
Dec 28 2011,positive,good movie to turn the lights down and pop some porcorn
Dec 27 2011,negative,only a butcher could mess this up more
Dec 27 2011,negative,i realized how bad it was after seeing the original gojira film
Dec 25 2011,negative,another classic movie that everybody should see but kinda sucky
Dec 23 2011,negative,its entertaining but the name godzilla doesnt fit the movies monster so it needs to be changed to zilla 
Dec 23 2011,negative,monster movies dont necessarily have to be smart or even scary they do have to be fun though and that is where godzilla fails dragged further down by awful writing and even worse acting godzilla is just a train wreck thats not a lot of fish just a pile of shit
Dec 20 2011,positive,ill give this one the old not too bad
Dec 20 2011,negative,the story has no strong elements to impress the audience and actually does the opposite of impress godzilla is supposed to be strong powerful and does not lay eggs like a chicken this is an incompetent slave and disgrace to the far more superior japanese films from 1954 to 1995 produced by tomoyuki tanaka
Dec 12 2011,negative,hated it i want my money back from the theater so stupid
Dec 12 2011,neutral,with a great plot this movie fell to launch at its best the action was great but the whole idea of huge monster laying eggs in the middle of a city fail to appeal to the audience a strong cast with a short live attraction
Dec 12 2011,neutral,dumb action with cheesy dialogue
Dec 9 2011,negative,unforgivably awful  i kept hoping that dumb lizard would just die so that i could carry on with my life  im no cinema snob but humanstupidity is a stupid plot device  and if you invent pseudoscience at least apply it consistently withn the universe of your own film
Dec 9 2011,positive,another guilty pleasure of mine i give this such a high rating more for its personal nostalgic value as this was one of my favorites as a kid but this is pretty much a horrible movie     the script is some of the worst writing i have ever heard in a movie ever the acting is straight up putrid even as 12 year old child we referred to broderick as nick the bad actor pitillo is simply pitiful i cant imagine why she never ever acted in hollywood again azaria lerner dunn pretty much everyone is total shite of course with a script like this they were doomed no matter who they were reno is the only cast member who turns in even a semipassable performance     the monster is great bigger badder and way cooler than his japanese predecessor and the effects are great really good battle sequences are definitely the only highlight of the movie bad pacing as there are long lulls dispersed throughout and the whole baby godzilla subplot is ridiculous     while it is interesting to see the cheesy rubber version brought into the 20th century anything beyond the action sequences is dribble still its very entertaining once you get past the awful script and acting
Dec 5 2011,negative,this film is a complete mess lets be honest most of the gozilla films were not high class entertainment however they were so cheesy they were good they were just something to watch when you just wanted mind numbing action  but this movie is a mockery of that it tries to pull a serious aproach but the bad cast and ridiculously stupid story makes this an insult to the godzilla name
Dec 5 2011,positive,it might not be the critics favorite but i like these kind of movies when the effects are good which they are in this one the only thing is that theres not really any suspence before they introduce the monster really early in the filmits also a bit sad that the leftwingenvironmentalistmorons had to get a bit of bashing of france and nuclear tests in there
Dec 4 2011,neutral,it could have been better but what do i know i do know this jean reno turned down the role of mrsmith in the matrix so he could play in this movie
Dec 2 2011,negative,i hated this monster movie  first of all the effects were not good it sucked  godzilla looked like a t rex not a dragon  so many cliche and stupid moments in the plot that it sucked too much  this movie had many flaws and they all keep it from being good overall the movie sucked beyond all belief
Dec 1 2011,negative,i like it in a this film just shaved 10 points off my iq sort of way
Nov 29 2011,negative,well what shall i say about this mess the biggest mistake they made was calling it godzilla because thats exactly not what it is its an uninspired high budget ripoff the monster zilla would rather fit into jurassic park and after all the most entertaining or least disappointing scenes are the ones where  zilla is on screen and that tells a lot about the talking parts which are just unnecessary i personally think that zilla gets what hesheit deserves in godzilla final wars where the real godzilla beats the shit out of it and annihilates it in less then 30 seconds and that should be done with this movie  godzilla needs one atomic blast to kill zilla and thats all the movie gets from me 1 blast out of 10
Nov 27 2011,positive,3826  tsschkk  i thought it was great  watch once yeah
Nov 23 2011,neutral,im not a fan enough to hate godzilla based on the originals being ive never seen the originals i in fact thought the creature design in this one was cool and by 1998 standards the special effects were the tits  granted its super silly in some bits the acting is terrible and storyline isnt worth remembering but ive still a huge soft spot for this flick based on the fact i thought it was the coolest shit id seen when i first saw it as a kid
Nov 21 2011,negative,way better then jaws i even had a godzilla toytrue story
Nov 20 2011,negative,this extremely stupid monster movie has nothing in common with the legendary toho series aside from its name in fact it would make a lot more sense if this were a remake of the 1953 bmovie classic the beast from 20000 fathoms  the story in this film is very similar to that black  white stopmotion cheesefest when i first encountered the film in 1998 as a teenager i hated it  i expected more action more destruction more suspense and less time with the human characters  my vehement disregard for the film has tempered a bit with age and today i regard the film as a slight amusement with nifty special effects and a few fun setpieces  sure i can still spot the moments that are ripped from better films and the human characters are just so stupid that they fail to win my sympathy theyre all better off as lizard food as far as im concerned  the best thing about the film is david arnolds majestic film score as it works so well that it manages to be a joyous listening experience divorced from the film  on the whole godzilla is a disappointment to anyone who is a fan of the toho series but for anyone who is in the mood for a silly monster movie with souped up effects its a mildly enjoyable diversion
Nov 18 2011,negative,generic rubbish monster movie
Nov 16 2011,positive,as is the case with every emmerich disaster flick the uninteresting and pointless human drama gets in the way of the wanton destruction were all there to see  still this is an underrated installment in the giant monster movie canon
Nov 16 2011,positive,the only film roland emerrich had directed that i enjoyed up until now was the day after tommorow which wasnt that great anyway godzilla is far from perfect but better than dat the typical aggresiveness of cgi in most of his movies like independence day and 10000 bc are so mind blowing that it causes the films to fall to ruins the films didnt have to be that aggressive because of their plotlines that could have turned them into modern epics with his remake of godzilla like the original japanese film the effects and characters are necessary to the storyline you do however have to be in a dumb mood to enjoy it i was
Nov 12 2011,negative,when bringing a foreign film and adapting it to hollywood often times the deeper meaning behind it can be lost in translation this is true for godzilla sadly which is just a nominal movie about a mutant dinosaur
Nov 11 2011,positive,changed my mind this movies not that bad
Nov 11 2011,positive,i love this movie
Nov 10 2011,positive,they dont come much bigger and louder than godzilla though not the special effects spectacle it once was roland emmerichs creature disaster movie remains a severely flawed but thoroughly entertaining popcorn movie that might be the sort of thing thats nominated for razzie awards several in fact but its also the sort of thing people go to see in droves at the end of the day its just fine for what it is and wants to be and in that light godzilla is a success on its own playing field
Nov 7 2011,positive,if u are living at outskirts somewhere like siberia and have only got the option to see godzilla than it isnt such a bad idea after all the film was released after the huge success of already present two monster films jurassic park 1  2 and therefore this could be the reason for film not receiving much attention since people were very much done seeing gigantic reptiles overall the film wasnt much of bad idea but yes the destruction of the city scenes were badly done and so grading it 610
Nov 7 2011,neutral,just deliver cheap graphics
Nov 6 2011,negative,its an emmerich movie destructiondoomsdaytype film but just like all his other generally overhyped films it falls flat its just bad and the fact that his godzilla looks nothing like the godzilla from the 22 godzilla films before it makes it unbearable to even watch seriously emmerich himself said he didnt like the godzilla movies so why make one this movie is just awful they should rename it zilla its not worthy of god
Nov 4 2011,negative,ill be the first to admit that im not exactly a fan of roland emmerichs work but i was intrigued to see what he would do with godzilla i was hopeful during the films opening moments it looked like emmerich was going to give the franchise the respect it deserves but it dissolves into yet another lets blow crap up epic that weve come to expect from the auteur theres no heart here and the film takes itself way too seriously to even be campy fun like the earlier japanese pictures its just big loud and dumb  the special effects are admittedly impressive as this is one bloated blockbuster where you can actually see the budget on the screen unfortunately once again the problem is at the script level it amazes me the money that the studios will pump into films like this without ever seeming to focus on the script and the only thing thats less important than the script in a movie like this is the cast and this is a hodgepodge of weird actors that dont seem to belong matthew broderick is terribly miscast but worse is costar maria pitillo who plays audrey but would be more at home playing audrey in little shop of horrors  emmerich obviously wanted to up the excitement level by adding the element of the jolly green lizards eggs hatching and a multitude of evil baby lizards but that just makes the movie feel like a jurassic park clone while watching the little buggers destroy madison square garden i had to keep reminding myself that i was watching godzilla this big summer film is one missed opportunity after another
Nov 4 2011,neutral,rating d or c depending on mood this isnt a very good movie as a godzilla movie its polar to any other godzilla film and was hated so much in japan it brought toho to making more godzilla films and referencing that this godzilla was a different monster named zilla most fans refer to it as gino or godzilla in name only its completely different from the original and doesnt have the same appeal the cgi hasnt aged well in some places and i like having it be a guy in a rubber suit better because it looks like something is actually there the essential film is week overall but has its moments there is a joke that two characters are parodies of famous film critics roger ebert and gene siskel which is completely pointless i have a soft spot for the film for introducing me to godzilla which im a big fan of but this film hasnt aged well with me growing up
Nov 4 2011,positive,usually hollywood grabs anything they can to make money and thats a shame  but i must say that this film was not bad at all in fact i have seen other godzilla movies and they all make me spend a good time this was not different from the others
Nov 3 2011,positive,wasnt so bad actually wasnt bad at all
Nov 1 2011,positive,pretty mean movie for a film made in 98
Oct 31 2011,negative,this is the worst piece of shit ever to bear the name of godzilla i mean if you think that son of godzilla was bad boy are you in for a fucking surprise cause this piece of garbage is a disgrace to everything right at least in final wars we see this zilla die
Oct 25 2011,positive,this movie is dumb fun but dumb now i started this movie with good expectations because im a fan of his other films but i expected better from roland i love independence day the day after tomorrow and 2012 but not this  i didnt care for any of the characters at all cloverfield is a much better monster movie
Oct 23 2011,positive,a movie that is absolutely awful on all levels and possibly one of my alltime favorites
Oct 21 2011,neutral,the roland emmerich adaptation of the famous big green lizard features a completely new design more like a trex  and a completely new take on the japanese legend  unlike the godzilla we all know and love this interpretation sees godzilla travel to new york to lay eggs   its an ok concept but the rampage and destruction that we all know and love about godzilla just isnt there with this installment
Oct 18 2011,neutral,splendid visual effects work but unfortunately the story is nonsensical and the 3 hour runtime is unwarranted  if you dont have a problem with that you should enjoy godzilla
Oct 18 2011,neutral,people all act stupid dialogue is cheese acting is meh and the cgi barely holds up but godzilla is so ridiculous that i find entertainment in the smallest things
Oct 17 2011,negative,lost world i say a disgrace to the originals
Oct 15 2011,negative,just an all around bad movie id say the only way you can get any enjoyment out of this is if youve never seen a monster movie and you go into it looking for a generic and unfaithful telling of a very cool genre if you want a great monster movie go see cloverfield
Oct 12 2011,positive,great movie i absolutely loved it no complaints
Oct 10 2011,neutral,godzilla may be one big mess of a movie but the creature designed and special effects make up for it remember its not godzilla its  raptors attack
Oct 1 2011,negative,how do they call this godzilla
Oct 1 2011,positive,another guilty pleasure of mine i give this such a high rating more for its personal nostalgic value as this was one of my favorites as a kid but this is pretty much a horrible movie    the script is some of the worst writing i have ever heard in a movie ever the acting is straight up putrid even as 12 year old child we referred to broderick as nick the bad actor pitillo is simply pitiful i cant imagine why she never ever acted in hollywood again azaria lerner dunn pretty much everyone is total shite of course with a script like this they were doomed no matter who they were reno is the only cast member who turns in even a semipassable performance    the monster is great bigger badder and way cooler than his japanese predecessor and the effects are great really good battle sequences are definitely the only highlight of the movie bad pacing as there are long lulls dispersed throughout and the whole baby godzilla subplot is ridiculous    while it is interesting to see the cheesy rubber version brought into the 20th century anything beyond the action sequences is dribble still its very entertaining once you get past the awful script and acting
Sep 29 2011,negative,an all time low for both roland and mathew which is saying a hell of a lot
Sep 18 2011,negative,a shit stain on the godzilla franchise
Sep 17 2011,negative,throw away and pretty much without merit but if its a sunday afternoon and theres nowt else on it might hold your attention for a while
Sep 6 2011,negative,the soundtrack is really good
Sep 2 2011,negative,the first time i saw this  which was at the theatres when i was 7  i cried because godzilla dies i cry now because i realize how terrible this movie is i dont even want to watch this movie again to give a full in depth analysis but why would i need to do a thing like that when the extent of the movies profundity is the exclamation thats a lot of fish
Sep 1 2011,positive,underated monster moviejean reno best thing in it
Aug 31 2011,negative,this reminds me a lot of growing up and how i fell into the amazing tokusatsu of japan this movie blows nothing like the fun of the originals    is it just me who always gets sad at the ending when godzilla dies  oh yeah spoiler alert
Aug 26 2011,positive,this film is so underrated i liked it this was a great reimagining of godzilla and it is a beautiful scifi film
Aug 16 2011,negative,thanks for destroying the classic gojira  it isnt some silly monster or a giant lizard although is it a irradiated lizard those are dinosaur feat not iguana feet i smell goof  the original was about the atom bomb and the horrors that surrounded it when it landed on nagasaki and hiroshima as far as i can tell this is just ronald doing what he does best trying to out michael bay michael bay
Aug 15 2011,negative,if i could sum this movie up on one word it would be stupid
Aug 12 2011,negative,godzilla it has been a while since we last saw it we have to say although the hypes that went around the time of its released the movie was and is a big flop first and foremost the visual effects suck big time not to say they are horrible but they look cheap especially compared with the dinosaurs of jurassic park that came out 5 years before this godzilla in the movie though there are few great shots and momentswhen godzilla is caught by a fisherman and wrecks avoc around new york city really makes us excited and entertainedhowever through out the movie there is not a shot where we can see the whole of godzilla without the rain or walking at nightfrustrating    anyway its a comedy if you acknowledge all of the actors performances as being a comical interpretation of stereotypical characters the french the scientist the american army the cute reporter the selfish major    its interesting however to see how the director frames few people reactions under godzilla attack    still godzilla is not brilliant but non the less entertaining
Aug 12 2011,negative,this is a horrid remake with no resembleces to the entire series shame on emmerich shame on him
Aug 10 2011,negative,godzilla  is so poorly written and so unoriginal that it makes independence day sound like shakespeare
Aug 9 2011,neutral,a few funny lines    he looks angry  what do we do  running would be a good idea    thats my husband on tv  im gonna kill him
Aug 8 2011,negative,a huge disaster that doesnt even include the title monster
Aug 6 2011,positive,pretty good cheesy effects bud good story
Aug 6 2011,negative,godzilla is the type of film that you watch when youre 12 and you think its the best film ever but once you hit your mid twenties you realize that whatever you thought was great in films when you were 12 is actually crap i have never seen an original godzilla film but i have to say that this film is a disgrace to the original japanese films i have seen snippets of the original films but nothing more roland emmerich crafts a film that is based more on the special effects than on plot or character development not to mention that this godzilla is much smaller than the original looking back now that im in my twenties i have to say that this film sucks i think this is emmerichs worst film along with 10000 bc the film lacks anything to make it appealing luckily i grew wiser and discovered what truly makes a good film godzilla is not one of those films a pointless action film with terrible acting roland emmerichs film is simply a big disappointment and is a film that has definitely not stood out the test of time one of the worst remakes too the film relies more on its special effects than on story the end result is a film thats struggling to be entertaining without offering anything really that interesting on screen a stupid and awful remake
Aug 6 2011,positive,dont know what anyone elses perfect movie is but to methis is perfection on celluloid dvd or whatever  filled with chills mixed in with laughsleaves me near breathless every time i watch it  chills thrills character conflict suspense  mail oui romance  do you feel  a good bookmovie must have romance
Aug 5 2011,negative,as an adolescent loved this move as an adult its fucking pathetic first and foremost godzilla is a champion of the people he fights the man on every border the embodiment of justice and badassery yet with this movie hes a retarded trex abomination that doesnt even do the roomies guy justice google roomies in toronto
Aug 5 2011,negative,roland emmerich adapts the classic japanese iconic monster into an overgrown lizard running havok in new york  how do you make that boring  apparently roland found a way
Aug 5 2011,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Aug 4 2011,neutral,love matthew broderick but this is one of those movies where i really need to be in the mood to watch it
Aug 4 2011,positive,i think its a good movie as a godzilla film its far from it but if you enjoy monster movies this film is perfect for you
Aug 2 2011,neutral,well call it a guilty bmovie pleasure
Aug 1 2011,neutral,terrible script its not the gojira but the walking through the city sequences were awesome to watch
Jul 30 2011,positive,the american godzilla movie seems to be a very divisive film there is no middle ground some either like it or they hate it i am one who actually really enjoys this film despite its flaws having grown up on the toho godzilla films of the 60s and the 70s it seems that the majority of the complaints about this movie are in how far rolland emmerich and dean devlin deviated from godzillas original design i think those who were upset with the design changes do have a valid point when you change the design of a cultural icon it is bound to upset the core fan base however despite the monster being godzilla in name only the movie does have many qualities to redeem it    pros taking the design of the monster on its own merit godzilla or zilla as he is renamed by toho studios is a very creatively designed creature even if one doesnt consider this creature godzilla on his own he is a well designed monster and a welcome addition to the panoply of tohos kaiju creatures he is more animal like than his japanese counterpart and less indestructible and this has been the source of many of the criticisms levied at this incarnation of godzilla but from my perspective the cgi effects are much more superior to a guy walking around in a latex suit and that adds to the sense of realism rolland emmerich and dean devlin have unapologetically stated that they make fun lighthearted popcorn movies that is exemplary with this movie and that is where the enjoyment comes all of the toho godzilla movies are covered with a healthy slice of cheese or two and the american version is no exception this is a light hearted movie which doesnt take itself too seriously and is enjoyable despite its flaws    cons sure the movie does have its cheesy moments but in my opinion all of tohos godzilla movies with the exception of the 1954 japanese original are covered with more velveeta than this american version i believe matthew broderick does an excellent job in the lead role as well as much of the supporting cast my only major complaint and big flaw as far as the characters are concerned is with mayor ebert he spends the majority of the movie just whining and complaining and worried how this will affect his popularity even when the military is doing things to protect the city mayor ebert really doesnt seem to care about the welfare of the citizens at all the other complaint is that the time spent in madison square gardens with the baby zillas is the part of the movie which seems to slow down and drag a bit too much other than that i really do enjoy this movie and wished zilla could get another chance to star in his own feature length movie
Jul 29 2011,negative,visit unlockawesomeweeblycom and landofawesomeweeblycom for reviews  sucked  gradef
Jul 29 2011,negative,fucking pitifuland coming from a true godzilla fan too
Jul 25 2011,neutral,its a guilty pleasure to say the least or maybe the most i dont know
Jul 20 2011,positive,a good movie has some inquerences but i liked it more than the original
Jul 19 2011,positive,as bmovie its ok but never understand what gozilla is
Jul 19 2011,negative,an ok monster movie     my favorite line thats a lot of fish
Jul 18 2011,positive,nowhere near the same back story as the japanese version but at least this one is a tad bit more realistic pegging godzilla as an animal instead of a monster
Jul 18 2011,negative,fuck you roland emmerich and dean devlin you pair of talentless dickless douchebags and fuck you matthew broderick you halfassed shithouse michael j fox
Jul 17 2011,negative,if youre not big on godzilla movies because you think theyre cheezy well americans are no different this big budget fantasy version of godzilla sucks away all dignity from everything it shows on screen    as a series of unbelieveable tragedies occur a scientist is called to help the us army to find a giant lizard but it is too late as it appears in new york city causing a path of destruction can this giant radioactive lizard know as godzilla be stopped well it will take the army the scientist his exgirlfriend her friends and a french secret agent to find a way you can just feel the sucking right now cant you where the original and one and only godzilla represented death destruction and mankinds demise for destroying mothernature this godzilla is just an animal trying to survive its not its fault it doesnt know better and its the frenchs fault btw the cultural difference on the atomic bomb is definitely noticable in this movie taking one of pop cultures most iconic movie figures and tinkered with it to be another hollywood action movie but whats even worse is the sheer impossibility of the whole senario the portrayal of the us army logic and the laws of physics are completely thrown away and dumbed down for audiences to seem more entertaining the story doesnt work at all and that hurts the actorss performances as well    first things first the godzilla design a giant lizard really thats what america sees when picturing the king of the monsters its avoidance of prehistoric monsters and designing the monster to be like an iguana to be more realistic and innocent is pointless now the rest my stars go out to the props team and set designers the look and creation of the entire sets their destruction and the detailed look of everything is truely impressive and the best part of the movie no mistake about it the budget for this movie was put to good use the directing wasnt all that bad to be honest but then again it wasnt all that imaginitive either this movie looks like every other disaster movie made in the 90s and doesnt nearly add the sense of thrill of fear that it could have the godzilla city attacks just seem more like eye candy than actually thrilling in other words this movie was more like an fantasyadventure movie than an action movie or even a creature feature the old hollywood cliches of the 90s are very noticible because it just doesnt fit for this movie    who thought this was a good idea godzilla is a hollywood creation more monsterous than frankensteins monster or actually more monsterous than hollywoods adaptation of frankenstein this godzilla is not the king of anything and it is surely not what the true godzilla stands for this movie is just a money grabber    ps baby godzillas didnt work in the original so who thought it would work for this movie
Jul 15 2011,positive,as my opinion this is better than the japanese rubber monster named godzillafantastic cgi and a good filmthats all
Jul 13 2011,neutral,its loud and stupid yes but its not as bad as the critics panned it there have been worse remakes over the years
Jul 13 2011,positive,i love this stupid movie
Jul 13 2011,negative,its cold blooded so our heat seeking missiles cant track it
Jul 13 2011,negative,roland emmerich admitted to not even liking any of the godzilla films that alone already shows this movie is not going to meet the standards godzilla is suppose to breathe fire but instead it just looks like he opens his mouth up and cars explode godzilla is suppose to be indestructible and the army cannot kill him but in here the army shoots him down have these people even seen a godzilla movie no probably not godzilla is too small in here the only thing that resembles godzilla are his spikes but even those dont look at all like the real godzillas whoever made this only cared about the name and that is it this should have been a remake of the beast from 20000 fathoms after all the design looked more like the beast than godzilla this american version of godzilla owed more to jurassic park than godzilla go to cinemassacrecom and watch james rolfes review of this film he pretty much sums it up perfectly show your kids this film but show them the other godzilla movies first
Jul 12 2011,negative,the military keeps missingâtheyre supposed to be the good guys
Jul 10 2011,positive,the film godzilla watched backwards is about a huge dinosaur helping to rebuild japan then moon walking into the sea
Jul 9 2011,negative,another rip off remake of the japanese film
Jul 4 2011,negative,if you have never seen or heard of the original godzilla you may enjoy this movie  but by any other means this movie is nothing but decent special effects
Jul 3 2011,negative,its not my intention to trash this film but this is a bad reboot of a long running franchise when the filmmakers came from id4 to godzilla i think everybody including myself were expecting something defining and amazing what we got was a character focused and strange creature feature the monster isnt that menacing and comes across as some hybrid from jurassic park and the island of dr moreau its that bad the actors appear bored and its not like they arent accomplished character actors jean reno is the only actor embracing the role and the situation and obviously enjoying a pay cheque the film builds to nothing before hunting for eggs yes thats right the filmmakers werent the right choice here and respected directors wouldnt have taken the challenge based on the script this had potential but the filmmakers made incorrect choices and the blame is definitely on them 07122019
Jul 3 2011,negative,plot summary    godzilla runs for new york city destroys everything end    thats what emmerich think about of godzilla a silly monster without intelligence that just want to appear in camera and devours a cab
Jul 2 2011,negative,worst movie ever made simple as that
Jul 1 2011,negative,completely unfaithful to its titlea dumb performance from matthew broderick and youve just got a boring monster movie
Jun 30 2011,negative,this is not godzilla this is a lie
Jun 24 2011,negative,more faithful to jurassic park than the actual godzilla series this movie is a mess of poor cg obnoxious and bland human characters hogging the screen most of the time oh and godzilla shows up occasionally and then disappears somehow this was another one of roland emmerichs movies that had great advertising and media hype but ended up being a major letdown godzilla fans will be furious at all the liberties or really lack of anything resembling the original godzilla movies he doesnt have the trade marked roar he doesnt shoot laser breath he doesnt look like godzilla and he even gets taken down by the military which never happens then theres the velociraptor godzilla babies that show up late in the movie it couldve at least taken the good elements of the jurassic park movies and it at least would have been tolerable but as it stand this movie will not please godzilla fans and to mainstream movie goers itll just be bland and forgettable theres plenty of other blockbusters that easily can take its place
Jun 22 2011,positive,godzilla is a really good moviethe creature itself is huge powerful and cleveri like the fact that although it is male and the first of its kind it still has babysthe only thing that i didnt like is actingwhich was just poorexcept for that everything else was perfect including the special effectsmy favourite part was actually the end which showed that one of godzillas babys had survivedit was a wonderful movie
Jun 18 2011,positive,fun perfomance by broderick and great effects for that time make godzilla a great and watchable film to see today
Jun 15 2011,negative,this movie has the worst design for a godzilla monster ever on top of that instead of creating an intelligent version of the very first 1954 movie you get jersey shore stereotypes fat man candy jokes and a military that cant keep track of a ten story monster and as if it cant get any worse the main subplot is this cheesy love story between mathew broderick and audrey timmonds whose character is a total bitch but wait theres more the climax is set in madison square garden where the military and all of new yorks inhabitants never noticed that godzilla who has both keeps a nest of eggs over all its another roland emmerich fail
Jun 14 2011,neutral,roland emmerichs godzilla promise a great entertaining time that brings amazing special effects thing that changes when we see the disappointing script and weak direction cliche godzilla show be a bad disaster film trying looks jurassic park rotten
Jun 13 2011,positive,underrated film well till the end when it gets dumb but still a decent monster movie
Jun 13 2011,negative,when i was a kid i loved the godzilla movies  there is something about watching model cities getting destroyed that is so awesome  i also loved watching godzilla movies for the cool looking monsters and the classic monster rumbles  so when i heard that an american adaptation was being made i was really excited  it would have been cool to see godzilla properly updated and introduced to american audiences unfortunately  what we got was a film that owed more to jurassic park or the beast from 20000 fathoms than godzilla  not only is the monster a crappy looking cgi ovenroasted trex  it does not even posses godzillas basic traits  the monster doesnt have radioactive breath or indestructible  the monster gets killed by the military something that never happens to godzilla  most of the time the monster is getting chased by the military which is an insult to godzillas character  another flaw with the film is it spends way too much time with the human characters who are cliche and shallow  this movie is just a boring and cliche disastermonster movie that was given the name godzilla for market value  how can anybody mess up godzilla
Jun 12 2011,positive,haha i love this movie
Jun 9 2011,positive,they should have called it zillanot godzilla
Jun 5 2011,negative,i really like broderickso much that i quite looking at him but apart from that this movie is really lacking
May 28 2011,positive,as craptastic as most people find this movie to be it holds a special place in my heart
May 26 2011,neutral,i enjoyed this a lot as a tot when it came out and i can kinda see why godzilla him erm herself is pretty cool here but not much else big gs screen time is where its at but unfortunately most of the runtime is dedicated to a surprisingly uninteresting human storyline
May 24 2011,negative,nyc is taken out by a giant invading reptilian with a lot of dopey mindless effects scenes and cheesy human subplots
May 22 2011,positive,i watched this when i was young and damn the cgi looked good as fuck but when i watch it now its really lame loll and i didnt realize how much the story sucked loll
May 22 2011,negative,as a godzilla film it failed to acomplish that simple goal it was only interested on the name but the king of monsters himself as a simple movie its simply mindless dull popcorn movie its not bad to watch a simple dull film at a time but the one thing this film failed to achieve other then people who really need to go back to acting school and a plot so dull youll forget their even was a plot was that it was a called a godzilla film it failed to achieve that role and proven to be an utter fail for godzilla fans like myself its entertaining in a dumb angle but is not qualify to be known as a godzilla movie at all d
May 16 2011,negative,i saw it once and while it was not recently it is not one i want to see soon it was a rip off of jurrasic park and godzilla did not even breath fire
May 14 2011,positive,i think that this film is really under rated i love it and guess it is amazing because it is such an original and cool idea to have a dinosaur invading a modern city like new york i also really liked the acting and the part of the airplanes and the submarines i love godzilla
May 14 2011,positive,this movie is oft berated by fans of the japanese filmswhich i am also but i have fond memories of this movie from my childhood seeing a giant monster rip up a city is always fun and the effectsthough now look dated were really impressive at the time i dont even mind the little godzillas as that provided a little variation from big godzilla smashing the place up in my opinion id rather the americans make an original american produced version of godzilla than rehash reedit and put horrible dubbing on the japanes classics
May 9 2011,negative,was it as bad as everyone says it is no was it good no that being said this is really an average movie at best and a below average movie at worst typical rolan emmerich style of a crapload of special affects and battle scenes that are oscar worthy but not much else    to start off i disagree with most godzilla fans about the monster it wasnt what i expected but it was pretty cool emmerich must have done a lot of work on this thing     also the chase scenes were pretty nice too they were even better than the ones from the 2005 king kong movie there were also some pretty creative ways that the director used to help the heroes escape the plot was pretty nice too    however there was slightly more bad than good most of the acting was downright terrible i particullary disliked matthew brodericks preformance as dr niko it was emotionless and underdone but the good news was it was better than most broderick preformances    the good news for broderick was that he was not the only one with a bad preformance maria pittilo was pretty bad too the overacting to brodericks underacting heck you might say every actor was bad    the intorduction to the baby godzillas was ridiculous and uncalled for the baby godzilla scene was basically a badly redone jurassic park velociraptor scene they looked like deformed reject giant birds more than terrifying monsters when broderick is the cause of your demise you know youre lame monsters    the ending was horrible when godzilla finally dies there is this moment where we are suppoused to feel sorry for it it is kind of emotional at least until the crowd starts cheering and it ends of on a completly different note    overrall bad movie not horrible but bad
May 9 2011,negative,the us adaptation of godzilla unfortunately felt more like jurassic park set in new york city than an actual godzilla movie i have to be totally honest i just didnt enjoy what this movie had to offer and as an adaptation of godzilla it missed the mark entirely of what the original godzilla film was all about that being said was it all bad no but its campy tone and annoying characters didnt help the film in any way
May 8 2011,neutral,would have been better if it wasnt called godzilla
May 8 2011,positive,guilty pleasure oh look i know its bad but theres a whole scene where a guy in a helicopter says he cant shake godzillasomeone shouldve told the pilot godzilla doesnt fly 
May 3 2011,positive,we know this fire breath star from old timesin this filmscientist nick tartopoulosbrodericktravels to the panama canal to investigate sightings of a creature who wrecks havoc on the peoplehis girlfriend is a reporter and tries to give people an inside scoopwhen madison square garden appears to harbor this monsters eggsthe military gets involved in the fight to secure manhattan and eliminate this foe foreverwith drama and interesting storythis movie makes me cheer for our guysbravo
May 1 2011,positive,just above average movie mainly based on the last 30 mins  good story just not well executed
Apr 29 2011,negative,gets half a star just because the sfx were pretty good for the time that is all
Apr 24 2011,neutral,the movie should not have been called godzilla the closest thing the monster comes close to being godzilla is the roar he took the god out of the name that comes as a major disappointment to me as a godzilla fan but as a monster movie fan i still find it entertaining there are alot of enjoyable scenes in it it was hyped up because of the advertising campaign and made people think that this would be the greatest movie in the world but it came as a major disappointment which i cant understand this is only popcorn entertainment your not gonna find the meaning of life at all the only problem i have is with the name and thats a big one for me but its still an entertaining movie
Apr 21 2011,negative,i hated this monster movie  first of all the effects were not good it sucked  godzilla looked like a t rex not a dragon  so many cliche and stupid moments in the plot that it sucked too much  this movie had many flaws and they all keep it from being good overall the movie sucked beyond all belief
Apr 19 2011,negative,im not happy im not happy at all
Apr 17 2011,positive,its not scary inept and stupid and i liked it it was fun unpretentious and highly enjoyable
Apr 11 2011,negative,very cheesy and very stupid
Apr 3 2011,positive,yes im one of the five people on the planet that enjoyed this film it has mediocre acting and major plot holes but i just have a weakness for giant monster movies of any kind pretend its not a godzilla movie and youll have a good time
Apr 3 2011,positive,im curious why this flick pan by critics ok cheesy cgi and plot but this flick still entertaining than roland emerichs bullshit blockbuster 2012
Apr 3 2011,positive,im curious why this flick pan by critics ok cheesy cgi and plot but this flick still entertaining than roland emerichs bullshit blockbuster 2012
Apr 3 2011,negative,proof god does not exist
Apr 2 2011,negative,this would have been a way better film if it was with the japanese where godzilla lives in the series
Apr 1 2011,positive,if youve read some of my other reviews you probably know that i feel that people are too hard on popcorn flicks this is no exception now i want to be clear that im not a godzilla fan so hard core fans of the japenese rubber suit big guy might not like this movie and thats understandable its a different kind of godzilla and i have heard so many people bash it and im sick of it it has good effects decent acting and lots of action and that is why this movie is good so stop bashing a movie just because it isnt a guy in a rubber suit its entertaining and another great addition to roland emmerichs library of movies
Apr 1 2011,positive,this is one of those movies when you watch it on surround sound feels like you are more on a ride than watching a movie  it was cool to see matthew broderick in an action flick instead of a comedy he did a decent job
Mar 29 2011,positive,there is no godzilla in this movie only zilla
Mar 24 2011,negative,though it has a good cast and incredible effects it lacks power
Mar 21 2011,negative,you know there are some things hollywood just shouldnt attempt to mess with
Mar 21 2011,positive,thi movie is great i loved it
Mar 20 2011,negative,terrible dont bother
Mar 19 2011,negative,there is a hell of a lot wrong with this movie but they got some of it right i think the cast is spot on and despite some of the cgi dating badly the rest of the action is exhilarating however the bad script blatant rip off of other movies that are better and unoriginal score make this any other hollywood big budget action movie that has little brains and at the same time not that much fun because of its lengthy run
Mar 17 2011,negative,really america  your doing it wrong
Mar 15 2011,neutral,wait godzilla was in this movie because the only monster i saw was zilla    all joking aside if this werent named godzilla i would probably give the movie a higher rating but because it carries god in the title i unfortunately cant do that i really do think this movie is entertaining and i could take the bad acting except for maria pitillo and even the stupidity but its extremely hard for me to do that with every character in this movie calling the monster godzilla when we hardcore fans know that the monster in this movie isnt godzilla    if you watch this movie knowing that the monster is zilla and not godzilla then you might like this movie if not then watch the 1954 japanese classic
Mar 15 2011,positive,it was a good movie better than what i thought want it on dvd i thought they would have done a sequel because the film ended suggested a second film it was really sad when godzilla died
Mar 9 2011,negative,formulaic monster movie that ticks all the boxes with regard to action set pieces and plot development good if you are a child like monsters or are roland emmerich if you are none of the above and want a descent monster movie  watch the host
Mar 8 2011,positive,following the french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific an unknown creature is spotted passing eastward through the panama canal
Mar 2 2011,negative,this movie is a terrible disgrace to the long line of great movies its just like some hollywood director to break from tradition and almost ruin a series with their brilliant new ideas thankfully it is rectified later by godzilla making short work of this joke of a monster
Mar 1 2011,negative,why just why no wonder japan felt inclined to start making godzilla films again after this
Feb 27 2011,positive,you know what i really dig this film most critics and people that saw it bashed the garbage out of it yeah some of the characters are cartoonish but that makes for a fun story    the buildup to actually seeing godzilla is pretty sweet for the most part you really dont see much of it until the big chase scene through the city    the effects are pretty great and the sound is amazing    and for one liked the baby godzillas it made for a lot of hokey fun in the end    the cast is such an odd one of paper but it actually works
Feb 25 2011,positive,god i loved this movie it was so funny not really a horror but it was fun to watch
Feb 24 2011,negative,loved godzilla but this was not a godzilla movie it was something elsesomething horrible
Feb 23 2011,positive,the best creature film ive ever watched its a must watch for any scifi fan who likes or admires the art of making movies it has a fantastic direction and is acted out very well too thumbs up
Feb 22 2011,positive,a new age of godzilla movies are upon us loved this movie but i do miss the classics
Feb 18 2011,neutral,cgi cannot beat a guy in a rubber suit
Feb 13 2011,negative,yeah a big steaming pile of godzilla
Feb 11 2011,negative,come with me i dont think so
Feb 8 2011,negative,id give this a zero but technical limitations prevent me from doing so  this is not a godzilla movie  paramount lies  lies  its garbage  this shit is not godzilla  godzilla is not a pushover sissy who runs from the military  godzilla does not lay eggs  he is not a pregnant shebeast  he is not an iguana  he has beam breath this creature has none  he only roars once or twice  he dies from rockets  godzilla does not die from rockets or jets  they piss him off like mosquitoes  godzilla was not made by frenchies  he was already there  too much emphasis on crappy characters like animal and worm guy and they all suck  zilla doesnt even leave new york city flaming in his wake    he just walks around like a lost tourist     no giant monster for this thing to fight and at the end godzilla dies  i cheered in the audience for this thing impersonating my beloved godzilla to die die die  then his demon spawn baby survived  i was sad d  godzilla doesnt even show his face much in the movie hes a coward who hides in the water and burrows for some freaking reason because hes too freaking camera shy  lame action bad script not godzilla this movie sucks  diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie   ahem that is all   i cant even enjoy this as a not godzilla giant monster movie  if you want a decent monster movie thats not godzilla go watch cloverfield  im a huge godzilla fan and id give this remake an f c
Feb 7 2011,positive,good story great special effects loved it
Feb 6 2011,positive,enjoyed the film but always routed for the monster traumatic ending well for me anyhow
Feb 5 2011,negative,even worse than i remembered it almost makes reptilicus look like a work of art
Feb 4 2011,negative,it doesnt exactly deliver the punch of the original or the heisei series it is not the most terrible monster movie ever it disgraces the name godzilla however which makes the japanese name zilla seem deserving of it as its certainly no god but just a big animal he doesnt shoot radiation from his mouth and he isnt an unstoppable force of nature as godzilla it is nonetheless a decent monster movie though it gets points taken off for degrading the godzilla name
Feb 1 2011,negative,godzilla is a poor remake of a japanese classic not only does the monster not even look like the real godzilla but has babys that look like velociraptors its just an insult to godzilla fans
Jan 27 2011,positive,this movie is enjoyable enough by itself but not using the name godzilla i enjoyed it by pretending it was an original monster movie
Jan 26 2011,negative,how dare they remake a the classic godzilla with this piece of junk its a disgrace it did have good effects but thats all the credit i will give it
Jan 25 2011,negative,when americans take my idol and completely mess it up although i love the babies
Jan 22 2011,negative,a giant reptilian monster wreaking havoc on new york city has never been this boring
Jan 16 2011,negative,is not godzilla is big tuna munching iguana nice to see real godzilla kicks its tail in final wars 
Jan 15 2011,negative,need some good laughs watch this
Jan 15 2011,negative,25 thats 25 too high if you ask me this socalled film which spits on the original godzilla is as enjoyable as running head first into a wall with spikes on it
Jan 15 2011,positive,i have to admit but i liked this movie but i know several reasons why first i know why godzilla fans hate it because its basically a dinosaur  another thing is that it steals from jurassic park  plus the actings not that great  im sure theres much much more but i guess thats all i need  but i have to say this movie is a guilty plesure but at least im being fair on why people hate it
Jan 10 2011,positive,the first ever pg13 movie i watched when i was 5 was intense and entertaining okay the effects look as old as roland emmerichs previous movie independence day and the acting is not perfect i hate matthew broderick and regardless of their acting the three leading ladies maria pitillo arabella field and vicki lewis were fricking hot and hopefully they still are today anyways despite its flaws and the two sequels being cancelled this is better than any other godzilla movie out thereat least until the warner bros remake comes out
Jan 10 2011,negative,i tried watching this for a while completely lost interest after about 25 minutes and it ended up just being background noise usually i love cheesy scifi movies but this just didnt cut it
Jan 9 2011,negative,saw this in theatres huge mistake
Jan 7 2011,positive,i thought it was full of suspence when i was little
Jan 7 2011,negative,1 star its tolerable but watch something else instead if you can
Dec 30 2010,positive,at least its better than its japanese predecessors stupid mindless fun
Dec 29 2010,positive,i liked it but its no were as good as the orginal whitch just rocks big time its old yes but i love it like all monster films this i still liked
Dec 28 2010,neutral,eh looked good at least
Dec 24 2010,positive,this is one of those movies that i just dont understand why people dont like it i think that they feel like they shouldnt so they dont but this is not a bad movie other than some faults in the movie such as the heat seeking missles being able to lock on even though earlier they say that they cant lock on to his heat because hes colder than the buildings around him and some piss poor acting at times this is a pretty good movie it has a good casting crew it has a good story line because it is both entertaining and believable who doesnt wonder or believe that if exposed to enough radiation you wouldnt be turned into something else anyway this film has a lot of conflicts with not just godzilla but in between the characters and with themselves it has a lot of accurated scientific information it uses comedy and humor at the appropriate times and its a great realistic showing of how our armed forces can be really dumb if something like this were to happen all they do is shoot now and ask questions later and they ended up causing more damage than that god damn thing did this movie has such a good ending that you really end up rooting for godzilla at then end and makes you feel sad when he dies all he is a giant lizard living and doing exactly what a normal lizard would do now i have to say that at the end when they showed that one of the eggs had survived and they showed it hatch i do not understand the point of that you could have used that to make a sequal and people would have watched so you really dropped the ball on that one but overall other than a few things there is nothing that makes this movie horrible and i think that it deserves more credit than it has received
Dec 19 2010,positive,i actually like this enough to buy it on dvd
Dec 18 2010,positive,classical actionmonster movie
Dec 10 2010,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i dont understand why people werent so fond of this movie it is very entertaining
Dec 7 2010,positive,hey its better than independence day
Dec 7 2010,positive,it was good for its time
Dec 4 2010,negative,what was mathew thinking
Dec 1 2010,negative,i was really looking forward to this film as a kid and i loved it when i first saw it it was also the first film i ever saw in theaters however i now realize that i loved just about any film back then the acting script and even effects are pretty terrible it ultimately proved to be the hand that slapped eager godzilla fans around the world in the face for daring to go see it
Nov 29 2010,negative,an insult to godzilla fans everywhere
Nov 28 2010,neutral,stupid but i liked the special effects and jean reno that russian dude i used to like this as a kid but looking back now it was not that great good for a laugh though
Nov 26 2010,negative,as a kid i liked it but as an adult i grew to show little respect for it as a godzilla movie it doesnt come off as a godzilla movie its almost as if the creators of this movies havent actually see a godzilla movie in their entire lives its just a poorly made jurassic park ripoff nothing about this movie seems to be important or credible the special effects of hoaky and cheep and the characters arent interesting the only redeeming value this movie has is the fact that the mayor and his assitant are named siskel and ebert
Nov 26 2010,negative,as a child and hearing of this film i was excited to hear of a japanese film series being americanized and also being somewhat rebooted upon seeing iti was so disgusted i walked out of the theatrea fate that i have done very rarely in my lifetime to this day i wont even watch it if it shows up on tv late night ill just turn it off i cant begin to mention how bad this film is my advice would be to only watch it if you absolutely have toie maybe some one could watch it and analyse the reason it sucks but besides that avoid this film its boringdrags on and makes no sense
Nov 24 2010,neutral,not as bad as everyone says but not in the spirit of the original concept
Nov 24 2010,positive,godzilla fans who have taken this film so coldyheartedly should note that this is an american remake and the style will be different as a result truth be told this is actually a movie that is quite fun and manages to hold its ground despite its flaws the story is also quite good and there are plenty of nonstop thrills that never cease to entertain
Nov 17 2010,positive,this will always be one of my favorite movies the acting was acceptable and believable like most of the older movies and the story itself was enjoyable not to mention that the concept had its own level of awesomeness
Nov 15 2010,positive,whatever others say  i liked that movie  yeah it wasnt the  ultrasuppa all destroyin godzilla everyone knows from the jappanese movies and the acting could have been better  realy better   the story itself was good in my opinion only thing im dissapointed   was that zilla was just was too weak even so i liked the idea to potray him like a more realistic animal instead of that rubbersuited monster that takes blizzards of rockets like they were just blanks     all in all i think its an mediocre movie not bad but also not realy good  but i still enjoy it
Nov 15 2010,positive,this film sent me to asleep twice but do get round to seeing it all in the end its ok
Nov 14 2010,positive,a giant mutant lizard tearing up the city how can you dont like it
Nov 13 2010,negative,not your parents godzilla and too bad because nothing beats the japanese godzilla
Nov 12 2010,negative,horrible adaptation but still kind of fun
Oct 31 2010,positive,i love this freaking movie
Oct 30 2010,negative,what a worthless hack job thank you hollywood for such a shit remake
Oct 30 2010,positive,nothing really special but a very entertaining piece of work something you watch when you are a kid and think oh my god godzilla is damn big exactly how i felt the cast done there job pretty good although but they aint serious enough at times roland emmerich isnt known to us as a director to make an epic masterpiece but he provides us with some unrealistic sequences which sometimes can be viewed as funny or pretty good apart from that its usually a no thanks godzilla isnt a bad remake mainly because of its up to date graphics which its devastation of the creature really entertained me at times but the adventuredisaster storyline was the only few things to say positive about this
Oct 25 2010,negative,an utterly soulless reimaging of a seminal classic godzilla might offer a handful of mildly impressive but dated action scenes but its ultimately let down by a poor cast with the exception of jean reno dull storytelling and a complete lack of awe
Oct 23 2010,positive,cheesy as hell but sometimes you just need a good bad movie
Oct 22 2010,negative,anyone who knows me knows how huge of a godzilla fan i am this thing is an abomination which should be swept away and forgotten by the masses    and no matthew broderick and jean reno do not save this film it defiles both of their awesome awesome names because of it
Oct 18 2010,positive,its a roland emmerich movie so its not gonna be like benhur or the dark knight by any means this is a movie where you just check out and watch if you dont take this movie seriously then you will see how fun this is
Oct 18 2010,negative,gargantuan sized piece of crap
Oct 16 2010,positive,its funnie not that bad great cgi effects
Oct 12 2010,positive,roland emmerichs godzilla is just a lot of stupid fun what makes a film this stupid so enjoyable is that its constructed like a theme park ride its got flashy special effects for the 90s that is big name stars acting like fools a plot you dont have to think about and plenty of giddy thrills like all of emmerichs disaster pictures godzilla is mindless silly silly fun
Oct 11 2010,negative,the original godzilla would destroy the little iguana used in this movie
Oct 8 2010,negative,i saw this movie in 2008 since i had a tape of simpsons episodes that had the iconic advertising that was done for the film even the ads for the taco bell foods and peelandwin game wouldnt reveal his size i watched the nostalgia critics take on this when i had a long night last night so in 1998 it was scary and unorthodox in 2008 it was funny and dated now in 2010 roland emmerichs cheesy hokey cant be mocked enough redesign of the japanese classic monster  is just a not scary not funny all around piece of shit movie    actually thats not that different from our perceptions of roland emmerichs other movies independence day was mindless fun that benefited from the timing and pacing of will smith and jeff goldblum stargate while silly at first spawned three television series that are actually taken very seriously in science fiction the day after tomorrow offered a horrifying however unrealistic depiction of climate change by the time 10000 bc and 2012 rolled around emmerich had lost his finesse at attracting moviegoers to the increasingly stupid and maniacal films he peddled    and yet i think his remake of godzilla is the one we had the highest hopes for well known for its secretive advertising the godzilla design was described as having a foot as long as a bus or a head as long as a billboard once we finally saw the movie we found that hollywood had ruined one of the things we love a much as japan once again in fact i think this was the first time the western world abused something from japan that is actually taken seriously in this country    there are a bevy of respectable actors on board matthew broderick jean reno nancy cartwright hank azaria and maria ptillo normally their characters would be uninteresting as a result of writing but this time i think that the writers went out of their way to make the characters dull and generic in fact their names are not even worth mentioning    flataspaper characters aside youd think that once we saw the monster that would help us distract from how boring the humans are see the monster a wideeyed openmouth gape ensues this is sad this monster design may have looked impressive in 1998 but now its simply horrid to look at godzilla has the appearance of a malformed crossbreed of a charizard and a tyranitar and can move at speeds ranging from carnosaur to sonic the hedgehog     youd think that the other special effects would compensate for a monster design that theyd gone through so much effort to hide after all the film was budgeted at 130 million 1703 million in 2009 money so youd think it would have a decent amount of money to make good effects right sadly emmerichs department has failed us once again despite having what was at the time his largest budget ever at his disposal the special effects are mindnumbingly crappy the vehicles move like micro machines the set pieces both practical and digital are every bit as transparent as cellophane and explosions and breaths of fire are somehow able to be triggered in torrential rain i dont have any physical science classes right now im focusing on computers and psychology in this part of my freshman year but i really think that typhoonlevel amounts of water should put out fire    while were on the subject of rain i must note for a movie thats supposed to be set in new york city it could not be any more obvious that the movie was filmed on location in seattle a city 150 days of precipitation yearly there are so few things to tell us that this is supposed to be new york save for a digitallyinserted statue of liberty and madison square garden    i know we nearly destroyed japans military after world war ii but at least the military depicted in their godzilla movies was competent our us armed forces are so terriblytrained and are so heavenly awful at piloting and shooting that the ateam and imperial stormtroopers could easily be put in their place and they would have better marksmanship and aircraft control than any of the people who enlisted here    there is only one line i can honestly take the time and effort to make fun of here thats a lot of fish just as this movie is a load of shit and let me clue you in baby american remakes of japanese cultural icons only got worse from here godzilla gets 20 criminally more mismanaged adaptations of japanese masterworks out of 100
Oct 5 2010,negative,i have yet to understand why this film was remade the way it was
Oct 5 2010,negative,it could be so good you have new york and a gigantic lizard matthew broderick as a scientist and hank azaria asit doesnt even matter he is hilarious and theres tons of other simpsons cast but they manage to destroy this like the army in the film destroys half of nyc they actually blow up the flatiron building i love that thing  they have good intentions but it goes oh so wrong there is a huge list of things wrong with this film but things that come to my mind right away are maria pitillo  really annoying the size of godzilla that keeps changing throughout the film the effects look really bad now godzilla and its babies look ridiculously bad they try to copy jurassic park they actually use a score that reminds me of the lost world which came out the year before the dialog is crapand while most of this applies to all emmerich films how come that even the effects are shit in this
Sep 28 2010,positive,dr niko tatopoulus hes not some monster trying to evade you hes just an animal if you find what he wants then hell come to you    this is arguably roland emmerichs worst film but still not a bad movie overall yes the acting is cheesy yes the dialogue is flat the special effects however still make this film well worth all the time in the world godzilla looks awesome in this movie my only other complaint is that i didnt really like the ending too much this is still however a decent and entertaining movie to watch overall just another movie to add to the guilty pleasure collection
Sep 26 2010,positive,cool looking godzilla i thoughti liked this movie
Sep 24 2010,negative,godzilla in name only and a waste of film on top of that
Sep 23 2010,positive,over all i liked it not as man china men running around screaming godzilla godzilla as i would have liked
Sep 22 2010,neutral,thats a negative impact sir i repeat thats a negative impact    synopsis  when a freighter is attacked in the pacific ocean a team of experts  including a biologist and two scientists  concludes that an oversized reptile is the culprit before long the big lizard is loose in manhattan destroying everything in sight    though it failed to transcend its genre and was loathed by japanese critics at the time the original godzilla movie gojira released in 1954 postwar japan saw the monster movie grow up and show that monsters were capable of more literary achievements as opposed to just being an excuse to set things on fire  in fact the original godzilla was so concerned with its themes of nuclear testing and its effects that the titular monster has surprisingly little screen time  a few sneak peeks a full reveal complete with abilities demo and a lingering death sequence and thats about it  the original godzilla had something to say and the monster was merely a loudspeaker    that may have been postwar japan but it was also prespielberg cinema  in 1998 the dangers of nuclear testing were well known and generally acknowledged  it makes perfect sense then that roland emmerich should strip his remake of the japanese classic from all its baggy overtones unless he could think of a more relevant topic he would have a guaranteed dud on his hands pun intended  if spielberg can make a silly monster movie into one of the patron saints of alltime movies why cant roland emmerich    well roland emmerich is no steven spielberg and its not for lack of trying either  the are many moments in godzilla 1998 that scream spielberg  the tinge of ironic awe and tragic beauty that the score often suggests the entire nesting act with minigojiras that walk and act like velociraptors and flat out backcatalogue references we need bigger guns all these are spielbergs legacy and the best parts in the film      when emmerich doesnt lean on spielbergs genius which is most of the time the results are often mind numbingly frustrating  the director doesnt seem to have much to offer his actors far too many lines delivered from solid actors fall flat or otherwise seem wooden only jean reno escapes the movie completely intact  which is a real shame as this film works best when focused on human emotions    though the lessons roland emmerich learned from peer steven spielberg work well godzilla isnt nearly as entertaining as it should be
Sep 21 2010,positive,i see this is terribly underrated   but let me give you the nice shock  i liked this brilliant special effects and has several breath taking moments though i didnt liked the ending especially the fact that godzilla died and giving another twist at the very end i expect this has part 2 or something  havent seen the japanese version and i see that is a really good one since everyone is sighing on this
Sep 20 2010,neutral,one of those movies that i loved as a kid hate as an adult
Sep 20 2010,positive,very good i think the godzilla in this one looked cooler than it did in the original it looks more like a dinosaur than a mutated iguana
Sep 16 2010,positive,ok so its no gojira its no classic its a bit lame its got matthew broderick playing yet another simpering scientist its got a dodgy plot and yet its still a great film its got big bangs some decent oneliners a big citydestroying lizard and best of all its got jean reno who needs more for a saturday night flick and yes i am a fan of akira kurasawas masterpieces go figure
Sep 16 2010,positive,its as bad as anyone could think but it entertained me very much
Sep 15 2010,positive,why dont people like this its a great movie
Sep 13 2010,negative,the 23rd and unofficial godzilla movie in the series why because godzilla is not in it    the plot is your typical roland emmerich movie     1a huge cast that are underdeveloped and most dont serve a purpose    2political heads who are jerks and idiots    3a bunch of science that dont make sense    4plotholes galore    5bunch of stuff blowupespecially by the military who shoot like stormtroopers and actually destroys new york more than the monster    6a romantic subplot with no chemistry or purpose    7obnoxious characters with bad acting     8a nerdy and socially awkward man trying to save the day this time from a giant monster    now thats out of the way let me talk about the monster it doesnt look like and feel like godzilla i knew there were going to change him i knew it was going to be cgi and badly i might add im all for updating the look but they forgot two important characteristics he breaths fire and hes indestructible now some have told me that they were going for a more realistic approach but those two characteristics are the most well known from godzilla you might say he breaths fire because its shown twice on the movie but its not coming out of his mouth he just opens his mouth wide and stuff starts to burn     now i have nothing against the monster appearance i actually like it it just that they gave him the name godzilla and it irritates me that a weak and cowardly monster has the name he runs away when the military shoots at him also this movie was trying to cash in on jurassic park since the monsters and attacks are all from that movie especially the baby godzilla scenes that scream out raptor scenes of jurassic park      overall this monster is not godzilla toho the company that created the original godzilla went as far as renaming the monster zilla its not worthy of having the word god in its name while they were at it they should have retitled the movie as zilla thats his name now anyways    but i feel like i should respect this movie for one thing it forced toho to retaliate at sony by creating a new series of godzilla movies a year after the release of this one    skip it or if youre a godzilla fan burn it
Sep 11 2010,negative,this was an insult to the classic godzilla the major changes made to the character were unnecessary and pointless  poor choice
Sep 10 2010,negative,this movie reminds me of troll 2 in that when i saw troll 2 i expected to see trolls just like when i saw this i expected to see godzilla    stupid misleading titles
Sep 10 2010,positive,incredibly enjoyable guilty pleasure blockbuster from the king of crap roland emmerich the casting among just about everything else made this epic film so tongue in cheek the action and suspense and even the one dimensional characters are all so entertaining     i saw this in theaters years ago when it came out and remembered liking it honestly i think i like it more now after my first revisit to it since then     as a film its quite silly and comedic but its pure fun
Sep 9 2010,positive,ive watched this movie a lot so i end up liking it a lot lol
Sep 9 2010,negative,gets one star instead of half just for the fact that an awful cgi creation can out act the god awful matthew broderick if only they allowed some cgi godzilla turd to be dumped upon him if only
Sep 8 2010,positive,thats a great movie ever i liked it
Sep 6 2010,positive,a very american and modernized retellingremake of godzilla  although its yet another film in the godzilla series which has way too many versions as it is the cast makes it worth watching theyre really good  i really liked this movie
Sep 6 2010,negative,after this movie you knew matthew brodericks movie career was over
Sep 2 2010,positive,i really enjoyed this film only having watched it this year
Aug 30 2010,positive,cool whenever godzilla shows up to do something not very interesting otherwise
Aug 29 2010,neutral,alright not bad a bit of fun
Aug 28 2010,neutral,the american version is abundant in special effects altough the story is poor
Aug 28 2010,negative,just horrible they got this so wrong broderick worst leading action man ever
Aug 27 2010,negative,i am a huge godzilla fan and america tried to show an american godzilla mostly because godzilla is huge and they wanted to get some new ppl interested or those ppl who hate the original live action films to like godzilla but they didnt do that well i liked the actors but didnt love their characters that much also i didnt like seeing the little godzillas i mean really wtf at that point it felt like jurassic park for a die hard godzilla fan i couldnt enjoy it but i liked seeing the american godzilla get pwned by the original godzilla in final wars
Aug 25 2010,negative,when its an emmerich movie we know the movie is bad
Aug 22 2010,positive,while yes this movie is not that great it isnt that bad its at least a popcorn movie but the key thing with this movie is that they ruined godzilla now ive never actually seen any godzilla films well any real godzilla films but all i can say is have toho do it this is pretty much when roland emmerichs career went downhill day after tomorrow and 2012 were good but anything else was bad avgn is right in noting that this film feels more like a jurassic park movie than an actual godzilla movie    the movie opens with the french doing nuclear tests in french polynesia this causes one of the lizards to become really huge and start destroying everything when a japanese ship is attacked by it an nrc scientist niko tatopoulos craziest last name for a movie character ever is reassigned to investigate it when the monster goes on a rampage through new york city it is up to the military to stop it     where do we start first of all this version of godzilla looks nothing absolutely nothing like the japan version going in you knew that it wasnt a guy in a suit like earlier godzilla movies but this one doesnt fit the cut he doesnt breathe fire for one thing    now i think matthew broderick is a good actor but this movie doesnt do him justice another big thing about the cast are the characters of mayor ebert michael lerner and his aide gene lorry goldman you tell me who they remind you of thats right siskel and ebert as the two of them said its a cool idea but the filmmakers didnt take full advantage of it they didnt die i mean this parody was because of the fact that se didnt like their other movies at least do something with it    but when you look at it in no terms relating to the godzilla franchise its a decent popcorn flick roland emmerich is a good director hasnt made all great films but he has had his movies this isnt really one of them but its not as bad as you might think
Aug 22 2010,positive,love the world trade center shot
Aug 21 2010,negative,one of the most amazing movies ever
Aug 17 2010,negative,the makers of the original godzilla had the good sense not to suggest that the creature was created by atomic testing but simply disturbed from its natural habitat  this remake however puts itself squarely in the radiation makes things grow big category of nonscience  i may have commented before on what i consider to be roland emmerichs antiamericanism which manifests itself in this movie by making all the american characters look like bumpkins theyre so boorish and provincial that none of them can even pronounce a simple name like tatopoulos maybe its meant to be funny but it isnt and they just end up coming across as buffoons  on top of this the poor old yanks cant even manage to defeat a gigantic rampaging monster without the help of a gang of french commandos and there can be few more powerful insults to a nation than to suggest they need military assistance from the french  i guess we never expect much from remakes of classic movies but even taking into account my low expectations this ones a big disappointment
Aug 16 2010,neutral,coulve been so much better
Aug 15 2010,negative,godzilla is laughably bad but id be lying if i didnt say that i enjoyed watching this re invented godzilla
Aug 14 2010,positive,like jurrassic park and king kong nicely done
Aug 14 2010,negative,it was fun when i was 16 years old  now not so much
Aug 10 2010,negative,godzilla dont look like this and this was a 10 ton turkey update
Aug 10 2010,positive,its not as bad as people say it is
Aug 8 2010,negative,while some good thrills do abound this film is the type of overhype effect driven tent pole crap that still run rampant today with the likes of transformers 2 or everything else team emmerich and devlin have crapped out this is a lumbering inexcusible butchering of the classic character
Aug 8 2010,positive,it was alright but nothing like the japanese godzilla movies had more of a jurassic park feel to it
Aug 8 2010,negative,cant touch the real godzilla this was a big lizard
Aug 7 2010,positive,i would have not called this movie godzilla more of a remake of the beast from 20000 fathoms fun monster flick non the less
Aug 6 2010,neutral,based on the godzilla japanese franchise and a reimagining of a 1954 movie of the same name in which i havent even watchedheard before it was known for being one of the best movies of 1998 despite it having received golden raspberry awards now to get on with the story    after a mutation was caused from the lizards by the french in french polynesia a deadly reptilian creature was created and migrates to new york city destroying everything in sight dr nick tatopoulos is called by the military force to do research on this gigantic creature and to aid them to stop it once and for all    do you think that action and science fiction movies keep you interested on whats going on then frankly this is one of them    the good things that i found to be tolerable was the cinematography matthew brodericks performance the cgi the music score and the action scenes    the bad things are the plotholes overused cliches the scenes the development and the scenes in where the hatchlings of godzilla started to eat the team by ripping off the scenes from jurassic park that were very familiar    godzilla isnt good or bad either it just did okay and its a very mediocre actionscience fiction movie but at least roland emmerich tried it is worth watching and a guilty pleasure on dvd or vhs only    510
Aug 6 2010,negative,an intense piece of garbage the beginning is so boring and all the acting is really bad i only ask one question in regards to this film why
Aug 5 2010,positive,roland has defiantly given the famous monster of japan a new stomping ground and it may not appeal to some viewers and it may not be the lovable costume lizard we know that being said i think godzilla is a entertaining thrill ride and gives the famous monster some much need respect and me being a fan of monster films i think they deserve a chance
Aug 4 2010,neutral,its biggest flaw is that its called godzilla ignore this and you get your average cheesy big budget monster movie not awful if youre bored and need something to watch but if you skip it youre not missing much
Jul 31 2010,negative,i do love matthew broderick but not this movie
Jul 29 2010,positive,a pointless action film with terrible acting roland emmerichs film is simply a big disappointment and is a film that has definitely not stood out the test of time one of the worst remakes too the film relies more on its special effects than on story the end result is a film thats struggling to be entertaining without offering anything really that interesting on screen a stupid and awful remake    the biggest beef i have with godzilla just dont tell him hes one big scary monster is that this retelling of the old story has no depth to it humanity is summarily exonerated of any responsibility in creating the monster in this version we just awakened it with our nuclear bombs
Jul 28 2010,negative,we expected so much from the 1998 release of godzilla but were dissapoited at every angle roland emmerich has put together a film that had so much hype around at the time but it doesnt live anywhere near to the high expectations set i can only describe this film with two words diabolically bad
Jul 27 2010,positive,it may not of been a rubber suit but not a bad americanized version either
Jul 25 2010,negative,roland emmerichs only good filmis not this its the day after tomorrow
Jul 22 2010,negative, terrible   i like matthew broderick but the same cannot be said for this dreadful film
Jul 21 2010,positive,as its own movie its not bad as a godzilla movie its pretty horrible
Jul 21 2010,negative,problems godzillas a chick doesnt look like godzilla doesnt have atomic breathe ruined kashmir it takes place in new york city and godzilla dies too much the every time we get a stupid excuse of why hes hmmhmm shes still alive piece of crap why is there no sequel as the ending was a cliffhanger like conan the destroyers cliffhanger godzilla is a guy roland emerich
Jul 20 2010,negative,sacrilege plain and simple this could not compete with this worst of the japanese godzillas
Jul 20 2010,positive,suffering from the same dilema as independence day godzilla can be enjoyed if the cardboard box characters can be dealt with
Jul 19 2010,negative,maybe im just bitter about jimmy page pimping out kashmir especially in such a tacky fashion but this one outandout sucked
Jul 19 2010,neutral,more fun and funny but logical true to the spirit of godzilla hell no
Jul 17 2010,negative,it proves to me that rolands first ever film to direct is nothing more then a spitting image of disastrous ripoff
Jul 16 2010,positive,godzilla was a cornerstone of my childhood along with the matrix and disney movies with that fact in my life im surprised to see such low ratings on this one its not that bad well when youre a kid its not that bad however it was good exciting fun full of fine special effects despite it being a little overlong and taking a long time for the title monster to pop up it had some good actingmatthew broderick in a surprising serious turn and the rest of the cast with the exception of mario pitillo and a tolerable plot i never saw the japanese versions but heard about them i suppose cg is much better than watching a guy walk around in a rubber suit ironically it was set up for a sequel but a sequel was never made but 12 years later warner bros and legendary pictures are planning on rebooting the franchise maybe it could improve upon roland emmerichs attempt and get the haters of this film to forget about their criticisms of this film the answer will come probably 2 years from now
Jul 15 2010,negative,saw this on a date and i didnt like it
Jul 13 2010,negative,one of the stupidest movie ever made
Jul 13 2010,negative,been there done that why dosent he breathe fire again and why is he so small
Jul 13 2010,negative,id rather stick with the original thanks
Jul 11 2010,negative,spoilers    cutting to the fucking point this film is like getting fisted by an angry midget who has drug problems    the film starts then 20 minutes later the proper film starts a man fishing at the end of a pier in rainy manhattan he catches a fish the fish is putting up a fight but the man is reeling this bad boy in its a bigun oh wait its motherfucking godzilla and he is pissed the fuck off but suddenly the 1000 tonne monster that is as tall as a skyscraper runs off into manhattan and disappears in manhattan and this brings me on to my first point    throughout the movie godzilla comes out of nowhere like a fucking ninja and does some godzillarly type shit then runs off i dont know much about godzilla but i know a he isnt a fucking ninja and b he doesnt employ the same tactics as a black man in compton who does drivebys    the second point is there is a giant monster running around who does the united states of america have dealing with such a major national threat the us army  the cia the fbi the nsa a dinosaur expert chuck norris no some fucktard who researches earthworms and to add insult to injury this worms expert completely ignores the us army and enlists the help of a slag a camera man and a french fella    overall id have more fun attaching jump leads to my nips
Jul 2 2010,neutral,broderick and azaria
Jul 1 2010,positive,thats a lot of fish

Jun 26 2010,negative,thats a lot of fish hahahahaha
Jun 22 2010,negative,the worst remake of cinematic history this film didnt even feature the title character godzilla what we get instead is an oversized cgi dinosaur that doesnt even look like godzilla that cant breathe fire burrows underground and disapears from the military at will isnt radioactive and runs away at the first sign of danger my rating is just for the effort
Jun 16 2010,negative,an epic summer turd
Jun 16 2010,neutral,its ok but i do not like it that much believing it should have been made under a different name not godzilla
Jun 11 2010,negative,this movie is crap the creture in it isnt even godzilla its just zilla  a overgrown  iguanathe real godzilla is a dino not a iguanaand besides all that the acting in this movie is stupid and bad
Jun 7 2010,positive,its entertaining watchable and simply enough to pass for a decent newage godzilla film  could it have been better  definitely
Jun 6 2010,positive,ive always loved this movie i still love it i thought it was cool funny and just awsome i remember having a godzilla toy and a godzilla birthday party that year
Jun 6 2010,positive,classic i saw this at theaters
Jun 2 2010,negative,the main problem as many may have already stated is that it just so happens to be called and marketed under godzilla it stretches too apart from the legendary creature we know and love it would have been best if they gave the monster a different name rather than slapping a name on the film for marketing reasons
May 31 2010,negative,this movie is a  steaming giant pile of dog shit its just plain awful this movie is the definition of the word suck
May 25 2010,positive,although this movie has stupid characters and lame dialogue i actually didnt mind this movie its very entertaining and as long as you dont comparebit to real godzilla movies its a pretty decent monster movie
May 24 2010,negative,this is a terrible insult to everything the real gojira series is about
May 24 2010,negative,ok now im 14 and when i look at this i dont really care for it that much anymore i used to when i was younger there were some parts i liked but i wish they made godzilla more like the original and not make him so weak i mean all he does is run away usually and this godzilla doesnt even look like godzilla just a giant lizard not my favorite movie but not too terrible
May 24 2010,negative,just dont ask too much from such a blockbuster and you wont be disappointed
May 24 2010,negative,just a quick rating of a movie seen in the past
May 22 2010,positive,i know this film is really really bad but every time i watch it i really enjoy it the sight of ferris bueller running away from godzilla always makes me smile
May 20 2010,negative,roland emmerich bites into the world of godzilla and makes  what else  a pointless monster movie that ignores everything that made the japanese films interesting the film yoyos between some of the stupidest scenes i can recall seeing in cinema and the third act quite blatantly rips off jurassic park to the point where its just pathetic is there entertainment to find here well yes but it would not have hurt to make the movie slightly enjoyable as well
May 20 2010,negative,the classics are much much better
May 20 2010,negative,i remember when it came out i rushed to the theatre i should have rushed out as well this piece of trash totally missed why people loved the godzilla movies it was all about campiness and they missed it totally

May 14 2010,negative,a cash cow that was just waiting to be plucked i suppose this film suffers from military types which are completely brainless
May 11 2010,negative,loved as a kid just annoys me now
May 11 2010,positive,old school quality film
May 10 2010,negative,for my 200th review ive chosen to review this terribly constructed americansed updated blockbuster version of toho studios imortal monster godzillia as an update of a classic japanesse monster movie it really begs the question why why was it nesscarry to americanise a jappanse pop culture icon why did the fucken writer thought it was clever to  have a lame joke like when the female lead scream at the tv  its gojira you moron after some reffers to it as godzilla oh by the way gojira was the oringinal 1954 jappanesse tile to the first godzillia film also why americanise it so much that it makes this film seem like the viewer is not viewing an actual godzilla film hang on this isnt a godzilla film at all it just some mindless michael bayseque  summer blockbuster from the 1990s 410
May 10 2010,positive,not as bad as people say it is the easiest way to enjoy this movie is to remenber that zilla  godzilla are two different creatures
May 10 2010,positive,visited one of the filming locations last year good times
May 9 2010,negative,roland independence day emmerichs take on the famous japanese monster starring matthew broderick and jean reno    while theres no doubt the fx are better than the old maninarubbersuit of previous versions and despite a few scenes that are more than slightly remniscient of jurassic park unfortunately im still waiting for a film to do the subject justice
May 8 2010,positive,i remember loving this movie
May 6 2010,positive,from the watermark 052598   no its not a period drama and dont confuse it with a documentary its just an actionpacked american version of the japanese horror classic and leapin lizards is it fun nuclear testing in the south pacific has caused genetic mutation and nature is now wreaking revenge on our manmade technology by delivering a gigantic lizard to civilization broderick is a biologist brought in by the government to help solve the problem pitillo is brodericks exgirlfriend who along with her cameraman azaria wants to further her career as a newswoman by breaking this big story  and what a big story it is the computergenerated monster is enormous and the special effects are better than anything seen on film to date right down to the minor destruction caused by godzillas swinging tail like twister this is a film in which a situation and the effects used to create it are the star of the film so godzillas plotline is flimsy at best but it at least extends us the courtesy of including some inside jokes to show that it isnt taking itself too seriously for example the portly mayor of new york city is named ebert and his balding sidekick happens to be named siskel pitillos character is named audrey  remember little shop of horrors when a geeky scientist and a girl named audrey were also battling a monstrous product of nature little yucks aside directorcoscreenwriter roland emmerich stargate independence day keeps the movie full of nonstop action because he knows that when the monster isnt on the screen the film is pretty lame its like a fun and surprisingly less gory jurassic park  with an extra helping of cheese on the side
Apr 29 2010,positive,i know it doesnt follow the original ones but i still think they did one hell of a job on it funny sad action i meabn it has it all  i will say though that it is not the best godzilla
Apr 29 2010,positive,this movie was a big part of my childhood although yes i do know that the godzilla in this movie isnt the real godzilla but this is the movie that introduced me to godzilla as a young toddler sure some of the lines in this movie are stupid such as thats a lot of fish he just suddenly disappeared um how cam you loose track of a 400 foot tall monster attacking the city oh yeah i forgot one to this is a place where he can easily hide um godzilla can easily hide in new york city um you know that its a giant monster and everybody is gonna notice a giant monster walking around the city and one thing i never understood how did hank h i dont know how yo spell his last name but he was in the simpsons to survive after godzilla stomped on him even that confused me as a kid and it turns out that the military cause more destruction then godzilla does how hard can it be the shoot godzilla yes this movie does have its flaws its not perfect but as i already said this movie was a huge part of my childhood i remember as a kid i would always cry at the very end when godzilla died i would rewind it and watch it again and cry again i thought godzilla looked cool despite it looking almost nothing like the japanese godzilla and how can it be godzilla without him breathing fire thats like having superman without the ability to fly every movie has at least a few flaws even the dark knight had its flaws such as when two face got killed off but i gotta admit the first scene when godzilla attacked new york was freaking amazing they did that part so well mainly cause they barely showed godzilla which made it so suspenseful so in conclusion this movie may not be perfect it has its ups and downs
Apr 19 2010,negative,after making the huge money maker of independence day how does roland emmerich follow up by making exactly the same movie except instead of aliens its a dinasaur the narrative is damn near identicle and there are so many characters who are similar its unreal all of the characters are one dimensional and although i can let it slide that there isnt enough time for character development with all the explosions it is frustrating to be able to predict exactly what the characters are going to say and do the only saving grace for this film is the sfx godzilla looks realistic and its movements are what you would expect with the destruction it causes being suitable apart from that it is a poorly written action flick that will only impress young teenagers and children
Apr 19 2010,positive,ill always like this film more than im willing to say i watched this as a young kid and have always like watching godzilla tear apart new york city    the scene where godzilla steps down and the man is standing between his toes is a scene that ill never forget like other films that i watched when i was kid ill never forget the raptors in the kitchen in jurassic park    its a cheesy but fun film whats happened to matthew brodorick by the way
Apr 18 2010,negative,what a horrible piece of cheezy s this is an abominattion to the monster movie category and its fing godzillia godzilla is a classic monster that everyone knows for destroying japan and terrible dubbing but now how original the monster is attacking nyc wow brilliant another well known area for lots of destruction why not destroy new hampshire nothing happens there i mean jesus serously choose a new location im pretty sure that they are all getting pissed at rebuilding the damn city but all in all this sucks bigger balls than godzillias
Apr 18 2010,positive,movie was weak sometimes but never the less a spectacular revision of a monster movie classic awsome speacialeffects and incrediable nonstop exhilerating action that you will never forget a feast for the eyes and ears totally amasing and extroadinary thrilling smart funny and tremendously fun
Apr 16 2010,neutral,bad acting cheesy dialogue yet great spfx and intense plot make this movie nothing more than okay dont believe me watch it again and take everything into view i really wish ths had a sequel it could have improved on the originals weaknesses and created more of a cooler movie to watch
Apr 14 2010,positive,even 12 years later i enjoyed this movie   yes its not like the original japanese godzilla it doesnt breathe fire and fight other robomonsters in tokyo but its more like down to earth aproach to the character  and that suits my taste better  ok sfx cant really mach with todays standards but its still nicelooking and convincing
Apr 12 2010,positive,i really like this movie i watched all the time when i was slightly younger it was a good movie to watch
Apr 11 2010,negative,as a kid i watched the animated sequel series to this film and loved it now that i have seen the real movie i think i will stick to the 2d cartoon     i cut the special effects some slack because it was made in 1998 the first 30 minutes are decently done but when the so called story and characters become involved it turns into a real mess this is most likely one of the first movies where i have said stop trying to show me characters and development i would much rather be watching godzilla blow shit up
Apr 11 2010,negative,not that bad to me entertaining in parts but a total dump on the sacred toho franchise
Apr 8 2010,negative,godzilla in manhattan  terrible  jean reno is one of my favourite actors  movie did nothing good for him  did no good for anyone
Apr 8 2010,neutral,when i watched this as a child i loved it but now i look at it and think  wow i liked that  kudos for a great soundtrack and visuals
Apr 8 2010,negative,is this the kind of crap that passes off for a movie
Apr 5 2010,negative,they ruined godzilla for me  ill stick to old ones
Apr 4 2010,positive,no matter how bad this is this movie combine two of my childhood loves godzilla and matthew broderick
Apr 2 2010,negative,a toddler with building blocks in his play room could have made a more legit godzilla movie then these hollywood idiots
Apr 2 2010,positive,i actually liked this movie the godzilla actually looks realistic not like the japanese versions matthew broderick does a good job
Mar 31 2010,positive,not nearly as bad as it was made out to be godzilla was just made before its time had roland emmerich waited until cgi had come along to the point of peter jacksons king kong peoples interpretation of the film would have been much more accepting however the cgi and effects in the film are often hitormiss with the poorly rendered portions completely taking you out of the film in the worst of ways however for every few bad sequences there are some truly stunning feats many including godzilla stomping around new york and just getting glimpses of his feet emmerich creates an epic level to the film with his rainy new york streets and darkness surrounding the monster throughout the film the acting is often dismal however seeing hank azaria actually get to act is by far a saving grace to the film normally not a huge fan of matthew broderick the casting of him and the nerd that he plays is memorable and helps keep this film from being an action fest apart from those two performances the rest are completely forgettable had the film stuck to the one godzilla wrecking havoc the film would have been unstoppable but as soon as we introduce eggs and hundreds of little godzillas the film starts to fold in on itself for being only 98 minutes the film often drags and becomes one chase scene after another with such potential its always hard to watch these films come and go but to be completely fair this film dabbles in a lot of the right areas but never quite catches on completely
Mar 30 2010,negative,yeah wish it was that good
Mar 23 2010,positive,i just recently watched this one i remember being so entertained by it as a kidturns out im still glued to it as a teen lol
Mar 22 2010,neutral,godzilla provides a great visual for it monster but lacks a good enough script full of weird people and cannot act like the original one when godzilla does not die from missiles
Mar 20 2010,negative,i liked the french guys
Mar 20 2010,negative,godzilla is supposed to be big lumbering  fakelooking     i know they wanted to modernize it but it didnt work
Mar 17 2010,negative,yawn frecnh nuclear tests in the south pacific birth giant irradiated lizard dubbed godzilla which makes its way north to the island of manhatten where it does battle with the us military shenangins between a scientist the miltary incompentant mayor ebert someone was carrying a grudge over reviews for stargate and id4 a wanna be reporter and some french secret agents insue    soaparently this is what happens when robots make a moviethat or everyone from producers director actors all the way down to the guy making coffee runs for the crew are just phoning it in no one seems to be able to express an identifable human emotion or they just couldnt be bothered the army guys give the impression of being actors given uniforms failing to convince theyre anything but actors the sfx are weak even for 1998 and the greatest amount of effort and innvoation seem directed towards a running swipe at siskel  ebert stick with the japanese originals which at there very worst retain some camp value the american remake is devoid of soul existing  mearly  to insure several hollywood types got there paychecks that year
Mar 16 2010,negative,water down jurasic park make it bigger take it oof the island and put it in newyork and bam here you go if you like the old godzilla movies than youll hate this movie when i was a kid i loved this movie back then i didnt know any better if they tried to make this movie a little more serieous and took out hte obvious parady of siskel and ebert than maybe this movie would of been adequate 30
Mar 15 2010,negative,i dont know which one is more impressive the buildingsized lizard or the taxi that survives everything
Mar 14 2010,positive,still a great film and the gf liked watching it too she dident nearly cry tho when the big mamma zilla died oh well
Mar 10 2010,negative,i found it hilarious how they tried to scientifically explain everything  it makes the giant lizard seem far more real  at least he was reptilian and not a man in a lame suitright
Mar 8 2010,negative,the best thing about this  jean reno adds a bit of class to this medicore shamble of a film matthew broderick is just awful and his acting not in the slightest believable farce from start to finish maybe someday a better production will come along
Mar 8 2010,positive,sure the acting is pretty bad in places this film is pretty enjoyable though
Mar 7 2010,negative,one of the worst movies ever released  shame on you matthew broderick
Mar 7 2010,negative,one of the worst ever
Mar 1 2010,negative,i tried to like this movie but i couldnt all this does is take advantage of special effects which arent actually that good they tried to make it good by putting a love story in there but they failed i havent actually seen the original godzilla films but im sure that they would be a lot better than this
Mar 1 2010,positive,godzilla is a popcorn movie its not meant to be taken seriously and i didnt until the movie became so dreadfully dull around the midsection when the monster appeared and the mind tends to come back into action and savage away compared to its japanese counterparts its better than a few of them but compared to the original 1954 movie and some of the more recent ones the simple reason is because the monster portrayed by a man in the rubber suit is more interesting and has more cinematic personality than the cgi monster the only mainstream audience that this has any appeal to are young children explaining why instead of making two sequels only a shortlived animated series was made even in the standards of its genre and category godzilla is a disappointing failure
Feb 27 2010,positive,sorry guys but this is a childhood favorite
Feb 27 2010,neutral,boring eye candy movie rather blah all the way around
Feb 27 2010,positive,one of my favorites
Feb 26 2010,negative,its mainly down to the poor story but this attempt to breath new life into the legendary monster movie fails miserably
Feb 25 2010,positive,i know im gonna get backflash because of this review but i love this moviegodzilla is a cool new way to look at the giant big monster that is godzillai thought ronold emmerich did a preety good job with the american view of godzillaalso the acting was preety good not the best but goodonly bad thing was the diogoule and the effectsthey were horriblebut all and all this film was funthrilling and cool to just get emerced insee it
Feb 23 2010,negative,i grew up with the real gojira so this was just a complete joke i have to admit though in terms of scale and cgi they beat their japanese counterparts
Feb 22 2010,negative,a movie that is definitely filled with crap in excess was it fun some interesting moments but not really was it scary no was it worth watching hell no there is no sense of originality in any of this rubbish the effects its alright but not superb and the story was there even a story
Feb 21 2010,positive,hah ha  another great bad movie
Feb 17 2010,negative,this film is very disappointing i seriously had to turn to the movie off during the helicopter chase scene im sorry but its not godzilla
Feb 15 2010,negative,bastardization that is all
Feb 12 2010,positive,a passable monster movie but it falls far short of the legend first viewing  may 1998 in theaters
Feb 12 2010,negative,fishy from start too finish
Feb 12 2010,negative,hurray an emmerich movie hurray hurray hurray hurray hurray no god this movie sucks roger ebert made a cameo in this film this film was boring stupid cheesy and un realistic
Feb 10 2010,positive,ok film with homer and moe out of simpsons
Feb 8 2010,positive,no independence day but still a decent work from emmerich a lot of people hated the way godzilla looks in this movie but he actually looked cool to me acting isnt the greatest out there you do get your cheesy moments however the special effects are good enough to at least give this one watch even though you need to turn off your brain first just sit back and enjoy the ride
Feb 5 2010,negative,a terrible excuse for a movie with terrible special effects the only thing memorable is well go online and go to youtube type in godzilla taco bell commercial overall bad film with once again bad special effects that are so bad that they are laughable
Feb 4 2010,neutral,in 1954 the film gojira was released and became an instant classic spawning numerous sequels some of which became classics too the 1998 american remake however just isnt that    keep in mind that this is a review from my critic side and not my fan side    the story centers around a giant reptilian monster that was created by nuclear tests in french polynesia after attacking a japanese cargo ship carrying fish in the pacific ocean the creature somehow swims towards new york city of all places to make a nest now its up to nick tatopoulos and his friends to stop the monster    the story as you just read is just a typical monster plot and the writers try way too hard to make this flick interesting by including realistic science what do i mean by this well godzilla is a mutated lizard specifically a marine iguana but he doesnt look anything like the lizard he originally was another example is when the film explains that the monster is asexual which is absolutely absurd because a mutation caused by nuclear bombs does not include being asexual i know about suspension of disbelief but theres only so much the audience can believe if having ridiculous science talk isnt bad enough godzilla downright steals scenes from jurassic park that this should have been called jurassic park 3 or jurassic park giant dino    the characters are either bland hateful forgettable the main character is nick tatopoulos played by matthew broderick who is the clichéd boring dorky socially awkward scientist who never are good main leads i understand that emmerich wants to make heroes from normal people but they have to be interesting andor likable tatopoulos is not likable in fact i dont know a thing about him hes a bore but whats worse than a boring character a hateful character the romantic interest audrey timmonds played by maria pitillo is a despicable selfish character who i wanted godzilla to eat so badly here an example on how shes hateful she is talking to her new york stereotypical friend about her relationship with nick and her friend asks her how long they dated audrey said about 3 or 4 years and this is what her friend said girl im surprised he didnt ask you to marry you then audrey says thats the thing he did theres nothing more we learn about their relationship expect that they get back together in the end so she wanted him to ask her but declined when he did why should i care about her also she steals top secret information from nicks tent when she knows shes not supposed to and it was for her career as a news reporter additionally after putting the information on the news we see her crying while watching the news but shes not crying because of what she did we know this because we see her give a horribly acted and soulless apology to nick prior but because her report was stolen by her boss what a selfish broad the other characters arent all that memorable outside the fact that theyre just new york or french stereotypes giving us some tasteless stereotypical dialogue and jokes    despite the poorly written characters the actors do a decent job playing them theres just nothing else to say about the acting they did what they could and did okaythat is expect for maria pitillo who was just awful    the special effects when looked at a modern aspect are bad but in the context of 1998 theyre from okay especially when you compare the effects of godzilla to the film that it strongly plagiarizes jurassic park one scene from godzilla that might have looked good in 98 but looks really bad today is the footstep scene shown in all of the trailers and commercials where godzillas foot slams down and raises back up however some effects still look really good which include any particle effects and my favorite shot when godzilla jumps over the bridge to dive into the hudson river that shot still looks really impressive    now lets talk about the monster godzilla i will not be judging this creature to the original but instead on how he stands on his own which is pathetic one of the main problems with him is that hes not scary or endearing if youre going to do a monster film you have to do one or the other and this monster fails trying to do either one hes not enduring because you dont see any reason why we the audience should care about him and hes not scary because not only does he not look scary hes a coward and a wimp the only reason he stays alive as much as he does in the film is because the military sucks at hitting him additionally we never see him showing why hes a force to be reckoned with hes constantly running away bottom line this is one of the worst monsters put on film    overall godzilla is a bad film but there are a few good things in it outside of the monster and audrey nothing in the film can be heavily criticized or hated for this is one of those movies where if you turn off your brain and just put it on to kill some time this film would be fine to put on or if you want to watch a movie but dont care what it is godzilla would be alright to watch now i cant hate on this film too much because there is a good or even great monster film in here but just not fully realized and the word to sum it best explains it best    the word to sum it stale this flick feels that everything was rushed and not fleshed out    imdb rating 410 personal rating 25 rotten tomatoes rating 255
Feb 4 2010,positive,apache helicopters chasing gozilla or godzilla chasing the choppers is a wow
Feb 1 2010,negative,note the way that in this crappy ripoff of a godzilla movie theres no other monsters and where is his supermegaawsome trademark blast and why was he killed by a few missiles when the origanal had regrowing flesh and was bomb a million times over and came back for some more
Jan 31 2010,neutral,thats not even godzilla
Jan 31 2010,positive,it was a pretty good movie with a lot of action bus there is only one problem its not the really godzilla
Jan 30 2010,negative,i give this half a star becuase jean reno and hank azaria were in it and any movie with leon and moe the bartender gets half a star
Jan 26 2010,negative,the only good thing that came out of this is watching him die in godzilla 2000
Jan 25 2010,negative,it has better special effects than the original version but is stupid too
Jan 24 2010,positive,alright dumb and lame and corny  but alright
Jan 24 2010,negative,thats a lot of fish
Jan 23 2010,positive,it lacks the wit and sophistication of the japanese original version but it has very good visuals
Jan 19 2010,negative,not too many positives to say about this movie its good to see something where hank azaria isnt doing a funny voice but it also has weak special effects and some pretty sub par acting
Jan 18 2010,negative,humanity is thrown out the window real laughs are impossible to find and this film is too bad to have fun laughing at its sheer dumbness i felt insulted by this film because emmerich has a little more talent than this and this film focusses on too much dumb humour when its supposed to be thrilling the cast in this film is fine but the way they react to everything is hilariously bad the direction is sloppy the camerawork is unfocussed and the script is honestly one of the worst ive seen in a long time this remake of godzilla did not need to happen and it should never have happened sure the technicalities of the film show in certain moments and for its time im sure it pleased a lot of people but to me its complete hollywood trash at its finest it doesnt even work as a guilty pleasure im fine with other people liking this film but its one of the worst ive ever seen
Jan 16 2010,negative,godzilla  big in japan in new york godzilla sucks  also mathew broderick is a huge misscast steven seagal could be the main character probably with hilarious results but still would be betther than broderick
Jan 16 2010,positive,didnt expect it to be a worthwhile film good choice to kill time
Jan 16 2010,neutral,pretty cool  hank azaria was great in this
Jan 15 2010,negative,godzilla is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life the acting was stiff and the dialogue was poor and unrealistic the monster was the only good part about the movie it was vicious the movie godzilla was a wasted opportunity
Jan 13 2010,positive,a giant lizard mutated by nuclear fallout invades nyc
Jan 12 2010,positive,i dont remember the movie much
Jan 11 2010,negative,fuck you hollywood  fuck you roland emmerich  fuck you both very much  you took a great series that at its core was about the human potential for destruction and you butchered it you utterly destroyed a piece of our childhoods too just like you did with carrie 2 and the lovely bones fuck you    emmerich like peter jackson should just stick to what they can do leave the films to actual directors
Jan 10 2010,positive,great as an action or disaster movie but weak as a godzilla movie  it bears no resemblance to the original film or franchise from which it bears its namesake  plus it ripsoff other american films such as jurassic park
Jan 9 2010,positive,kewl movie  n guess wat i watched it again on hbo 
Jan 7 2010,negative,i have this movie and i like ituntil i watch it i always forget why its so bad because i really dont know why its so bad it just kinda is
Jan 6 2010,negative,a big load of wasted extravaganza but has some heart
Jan 5 2010,negative,you cannot imagine how awkward it is for me to watch matthew broderick in this movie with a buttugly godzilla shame on you emmerich
Jan 2 2010,negative,this is painfull to watch    includes very dated animation unrelated babygodzillas awfull attempts at comic relief and it completely misses the point of the classic japanese movies on top of it all a sickeningly unoriginal and misplaced romance between puppyeyed matthew broderick and maria pitillo who is about as shallow clichãd and mindnumbingly stupid as a moviereporter or attempted reporter can possibly be also involves criminal misuse of jean reno
Jan 1 2010,positive,another movie that gets all the hard stuff right then lazily gets too many easy bits wrong oh for a james cameron eye throughout this project     an enjoyable romp often unfairly criticised the ending displeased me like fatal attraction i think there is something wrong with the subliminal message of killing things that are out of place rather than evil both films would have been better with different endingsand sequels
Jan 1 2010,negative,a friend of mine worked on this movie haha
Dec 31 2009,neutral,good effects but reminded me of jurassic park though
Dec 31 2009,negative,out of all the awesome stuff they could of done with this movie why did they make it as crappy as it is
Dec 30 2009,positive,a japanese classic made for a western audience gojira pronunced in japanese watching it again i remember some of the vivid scenes i think the special effects were classic at the time
Dec 29 2009,positive,nowhere close to as good as it should have been

Dec 23 2009,neutral,i like this movie probably more than others so this is probably the most generous review this flick will get   godzilla follows dr nick i cant remember his last name he is pulled from his research to investigate the appearance of a mysterious sky scrapersized monster in manhattan the performances are decent and the action is soso except for the final esahcrac which was pretty cool the film takes a very different look at the big green lizard as we see him as a real monster with the military hot on his coldblooded tail as they combat him they find out that the beast is not all that he seems the special effects are passable at best the dialogue is terrible and the movie comes off more funny than scary or exciting the best thing about this movie is the performance of jean reno as a french secret service agent everyone else just comes off as silly the spirit of the movie does not follow the spirit of the old films which is possibly the worst thing about it godzilla steals 5 monster roars out of 10 and thats being generous
Dec 23 2009,negative,godzilla marks the downfall of roland emmerichs moviemaking business    imitating rabbit from winnie the pooh why did roland emmerich move on to making bad movies why oh why oh why    anyways like i was saying most movie remakes suck ass from a straw the day the earth stood still got remade the shaggy dog got remade friday the 13th got remade everything however there are some good remakes such as the 2005 version of king kong the upcoming tim burton version of alice in wonderland and homeward bound which was remake of the 1963 disney film the incredible journey     but thats not my point my point is the 1998 version of godzilla is a pretty bad remake looks like roland emmerich has joined the nowmediocre film club along with don bluth and bob clark this movie made me start to hate emmerichs postid4 films and heres why    this movie takes place in the present days in new york city a giant japanese monster known as godzilla strikes in our planet meanwhile scientist nikko tatopolous matthew broderick no one can pronounce his last name right and a u s military plan to destroy this monster before it destroys all of new york city    i spotted that nancy cartwright harry shearer and hank azaria are also in this film what the hell is this a simpsons reunion whatever next the entire cast of spongebob squarepants is going to show up    a cartoon based on this movie aired on fox kids at the time this movie premiered in theaters and the cartoon sucks 1000 times more ass than the movie and its also directed by roland emmerich and its on kabillion on comcasts on demand    bottom line once youve seen this movie itll make you boycott emmerichs movies dont ever watch it however its not the worst movie ive ever seen besides the only thing i got from this movie was the trailer     final score 10100 horrible
Dec 23 2009,positive,im one of the few people on the planet who liked this movie
Dec 23 2009,negative,the guy in the rubber godzilla suit from the original movies had more personality than any human character in this one  the monster just looks like any monster  you might as well call this movie fredzilla  so it was a waste of money to attach the godzilla brand name  unfortunately it doesnt even work as disaster porn since most of the movie is about people just gawking at godzilla and marveling at how big he is    the experience is like watching the highest paid batter on your favorite team hit a ground out to the pitcher
Dec 22 2009,negative,cant really defend this one much it is roland emmerich after all
Dec 21 2009,negative,is it possible for an action packed monster movie with good special effects for its time to be tedious and boring  yes case in point  godzilla  size doesnt matter because movies shorter than 139 minutes have told better stories than this one  just saying
Dec 19 2009,negative,a major disappointment for me as a teenager  havnt even revisited since
Dec 18 2009,positive,not as good as some of emmerichs other films but still pretty fun to watch
Dec 18 2009,negative,jeez what a mess  with a cast list full of comedy actors its easy to see why this is such a funny movie  unfortunately the comedy is unintentional awful
Dec 17 2009,negative,man this movie blow really badly  the american godzilla doesnt match up to the japanese godzilla  the made this godzilla more a a wimp whom doesnt breath atom fire or none of that good stuff  i really like jean but this movie he shouldnt be in at all
Dec 17 2009,negative,broderick cements his legacy as the most boring lead of all time an absolutely pitiful movie with paper thin characters and a dull monster
Dec 17 2009,negative,what a disaster this was it started out pretty well but as the movie wore on its obvious that it was not up to scratch the screenplay is dire the special effects is poor the characters are dull and why the hell did they want to change godzilla steer well clear of this wreck and stick to the japanese godzilla movies theyre a lot more fun than this joke
Dec 13 2009,positive,pretty alright movie nothing really special its decent ive watched it several times since seeing it in theaters not as bad as everyone would have you think
Dec 11 2009,negative,hollywood crapped out version of a japanese classic icon
Dec 11 2009,negative,it is spectacular and certainly more so than a guy witrh a stupid kaiju costume but the story dude wheres the story
Dec 8 2009,negative,while godzilla looks okay hes not the traditional godzilla we all know and love  i was and never will be a huge godzilla fan but the movie was awful to every detail acting special effects story and direction  not worthy of seeing unless you really would like to waste two hours two precious hours
Dec 6 2009,negative,a joke actually though broderik makes it bearable
Dec 6 2009,negative,my memory always told me this adaptation of godzilla was mediocre but a recent viewing of this film revealed that its total assage the fact this film barely to not at all captures the feel of godzilla isnt the only issue really its just bland repetitive annoying and boring given that i had some good laughs with this film of course directed at the films sheer stupidity and lame humour theres little else to say about this film that isnt a rotten or negative statement at least the characters have a little dimension to them and some background but it still doesnt give you much reason to care for these characters the film barely escalates because most of the movie the military is looking for godzilla who disappears in the city how does that happen and when he does appear hes running away what a puss and the military constantly sends out helicopters that completely miss their target and destroy more of the city than godzilla does theres never this feeling that godzilla is necessarily unstoppable theres just this feeling that hes an ordinary dinosaur who could be taken down easily but isnt so because the military is clumsy the whole hatching of eggs come on its jurassic park and alien mixed its absurd apparently the major revamp for this film was due to the fact emmerich wasnt a fan of prior godzilla films which is a bad sign for the film to begin with no wonder if you want to make a proper american godzilla film you got to have a directorwriter who respects the source material which asshole hired emmerich for this god knows but all i can say is what everyone else has said this is not a godzilla film godzilla in this film is a dinosaur on the run and raising babies not the terrorizing and even ironically heroic depending on which film firebreathing monster that we all know and i guess admire theres plenty to poke at in this film for amusement but thats the most entertainment youll get out of this film
Dec 3 2009,positive,critics give it horrible reviews but you gotta give it credit its entertaining
Dec 2 2009,neutral,dont really remember the movie remember the music from it though
Dec 1 2009,negative,how did godzilla get inside madison square garden to lay eggs in every other seat that creature was walking beside skyscrappers and swatting at jets my word just an awful idea to remake something that already sucks
Dec 1 2009,negative,i hate what hollywood did with mrgodzilla
Nov 30 2009,negative,wasted opportunity considering what could have been godzilla is now more dinosaur than the freakish super mutant that he should have been and only uses his fire breath twice in the film and its not even blue as you can tell i am a big fan of the original japanese gojira movies and in those godzilla was not entirely bad in fact he fought other monsters so why did they not do that in the plot also the cast is totally lame with only jean reno being of any interest
Nov 27 2009,positive,call me crazy but i actually like this granted ive always been a godzilla fan and seeing this at age nine was like heaven on earth when i look back on this i can say that it was well made has some great special effects and the characters are fun now its not a wonderfully constructed story and it basically revolves around showcasing godzilla destruction but honestly i dont really care the movie works for what it is a big budget monster movie while it basically changes everything about godzillas origins and everything about the character basically we do get to see him destroying manhattan and thats good enough for me for what its worth matthew broderick does a good job here and so does the always awesome jean reno roland emmerich succeeded in making an incredibly larger than life disaster movie that at times appears extremely surreal other times goofy but always entertaining
Nov 26 2009,neutral,there were some redemptions but it is a dump of a film why does jean reno do this
Nov 26 2009,positive,i have always loved the concept of a gigantic dinosaur attacking a citybut the way this movie uses it is patheticthe first half of this film started out excellent but then during the second half i began to loose interestit got more and more pointless and i was stunned at how awful the effects werethis movie ended up being too long and slightly patheticbut on the other hand i love disaster movies and everytime a building was destroyed i got back into itso this movie is just alright
Nov 25 2009,negative,hilarious idea brought a lot of stereotypes for the japanese people though the movie is cheesy
Nov 24 2009,positive,good movie but not like the originals
Nov 23 2009,negative,this is a horrible poorly made movie enough said
Nov 23 2009,positive,its a new point of view for the classic japanese monster     i really liked it and i thimk they did a great job by changing its image and giving it hte chance of making it reborn its has better visual effects than previous and afterwards movies so its a full price
Nov 22 2009,positive,im a little biased since i am a huge godzilla fan like i saw a lot of late night 70s godzilla movies
Nov 20 2009,positive,good remakereally enjoyed it  hated how the ending made me sad instead of satisfied though
Nov 20 2009,negative,this movie isnt even fit to growl at its predecessor a horrible remake
Nov 17 2009,positive,hes green my fav color
Nov 16 2009,negative,it sucked im a godzilla fan of the real godzilla
Nov 16 2009,positive,i liked thisits considered one of the worst movies of all time but people loved blair witchsin city and escape from lai dont get iti dont want to get itthis was a fun movie
Nov 15 2009,positive,love this film for many reasons and this godzilla looks so much better than the japan versionlove it
Nov 14 2009,negative,my childhood dream was to finally see a godzilla movie in theaters my dream turned into a nightmare godzilla not only got much much smaller but his new look was horrible was his look copyrighted i wouldnt be surprised also hes not so much of a cool dino in this because he focuses on little helicopters instead of buildings also godzilla is a she like oh my fcking god what have they done this movie did so bad japan actually made a movie saying that it wasnt godzilla attacking the us however it was actually some monster they call zilla you get to see in that film the real godzilla make zilla eat sht and die now thats entertainment
Nov 13 2009,negative,jean reno is pretty cool in here thats about it
Nov 12 2009,positive,this film has a very slow start but as the storyline progresses you become more immersed in it theres some really gd scenes like when there in the taxi and nearly get eaten by godzilla
Nov 11 2009,positive,matthew broderick is adorable in his character and hank azaria is always great
Nov 10 2009,positive,for a summer rollercoaster ride this version of godzilla works as a sheer popcorn movie  not a true godzilla movie but not a bad monster movie
Nov 10 2009,negative,one may have a good laugh at this remake of a 1954 japanese classic director roland emmerich claims he regrets making the movie and im glad that he at least admitted it it takes place in new york city where the city has just been attacked by a giant iguanalike monster people from other countries claim they have seen it and refer to it as godzilla by the time the monster arrives in nyc the mayor and the military must find a way to take the monster down scientist nick tatopoulous played by matthew broderick takes a significant amount of assistance in figuring out how the monster formed and what to do about it he meets the french sergeant phillipe roache played by jean reno who helps him maria pitillo plays news reporter audrey timmonds who wants to succeed in the news reporting business and there seems to be some kind of romantic story between her and nick its weakly developed though hank azaria plays animal polotti a man skilled with using cameras as he tries to get his footage of the monsters attack these are the four leads and three of the four broderick reno and azaria are good especially reno pitillo is not so good michael lerner and lorry goldman are very funny as mayor ebert and his aid gene respectively these two characters were meant to spoof the film critics siskel and ebert who had previously disliked emmerichs previous films and it was no different with this one its funny to see these characters but it may not have been necessary moving along when godzilla meets nick it happens to be raining when godzilla moves away the military is ordered to open fire not only do they with bullets helicopters and missiles seem to miss the target but it stops raining the rain is on and off throughout i wasnt believing that wed go through such drastic measures as destroying the city to kill godzilla which includes blowing up the empire state building and the brooklyn bridge also ive got to say the visual effects were terrible for its time it looks very awkward to see nick running as the feet of godzilla are chasing him and this doesnt change when the baby godzillas are chasing the humans in madison square garden its easy to assume that the effects were rushed for the theaters the set design is rather strange as well the sequence involving the taxicab inside the mouth of godzilla is the weirdest scene of them all this movie had a budget of 130 million as well as a lot of promotion proving to be a huge waste of time and money that doesnt entertain
Nov 9 2009,negative,good grief this movie was embarrassing i flipped past it on tv last night would never even be tempted to rent it what horrible acting what horrible plot what horrible special effects
Nov 8 2009,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen please roland emmerich take note of manoj nelliyattu shyamalans filmsstop making them
Nov 8 2009,positive,it pains me to say this but i actually kind of like this movie
Nov 8 2009,positive,lol i love this movie  and all of the other godzilla movies too
Nov 8 2009,neutral,it looks ok i like how they tempted you to see the movie the monster but when i saw it it was like wtf
Nov 7 2009,positive,ohhh childhood favorites
Nov 6 2009,positive,this is a good movie because it describes all of the weird testing america is into
Nov 5 2009,positive,one of my favorite movie monsters
Nov 4 2009,negative,hes angry hes mad he watches the worst movies ever hes an angry movie reviewerthis godzilla movie is just to stupid to be called godzilla cause he looks stupid and he dosent breath fire from his mouth so go to your place where you rent all of your movies from and rent it and toho renamed the monster zillasee you
Nov 3 2009,negative,a dishonor to the godzilla name this is an ugly soulless movie
Nov 3 2009,positive,a decent monster flick it wasnt great but if you are in the mood for a monsterdestruction movie than this should satisfy you
Nov 3 2009,negative,first time i saw this movie was great but then it was only strange
Nov 2 2009,negative,a waste of everybodys time
Nov 1 2009,negative,i have to start this off by saying that i dont know anything about godzilla  ive never seen any of the older movies made but im sure they are better than this      this movie seemed more like an amusement park action ride than it did a movie  i felt like i should be sitting in a moving chair with surround sound  however i didnt feel the action was very well done for the movie  godzilla and all of his babies were completely cgi  for when the movie came out the cgi is good but its not perfect  i felt like the movie was not consistent  for example godzilla was outrunning fighter jets in the beginning of the film but towards the end of the film he had trouble catching a taxi cab  another weird thing was the baby reptiles  they were supposed to be extremely strong but couldnt break a piece of wood holding a door shut  im also pretty sure that they could outrun a human      it bothered me that godzilla was assumed dead when there was nearly an hour of the movie left  this just seemed like a weird concept considering he is the monster in the movie but this was also when the plot split so i guess it made a little bit of sense  i was bothered that the worm guy seemed to know everything  i know you can use biology and relate animals to other animals but it seemed a little ridiculous  there was also cleverly placed advertisements placed throughout the entire movie  blockbuster kfc and pepsi are a few you will see    im not sure why they ended the movie the way they did either  they set it up for a sequel but never bothered to make one  its been 11 years since this film was released and i believe the company that has released this has lost the rights to godzilla      final words  it is worth seeing once but i cant see myself watching it again  its a monster movie and you will get exactly what you are watching but somehow i feel the older godzilla movies will be a lot better than this one
Nov 1 2009,neutral,was fantastic watched it in hindi dubbed was full of laugh with those hindi dialogues
Oct 30 2009,positive,cool stufffwell taken
Oct 29 2009,positive,if you love giant monsters watch this movie
Oct 25 2009,positive,i liked the movie i am still waiting 4 the second part
Oct 22 2009,positive,why did no one like this d
Oct 19 2009,neutral,contains spoilers    well it was better than jurassic park but if it werent for matthew broderick and the wonderful jean reno the movie would have been crappy and i am i the only one who felt bad for poor godzilla when she stood over her childrens dead bodies this was so sad
Oct 17 2009,positive,yeah so wat i like it its better than a guy in some fucking suit
Oct 16 2009,positive,loved the taco bell commercials tho
Oct 16 2009,negative,i first stumbled upon this movie while looking for some japanese godzilla movies at my local blockbuster i was planning on getting one to rent when someone accompanying me said no get that one its the newest one pointing at the lizard eye box cover this was back when i thought doom was an awesome movie so i actually liked godzilla now that i look back on it though its one of the worst movies ive ever seen the script sucks the plot sucks the jokes suck the effects suck and on top of that its a horrible ripoff of jurassic park think about it a large trex like dinosaur runs a rampage through new york and upon defeating the dinosaur the group finds a nest of dinosaur eggs wow they werent even trying the worst part about it that they ruined one of the greatest movie monsters of all time they gave him horrible cg changed his design to look like a trex and made him weak as all hell i mean in the original movies godzilla gets all messed up rockets lasers everything the only thing that can take down godzilla is another monster but in this god awful movie they take him down with just a couple of missiles its like and insult the only redeeming factor this movie has is the oh so famously stupid line thats a lot of fish please burn all copies of this movie and destroy the ashes with the nearest household power tool
Oct 14 2009,negative,literally a pile of shit
Oct 12 2009,positive,a very good monster movie if it just wasnt called godzilla
Oct 12 2009,negative,prefer the original with the dude smashing stuff in a dinosaur suit
Oct 11 2009,positive,very coolway better than the original lol
Oct 11 2009,negative,this film just has wrong written all over it the acting is horrible the cgi on godzilla looks extremely cheap even for 1998 the script is just awful the action is standard i could go on and on
Oct 8 2009,positive,i loved this film when i was a kid my favorite of all time love the scene when the taxi is inside godzillas mouth near the brooklyn bridge towards the end of the film    but as i got older i started to look pass the awesome action and destruction brought on by the radioactive lizard    the writing and acting definitley couldve been better    i gave this movie a good review for the sake of my childhood i loved this movie so much but this thing is not a good movie sorry childhood
Oct 7 2009,negative,i watched when i was teenager and at that time i liked
Oct 5 2009,negative,the principal unleashes godzilla on an unsuspecting bueller  get back to class
Oct 4 2009,negative,why ruin the top greatest monster ever like this why oh why this movie is incredibly dull and more  stupid than any monster movie could get and whats up with these baby godzillas dont waste your time watching this  instead watch some better 
Sep 30 2009,negative,there are so many mistakes in this movie as well as things that make this movie cheesy it had a huge budget that was spent on visual effects and stunts but nothing else
Sep 30 2009,negative,ummwhy was this necessary relevant no it really wasnt was it
Sep 29 2009,neutral,campy safe way to tell a story that had great potential obviously the visuals were awesome but the attempts at comedy were embarrassing still you cant complain too much its about a lizard taking over a city so being upset about the plot is quite sad besides there is so much more wrong with this than the plot
Sep 28 2009,negative,this killed a classic
Sep 26 2009,positive,not bad but not good
Sep 26 2009,negative,i didnt know godzilla was asexual
Sep 25 2009,positive,yeah i liked this its not really the traditional godzilla but hey when you take away the rubber suit bad dubbing and little city models youve lost half the charm anyway
Sep 25 2009,negative,big what the fuck moment of my childhood i was at least 3 years old when this came out and i thought it was pretty lame even then ive tried seeing it again multiple times but it still doesnt get any better in fact it still doesnt have a plot
Sep 24 2009,positive,i cried at this film 
Sep 23 2009,positive,ant beleive what im readingwhat horrible writing what fake special effects what a boring uninteresting plot hah and then i think to myselfwait a minutei dont care about how horrible the writing is or how boring this movie is if you think this move is boring then your obviously not familiar with monster movies anyway its still one of my favourite movies
Sep 19 2009,negative,again no rating is low enough
Sep 19 2009,positive,all those who say godzilla r all stupid idiot dunnoe how 2 watch
Sep 17 2009,positive,an ok film not boring its fun to watch seeing godzilla run around the streets of newyork along with the screaming then trampled crowd surely gave me a ride the effects were ok cgi is good on that time it would be made better if its done today the cast well i dont know i dont know if they fit with the film a radiation expert a reporter camera man french guy though i know their names made a good team but godzilla was the man of the film with or with out the romance of broderick and pitillo jean renoyes funny on their bubblegum scene its unforgetable makes them look american yeah right d
Sep 16 2009,positive,a big budget special fx driven monster blockbuster designed to and delivers just what should be expected  a brainless flick with limited plot good fun
Sep 16 2009,negative,what the fuck did they do to godzilla
Sep 15 2009,positive,big fan of the large green lizard loved the actors involved they played it perfectly and the big guy well cant go wrong eat destroy repeat
Sep 13 2009,neutral,if this movie didnt have the word godzilla in the title this wouldve been a really good monster movie  being a huge godzilla fan i watched it  i was sort of disappointed  it isnt godzilla unless it is a guy in a monster suit  cgi cant replace it  as a movie it was ok  as a godzilla movie not that good
Sep 12 2009,positive,i was never a huge fan of the japanese godzilla movies so for anyone that is die hard about it dont get angry with me i am sure that if i had happened to be a fan or know more about the japanese films i would be more inclined to hate this movie     overall this movie is nothing special just a typically cheesy monster movie with little velociraptors thrown in this movie is mildly entertaining but nothing special i kind of enjoy this film which is why i am giving it a fresh rating although in the scheme of things i dont disagree to anyone who says this movie sucks check this out at your own risk
Sep 7 2009,negative,was never much interested in godzilla and this didnt change it
Sep 7 2009,positive,not well received on its release really like this one hank azaria and jean reno are old faves dialogue is terrible but i like it nonetheless
Sep 6 2009,negative,after making the ok independance day roland emmerich made this monstrosity this movies not only was a bad godzilla ripoff it also steals from jurassic park the biggest problem is the horrible acting and dialogue the plot is just stupid with plotholes the movie does have some good special effects which saves it from being a complete waste of time
Sep 4 2009,positive,good times good times this movie came out when i was just a little boy and i loved but remembering back and watching some clips this movie does suck while havent seen this movie in years i am giving this movie a positive review why for my childhood it may sound little bit bias thats because it kind of is besides the second to last fifth of the film totally ripoff jurassic park and i love jurassic park please dont judge me 35
Sep 4 2009,negative,godzilla  a worn down king kong  matthew broderick  absolute gayness not even a fun movie for a guilty pleasure reno took this role and turned down agent smith in the matrix bad move mr reno
Sep 4 2009,neutral,when looking at this film from the fanboy japanese godzilla perspective yeah this americanized version is an insult to the original but its not as bad as everyone says it is godzilla is entertaining enough  tons of action and chase scenes passable special effects and jean reno who i think is hilarious with his usual french persona however the story is thoughtless and plain and the characters are funny sometimes but mostly disposable godzilla for me is a 90s childhood favorite but now its a bit of an eyesore
Sep 1 2009,negative,this film is neither especially good nor unberably awful godzilla has some decent special effects and some ok acting but the problem with the film is that it doesnt feel like godzilla but rather an imitation of jurassic park the design and behaviour of godzilla himself prove this as he is nothing like his japanese counterpart i cant recommend this film but its not as bad as it could have been
Sep 1 2009,positive,i was a huge godzilla fan when i was young i used to have a godzilla blanket from the movie lol i wish that thing was hangin around somewhere lol
Aug 31 2009,positive,amazingly this is the most realistic monster bash ever our firebreath alien comes to existence amid nuclear and military experiments in the worldbroderick plays nick totopoulosa scientist who encounters this beast on a trip to the french polynesian islesit seems our monster lays eggs within the famed madison square garden arena when the beast disappears to pop up later he reeks havoc on  big apple manhattan it is a tense struggle to save the citys people and defeat this monsteronce and for allbravo and cheers for the special effects
Aug 29 2009,positive,hey i liked it when i was 10
Aug 29 2009,positive,another guilty pleasure of mine i give this such a high rating more for its personal nostalgic value as this was one of my favorites as a kid but this is pretty much a horrible movie the script is some of the worst writing i have ever heard in a movie ever the acting is straight up putrid even as 12 year old child we refered to broderick as nick the bad actor pitillo is simply pitiful i cant imagine why she never ever acted in hollywood again azaria lerner dunn pretty much everyone is total shite of course with a script like this they were doomed no matter who they were reno is the only cast memeber who turns in even a semipassable performance the monster is great bigger badder and way cooler than his japanese predicesor and the effects are great really good battle sequences are definetly the only highlight of the movie bad pacing as there are long lulls dispersed throughout and the whole baby godzilla subplot is ridiculous while it is interesting to see the cheesy rubber version brought into the 20th century anything beyond the action sequences is dribbe still its very entertaining once you get past the awful script and acting
Aug 28 2009,positive,i felt sorry for him in the end he                   godzilla shoudnt have died it was a good movie though
Aug 28 2009,positive,i still very much enjoy this movie
Aug 27 2009,negative,its not so much godzilla as it is just a different sort of giant monster movie
Aug 26 2009,positive,seen it like a million times  loved it
Aug 26 2009,neutral,lol this was a fun movie to watch
Aug 26 2009,negative,watched this again for first time in 10 years mildly entertaining but flawed action thriller comedy blockbuster remake    relies on some memorable action setpieces but suffers for lack of interesting dialogue and a questionable cast even gravitas from jean reno doesnt save this bloat
Aug 26 2009,negative,so bland and boring
Aug 24 2009,positive,great film  but feel sorry for godzilla when he dies 
Aug 24 2009,positive,ferris bueller gets chased around new york by a giant monster how can you not love this film

Aug 22 2009,neutral,size does matter      a dumb monster movie that failed to live up to the hype    years ago the french military conducted a series of nuclear tests in the french polynesia of the pacific ocean most of the wildlife was killed in the surrounding areas but a member of the lizard species survived and was irradiated by the fallout in the late 20th century a japanese fishing vessel is attacked by a massive unknown sea creature that destroys the ship leaving only one survivor who is traumatized by the incident in one word he describes what he saw as godzilla nrc scientist niko nick tatopolous is called into to investigate the matter and deems the massive creature to be the result of the testing with mans most powerful weapon the us military are about to have their hands full as the creature has been making its way north and is about to hit and cause havoc in new york city which is nothing more than a mere playground for the king of the monsters known as godzilla    helming yet another scifi disaster film is roland emmerich the guy with an eye for spectacle this remake of the japanese film of the same name starts off well but soon gets tedious with lame acting poor dialogue and cheap cgi despite being a critical failure for which it was nominated for five razzies worst picture worst director worst screenplay worst supporting actress and worst remake or sequelit was certainly a box office success godzilla had a budget 130 million and grossed 379014294 worldwide    the lead character is dr niko tatopoulos matthew broderick a scientist who studies the effects of radiation on worms and his expertise will certainly help the military learn about the threat they are about to face tatopoulos has to report to colonel hicks kevin dunn of the us military on every detail he finds after the creature has destroyed half of new york tatopoulos runs into his old girlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo when he is buying pregnancy testers to see if godzilla is pregnant this love story didnt need to be in the film as i already care little for the characters a failed attempt at a love triangle is written into this film and includes tatopoulos timmonds and partially dr elsie chapman vicki lewis the most decent member of the cast is jean reno as philippe roache a french secret service agent who is trying to stop godzilla and make up for his countrys mistakes a nice addition to the cast as a comedic relief element was michael lerner as mayor ebert and lorry goldman as the mayors aide gene these two characters were an attempt at expressing displeasure towards critics roger ebert and gene siskel for the constant bashing of emmerich and cos work in the past i like matthew broderick kevin dunn and other members of the cast as actors but here there performances are stiff and you never believe in them    the design of this godzilla is one i find to be well done he doesnt look fat like the japanese version and it makes sense for him to be not impervious to missiles i do wish he had better fire breath to cause more damage to the military and new york the cgi done for the creature isnt astonishing as godzilla looks like he was just cut and pasted onto the screen the amount of military hardware surrounding new york is impressive and it includes submarines tanks jets attack helicopters and pretty much everything but an abomb the special effects for the action scenes are even poorer than the shine given to godzilla himself    this  is a dumb monster movie for people who like to keep their brains of while watching film the effects are poor but you get the idea the dialogue isnt the greatest and the characters are weak godzilla fans of the official toho series will want to gouge their eyes out after seeing this this flick is only worth watching if you have a taste for dumb monster blockbusters    the city that never sleeps just got a wakeup call

Aug 22 2009,positive,ha ha my first dvd the best scene is inside the shopping centre or is it mall in america
Aug 22 2009,neutral,godzilla dazzles in its special effects but plot holes flimsy acting and too many imitations of jurassic park make it too weak to recommend
Aug 22 2009,positive,okay it may not be as good as some of the directors others films but it still an good popcorn flick not as bad as some say
Aug 22 2009,negative,what a disappointment
Aug 20 2009,positive,well hells bells people this movie may not be great but it is far from awful as a diehard bigg fan i was a little dissapointed with this movie but overall it a good remake godzilla looks different his babies look stupid so what its a fun popcorn flick and compared to train wrecks like transformers its a rolicking success godzilla would be proud gino isnt bad and matthew broderick ismathew broderick if you like him you like him if you dont you probably hate him oh well your loss rock on gino rock on
Aug 19 2009,positive,this is one movie i absolutely cant explain why i like so much but i do must have something to do w matthew broderick hes hilarious
Aug 19 2009,negative,they had the rights to godzillato bad they didnt bother making it awesome in anyway ill admit i liked the design for godzilla but it owed more to jurrasic park than anything else and missles kill godzillain the toho films godzilla is indestructable and can only be killed by another monstermy opinion they should have bought the rights for king ghidorah and had him fight him instead of going on a rampage
Aug 18 2009,positive,as a godzilla film it sucks but as a monster film that successfully reboots godzilla for an american audience i think it does wonders and who better than ronald emmerich to do the honors
Aug 18 2009,negative,you know what it sucks thats all there is to it
Aug 15 2009,neutral,i think this movie made a profit before its release through merchandising and promotion  which is just aswell because although this is not a bad movie it is not exceptional and easy to forget amongst all the other disaster and monster movies out there  good effects but not much plot and acting is hohum
Aug 15 2009,positive,this the a movie   i have watched it like 100000000 times
Aug 14 2009,negative,should have been called attack of the giant dinosaur
Aug 14 2009,negative,the teasers were a million times better than the product
Aug 14 2009,neutral,haha this was awesome when i was a kid
Aug 14 2009,positive,this is worth  watching
Aug 12 2009,neutral,a rather shitty homage to the original godzilla i thought it was fun but it was a shitty take on godzilla and its babies acted like retarded raptors not my first choice
Aug 11 2009,negative,jurassic park in nyc i mean a remake of the classic japanese monster movie noisy  chaotic
Aug 10 2009,negative,this film was trying hard to not be what it was meant to be and fails because of it    has some nice forgetable 90s eye candy though
Aug 10 2009,positive,acting and script  not so great everything else  pretty good actually godzilla fans and people in need of a popcorn flick might enjoy it
Aug 10 2009,negative,i found this fairly boring but with a little entertainment value  probably saw this with daniel kerry mandy susan maybe in bournemouth or on vhs
Aug 10 2009,negative,crap i loved this when i was a kid though
Aug 9 2009,negative,wow what an epic an epic failure seriously how can they fuck up godzilla the cast completely sucked but what can you expect when matthew broderick maria pitillo and hank azaria are the main stars jean reno was the only joy from this and thats because hes better then shit aka broderick pitillo azaria and his english sucks roland emmerich sucks as a director and a screenplay writer and this movie proves it the only thing that emmerich did with the story that was even close being clever was ripingoff ebert  siskel but it backfired and emmerich just looked like a dumbass that he really is    
Aug 9 2009,positive,a seriously underated film that amazed me from the begining the special effects while they dont make a movie are incredible in this one all in all i was very suprised how much i enjoyed this this one is definetly worth a shot in my opinion check it out
Aug 6 2009,negative,worth seeing to make fun of  its such a piece of garbage
Aug 6 2009,negative,what it holds in the visual department is completely outdone by its horrendous performances and completely senseless plot
Aug 6 2009,positive,so bad the japanese renamed him to zilla and talked about how he was just another monster that the americans thought was godzilla still like the movie though
Aug 4 2009,negative,fun when its about a giant lizard smashing up manhattan but i really could have done without the multitude of lame subplots about the human characters
Aug 4 2009,negative,this was a bad idea to try and remake a japan classiceven a dude in a rubber suit is better than this crap
Aug 4 2009,positive,pretty decent film but it could have been so much better i also did admire the spoof on roger ebert and gene siskel
Aug 4 2009,neutral,could have been much better if they had a storyline
Aug 3 2009,positive,its a fun movie but too many things are ripped from jurassic park but its nice to have azaria and shearer both simpsons veterans in this     godzilla and its offspring are the highlights of the film however
Aug 3 2009,neutral,should of made a second one it left it open for a second one
Aug 2 2009,positive,one of the most wellknown monster films godzilla is a very interesting look at the humanity of flesh eating monsters as theyre just trying to survive after all
Aug 2 2009,positive,one of the most wellknown monster films godzilla is a very interesting look at the humanity of flesh eating monsters as theyre just trying to survive after all
Aug 1 2009,positive,i mean come on its the godzilla wrecking havoc in ny
Jul 31 2009,negative,that was not godzilla  it was just a big dumb lizard  matthew broderick would crap his pants and give up if it was the real one
Jul 31 2009,negative,godzilla holds the actionstyle and graphics  the actors hold their palms up and ask what should we do next
Jul 30 2009,negative,on the plus side jean reno    on the minus side almost everything else
Jul 27 2009,positive,i8ny not as campy as the older movies but still tries to capture that same spirit throw in a little neojurrasicpark and it makes a good popcorn muncher
Jul 26 2009,neutral,though it has amazing special effects it lacks in story and any real character development honestly there is no pleasing some people does it have a big nasty radioactive lizard that pulverizes new york and munches tanks without impunity oooo yeah however the drawback of this film was undoubtedly the humans the humans in this film were awful they spent way too much time on the whole reporter side of it and relationship nonsense about these characters we dont feel anything for people just wanted to see some downhome building crushin that and the constant dreary rain and dark atmosphere this is godzilla not blade runner two big highlights though were the creature chase scenes on land and sea and jean reno lets face it jean reno makes everything he touches much cooler
Jul 25 2009,neutral,one sentence review    visually stunning but lacks any real plot and corny characters
Jul 25 2009,negative,an american remake of a legendwhat else do you expect
Jul 25 2009,positive,it might have been because i was a kid and had no much experience what this cinema industry was that i totally loved this moviei dont know what i will feel now if i watch this these daysbut the fist time i watched this i liked the movie
Jul 22 2009,positive,ok just beacause it got jimmy page thrown back into the limelight
Jul 21 2009,negative,the graphics are good bu everything else falls flat the acting is bad the story is odd and has little emotion or sympathy roland emmerich seems to have started a downward spiral after this movie

Jul 19 2009,negative,this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen its so bad
Jul 17 2009,positive,well quite a bit of action  godzilla  matthew broderick is his usual cute and goofy self  the computer generation is pretty decent and there are some funny parts as well  i just love
Jul 14 2009,negative,i wonder when the people who are doing a movie realize that the movie sucks and no amount of budget will help  with a big name cast big budget and new cgi to work with the hope and potential of this movie was really high  a couple of things really stand out  that it is easy for a 500 hundred foot monster to hide in nyc a city with 10 million people  two when big monsters come to nyc it rains continuously for several days  three if you are impersonating an american soldier just chew a big wad of gum very loudly and you can get away with anything    obviously the people of cloverfield thought this was a good idea that only could be improved with shaky cameras shoot me now
Jul 14 2009,positive,it was ok but that was because it had hank azaria and harry shearer in it
Jul 11 2009,negative,size does matter    following the french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific an unknown creature is spotted passing eastward through the panama canal scientist niko tatopolous is called in to investigate the matter and he quickly arrives at the conclusion that a giant irradiated lizard has been created by the explosions godzilla then makes its way north landing at manhattan to begin wreaking havoc in the big city even with the combined forces of the us military to fight the monster will it be enough to save the people of new york    review  despite the promise of its snide tagline size does matter godzillas penis never fully comes into play herein he reproduces asexually people who remake campy monster movies have got to consider what made the originals great  and it usually has nothing to do with a bulging budget the original godzilla was endowed with some personality despite being relatively lowbudget in appearance this version is one long special effect the filmmakers include a spiteful sarcastic swipe at movie critics gene siskel and roger ebert who must have found their thumbs going limp after witnessing godzilla
Jul 8 2009,positive,im a sucker for giant lizards and hank azaria  gahzheera
Jul 8 2009,negative,blech you wanna see real monster movie see cloverfield this just plain sucked
Jul 7 2009,positive,good popcorn film but could have been better the plot and characters are okay but the special effects are awesome and i like that one godzilla design over all its a good film

Jul 5 2009,positive,just dont take it seriously and youll really enjoy this movie its got very good special effects for the time and great action
Jul 4 2009,positive,a montage of french nuclear tests in the pacific ocean observed by many marine iguanas then in present days a japanese fishing ship is being attacked by an unseen monster only one survived traumatized he is later questioned in a hospital by a mysterious frenchman and repeatedly says only one word gojira nrc scientist niko nick tatopolous is called in to investigate the matter and he quickly arrives at the conclusion that a giant irradiated lizard known as godzilla has been created by the explosions then godzilla makes its way north landing at manhattan to begin wreaking havoc in the big city even with the combined forces of the us military are going to destroy godzilla at all costs but will it ever be enough to save the people of new york
Jul 4 2009,positive,better than i was expecting i love that godzilla was not made to be evil just a caring parent
Jun 29 2009,positive,yeaahh it was ok good but i did not like how they put godzilla in new york it should have been filmed in tokyo
Jun 28 2009,negative,turdturdturd  actually manages to rip off the movie gremlins
Jun 27 2009,positive,good cheesy summer blockbuster
Jun 25 2009,positive,this film is one of the reasons i want to make movies  i do understand why die hard godzilla fans would absolutely hate this movie i usually like remakes that are faithful to the original i think the reason i like this film was that i watched it before i watched the 1954 original i probably would hated this if i watched the original first if it was just titled zilla amercian godzillas real name it probably couldve just been part of the toho series and couldve gotten better reviews     still this is one great monster movie from roland emmerich     the actors were great never hated matthew broderick the special effects are impresive the action scenes just fantastic with the helicopter chase and the cab chase and zilla makes a great debut to the big screen     godzilla rampages through your mind with excitement and fun and shall be a classic forever    not completely faithful but full of entertainment  see it but see the 1954 version first
Jun 25 2009,neutral,the soundtrack for this movie was phenomenal back in the day but now it is sadly dated broderick leads a band of misfits through a weak plot if you are a fan of this city destroying monster you might not want to raise your expectations for this movie very high
Jun 25 2009,negative,very bad  but cool special effects at the time
Jun 22 2009,positive,not a true godzilla film  should never have used the name   other than that a good enjoyable monster movie

Jun 21 2009,positive,this is special because it brings out the school days memories went to see this with classmates school picnic so its not great and i love jurassic parkthe lost world much more but its a good time pass movie and i could watch it again and again and againits that kind of a mediocre movie
Jun 20 2009,negative,the gender bending was very annoying it would have been more plausible if godzilla traveled to ny to breed
Jun 20 2009,negative,wow this was bad on top of bad and who would have thought this turd could have come from the minds who made an almostequal sized turd independence day
Jun 17 2009,negative,one star for hank azaria sorry matthewi couldnt spare another

Jun 14 2009,positive,one of my favorite movies as a kidso cool
Jun 14 2009,negative,incredibly stupid and an insult to the real godzilla roland emmerichs godzilla is a stupid overthetop action film the cgi on zilla himself was horrible that has nothing to do with the original godzilla the monster looks like nothing like him either why couldnt they use the original design were they trying to be creative and come up with something else who knows sure the action scenes are okay and there are some thrills but its just a misfire all around a bad script an uninteresting story and poor acting make godzilla a mindless blockbuster
Jun 14 2009,positive,good special effects but the movie overall was just alright
Jun 14 2009,positive,  saw this in the cinema around the time dolby digital 51 was introduced in multiplexes
Jun 13 2009,negative,fail thats all there is to say about this as a fan of godzilla this pained me bad performances and a monster who runs away from the military roland emmerich said he wanted godzilla to look more like a lizard mr emmerich godzilla is supposed to be a mutated dinosaur not a giant iguana

Jun 8 2009,positive,change the name of the moster other wise great
Jun 7 2009,negative,what a disaster this was it started out pretty well  but as the movie wore on its obvious that it was not up to scratch the screenplay is dire the special effects is poor the characters are dull and why the hell did they want to change godzilla steer well clear of this wreck and stick to the japanese godzilla movies theyre a lot more fun than this joke

Jun 4 2009,positive,despite everyone hating this one i loved it
Jun 2 2009,negative,they should change the name of this film to even worse than the second jurassic park film this took one of the greatest cinematic icons and reduced it to a generic action even that wasnt much good plot holed mess of nothing aww and they set up a sequel that never got made such a shame in the real godzilla films theres now a spiny one called american godzilla who gets his ass handed to him good

May 18 2009,negative,if you thought this was cool or something go take a second look at it now
May 17 2009,negative,probably one of the worst remakes of alltime the cgi looks like shit mortal kombat annihilation had better effects the characters are shit and just one question is this godzilla or is this the lovechild between a trex from jurassic park and the monster from aliens
May 17 2009,negative,i had no idea how bad this movie was until just recently when i saw it as a kid i was fervently obsessed with the old godzilla movies and couldnt make a clear distinction between the old crap and the new
May 17 2009,negative,could have been so much better
May 16 2009,positive,i love all things godzilla  to have it all happen in native land again weas awesome  those who dont like this movie were expecting far too much
May 16 2009,negative,this ruined my childhood watching the original godzilla films with the guy in the suit kicking over the cardboard buildings
May 15 2009,negative,silly green day song aside this movie really really sucks
May 14 2009,positive,i was rootin for the big lizard
May 14 2009,negative,i watched this on tv a month or so ago i wasnt a huge fan of it when i saw it the first time and this more recent time reminded me of just how completely stupid this movie is
May 14 2009,positive,great retelling of a timeless character
May 10 2009,negative,just one of the most poorly written films of all time  just awful
May 10 2009,positive,classic movie but not very interessting
May 9 2009,negative,one of the worst movies ever made anyone else want the damn lizard to eat the cast
May 9 2009,positive,nice remake of a hyper classic japanese scifi movie
May 8 2009,positive,this is the boss of all godzilla movies matthew broderick plays the nerdy hero to the hilt jean reno providing much gallic macho no eye candy here though
May 7 2009,positive,i dont think ive ever found anything so wrong with this movie that would warrant the hatred of so many people its okay good at some parts crappy in others it starts out unique and interesting but slowly deevolves into more and more cliches the baby godzilla sections felt like a cheap knockoff of the jurassic park raptors and the final chase scene in the end is riddled with redunancy and lack of thrills all that said i think that this is a movie that is greater than the sum of its parts its a summer thriller and little else and trust me there are far worse films than this one that have the same agenda of simply being entertainment
May 2 2009,positive,i liked it it was a good movie
May 1 2009,negative,let me down big time emmerich hasnt done anything good since
May 1 2009,positive,a dinosaur era in a modern tokyo
May 1 2009,negative,decent for a mindless actionmovie not much more
Apr 26 2009,positive,not too bad not really my kind of movie
Apr 25 2009,positive,a sweet pop corn flick
Apr 25 2009,negative,thats a lot of fish sutopolis
Apr 24 2009,neutral,so far removed from the original classics its untrue not a bad film but it really shouldnt have been called godzilla at all decent enough effects and an amusing performance from jean reno pretty much made the film for me the rest of the cast are pretty poor
Apr 23 2009,negative,best thing about this movie was the teaser trailer
Apr 23 2009,negative,i love the old godzilla monster movies that the japs made some guy in a godzilla suit smashing up papiermâché houses thats worth watching not some very poor cgi hollywood crap that this movie was not worth watching this dribble
Apr 23 2009,negative,the producers first conceit is even attempting to link their film to the classic japanese monster didnt they learn anything from dino de laurentiis the story line is so far removed from the original toho feature that its unnecessary to call this a remake ishiro honda certainly didnt hold a copyright on the giant nuclear monster destroys big city story line in fact the modern godzillas plot limps along feebly in its first half where the behemoth plows through manhattan its only when the writers break completely from the original and introduce a nest full of baby monsters that the energy picks up and godzilla provides some fun fastpaced action another problem that the blockbuster has is the creature itself even with the original godzillas rubbery body and fixed face he or more accurately she had personality something that this modern digitally animated beast woefully lacks so its up to the human cast to provide it and theyre not all up for the task as the worm guy who figures out how to fight back against the monster matthew broderick is his usual appealing self even when spouting such ridiculous lines as each one of these amazing reptiles are born pregnant and thats a lot of fish maria pitillo as his exgirlfriend and cub reporter exists mainly to wear flattering tops and suck lollipops the best performances not surprisingly come from two regulars from the simpsons hank azaria is funny as a gonzo tv cameraman and harry shearer essentially reprises his kent brockman role from the animated sitcom if the makers of godzilla hadnt been so hot to jump on the remake bandwagon of the late 90s they might have produced a film with more lasting impact than a series of taco bell tiein commercials
Apr 22 2009,negative,this has to be the biggest pile of giant monster dung i have ever seen  leave it to us americans to sink a japenese icon that has survived for at the time of this movie 43 years  what is that thing a giant iguanna  ooooh  scary  definitely not a 400 ft tall atomic fire breathing mutated trex  this things only plus side is it can swim in more than a straight line  the acting is terrible the effects are a joke   the storyline has more holes in  it than war of the guargantuans  this is a steaming pile of godzilla poo  the best part of the movie apart from the ending credits was the taco bell ad campaignhere lizard lizard lizarduh oh i think im gonna need a beeger box  i award you 1 star because unfortunately there are worse movies than this and may god have mercy on its hollow soul
Apr 21 2009,neutral,a guilty pleasure movie  enjoyed seeing it despite its silliness
Apr 20 2009,negative,againfuck you roland emrioh
Apr 20 2009,positive,it is quite different from the japan style godzilla but still good
Apr 16 2009,positive,it might be totally different to the japanese version especially without the hyper beam attack but this movie is very interesting and its graphics is far better than the japanese version plot was well written and i was actually expecting a godzilla 2 to be release due to the ending of the movie with the baby godzilla hatching
Apr 16 2009,negative,this movie sucked beyond beliefif ever a movie deserved a negative rating as in less than zero stars this boner by devlin would be it
Apr 16 2009,negative,soundtrack was better
Apr 16 2009,negative,this was a mistake of a movie
Apr 15 2009,negative,what a comedown after independence day
Apr 13 2009,positive,i liked it fun and entertaining the only thing i didnt like was the blond chick
Apr 11 2009,negative,disapointing rather have the maninasuit godzilla to this any day
Apr 10 2009,positive,okay this is one of my guilty pleasures  im fascinated with overgrown monsters and animals  this is the perfect popcorn movie with some laughs and thrills thrown in
Apr 8 2009,negative,fun when i was in the 5th grade im sure i would not judge it the same now
Apr 8 2009,positive,ok im a big godzilla fan they marketed the crap out of this and it scored huge box office early but the changed godzilla into something only called godzilla missed a chance to make a really good film by messing with a model that worked
Apr 8 2009,positive,i think the best way to start this review and to summarize the nature of this film is to compare it to the first song during the end credits a man raps over led zeppelinâs kasmir his weak words of protest and defiance a pitiful waste of any skill laid on top of a great classic in the same was the original concept of gojira is taken utilizing some of the campy less than serious elements of the older franchise and then poorly reinvents it for an american audience the opening credits are well styled to the movie and the action of the second half especially the infants in madison square garden are a series of entertaining scenes and the movie as a whole is entertaining to watch but the characters are cheap mildly annoying and shallow portrayals of humans and new yorkers the film pulls on references from aliens independence day jurassic park and in turn inspires elements of jj abrams cloverfield there are moments that are almost identical making one wonder why he chose this as a reference but the film does not stand out as a standard or a grand tribute to other movies instead as already stated this movie cannot translate the campy somewhat ridiculous nature of other godzilla films into a formula that seriously works on the big screen
Apr 7 2009,negative,while i seem to remember being entertained by this in the theater in 98 i watched it again about a year ago and found it absolutely stupid i think its mostly to do with the fact that the special effects used were at the end of their prime and honestly tho ill always love ferris beuhler so was matthew broderick
Apr 7 2009,positive,great movie the funny thing is i saw this right after watching lake plasid both great movies
Apr 6 2009,neutral,i enjoyed this as a teenager when it first came out but i can say that it doesnt really hold up as well now the cgi is quite cartoonish the acting is bad and some of the scenes are just dumb
Apr 6 2009,negative,this could of should of been much betterthey ruined the enitre thing from changings godzillas classic look to all the baby godzillassigh
Apr 6 2009,negative,gino is not godzilla  wanna see the real thing  watch godzilla final wars
Apr 5 2009,negative,boring as boring can be
Apr 5 2009,positive,nobody seemed to like this movie i thought it was brilliantly done its funny and action packed with great cgi and it didnt make you gag like cloverfield
Apr 5 2009,positive,this is ok has dated a fair but over the years cloverfield shows how it should be done it did take another 10 years for that though
Apr 3 2009,negative,too much hollywood style
Apr 2 2009,positive,its godzilla and jean reno it might not be great but its got some nostalgia in there
Apr 1 2009,positive,this is not a godzilla movie  its a movie about a giant lizard
Apr 1 2009,positive,childhood memories still enjoyable kinda even though its not really godzilla
Mar 31 2009,positive,me and my sister used to watch this movie soo much
Mar 30 2009,negative,jean reno lives  always a sign of a bad movie and where was the taco bell dog
Mar 29 2009,negative,heres something positive i can say nice special effects for the time but thats the only positive thing
Mar 28 2009,neutral,this wasnt as bad as people say
Mar 27 2009,negative,do producers really think that monster fans will watch any old twaddle just because it has a giant beast in it and whats the point of watching something thats a virtual clone copy of thousands of other atomicbredmonsterrampage films youve already seen there are ideas lifted straight out of other films such as the lost world and the whole thing reeks of commercialization with its digs at disney and other such companies the waferthin plot is down there with the worst of the japanese godzilla films and the film is very overlength the monsters here are computergraphics and it shows  theyre just so bereft of character or realism the big creature is barely visible through the grey skies and rain and its face complete with desperate dan chin makes it look comedic rather than frightening the babies are just laughable and are quite obviously cgi graphics
Mar 26 2009,negative,i actually walked out of this movie
Mar 26 2009,negative,worst movie of all time
Mar 26 2009,neutral,overblown monster yarn how many times will we see nyc being destroyed
Mar 26 2009,negative,im not really into this kind of movie so
Mar 24 2009,negative,they layed eggs in msg
Mar 24 2009,neutral,at least this movie was much better then the black and white movies  where you can tell it is a doll  this is entertaining but how many blockbuster animal movies do we really need  i guess if matthew broderick wasnt in this movie it would have no spark
Mar 24 2009,positive,great movie if only the actingwriting didnt suck definatley better than its japanese counterparts
Mar 23 2009,neutral,okay movie  been waiting for hollywood to have the technology to do godzilla right story is lackluster and the performances match that effort
Mar 22 2009,negative,way to rape the series mr emmerich
Mar 21 2009,negative,way to try and ruin my childhood hollywood
Mar 21 2009,positive,good movie tell us we can belive the godzilla sometime but women no   woman does everything  for her unsensetable feelings and stupid wills there is no rule for it even super smart nerts were being  fooled everytime  so be careful   dont trust so much in 
Mar 20 2009,negative,after careful review this movie its kinda stupidgive me the cheesy old black and white version any day
Mar 19 2009,negative,better than the core
Mar 17 2009,positive,much better than the old version i loved godzilla like i love chocolate its great and thrilling including breath taking
Mar 17 2009,positive,very very entertaining worth a watch especially if you havent watched it in a while
Mar 17 2009,negative,a horriffic take on the godzilla series for western audiences
Mar 16 2009,positive,better than what most people think
Mar 16 2009,negative,oh mani could go on and on how craptacular this movie wasbut i wont stick with the japanese original kiddies
Mar 16 2009,negative,good if you have an iq lower than 16

Mar 15 2009,positive,clasics for me all the way this new version was still pretty good much better than i thought it would be
Mar 15 2009,positive,there was something about godzilla not looking like a man in a suit that made this somehow disappointing
Mar 14 2009,positive,pretty cool at the time but yet another that would be awful if i saw it again
Mar 14 2009,negative,should not have been made
Mar 14 2009,neutral,i dont get this asian classic b movie it is a mythical creature like the dragon could use more story line explaining the current signifigance of such a enigma
Mar 14 2009,negative,aint seen dat film in tym
Mar 14 2009,positive,bleh i like the japanese gojira movies but this one was ok
Mar 13 2009,negative,i give this 2 stars only for the beginning of the movie  it is actually quite interesting following the trail of the monster across panama and the footprint scene was really well done  then the movie descends into absolute stupidity when the creature goes to new york  some scenes of the monster running through the streets are better suited to a bugs bunnyroad runner routine
Mar 13 2009,negative,it was a dreary day in apriltbs was on the tv
Mar 12 2009,positive,i liked it so there
Mar 12 2009,negative,could possibly be the most disappointing movie ever made
Mar 12 2009,positive,bmovie unintentionally

Mar 4 2009,negative,starts out okay but then turns into the new york branch of  jurassic park
Mar 3 2009,positive,matthew broderick sucks
Mar 3 2009,negative,the only thing of note is that jimmy page plays guitar on the horrific puff daddy cover of kashmir yeah im stretching here
Mar 2 2009,neutral,jean reno is the only good thing in it
Feb 28 2009,positive,stupid and a pathetic excuse for a godzilla movie but for some reason i love it
Feb 28 2009,negative,really really really bad
Feb 27 2009,negative,i like matthew broderick but this movie was subpar
Feb 27 2009,positive,eh nothing like the japan ones but still good
Feb 27 2009,positive,not quite as bad as everyone says
Feb 26 2009,positive,seemed good at one point
Feb 26 2009,positive,it has jean reno and a big lizard and lots of stuff gets destroyed while this film lacks the charm of the original godzilla movies there is enjoyment to be found here
Feb 26 2009,positive,much better than thowe old cheesy ones from japan
Feb 25 2009,neutral,very boring abd sometimes fun
Feb 25 2009,negative,i remember seeing this as a child and i loved it man i was the stupidest kid ever this movie is a pile a junk the acting is bad the cg doesnt work the possible odds of godzilla hiding dont make sense and is just nothing but a cluster fk if you want a good monster movie then the original godzilla would be a great choice this is just garbage
Feb 25 2009,negative,this could have been sooooo good
Feb 23 2009,positive,eh i grew up with godzilla in the 70s and 80s he was way better then didnt look like an over grown nuclear iguana
Feb 23 2009,negative,it has stock characters and a creature with no personality godzilla 1998 is a dumb junky popcorn flick
Feb 22 2009,neutral,the only cool thing about it is the crazy japanese man and the giant lizard
Feb 20 2009,positive,7510  godzilla has been heavily maligned by many but i dont believe its anywhere near as bad a film as many have claimed it is  its a giant aweinspiring spectacle not much more i could ask for
Feb 20 2009,positive,i dont care what anyone says i liked this movie
Feb 19 2009,positive,a typical yet fun and entertaining monster movie  if i were asked what was my favorite monster scene of any film i would say it is when godzilla first appears in new york city in this 1998 retelling of the japanese classic  yeah perhaps its a little hokey at times and doesnt entirely live up to the original but the movie nonetheless thrills and chills  put simply its a popcorn movie but that fact is often overlooked and the film thus underrated  im still moved when zilla dies on the brooklyn bridge
Feb 18 2009,neutral,its zilla cuz that aint no god if you ask me
Feb 17 2009,positive,i dont care what anyone says i liked this movie
Feb 16 2009,neutral,lame wow such a jurrasic park wanna be
Feb 15 2009,positive,when i waz little i luvd this movie
Feb 15 2009,negative,i dont know how cg fails compared to a guy in a rubber suit but here you go
Feb 14 2009,negative,gosh when i was a kid i would watch all of the godzilla japanese original films and i would think godzilla is the best thing created when i saw the new godzilla i thought blow me roland emmerich many many problems arise in this film the first one is the biggest problem for me is godzilla if you are going to make a godzilla film make it look like a godzilla it is just a giant lizard when i first saw godzilla american i thought it was a giant iguana it looked nothing like godzilla having this monster breathe fire and be a giant monster does not make it a godzilla second big problem is roland emmerich roland has only made movies with over the top cgi special effects constantly independence day was pretty good day after the tomorrow over the top special effects 2012 will be an over the top special effects 100 its just that every movie he has made has made low critic reviews cause it isnt only the cgi it is the acting too emmerich is a cgi guy not a good director i have no problem with matthew broderick being the nerdy scientist and really i have no problem with the other cast except marias character that changes and does dirty rotten things and you want to like her and then she wants you to hate her like hate like hate it is such a crappy character now the mayor and his assistant dude was pretty bad now what i noticed about the mayor and his assistant friend is that they were making fun of the critics siskel and ebert the review people and what a bad job they did now giving godzilla the ability to be asexual is pretty smart but it doesnt play out well also the scenes where the baby godzillas awake from their eggs and act like raptors from jurassic park and after the submarines kill godzilla some how hell spat him out and godzilla came back to life and attacked the main characters lastly godzilla is killed and no one cares and the biggest huge problem is the very very end where a baby godzilla escapes and roars then to credits hoping for a great sequel to this great film this movie destroyed my look on godzilla and thankfully in the japanese godzilla films the original godzilla kills the american godzilla within 40 seconds now that is a battle this film sucks
Feb 14 2009,negative,well with this film it was very dodgy us update of the classic tokyo destroying lizardits a rip of so many ideasand the little baby zillas make it even worsealmost jurassic parkish crossed with aliensthe look is goodthe effects being quite decent for the time i was just exspecting much more
Feb 12 2009,negative,what a stupid film just consider this how come godzillas size changes throught the film
Feb 11 2009,positive,the best godzilla movie
Feb 11 2009,neutral,bonus point for having the french save the day still a pretty awful movie though
Feb 10 2009,positive,it they wouldnt have raped godzillas name this movie would be more respectedbut they did rape his name so its not as cool
Feb 9 2009,positive,i think this film was a victum of its own marketing there was no way in hell it could live up to the hype and sadly people were dissapointed that it didnt bring the dead back to life or make the kid in the wheelchair walk again look at the original again people its not a master piece its a low budget bit of nonsense a classic but nonsense this is exactly the same just a bigger budget stop the hate people
Feb 9 2009,positive,a highly underrated film extremely entertaining great effects and great actors definitely worth seeing
Feb 9 2009,positive,i think its a great movie  its a remake of a film about a giant lizard that destroys a city  we get a movie about a giant lizard that destroys a city but with more expensive fx  whats more theres some fun action with a bunch of babies too  jean reno was also a nice touch  im not sure why anyone would expect more  i do think it would have been better however if matthew had entertained godzilla and all the sons of godzilla with some beatles karaoke
Feb 8 2009,negative,nice one america take the guardian of the east and turn him into a well what big and unique creatures tend to be in films    a threat an nexcuse to shoot at something on your home turf poor gody
Feb 8 2009,negative,since when is godzillas enemy the big bad government  oh thats rite it never was his enemy was always another fucking monster
Feb 8 2009,positive,following the french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific an unknown creature is spotted passing eastward through the panama canal scientist niko tatopolous is called in to investigate the matter and he quickly arrives at the conclusion that a giant irradiated lizard has been created by the explosions godzilla then makes its way north landing at manhattan to begin wreaking havoc in the big city even with the combined forces of the us military to fight the monster will it be enough to save the people of new york
Feb 7 2009,negative,when puff daddy doing raps over zeppelin is the most memorable thing about your movieyou got a problem
Feb 6 2009,positive,ill only watch the version i edited
Feb 6 2009,positive,it may not be a work of art but you cant say that its not fun and entertaining
Feb 6 2009,neutral,the monster comes wreaks havoc and then dies no explanations no backstory whatsoever its all about the effects which are good but when the dust settles its like a fresh can of soup with nothing in it
Feb 5 2009,negative,what a fantastic pile of crap of course i love it in a masochistic kind of way
Feb 3 2009,positive,very bad special effects but hey thats godzilla
Feb 3 2009,negative,to watch maria pitillo is too painful to explain and broderick and azaria were just forced into a bad movie truly a horror for a le
Feb 3 2009,positive,acting was painful most of the time but tolerable to see the creature and observe the storyline
Feb 2 2009,positive,roland emmerichs another attempt to destroy his favourite city by an overgrwon wall lizardfinenothing too great
Feb 2 2009,positive,i dont see what the fuss was about this movie was awesome
Jan 28 2009,neutral,shoulda been better
Jan 28 2009,negative,well to be fair to those who are in love with this film i will not compare it to the better made japanese films in the franchise in this review    never mind the redesign of the title character director roland emmerich decides that popcorn films are made to equip the audience with a film worthy of having popcorn thrown at the screen during key parts reminiscent of ed wood story telling whatever luck he struck with his earlier film independence day was totally a stroke of luck    with a script bad enough to contend with ed wood films for the position of worst ever the scientific side of the film stoops down to the level of the 1957 film the amazing colossal man and the cgi effects at times look stiff and no better than what phil tippets gomotion animation might have looked like if the technique was ever fully mastered if you dont know what im talking about watch the special features of jurassic park    spoiler alert    roland casts the sappiest actors known to modern hollywood and has them attempt at interacting with a monster that cant be seen by anyone until after it would have effected performances matthew broderick does little more than sound like the astounded twelveyearold boys the film was made for    as mathews character randomly named the japanese sounding name of niko tatopolous to give a nod to the films superior works of art helps an american fleet of military guys who all look and act like they just came off the set of the hottest sitcom of the day    then when godzilla makes is big entrance in the film we learn that he is a giant mutant iguana that grew due to the effects of radiation from this point the films also loses all science fiction credibility that was at least aimed for in films like jurassic park not only does this radiation make things grow big but it also wipes any of the natural instincts of the creature as godzilla can be seen displaying the characteristics of a giant asexual mole instead of an iguana    in lure of all this madness the military evacuates all in nyc this evacuation seems to be ignored by the filmmakers as there are scenes that take place in a pharmacy and a sports bar during the period where the city was supposed to be emptied    godzilla ends up reproducing inside sports arenas too small for him to actually fit in and when this is found out matthew joins up with a bunch of french guys and the dumbest cast of female characters ever seen in modern hollywood to destroy the nest    when the end credits finally started to roll what had passed was a film where anything that could have been amazing was reduced down to a really bad pun if you want to have a good godzilla experience watch the first black and white one in its original japanese language it has been hailed the best monster movie ever made if you want to see  nyc landmarks get destroyed watch cloverfield either films are much better by any standards anyone would hold to    sorry folks godzilla 1998 just was not actual entertainment
Jan 27 2009,negative,bloated totally ridiculous disaster movie
Jan 27 2009,positive,love this movie sooo goofy

Jan 24 2009,positive,in my opinion a lot better than its given credit for sure the movie has its flaws but i found it to be quite entertaining for the duration despite dragging a bit at times
Jan 23 2009,neutral,saw parts of it looked ok but not that engaging
Jan 21 2009,positive,oh good lord how this movie is terrible but as it is the only godzilla movie that hasnt been racked with terrible voiceovers we have no choice to accept it as good because we have nothing to compare it with     that being said it still doesnt make it not fun to watch its always fun to become a little kid again and believe that godzilla actually exists and could terrorize new york very easily if he wanted to
Jan 21 2009,negative,thats a lot of fish
Jan 21 2009,negative,i think this movie would have been better if they had skipped the cgi and put a dude in the suite stomping around the minature city
Jan 21 2009,negative,found this to be really disappointing despite all the hype surrounding it was not a very good film at all
Jan 20 2009,negative,this movie is terrible  i laughed by my arse off

Jan 9 2009,positive,an entertaining remake but nothing more than that
Jan 9 2009,positive,an entertaining remake but nothing more than that
Jan 7 2009,positive,how can some of you people think this movie is bad its way way way way way way way way way way way way way way better then the olc cheesy campy older godzilla movies come on rhw special effects where amazing and godzilla actually looked not like a fake robot like the other stupid godzilla movies the hole point of this movie was to make it nothing like the other godzilla movies it stands alone you loser nerds need to get a life and stop complaining about this movie a sad thing is never had a sequel and a sequel wouldve been awesome lol i remember when i was little i would watch this movie over and over again and i would always cry at the end when godzilla got shot and died deffently deserved a seqel one of the only monster movies i can watch over and over again
Jan 7 2009,positive,an enjoyable action romp but thats about all
Jan 6 2009,positive,say what you want about this movie i saw this movie when it first came out and i liked it
Jan 6 2009,negative,overhyped and overstupid
Jan 6 2009,negative,why is jean reno in this film
Jan 3 2009,negative,cloverfield succeeded where this film failed profusely
Jan 3 2009,neutral,not too bad worth seeing at least once actors do bring it down quite a bit focus on the lizard terrorizing nyc
Jan 2 2009,negative,omg whyy does this exist xd  its not a remake but its jus terrible ahahahaa wish i never watched it xd  but i was entertained by the fact that many of the simpsons cast was in it haha
Jan 1 2009,positive,i dont know why everyone seems not to like this film its defianty not the best film but its not complete crap when i saw this i almost shit myself this movie was great at what it was trying to do whitch was to americanize godzillafuck you haters wtf do u know
Dec 30 2008,neutral,does anyone else remember the taco bell commercials with godzilla  i think i need a bigger box
Dec 30 2008,neutral,i liked it when it came out now its lame
Dec 28 2008,positive,really cool movie enjoyed it
Dec 28 2008,positive,i contend had jurassic park never been made  this would have been a bigger deal as it stands  cloverfield was a much better godzilla movie
Dec 28 2008,neutral,2d character a script that at times borders on ridiculious and makes it difficult to judge the acting performances given what they had to work with scietifically its a load of bollocks aswell decent effects but nothing out of the modern day ordinary yet its actually quite a cute film jean reno saved it for me with out that french secret service slant on it i would have hated it all in all its ridiculious enough to be enjoyable but a movie that should stand as a warning to scifi flicks its almost impossible to create the full package hollywood blockbuster movie and still retain any dignity in your finished product however your far better off watching king kong or cloverfield if you have the choice
Dec 27 2008,negative,this movie never fucking ended i almost chewed off my own tongue just to keep myself sane
Dec 27 2008,positive,other than making godzilla a oversized iguana this movie was not too bad but they should have made godzilla look more like the classic godzilla
Dec 26 2008,positive,not as bad as everyone makes it out to be the special fx rocked my world godzilla looks awesome and it was an entertaining film the whole way through the only things i didnt like are that the actorsactresses seem lifeless at times and how can godzilla be 200 feet tall at one point and then the next he can run in a 50 foot tunnel with no problem
Dec 26 2008,negative,godzilla  jurassic central park you idiots americans should keep their filthy hands off godzilla
Dec 25 2008,positive,not bad if one takes it for what it is and doesnt judge it against the real godzilla the whole act with the horde of minigodzillas in madison square garden was pretty lame but the one giant lizard stomping a city flat stuff was entirely adequate
Dec 24 2008,positive,this is a better movie then everyone thinks
Dec 23 2008,negative,ill tell you what dont bother with this and just watch jurrassic park its quite emotional that they have to kill the big dinosaur but do we want great huge monsters strolling around our cities the special effects and the action can be quite good but this is so unnecessarily long there is also far too many stupid lines that are meant to be funny but become annoying and the ridiculous love story that is way too unrealistic and predictable and done too many times urgh
Dec 22 2008,positive,cant compare this to the toho classics this shouldve been called big lizard
Dec 21 2008,negative,a fan of the asian films but i dont take them seriously so i wasnt too omg offendorzed by what devlinemmerich did to this  not bad at the time but the effects have aged terribly and really start to show after multiple viewings  average cgi that doesnt blend with the environments baby dinos with no reflections and extremely poor modle fx considering the budget  the cities and model cars look every bit as fake as their japanese counterparts  gets worse the more you watch it
Dec 20 2008,positive,i dont know why this movie gets so much hate  godzilla isnt the most serious property in any case or event  if you enjoy big disaster movies like id4 and cloverfield give this a whirl
Dec 19 2008,positive,nicee special effects and godzillas looks were so unique and excellent with its id4 creators and producers good parody on mayor ebert the actual movie critic who gives movies with thumbup or thumbdown reviews wellcasted movie with action thumbs up for this mov
Dec 18 2008,negative,a really dont lyike this film a dnt c y every1 is crazy over it
Dec 17 2008,negative,dear matthew broderick why
Dec 17 2008,negative,weak  but then again the effects were cool
Dec 15 2008,positive,this was the godzilla film that got me into the godzilla films  it is my favorite godzilla film of all time id rather watch this insted of any japanese film any day the jap films were corny  you expect what was going to happen this is  always will be the most realistic godzilla film than any other  in this film it explained how godzilla got kids in the japanese film son of godzilla just showed up what the fuck in 1 of the early 90s japanese godzilla film had 1 son of godzilla that looked like his dad
Dec 15 2008,negative,this movie was sooooo good when i was little
Dec 15 2008,negative,man had high expectation for this movie totally understand why they didnt make a sequal every part of the movie was bad

Dec 13 2008,positive,one of the greatest godzilla episode with modern twists that made it the greatest it is a mustsee piece for the whole family
Dec 13 2008,negative,ok storyand awesome effects but a poor interpretation of japans fav monster
Dec 12 2008,positive,classic film i really enjoyed it
Dec 12 2008,positive,imagine what happens when it has a poo
Dec 10 2008,negative,bad moviethis is just a disgrace to the japenese moviesthe actors were just horrible and the plot was awfuli dont recommend thisif you wanna see a movie like this see cloverfield or jurrasic park
Dec 9 2008,negative,this made me ill godzilla was a huge disappoint that should have been left to rot in a warehouse
Dec 9 2008,positive,this is by far the best godzilla movie ever jean reno owns haha
Dec 8 2008,positive,well i liked the monster anyway its a pretty convincing giant lizard though its definitely not godzilla if it had been released under a different name people would probably complain less so i cant be too harsh on it still its a giant lizard running around new york hunted by stupid characters as if we havent seen that before
Dec 8 2008,neutral,i thought this was just a typical movienothing really stood out to me in it  just all right
Dec 7 2008,positive,this one was better at the cinema only just tho
Dec 6 2008,negative,oncet said to be the worst movie made i understand why
Dec 6 2008,positive,isnt what i had hoped but its ok
Dec 6 2008,negative,whoever made this movie needs to be shot in the face with a shot gun at point blank range
Dec 4 2008,neutral,not as bad as i thought it would be
Dec 3 2008,neutral,i was one of the idiots that actually paid money for this movie
Dec 3 2008,negative,godzilla is your typical monster flick it is dumb full of cheesy dialogue and attempts sympathy with the monster at the end a bad idea  nothing special here
Dec 3 2008,positive,i dont care what anyone says i enjoyed this movie a lot
Dec 2 2008,positive,best car chase the fact that the chasee was a dinosaurs
Dec 2 2008,positive,i cried at the end of this film 
Nov 30 2008,positive,yknow i dont get why folks did not like this movie
Nov 30 2008,positive,the only problem with this movie is that its called godzilla
Nov 25 2008,negative,i love godzilla movies and i hated this
Nov 24 2008,negative,a horrible reworking of a classic character tough to tolerate
Nov 24 2008,neutral,i have no connection with previous incarnations of the beast this particular one is relatively entertaining but theres a lot of awful stuff too the human element is lacking the dramatic beats are all familiar and irritating while there were some pretty good set pieces unfortunately the special effects could not live up to the creators imagination this is not a jurassic park style creature success its an awful dark cgi saturated messy failure all in all watchable but objectively not very good
Nov 22 2008,positive,not as good as the classics
Nov 21 2008,negative,the rubber suit for the 60s was way way way better
Nov 21 2008,negative,thats not godzilla its zilla
Nov 20 2008,positive,its a devlinemmerich film so youll either love it or hate it i find it a good eye candy movie which out of something called godzilla is exactlly what i want
Nov 20 2008,negative,haha they cant find godzilla in the middle of nyc
Nov 19 2008,positive,i saw this a long time ago but i hardly remember it
Nov 18 2008,positive,i would like for the producers to do over the movie and make the graphics  better
Nov 18 2008,positive,just about everyone i talk to hates this movie  but what can i say i have a soft spot for it  i very much enjoy this movie
Nov 17 2008,negative,yeah its a blockbuster but a pretty tiresome movie to watch after the viral jurassic park franchise another dinosaurthrashesthecity movie isnt really necessary
Nov 17 2008,neutral,in what movie could the french play a part in saving the day not many
Nov 15 2008,positive,wen r they gonna make the 2nd one im tired of waiting
Nov 13 2008,positive,i loved these movies when i was a kid and the while the remake wasnt awesome i still really liked this update
Nov 13 2008,negative,10 years old i would never of known
Nov 13 2008,neutral,this was made around the same time as independence day but i dont think the effects are anywhere near as good  for the money that they spent on this film you think this would be a more polished offering but i dont think its a very good film  i was surprised to see 3 people who do the voices for some of the simpsons characters in this film thats weird
Nov 12 2008,negative,really did this need to be made
Nov 11 2008,negative,cgi nonsense destroys everything but matthew broderick and the fucking taco bell chihuahua     no
Nov 10 2008,positive,truly awesome giant lizard movie thats not badly acted and the sfx rock  the choppers would have murdered him though with their cannons so looses half a star for unrealistic portrail of us military hardware
Nov 7 2008,neutral,not bad old school storyline with modern cg
Nov 7 2008,negative,i liked it and hated it all at the same time  if you can see it for free and have nothing better to do watch it
Nov 6 2008,positive,this movie introduced me to godzillanot a bad movielet it pass

Nov 2 2008,negative,could of been way better
Nov 2 2008,negative,lol really bad remake this is considering that the old japanese ones you could see the zipper on godzillas suit
Nov 2 2008,positive,you know godzilla is just one of the best movie monsters since king kong hes been around the block most certainly done lotz and lotz of films the one that stuck with the most just almost as much as the first one gojira was the 1998 godzilla film yeah i know not very many people were happy with but i can tell ya i was one happy happy child when it came out so thats why i am not so hard on it because it was part of my childhood i mean i even got my parents to buy me the action figures back then i was just hooked on it the movie just made you feel like you were watching a jurassic park movie it opened up a new universe for godzilla and the filmmaker was faithful tworads the origins of godzilla so it was quite worth it in my opinion
Nov 2 2008,negative,this wasnt godzilla
Nov 2 2008,positive,good but i smell like fish
Nov 1 2008,positive,when it first came out i remember thinking it was awesome cant really remember a lot now obviously other than a big lizard destroyingterrifying a city lol
Nov 1 2008,positive,great movie absolutely brilliant
Oct 31 2008,neutral,it could have been better but what do i know i do know this jean reno turned down the role of mrsmith in the matrix so he could play in this movie
Oct 31 2008,positive,saw this in the cinema when i was 8 it blew me away
Oct 31 2008,positive,y didnt this movie do better at the box office i will never understand this is one of my fave creature films great special effects inspired casting especially jean reno and sure handed direction i ve seen this about 5 times and enjoyed it excellent movie
Oct 30 2008,positive,this movie was actually pretty sad why did they have to kill godzilla why couldnt they have worked on releasing it somewhere where it could be in captivity
Oct 28 2008,positive,if you only watch this movie one time its not that bad
Oct 27 2008,positive,intense loved it saw it twice maybe thrice
Oct 27 2008,negative,brought shame to the name godzilla leave japanese monsters alone america
Oct 27 2008,positive,classic very good different matthew broderick awesome scenes
Oct 24 2008,positive,no rubber customs and no subtitles best godzilla movie ever no brainer
Oct 23 2008,negative,roland emmerich ruined gojira with this piece of crap remake godzilla doesnt even smash buildings stomp on people or fire his atomic breath     godzilla 1998 is an example of big budget hollywood failure if you want to see a real godzilla movie stick with the old fashion japanese godzilla
Oct 22 2008,neutral,for what it is its all right
Oct 22 2008,positive,i love the credits song
Oct 22 2008,positive,the new godzilla didnt look like godzilla

Oct 20 2008,negative,pos japanese ones are far better i could go on about how much this one sucks but im not going to
Oct 20 2008,negative,i used to love the soundtrack green day puff daddy with jimmy paige etc but now those songs seem about as bad as the movie why didnt godzilla just eat matthew broderick in that one scene when he gets all close hes so small hes an hors doeuvres
Oct 19 2008,negative,in the same realm as the live action spawn in terms of disappointment and failure  reno is funny but broderick and azaria and shearer  this isnt the simpsons or a comedy peoplemaybe a comedy of errors  effects are poor and while godzilla looks kind of cool he also looks kind of stupid running around like a dinosaur when he isnt a dinosaur this movie was trying to make godzilla into jurassic park and failed badly extremely badlyjust look at the pathetic attempt at duplicating the velociraptors with the babies godzillas an idiotic plot device that made no sense at all  a massive failure dont waste your time
Oct 18 2008,neutral,the graphics were great i love how organic godzilla feels in this movie but it didnt feel like a godzilla movie it felt more like a movie with some random creaturealian sure there were moments of coolness  i really enjoyed godzillas introduction to the city at the pier  but unlike the cheesy goodness of old it didnt capture any of the characteristics godzilla enthusists lovednot that i was that big of one but it still held a certain kind of charm with me this movie simply took an icon and gave it a fresh new unwanted feel
Oct 17 2008,neutral,i admit that i saw this at the theater i know i know
Oct 17 2008,negative,this movie is simply atrocious america took the god out of godzilla
Oct 17 2008,negative,not the first remake of an asian film but possibly one of the worst when a guy in a suit from the 50s makes a more believable monster you know you have problems
Oct 16 2008,positive,i loved this movie d it was really cool for its time
Oct 15 2008,positive,a beast that has no personality has size but no power
Oct 14 2008,neutral,i havent seen it in a while but i remember i was really disappointed
Oct 14 2008,negative,cgi is ridiculously bad even for 1998
Oct 14 2008,positive,good movie just a little too bad for the plot but other than that good movie
Oct 14 2008,negative,totally forgettable movie except that you cant forget that the monster looks nothing like godzilla  lacks the campy charm of the originals
Oct 14 2008,negative,now i think this movie is stupid but back then it reallly2 scares me
Oct 13 2008,positive,this godzilla movie is really good the new godzilla is better than classic one
Oct 13 2008,negative,mutant movies should be funny
Oct 13 2008,negative,this isnt godzilla its a lie
Oct 12 2008,negative,ummm yeah  not great i remember it being a decent enough popcorn movie in the theaters butdoesnt do as well at home
Oct 12 2008,positive,not as bad as everyone says  supremely silly very cheesy fun thought the action was great some looking really fake helicopter attack which could be a tribute to the old movies i supposeyeah right not a proper godzilla movie by any means
Oct 11 2008,neutral,bahhumbug of a movie considering theres so much special effects p a let down
Oct 11 2008,negative,so stupid had its moments but then too many mistakes were made as you kept watching could have been a lot better
Oct 10 2008,negative,not excellent but good solid actors
Oct 10 2008,positive,this remake is a good one with a good cast that work well
Oct 9 2008,positive,one of the first few movies i remember seeing with my dad when i was younger
Oct 8 2008,positive,so the world hates this movie but i love it    tense tntpacked special effect laden monsterfest that is pure entertainment its not particularly smart but what it sets out to do it does very well
Oct 8 2008,negative,saw this in theaters
Oct 6 2008,neutral,prefer the cartoons
Oct 6 2008,positive,disappointing nothing like the cartoon we grew up with as that is what i was expecting but still good
Oct 5 2008,negative,its not godzilla its matthew broderick fighting a giant lizard
Oct 5 2008,positive,this is like one of the greatest movies ever
Oct 5 2008,negative,it was ok wouldve been better if it had been called anything but godzilla they shouldve learned from the new coke fiasco
Oct 3 2008,neutral,eh was good i guess dont like broderick that much some parts were pushin it but hey its a moster movie right
Oct 3 2008,positive,still one of the best creature features out there even after 10 years has dated very well
Oct 2 2008,positive,after watching it several times it aint a bad monster movie but it aint godzilla as we know and love him
Oct 2 2008,negative,no just no godzilla should never be made like this
Oct 1 2008,negative,think i saw itmeh
Sep 30 2008,negative,big budget summer action movies usually are enjoyable even if they are kinda bad but this one was too bad the cast really is terrible hank azaria was cool but nothing else was except maybe the soundtrack which is bomb ass and the sheer entertainment of watching matthew broderick try to run and perform action scenes
Sep 30 2008,positive,not a lot of people liked this but i enjoyed it thought it was nice
Sep 28 2008,negative,american godzilla is horrible
Sep 27 2008,positive,you know what i didnt hate it roland emmerich knows how to entertain

Sep 25 2008,neutral,dont really remember all of it just the end
Sep 24 2008,positive,omg godzilla lol this was the best movie ever i havent seen it in ages hahaha
Sep 23 2008,positive,very good film and fun better than the japanese version where the effects were poor in this movie entertaining and cgi of the dinosours were pretty good
Sep 22 2008,positive,an excellent version of this japanese myth  jean reno always rocks
Sep 22 2008,negative,this is not godzilla godzilla is a guy in a rubber lizard costume that shoots nuclear lasers out of its mouth plus theres the fact that the majority of the damage to the city is done by the military not the big g
Sep 21 2008,positive,jean reno makes every movie he is in good
Sep 20 2008,positive,i remember seeing this in theaters and i cried at the endi was a kid lol
Sep 20 2008,negative,all this makes me think of is taco bell
Sep 19 2008,negative,the story of this godzilla is pretty much the story of jurassic park with a bigger dinosaur  the difference between this and jurassic park is that jurassic park had variety with multiple dinosaurs better acting and a better storyand this movie didnt need to be 2 hours  this also has to be one of the most product placement movies i have seen
Sep 19 2008,positive,i loved this film as a kidnow that im older theres nothing really memorable or unique about this moviegood to watch if youre really bored
Sep 18 2008,neutral,something was just off with this movie i cant exactly point it but a godzilla this was not
Sep 17 2008,positive,this is ok  i liked the very first one which has been rereleased as gojira in the original form  i have to say that jean reno is my favorite in this

Sep 15 2008,positive,great action movie loved it
Sep 15 2008,positive,super good so good its sad when he dies though
Sep 14 2008,positive,love the quality of this film from the acting of jean reno to the quality of the effects this is one film where i certainly didnt think the effects were overdone
Sep 14 2008,positive,not as good as the japanesse movies
Sep 13 2008,negative,didnt do the real godzilla justice
Sep 13 2008,neutral,coming from roland emerichkind of suprising  its funny that they never mention this when they hype up his moviesits always independence day and day after tommarowi dont think they will mention 10000 bc either
Sep 11 2008,negative,the japanese ones are more entertaining
Sep 9 2008,neutral,the movie was okay but it was not godzilla  the fact they claim its godzilla makes me want to punch a baby and then club baby seals with the baby i punched

Sep 8 2008,negative,this is so awful  it has gaping plot holes and really bad acting
Sep 8 2008,positive,panned by godzilla purists this movie really wasnt as bad as it was made out  would be better without the george lucas love story between broderick and pitillos characters
Sep 7 2008,positive,so its the typical disaster movie yet its actually quite funny pretty good i thought
Sep 7 2008,positive,mono gia to soundtrack
Sep 7 2008,neutral,i need to get ther original
Sep 5 2008,negative,absolute crapfest  it was worse than i ever imagined it would be
Sep 4 2008,negative,painful  jean reno get out while you can
Sep 4 2008,neutral,other than jean reno being in this film i found it to be boring why does new york always have to have all this nonsense oh wait its new york it is nonsense
Sep 3 2008,positive,a candyfloss movie  enjoyable but lacking substance just dont watch it with too much expectation jean reno is fun as the rock hard leader of the otherwise inept french secret service squad
Sep 3 2008,negative,very cliched and incredibly unbelievable
Sep 3 2008,positive,i read a lot of bad stuff about this movie so i had low expectations but i didnt think it was that bad okay it had a lot of flaws very variable acting some badly cutted scenes etc but still it i found it quite entertaining  not very memorable but fast packed fun all the way i prefer godzilla rather than the headachepromoting cloverfield
Sep 2 2008,neutral,ok jamiroquai was on the soundtrack to this movie  it was terrible but cmon jamiroquai
Sep 1 2008,negative,awful awful awfulthrice times horrific and unbelievably bad  and yet still better than the steaming pile known as cloverfield  ferris what on earth happened to you
Aug 30 2008,negative,disappointing to say the least  the japanese did it many times better

Aug 29 2008,negative,when are people gonna relise mattew broderick ruins films
Aug 29 2008,positive,awsome movie loved it eva since it came out
Aug 29 2008,positive,if you like this film but find it hard to get to grips that it isnt the real godzilla just think of it as a spinoff film like the mummy and the scorpion king
Aug 28 2008,positive,my daughter cried when the f18s shot at it
Aug 27 2008,negative,awful i like the classic ones not this piece of crap why is this in my favorite movies on here
Aug 27 2008,negative,why why make this craptastic movie based on the clasic camp movies of yesteryear they took it  tried to regenre it  killed it i want a good modern godzilla movie
Aug 26 2008,negative,piss poor jurassic park clone everyone involved in this dogshit of a movie should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves
Aug 26 2008,neutral,relieved of the charm of the man in suit this movie had to stand on its own merits  in the disaster movie canon its quite good  but as i said it lacks charm and has little redeeming quality outside of special effects fans
Aug 25 2008,negative,eh good movie to read during
Aug 25 2008,positive,really cool i wonder if theyre making a sequel
Aug 24 2008,negative,bad  toho should have sent a strike team to kill this movie
Aug 24 2008,positive,i had heard that this movie was bad so i came into it with very low expectations    i enoyed it actually i have never seen any of the other godzillas so i am not going to knock it for not staying true to the formula     it was entertaining and fast paced it isnt too terribly memorable but its a fun movie nonetheless
Aug 24 2008,positive,decent enough as far as well made action scenes goes but really lacks substance  some scenes are just a little to outrageous for my taste though
Aug 24 2008,neutral,as a fan of original godzilla there are things about this movie i had to disagree with a few parts of this moviebut the effects are good and theres a killer soundtrack and jean reno is probably my favourite french actor hes hilarious
Aug 23 2008,positive,i used to love this
Aug 23 2008,positive,not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be but of course it doesnt stand up to the originals
Aug 22 2008,negative,this is not godzilla this is shit
Aug 22 2008,positive,with a cast featuring matthew broderick hank azaria and jean reno you cant go wrong
Aug 22 2008,positive,i remember this  scared me
Aug 21 2008,positive,this one was awesome when i first saw it
Aug 21 2008,positive,a much loved movie of mine
Aug 20 2008,positive,in the words of louis walshi liked it
Aug 20 2008,positive,this is my favorite of all the godzilla movies though for some reason others dont agree with me a lot of hardcore fans complain that the reimagined design for the american godzilla just wasnt cool did anyone complain about them redesigning the joker character in the dark knight this film had groundbreaking special effects quite literally in the movie were new york was constantly breaking apart under godzillas rampage the major thing that really broghtdown this awsome film was the actors they just seemed straight out of a movie like american pie or something even the military characters didnt feel entirly convincing what this film really needed was some serious actors to go with the dark atmosphere of the movie honestly this movie had such a gorgeous dark and gritty look to it all but absent in all the other godzilla films and do you want to know something funny before anybody knew what the cloverfield monster was going to be eye was convinced it was going to be this version of godzilla eye mean the promoting absolutely screamed godzilla the movie poster depicting three claw marks on the decapitated statue of liberty a similar growl in the trailers and a short clip of the movie posted on the web formated to move in slow motion clearly showed the form of the american godzilla but sadly the cloverfield monster ended up being a big letdown now back to this movie ohh man does this movie have destruction and chaos the ending were godzilla died was actually quite sad similare to the king kong ending except on a brooklyn bridge not the empire state building and minus the weeping woman at the very end the movie treats us to a view of a surving godzilla egg hatching and it roaring as the end credits begin to roll tragically the only sequel to this movie was a boring cartoon tv series that no longer airs blast eye so wanted there to be a serious sequel to this but ohh well eye just have to live with the fact that there is almost a zero chance of it happening after all its been over ten years already since this movie came out and still no announcement that there is even a planned sequel my word to the reader if you enjoyed the day after tomorrow or independance day youll most likely enjoy this
Aug 20 2008,positive,the special effects were outstanding but the movie was boring

Aug 16 2008,positive,thank goodness for the brooklyn bridge
Aug 16 2008,neutral,high ratings are for the digital godzilla only but this movie made the big green monster look like any other dinosaur to avoid if you are truly a godzilla fan
Aug 16 2008,positive,sorry classic japanese godzilla is waaaaaaaaay better but jean reno is in this movie and plays a good role so i have to give it a decent rating

Aug 12 2008,negative,sorry but im more of a kong man myself
Aug 12 2008,positive,lol run its godzillacrazy japanese guy running away like a baby
Aug 11 2008,positive,i like how it returned to the antinuclear weapon stance of the original story and it was not a bad movie over all but i wasnt big on how godzilla looked also it seemed like at times they were trying to be more serious than they should have been and at other times they are way off in the other direction
Aug 11 2008,neutral,this movie seemed very derivative it was like some weird combination of jurassic park aliens and gremlins 2  it is a good sound system demo disc though
Aug 11 2008,neutral,well lets see i would give the soundtrack for this movie a 6 out of ten so i guess that means the movie is like a 5 
Aug 11 2008,negative,godzilla babies product placement and matthew broderick were all unneeded additions to this franchise
Aug 11 2008,negative,i think i actually walked out of this me the guy whose seen more terrible movies than i care to list
Aug 11 2008,positive,its funnier than you would expect
Aug 10 2008,positive,bad but on the scale of quality for godzilla movies above average
Aug 10 2008,positive,at least matthew broderick is good
Aug 9 2008,positive,i like the story in this movie just imagine a huge lagartija coming straight to you in one raining day destroying the city and suddendly desapears in front of your eyes feeling like a little ant excellent video and sounds effects the soundtracks is good too
Aug 9 2008,negative,a hideous bastard abomination  give me a rubber monster any day  they tried to make it like jurassic park in the city and it failed miserably in pretty every aspect    literally even the worst of the japanese godzilla films is better than this unoriginal waste of developer
Aug 9 2008,negative,never had i wanted to see a man in a rubber suit so badly
Aug 9 2008,negative,matthew broderickaction star really
Aug 9 2008,neutral,i never liked matthew broderick much and maybe im too nice but i didnt think this movie was as awful as everyone said still maybe 25 stars is about right since i never think of it
Aug 9 2008,positive,watched it as a child and just loved it now the effects seem lil ill though 10yrs of technological advancement
Aug 8 2008,negative,this was just a blockbuster shit
Aug 8 2008,positive,this was a great film  mathew broderick is adorable as all can be and who can ever say no to a giant beast tearing apart new york city
Aug 7 2008,positive,this is damn good  roland emmerich should be praised for his past work on films like this  alot of action and special effects plus great casting  godzilla is the king maybe even more than king kong
Aug 7 2008,neutral,they say one true thing coffe in america is so bad
Aug 7 2008,positive,i love matthew broderick
Aug 7 2008,negative,ehh i saw aliens and jurassic park i didnt need to see them rolled into a godzilla flick and mathew broderick as the hero whos stupid idea was that an what the hell was jean reno doing in this turd mustve needed an extension on his house
Aug 7 2008,negative,i think godzilla is one of those movies that has to be so bad its good but this one is just mediocre which makes it even worse
Aug 6 2008,negative,garbage  an insult to the real thing
Aug 6 2008,negative,its pretty sad not that id waste a tear or a ticket price to ever see this again
Aug 5 2008,negative,because matthew broderick can stand on screen next to godzilla the most memorable thing about this film is the puff daddy song
Aug 5 2008,positive,picked up for â3 in tescos about right in my eyes     love the fact that other than the actual simpsons movie this has more simpsons voice actors in it than any other film
Aug 3 2008,negative,come on matthew broderick
Aug 3 2008,negative,wow i mean freaking wow  i dont even know where to start  roger ebert has become mayor of new york and siskel is his deputy and they are complete idiots  haha very mature  godzilla is able to hide in new york  let me say that again  godzilla a 200 foot tall lizard is able to hide from the military in new york  matthew broderick is the star in an action movie  the fact that they had the gall to put jean reno in this crapfest makes me want to kick dean devlin and roland emmerich in the nuts for the next 20 years straight
Aug 3 2008,positive,ive seen this movie so many times to me the entire thing was funny as hell
Aug 3 2008,negative,it was a major failure but fo a very simple reason godzilla needs another monster to fight

Jul 31 2008,positive,it has a great story
Jul 31 2008,negative,a movie like godzilla should be lots of fun its abouta freaking dinosaur destroying things where can you go wrong well to see how badly it can go wrong just watch this film which is not only boring but also tedious in its execution
Jul 31 2008,positive,not the best monster movie  but i like broderick and reno and that carries a movie a long way
Jul 30 2008,negative,perhaps the worst of all monster movies good only when godzilla destroys the city
Jul 30 2008,negative,if this was 40 years earlier and actually good it wouldve gotten 5 stars instead it gets
Jul 29 2008,positive,twisty and very interesting
Jul 29 2008,negative,the only ool thing about this movie was puff daddys rip off of kashmir and even that was pretty bad
Jul 29 2008,negative,waste of money  the only thing good about this movie was the soundtrack
Jul 29 2008,negative,ridiculous awful bad corny big budget movie turned garbage
Jul 29 2008,positive,i like this one alot how come they never made a sequel i hope there will be one in the future
Jul 29 2008,negative,im not impressed with this movie special effects are very good but i beileve this is not godzilla his skin is weaker and his breath sucks no regenerative abilaties i like the design the movie sucked not the creation
Jul 29 2008,neutral,poor was expecting more king kongs alot better
Jul 29 2008,positive,despite an awful screenplay awful acting awful directing and generally overall an awful two hours the character design action sequences and campy feel to the film is light enough for families to enjoy as a nobrainer popcorn flick  grade c  views 5
Jul 28 2008,negative,you know this movie is a failure when jean reno is infinitely cooler than that 30 story tall cgi piece of shit
Jul 28 2008,neutral,does not hold a candle to the original
Jul 28 2008,negative,fuck me sideways this crap that they call movie is a fucking stooopid piece of shit    i remember tat when i was a kid i used to like this movie but when i saw it now it was bull shit what was jean reno doing there cgi was bad and tell me what the cast of the simpsons is doing there
Jul 28 2008,negative,just go see cloverfield its way better
Jul 28 2008,positive,its okay but nothing more

Jul 27 2008,positive,really good monster film
Jul 27 2008,positive,fantasic enjoyable and totally underrated
Jul 26 2008,negative,ill watch it but alcohol is requisite
Jul 26 2008,positive,i really liked this movie but the director needs to do a remake of the movie so the graphics arent so cheesy
Jul 26 2008,positive,but where was godzuki
Jul 26 2008,negative,a blatant jurassic park ripoff
Jul 26 2008,neutral,im not sure why i like this movie
Jul 26 2008,neutral,im not sure why i like this movie
Jul 25 2008,neutral,saw it at bfest therefore i have fond memories of it
Jul 25 2008,positive,this movie is pathetic really utterly unequivocally lame  the cool part is i couldnt care less because recent hollywood monster epics have been waaay too pretentious for their own goodcloverfield anyone  godzilla on the other hand was intentionally lame  the whole thing works on sheer ferocity of cheese and yes i just said ferocity of cheese if you cant get past the campy effects the lousy script and the playful jabs at roger ebert one of my favorite movie critics then watch a seriousartsy movie  i still think this one is a keeper  stupid  well yeah but thats kinda the point
Jul 25 2008,negative,just godawful  loud dull and stupid  the only exciting bits were stolen from jurassic park  so bad that the man who wore the godzilla suit for toho walked out in the middle of the film
Jul 25 2008,negative,caught this again on tv late at night after 10 years  wow is this shitty  some awful dialogue even worse special effects and a mindbendingly ridiculous plot point every 6 minutes or so  talented cast but total crap
Jul 25 2008,negative,the original was much better special effects and high dollar actors are no substitute for originality and fun
Jul 24 2008,negative,godzillas not a chick
Jul 24 2008,negative,its actually very entertaining but i hate scifi creature crap
Jul 24 2008,positive,i thought it was good
Jul 24 2008,negative,i just saw a stranger on flickster claim this piece of shit as one of her alltime favorites is she fucking kidding me
Jul 24 2008,positive,too sad that they killed her
Jul 24 2008,negative,id walk out of this movie on a plane
Jul 23 2008,negative,when i saw this movie the filmstrip melted and was ruined just as the film reached the climax  this was the best part of the movie to me because it meant i got my money back for one of the worst pieces of junk i have ever seen
Jul 23 2008,positive,i turn to this movie every time i want to watch a classic
Jul 23 2008,negative,im a big fan of all of the old godzilla movies i grew up watching them but this one really stunk they did a good job in ruining it the creature didnt even look anything like the real godzilla
Jul 23 2008,positive,the movie was the first one i ever saw
Jul 23 2008,neutral,i did not like the main characters too cliche and typically cheesy funny how each missed missile has to necessarily hit a building and each missed torpedo has to uturn and hit our submarine special effects were nicely rendered but lack of artistic directions make them lose their reason of being in other words unappealing and useless you want to emphasize on the explosion fine but do it smartly
Jul 22 2008,neutral,i remember when i was younger i liked it back then now its fun but kinda lame a decent reimagining of the famous japanese with a few flaws 1 the movie focused too much on the special effects 2 the monster doesnt compete against the japanese counter part and 3 the story fell apart towards the end worth checking out but dont get your hopes up
Jul 22 2008,neutral,there are two reasons why this movie should exist 1 the taco bell commercials where the chiwawa declares hes going to need a bigger box  2 rage against the machines no shelter on the sound track where zach de la roche declares godzilla is nothin but pure mother fing filla to keep your eyes of the real killa genius  the movie its self was alright
Jul 22 2008,negative,i a die hard godzilla fan this waz hate love movie for me  1 this godzilla waz renamed zilla because toho was pissed that they didnt stay true to the real godzilla  2the cgi inthis film waz great  3acting waz good but could hav been better  4he didnt even hav atomic breath    5godzilla cant be killed by 2 rounds of f18 missles fires damnit
Jul 22 2008,negative,now i know why i waited this long to see this  boring slow and not a good monster movie  the actors were good but the execution of this film sucked
Jul 22 2008,negative,godzilla is supposed to be intimidating terrible casting all around this is a slap in the face to the japanese
Jul 21 2008,negative,cant compare to the old godzilla films
Jul 21 2008,negative,this movie was in a word crap but hey my 10 year old likes it
Jul 21 2008,positive,had the pen had the video had the roaring money box
Jul 21 2008,positive,my cousin actually fell asleep in this movienot sure how though
Jul 21 2008,neutral,godzilla could have been so great  unfortunately the thing i will always remember about this movie is the soundtrack which gave us one of the best rage against the machine songs ever  no shelter
Jul 20 2008,negative,roland emmerich and company squandered whatever good will theyd managed to generate with the wildly popular and wildly overrated independence day with this mindnumbing bit of monster movie detritus that dares to ask the question what if we made a godzilla movie and nobody came selfsatisfied where it should be reverent to its source material campy where it should be serious joylessly serious where it should be funny and ultimately stupid where it should demonstrate at least an ounce of cinematic cleverness this megabudgeted hollywood version of the classic citystomping monster series substitutes special effects in place of well everything else that should go into a moderately watchable flick a disappointing waste of a potentially enjoyable night out at the movies and a condescending slap in the face to fans of ishirô hondas original beloved gojira
Jul 20 2008,neutral,i did not like the main characters too cliche and typically cheesy funny how each missed missile has to necessarily hit a building and each missed torpedo has to uturn and hit our submarine special effects were nicely rendered but lack of artistic directions make them lose their reason of being in other words unappealing and useless you want to emphasize on the explosion fine but do it smartly
Jul 20 2008,negative,the biggest tragedy of this film is that matthew broderick was possibly the coolest character ever back in the 80s
Jul 20 2008,positive,yeah you read it right bitch
Jul 20 2008,positive,i enjoyed it  the monster was fun and the effects where descent  matthew broderick is very good while the humor added by hank azaria keeps the plot moving along without getting bogged down  jean reno is the scene stealer though  he is a great actor and as usual even his supporting role overshadows
Jul 20 2008,negative,heresy  hated it
Jul 20 2008,negative,thank you flixter for reminding this movie exists i spent years in therapy after seeing this film and i had finally blocked it out    did i mention how much i hate this movie cuz i do
Jul 19 2008,neutral,  not interested
Jul 19 2008,negative,horribly warped version of the toho classic monster
Jul 19 2008,positive,an action movie that really not that much of good action hero character is just alright the heroin is just not good seemed too cheeky or less serious in her acting the godzilla monster was not such a bad ass as i thought it would be seemed weak and less able to defend itself on the other hand it had reasonable efforts in computer graphics the monsters first appearance from the sea was acceptable the storyline and the humour were strong enough motivation for a replay a 3 out of 5
Jul 19 2008,neutral,jimmy page plus puff daddy i dont remember the movie but isnt this enough
Jul 18 2008,positive,okay people even though this wasnt the best it doesnt deserve to be panned i thought it was pretty good myself characters couldve been better and godzilla couldve done more destruction but its still pretty good give it a chance also the special fx were awesome
Jul 18 2008,negative,its bad worse then i remembered but i still enjoyed it
Jul 17 2008,negative,a bigbudget hollywood version of a popular movie monster with amazing special effects has to be great right  wrong  this movie makes you wish for a guy in a rubber dinosaur suit
Jul 17 2008,negative,matthew broderick  godzilla hunter worse then the la scene in jurassic park 2 go watch godzilla 2000 or gamera or anything from toho poor crap
Jul 17 2008,positive,wasnt bad it was interesting and the ending was unexpected
Jul 17 2008,negative,this one makes jurassic park look good
Jul 16 2008,negative,thanks for being inaccurate jackasses
Jul 16 2008,neutral,this was the remake and it sucked
Jul 14 2008,positive,soundtrack was better than the movie
Jul 14 2008,negative,not a godzilla movie a bad experiment in my opnion
Jul 14 2008,negative,stinks like ten tons of rotting fish  skip it instead see the 1954 original as it was shown in japan ie sans raymond burr thats a movie
Jul 14 2008,positive,the godzilla in this movie was amazing i enjoyed watchin this
Jul 13 2008,negative,the makers should die this wasnt godzilla
Jul 13 2008,positive,couldve been so much better
Jul 13 2008,positive,honestly the only real criticism any godzilla fan can have with this movie is that they totally redesigned the big green guy  personally i think godzilla needed to be made more realistic and wasnt upset by the design though they could have kept a few more similarities in the redesign  so i will concede to that point and perhaps the part with the godzilla babiesit felt a little like jurassic parkbut then again godzilla was eating people long before the trex in jurrasic park      that being said any godzilla fan complaining about the plot or acting or dialogue is completely fooling themselves about what godzilla actually is  because there is not a godzilla movie out there  that is not a grade b scifi flick that is suited to be mocked by mystery science theater 3000     as for me i enjoy it on a rainy day or a friday night with nothing better to do then put on an old fun popcorn flick like this or godzilla 1985
Jul 13 2008,positive,i loved this movie this isnt another tall dude in a green smelly suit romping through tokyo no this is ludicrouslyoversized trex destroying new york city from the inside it truly makes you feel small compared to this giant lizard
Jul 13 2008,neutral,i was expecting more out of this movie
Jul 12 2008,positive,saw this when i was a kid thought it wasnt that bad and it wasnt its just not good thats all now that i watched it again godzillas kinda gay
Jul 12 2008,negative,i was never too sure if they were trying to make it come of kinda cheesy or what
Jul 11 2008,positive,not as bad as people make out
Jul 11 2008,negative,theres something to be said about an actor in a suit that works better than the cgi of this film  it is obvious that the producers of this movie dont get it  cloverfield did  see cloverfield before you see this turkey
Jul 11 2008,positive,i wont lie i enjoyed this movie
Jul 11 2008,negative,this was not good but seriously whats the big deal there are far worse bigbudget movies out there
Jul 11 2008,positive,its more fun to make fun of the movie
Jul 11 2008,neutral,dnt rember how good it was
Jul 11 2008,positive,not cool to like it and its not a proper zilla movie but i still love it
Jul 10 2008,negative,the original japanese godzilla is waaay better
Jul 10 2008,positive,was wicked when i first saw it and watching it now im more like huhlol still a good watch though

Jul 9 2008,positive,its so so but wasnt exactly how i expected it to be the new look is fine but the story could have been better
Jul 9 2008,negative,its not that bad its just badly acted has poor special effects a lame love story annoying characters and an idiotic plot okay so it is that bad
Jul 8 2008,positive,could have been better
Jul 8 2008,positive,my favorite movie of all times just as well as the old tv shows
Jul 8 2008,negative,what  what the hell was that  wheres godzilla  i just saw some scrawnyass iguana running around    im giving it half a star for a couple of funny lines hank azaria delivered  besides that this was insulting  boycotting devlin  emrich    thanks for ruining my childhood
Jul 7 2008,negative,i never thought id see a monster movie that cribbed the 70s king kong for inspiration
Jul 7 2008,positive,favorite movie when i was 5
Jul 7 2008,positive,big lizards and explosions this pretty much sums me up
Jul 7 2008,positive,no where near as good as any of the real godzilla movies i blame horrible directing but still i for some reason cant hate gian monsters destroying a city best part about this movie is seeing the american godzilla zilla fight the real godzilla in godzilla final wars
Jul 6 2008,positive,the lead actress is a terrible actress  hank azaria makes the movie
Jul 6 2008,negative,roland emmerich should not be allowed to direct this kind of movie ever again godzilla is not a lizard make giant sized broderick is not a hapless clone of the guy from jurassic park the pregnancy test was laughable godzilla is not a female and it didnt lay eggs this is just the single worst movie of 1998 maybe of the 90s the fx cant even save it
Jul 6 2008,negative,proves you cant beat a little japanese guy in a rubber suit
Jul 6 2008,positive,my guilty pleasure movie great fx and nyc gets its ass handed to it on a plate
Jul 6 2008,negative,it was ok but could been lot better
Jul 6 2008,positive,haha matthew broderick
Jul 6 2008,negative,the problem with the film isnt that it fails i mean any film can do that the problem is that it fails on almost ever level i mean come on the cgi is terrible the dialogue is awful acting is garbage the direction is muggy  the music is ok a best
Jul 5 2008,positive,i watched it a million times3
Jul 5 2008,positive,not too bad of a movieand i love matthew broderick
Jul 4 2008,negative,godzilla should never be made in american studios they always mess it up
Jul 4 2008,negative,this is not godzilla  they should of just called this movie iguanadon or super iquana  first of all  godzilla was a trex surviving on the island  saipani think and was mutated by an atomic war between the us and japan  second  godzilla never   ever  ever ever ever reproduces asexually  third  godzilla dosnt eat fish he gets his fix from nuclear energy from nuclear plants  fourth  godzilla can breath radio active fire and he just dosnt reproduce asexually   you know what america bitches just leave some things for japan because they know how its done
Jul 4 2008,negative,would have been much better with anyone but matthew broderick
Jul 4 2008,negative,as a fan of the orginal japanese godzilla tristar version sucked big time it was an insult to all godzilla fans everywhere
Jul 4 2008,neutral,not perfect by any means but more fun than people give it credit for
Jul 3 2008,negative,a piece of shit that proves that director emmerich has no talent of anykind and should stop making these overbudgeted movies come on first stargate then independence day and now this stop him please
Jul 3 2008,positive,this movie had awesome special effects looked great visually was paced well and the creature featured in this film is still one of the best looking cgi creatures brought to life on screen of all time     on the other hand ill have to admit that their isnt anything impressive about this films storyline aside from that the cast werent exactly great either
Jul 3 2008,positive,i always think this a perfect boyfriend loud strong disrupitve and looks after the kids lol
Jul 3 2008,neutral,too bad there are real godzilla movies

Jul 2 2008,positive,my favorite monster flick p
Jul 1 2008,positive,what can i say some of the actors kinda sucked and the characters pissed me off but other then that i enjoyed the movie i felt bad for the poor monster at the end all it was doing was trying to live its not its fault that a city was in its way  graphics were pretty cool but they should have just made it a regular old monster movie and had more explosions and stomping and screaming and fire instead of a loooooove story between two annoying people who you wanted to see get eaten by baby godzillas
Jul 1 2008,positive,no its not the real godzilla but for what it is this movie is still fun
Jul 1 2008,positive,not the best of movies but hey how could you go rong with godzilla
Jun 30 2008,neutral,when this first came out i was pissed cause they redesigned godzilla the movies still fun though featuring jean reno as the ultimate french badass
Jun 30 2008,neutral,would have been better if they had dropped the godzilla connection and just made it a good ole monster loose in ny story   silly fun nice to see a giant lizard stomp a city other than tokyo for a change only for the true b monster movie fan
Jun 29 2008,negative,what happend here total misfire
Jun 29 2008,positive,this movie is special to me becuase not only was in the first pg 13 movie i saw but when i was little i used to love godzilla
Jun 29 2008,positive,some of the worst acting i have ever seenalso some of the worst dialogue ever  but godzilla himherself is every bit worht seeing this movie for

Jun 13 2008,negative,damn you matthew broderick the only one who gets out of this mess intact is jean reno
Jun 13 2008,negative,this must have been one of the first american remakes of asian classics i love the japanese original in black and white so even as a teenager when i first saw this one at the cinema i couldnt get over the fact that they had ripped off a good original story set it in the us slapped some big digital effects and  famous actors in it and had a box office hit yes it looks impressive and i love jean reno in any part still it can only ever live as the hyped up bastard child of the original im a bit ashamed that the one who orchestrated this is my countryman it get 15 purely for effects and mr renos effort

Jun 10 2008,neutral,i saw this on my birthday i think i was in grade 6 lol good times
Jun 10 2008,negative,hes not some monster trying to evade you hes just an animal    more than 40 years and twodozen movies after first raising his mammoth head in the japanese monster flick gojira godzilla is back courtesy of the directorproducer team of roland emmerich and dean devlin by 1998 this particular twosome had firmly established themselves as purveyors of bigbudget hollywood blockbusters with stargate and independence day having previously blown out theatre speakers thus this late90s reinterpretation of the normally dumpy rubbery monster is a loud fxridden hollywood summer flick created with the braindead in mind its also a textbook example of a failure  it underperformed at the box office although it allegedly made back its production cost the planned sequels never materialised and it was disowned by toho pictures the company responsible for the original godzilla productions who actively excised this version from the canon    the plot such as it is concerns biologist dr niko tatopoulos broderick not long into the film niko is recalled from chernobyl by the us army to study large footprints left on tropical islands meanwhile accounts begin to materialise which claim that a large creature known as godzilla has been capsizing ocean vessels around the world before anything can be put into conjecture godzilla  a storiestall creature which bears the appearance of a dinosaur  emerges from the waters off new york city and begins wreaking havoc within the big apple with the city under threat of annihilation niko is hired to work in conjunction with the military to stop godzilla as fate would have it nikos former flame audrey pitillo  now a reporter looking for her big break  rekindles her relationship with him    at first the monster is not seen at all  its an unseen but clearly gigantic menace à la jaws with radars blipping ships being destroyed an attack survivor uttering the word gojira and giant footprints being discovered the sense of foreboding is enormous unfortunately this style lasts all of 20 minutes after which the style shifts from jaws to jurassic park as godzilla proceeds to rip up the city from there the film was designed to be twisty and turny with new obstacles provided every 10 minutes or so problem is it all feels tacked on by the end of this unforgivably lengthy 130minute film one doesnt view the twists as surprises  instead they simply trigger a groan and an uh oh here they go again reaction in particular theres a subplot involving godzilla being pregnant that adds an unnecessary halfhour this leads to an extended sequence involving baby zillas which look and act like the velociraptors in jurassic park the mini zillas even hunt down the movies heroes from one room to anotherjust like jurassic park however the difference is that jurassic park was suspenseful and nailbiting whereas godzilla is bland and merely interested in money shots rather than suspense    theres a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching godzilla as he rips his way through new york city but the novelty wears off quickly and frankly while the digital effects are competent they are not genuinely stunning and fail to hold up all these years later at times the giant lizard looks convincing while at other times it looks hokey and embarrassingly computergenerated more importantly the size is inconsistent it grows and shrinks at the plots convenience and the creature lacks weight each time a closeup observes godzillas foot as it hits the ground it never looks quite right and of course what summer blockbuster would be complete without plot holes and illogicalities in this case a monster thats as tall as a skyscraper is able to fit through subway tunnels and niko is able to purchase home pregnancy tests in the middle of the night from a pharmacy still operating in an evacuated city furthermore the splitsecond timing typically associated with hollywood movies is a frequent bother for instance the protagonists find the nest of baby zillas just as theyre hatching godzilla arrives on the scene at the most convenient time and so on    in the original japanese godzilla films the monster usually had a clear agenda in this american appropriation godzilla is a mindless brute a lizard that wants to eat and reproduce which was mutated into gigantism during a nuclear test the creatures destruction isnt intentional  its just the result of a big dinosaurlike monster being loose in a world designed for humans thus this is literally a film about a bull in a china shop adding insult to injury a few lame attempts at humour are thrown in theres an ongoing gag regarding the fact that noone can pronounce nikos last name correctly and even an attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel of course the reason for this attack is because ebert  siskel panned emmerich  devlins prior movies but the characters serve no purpose in the story other than to add further padding and as the critics themselves noted the revenge part was handled poorly are these characters torn to shreds and eaten by the monster nope they just bicker what terrific revenge tactics    ultimately godzilla is pretty much criticproof it has its niche audience and said audience will probably enjoy it it was my favourite movie when i was 8 years old after all its a widelyshared viewpoint that critics are boring and are not able to enjoy blockbusters but look even brainless popcorn flicks can be appreciated as long as theyre entertaining godzilla on the other hand is a lumbering meandering beast of a blockbuster that drags on and on for 130 long minutes certainly the film has its strong points the creature design is nifty and at times it succeeds on a basic popcorn movie level but for the most part its slapdash and cheesy this is a film which lives and dies by its special effects after all and if these special effects are distinctly unremarkabletheres a big problem
Jun 9 2008,neutral,doesnt it needs a mate  no if it reproduces asexually  mmm and whats the fun at that jajaja
Jun 9 2008,negative,the animated series trumps this five times over

Jun 7 2008,positive,this is ok if you dont like the older godzila movies but its hard to beat the classics
Jun 6 2008,neutral,disappointing remake of the classic japanese film and its subsequent sequels which were all very corny unfortunately this remake is a doozy with poor logic and characters to go along with its smashing visual effects

Jun 3 2008,positive,when are they going to make another with the same people
Jun 3 2008,positive,not 1 of my fav godzilla films but still very entertaining to watch
Jun 3 2008,positive,i was reluctant to see this one  movies with dinosaurs or big lizards arent really my thing  but it was actually pretty entertaining
Jun 3 2008,positive,not the old godzilla with the dude in the suit destrying the little model sey that was good this ok
Jun 2 2008,negative,they swapped looking terrifying for trying to look badass and the little godzillas left little to the imagination and felt like an excuse for filling the last 30 minutes rather then trying to do different things with  the monster matt sucked in the leading role the rest of the cast was meh at best and the action now feels outdated and kinda lame easily one of the biggest letdowns in blockbuster history for me
Jun 2 2008,negative,why did they make this movie why
Jun 2 2008,positive,i loved the chaos in the cityno it was not like jurassic park when i saw it at that time in the movies

May 28 2008,negative,terrible  absolutely awful  how can you screw up a giant lizard tearing down a city they found a way
May 28 2008,negative,hmmm very dodgy us update of the classic tokyo destroying lizard its a rip of so many ideas and the little baby zillas make it even worse almost jurassic parkish crossed with aliens the look is good the effects being quite decent for the time its all cgi of course but because its dark allot it does look quite atmospheric     the best part of the film easily is the choppers attacking zilla and being chomped down one at a time the cast is pretty lame though broderick isnt fit to be in anything frankly and azaria should stick to tv comedies reno is the best actor on show here basically the film looks good and thats it the rest is a bit embarassing really    love how the old japanese man on the dock at the start sees something happening in the sea before him and cries godzilla even before hes seen anything haha why would it have a name in the first place insane lol
May 28 2008,positive,ima star wars fan
May 28 2008,positive,a great american version of the low budget graphic japanesse version

May 25 2008,negative,wow what an epic an epic failure seriously how can they fuck up godzilla the cast completely sucked but what can you expect when matthew broderick maria pitillo and hank azaria are the main stars jean reno was the only joy from this and thats because hes better then shit aka broderick pitillo azaria and his english sucks roland emmerich sucks as a director and a screenplay writer and this movie proves it the only thing that emmerich did with the story that was even close being clever was ripingoff ebert  siskel but it backfired and emmerich just looked like a dumbass that he really is
May 25 2008,positive,this was good just completely different than the godzilla the japanese had created the story differs too much from the originals the americans are always trying to take over stuff
May 25 2008,negative,except a couple of funny dialogues its a shame
May 25 2008,negative,horrible lost the spirit of the godzilla franchise
May 25 2008,neutral,although the special effects are very reasonable the portrayal of the armed forces has an almost slapstick quality to it diminishing from the quality of the movie i was left disappointed

May 25 2008,positive,pretty good for a remake
May 24 2008,negative,another giant creature movie you are kidding me right from jaws king kong jurassic park and those forgettable ones with giant snakes or crocodiles they all end up on the same rail line talk about an unoriginal approach to movie making however godzilla makes an alright watch once or twice but it wears thin seemingly quickly
May 24 2008,negative,what a crappy remake
May 24 2008,negative,jamiroquai saoundtrack and the fact that andys chair broke and he sat there all through the film alone scores 5 points

May 18 2008,positive,uber cool but very dark as in not well lit treatment of the japanese monster azaria is great and broderick oddly carries the film but it is the monster that is the star fave momentat one point it feels like its ending but then mommazilla rises up from the rubble that used to be madison square gardens very cool

May 7 2008,negative,an insult to the real godzilla and fans like me roland emmerich is a hack
May 6 2008,positive,a decent monster on the loose movie but godzillas name shouldve been kept off of this  it is not representative of gojiras excellent screen work
May 6 2008,negative,the whole point of godzilla is a guy in a rubber suit  how do you screw that up
May 6 2008,negative,if the monster didnt keep changing size id have given this a whole nother star
May 6 2008,positive,this is like wooooaaahhh awsome but i also like the original japanese films which r like fantastic

May 2 2008,negative,a monster who comes to new york city and doesnt crush a camera man
May 1 2008,positive,i really enjoyed this one as a kid
May 1 2008,negative,ha this was atrocious the siskel  ebert bit alone set cinema back a good thirty years and how about that desperately impoverished mans sarah jessica parker as the main love interest she was completely unwatchable
Apr 30 2008,neutral,high five this movie is so funny
Apr 30 2008,positive,its very long  its very loud
Apr 30 2008,negative,what wasted potential  they should have made the movie more like the japanese original with godzilla being a badass who goes around destroying stuff and with strong antiwar undertones  now i doubt i will ever see a true blockbuster realization of the awesomness of godzilla
Apr 30 2008,positive,i love it but nothing like the original and not all that well put together
Apr 30 2008,negative,man this one was a turd
Apr 30 2008,positive,i actually enjoyed the more then i thought i would

Apr 25 2008,positive,you know ive seen a lot worseat least you saw the monster in this one
Apr 24 2008,positive,um  anyone have a problem with godzilla laying eggs while everyone refers to the monster as he  sense is not allowed to stand in the way of spectacle here  a thrill ride that requires you to leave your brain at the door
Apr 24 2008,negative,sad attempt to rip off the japs
Apr 24 2008,positive,  not rated yet
Apr 24 2008,positive,better then cloverfeild

Apr 23 2008,positive,so who doesnt love anything godzilla very cool
Apr 23 2008,positive,i saw this at the cinema and it was pretty good up on the big screen it was just a bit too americanised for my liking with the bumbling and the highoctane explosions all over the place
Apr 23 2008,neutral,there are worse movies with the word godzilla in the title  were it to lack jean reno it would definitely loose a star
Apr 23 2008,negative,such a good cast for such a turkey is depressing roland emmerich should be shot for this
Apr 23 2008,positive,i actually like this movie
Apr 23 2008,negative,horrible take on a classic monster movie it was a nice attempt but it will never top the originals quality and come on do we really need puff daddy to do a song about it i would have rather heard bocs godzilla instead of p diddy slaughtering a classic led zeppelin tune
Apr 22 2008,positive,honestly this is one of my favorite childhood movies so i am a bit biased but godzilla is pathetic in comparison to what he should be and maria pitillos character pissed me off way too much
Apr 22 2008,positive,can i like this one  its fun and exciting  sure the story is about as deep as a plastic pool and the script is the length of a butter label but hey that isnt what i came for  this one delivers on its premise
Apr 21 2008,positive,awesome movie an old classic
Apr 21 2008,negative,dad and bry wanted to see this in the summer of 98 i wanted to see lost in space losers

Apr 20 2008,negative,oh god was this ever stupid
Apr 20 2008,positive,not quite the type of movie that it shouldve been hank azaria and harry shearer were awesome though
Apr 20 2008,negative,i like it when it becomes a total ripoff of jurassic park at the end  baby raptor godzillas are a disgrace to humanity  or something  i do like how half the voice cast for the simpsons is in this and how the mayor and his assistant are named and look like siskel and ebert  probrably because they knew they were going to get panned and rightly so
Apr 19 2008,positive,deserved a better reception at the box office
Apr 19 2008,negative,another movie from disaster movie duo roland emmerich and dean devlin so matthew broderick plays the socially awkward guy who wears glasses as he is called to stop a giant lizard who they call godzilla since the real godzilla downright refused to be in this movie they have 2 characters that are supposed to make fun of siskel and ebert for not giving their movies positive reviews but dont truly take advantage by having the lizard killing them what was even funny was even roger ebert and gene siskel made fun of this in the movie review for godzilla
Apr 19 2008,negative,how could they mess up a thing like godzilla how do you make something like that boring and unimpressive this is how
Apr 19 2008,negative,in the brief span of time between seeing this in the theater and getting it on video i realized i never wanted to see this movie again

Apr 17 2008,positive,moderately entertaining scifi action movie unrealistic in parts
Apr 17 2008,positive,who doesnt like godzilla i thught it was great and id wach it over and over if i could
Apr 16 2008,positive,watch for funnies bit in the movie the helicopter attack scene the one where the pilots think two dimensionally and the big dumb lizard thinks in three
Apr 16 2008,positive,interesting take on it but i still have to cheer on the big lizard just as in the past
Apr 16 2008,negative,so dissapointed with this godzilla should be a raw elemental unstopable force not a giant hermaphrodite iguana that eats fish and could be taken down with a couple of shots
Apr 16 2008,negative,the originals were much better  cheesier but still better
Apr 15 2008,positive,hey they did the best they could
Apr 15 2008,neutral,cheesy but fun with a wonderfully wicked soundtrack
Apr 15 2008,positive,this was the formula less plot more monster it worked

Apr 14 2008,positive,i want one hes such a cutie
Apr 14 2008,neutral,the japanese godzilla was better
Apr 14 2008,negative,all i can honestly remember is the camera guy getting crushed not a good sign
Apr 14 2008,neutral,i thought this was alright jeno reno adds a bit of class
Apr 14 2008,positive,not as bad as everyone made out not great though
Apr 14 2008,negative,unforgivably awful  i kept hoping that dumb lizard would just die so that i could carry on with my life  im no cinema snob but humanstupidity is a stupid plot device  and if you invent pseudoscience at least apply it consistently withn the universe of your own film
Apr 13 2008,negative,a waste of computer animation
Apr 13 2008,positive,some fun moments  hank azaria is funny
Apr 13 2008,positive,good soundtrack new take on a classic

Apr 12 2008,positive,for all you old school godzilla fans that didnt like this movie because it wasnt the godzilla you were use to get over yourselves this is a modern version for the next generation dont compare it to the original its not the original for a giant monster movie attacking the city this one did okay i had fun watching it

Apr 11 2008,negative,american movie makers need to stay the hell away from japanese films if anyone ever sees one of the jackasses that allowed this movie to be made piss in their eye
Apr 11 2008,positive,i love this movie i think this american version of the lizard is so much cooler and believeable than the japanese version

Apr 8 2008,positive,i like it by golly
Apr 8 2008,negative,i agree with japan  this movie has brought great dishonor upon godzilla  ps i hate matthew broderick  being whimsical and quirky in every single movie youre in does not count as acting
Apr 8 2008,positive,matthew broderick was great in his usually quirky way and with godzilla what more could you ask for
Apr 8 2008,negative,ferris buellercould of found a better actor
Apr 8 2008,negative,why didnt broderick die in this film god i hate him not bad but not good

Apr 5 2008,positive,really good movie matthew broderick is amazing
Apr 5 2008,positive,godzilla i want more like back in the day
Apr 4 2008,neutral,im confused the end makes me think that there is gonna b a sequel is it true
Apr 4 2008,negative,they destroyed the whole thing
Apr 4 2008,negative,matthew broderick as an action hero
Apr 3 2008,neutral,the part of the movie when the asian guy is like gogeela googeela is the funniest thing ive ever seen
Apr 3 2008,negative,not bad for an american remake
Apr 2 2008,negative,leave godzilla to the japanese
Apr 2 2008,negative,this is where matthew brodericks career reached such a low that he fell in love with sarach j parker

Apr 1 2008,positive,i liked this movie they did make changes of course to godzilla it does not look anything like the original but then again it looks way better  the effects were great and there were lots of funny parts in the movie  all i can say is i enjoyed it enough to buy it
Mar 31 2008,negative,can you say crap they took a classic which had its time and place and pimped it out for a summer block busterwhich flopped rightfully so
Mar 31 2008,positive,no its nowhere near as good as the originals but its still good
Mar 31 2008,positive,i just wanted to see how ferris would have gotten himself outta this one cant dance in the parade now can ya
Mar 31 2008,negative,chaotic thats all i could say and the godzilla can go invisible
Mar 31 2008,positive,i like all the movies of this sort
Mar 31 2008,neutral,at the end i cared more about what happened to the monster then what happend to the actors
Mar 30 2008,positive,godzilla is awesome such a classic
Mar 29 2008,neutral,after taking a hiatus in his hometown of japan godzillas rights are sold to american so that the nuclear breath monster can be given an americanized upgrade in the great western world to top things off the creative reigns were handed over to none other than roland emmerich the godfather of big budget blockbuster brainless action films after giving the world the wet fart known as id4 emmerich brought us the new story of godzilla a mutated iguana that rose out of the ashes of nuclear bombed french polynesian islands who makes his way to good ole new york city leaving behind a large trail of damage and wreckage hot on his trail are the military and hired scientists which include lead guy matthew broderick with broderick sometimes nerdy can be fun in a lead role especially in japanese godzilla films but it does not work here also in the mix is maria pitillo bringing zero charm and personality to her role as brodericks ex girlfriend whose trying to make it as a reporter hank azaria whose slightly fun as a news cameraman and jean reno the only human i enjoyed in this film as a french spy trying to dispose of godzilla himself as for godzilla himself this new look is a complete embarrassment they kept it a big secret all the way up to the films premier an effective move back then in the days of slow internet and a lack of faggot piraters but truth be told they could have been keeping him secret because of how awful he looks even the japanese hated it and even brought it back in a future godzilla movie to have its butt kicked by the real godzilla overall this isnt a terrible film but its certainly not a good one in the end im much happier with my original japanese gojira films and not this silly mindless entertainment for mindless viewers drivel
Mar 29 2008,negative,why remake a classic
Mar 29 2008,positive,like it chinese people are fun
Mar 28 2008,negative,i want my rubber suit guy  when i first saw what the monster looked like i laughed hysterically
Mar 28 2008,negative,fuck off gojira has been ruined again
Mar 27 2008,negative,jean reno kicks ass in everything    this sucks
Mar 27 2008,positive,really nice  i dont like the girl tho  but i like the storyline and the godzilla great effect and yeah i just like it
Mar 27 2008,positive,i liked it i first saw it when i was 4 and cryed when godzilla died
Mar 27 2008,negative,i hope to god that godzilla never attacks america because it would mean i would hafta sit through another terrible viewing of it    whose i dea was it to pair up ferris bueller and the professional together a match made in acting purgatory
Mar 27 2008,negative,an embarassingly bad remake misfire that fell entirely onto the shoulders of the films uninterested director and egotistical producer who decided incorrectly that reinventing the wheel would go well against an established fanbase  in short this movie not only fails to capture the essence spirit fun and dark heart of the japanese godzilla films but its also just a plain terrible film with loser characters unscary monster and dodgy special effects at best  hailed by the industry as a blunder that was heard around the world
Mar 25 2008,negative,leave giant monsters to japan
Mar 25 2008,positive,i actually enjoyed this movie  its not great but it works
Mar 25 2008,negative,no no no no no no  american version of godzilla  bad  hes all square and a mommy and stuff  i mean wtf mate     not recommended  if you want godzilla get the japanese stuff
Mar 24 2008,negative,i was totally disappointed lame velocoraptor godzilla babies
Mar 24 2008,negative,this movies existence and plot are such a tragic travisty i happen to be a huge fan of the japanese godzillagojira films because of the ridiculous special effects lots of monster fighting and godzillas indestructableness they werent excellent pieces of art except the original godzilla film gojira sometimes they were downright silly but godzilla had character and was fun to watch however this movie this crappy american adaptation is nothing but your runofthemill monster flick with godzilla slapped on as the title to draw people in the monster itself is unimpressive yes good cgi and more realistic portrayal but the creature was weak pregnant wtf and did not possess and air of power and fierceness the story was so dumb and full of cheesy dialogue it makes classic godzilla movies like godzilla vs the sea monster look like oscar winners the casting was also terrible no one was right for their role and their acting therefore was stiff the poor attempt at showing pitty for the monster at the end was more hollywoodtype crap awwpoor big iguana died yawnis this old yeller or something
Mar 24 2008,positive,i remember seeing this when i was like 8 from what i remember it wsnt terible but it got really boring
Mar 24 2008,positive,its great movieexcitingamazing
Mar 23 2008,positive,amazing movie  one of my all time favorites
Mar 23 2008,negative,if you can make yourself understand you are not actually watching godzilla it is okay i liked the cgi godzilla quite a bit but the humor and having him give birth at the end just destroyed it use the same cgi and make a real godzilla movie now please
Mar 22 2008,negative,this was a cool theatre experience but its definitely lacking  the cg is really pretty good  the score sucks
Mar 22 2008,negative,terriblely weak bad acting dumb jokes a shitty story explanation ya the monster just vanishes in new york city and lays an ass load of raptor eggs stupid not only is the monster smaller then the original its incredibley weaker as well being taken down by aircraft missles
Mar 21 2008,positive,i was sad by the death of the monster in the ending poor little thing
Mar 21 2008,neutral,that old bum sure knows how to catch a fish
Mar 21 2008,positive,cool but kind of weird

Mar 21 2008,positive,awwi watched this movie wen i was like 6loved it thenand willin to watch it again naw
Mar 20 2008,negative,meh they kind of screwed up godzilla wait no they did screw up godzilla jean reno helps save the day and wtf is up with the baby zillas trying to capitalize on jurassic park much
Mar 20 2008,negative,they need to remake it cause it looks really crappy now
Mar 20 2008,positive,i saw it but i wouldnt watch it like that
Mar 20 2008,negative,why would you cast matthew broderick in this movie  nothing says summer blockbuster less than matthew broderick
Mar 19 2008,positive,i still love this movie
Mar 19 2008,negative,okay i thought the original godzilla movies were much better than this adaptation
Mar 19 2008,neutral,if it werent named godzilla it would be good
Mar 19 2008,positive,great movie lots of action and suspense
Mar 18 2008,positive,i know i shouldnt but i love this movie
Mar 18 2008,positive,cool but a disgrace to the japanese godzilla movies at least final wars made use of the nowdubbed zilla
Mar 18 2008,positive,better in my opinion than most think
Mar 18 2008,negative,want to see a good version of godzilla which isnt named godzilla check out cloverfield
Mar 18 2008,negative,the only thing somewhat good about this movie was the soundtrack
Mar 18 2008,negative,the only thing good about this is the frenchman and he barely can cover for the awfulness of everything  blah
Mar 17 2008,negative,incredibly dumb and ridiculous the attempted human emotion is done horribly some solid special effects for the time and provides some moments of idiotic entertainment
Mar 17 2008,positive,i was surprised i enjoyed this  but i did
Mar 17 2008,negative,when did godzilla become jurassic park oh thats right when it rips off the raptor concept
Mar 17 2008,neutral,based on assessing it on its own merits and not thinking about the legacy it passed the time entertainingly enough
Mar 16 2008,negative,i was asking questions the whole time  lol  did anyone notice how godzilla changed shape and size lol
Mar 16 2008,positive,special effects are not bad for a 90s film
Mar 16 2008,negative,the soundtrack is good
Mar 16 2008,positive,teehee this is a fun film godzilla is cool  but even if you dont watch the film you really should buy the soundtrack cos its pretty good
Mar 16 2008,negative,ah yes the american godzilla this movie was truly shite  it completely missed the point of the original godzilla  the special affects are obviously way better than any japanese godzilla movie but the monster here is simply a rampaging animal  no characterisation whatsover  bad
Mar 16 2008,negative,ugh  i wanted to love this movie  i wanted it to kickstart the franchise again  it just took itself far to seriously and moved too far from its source material  audiences loved the original godzilla because it was campy  play on that dont screw with sucess
Mar 16 2008,neutral,img  1998 139mins pg  director roland emmerich  cast includes matthew broderick maria pitallo jean reno hank azaria kevin dunn harry shearer michael lerner     ifrom the director of independence day irang much of godzillas promo material but is that a blessing or a curse iindependence day imade plenty of cash but on the whole its hardly a super film indeed there are those believe it or not who see it as a cgi riddled cornball in my opinion igodzilla iis a more rounded effort from director roland emmerich and scripter dean devlin its situation is a little funner for sure but theres still no denying that its strewn with narritive and thesping issues  img  the film opens with scenes of nuclear testing and various lizards on the island where its taking place i have to admit to liking the opening scene and the scratchy yellow way that emmerich presents it some is evidently real life footage other possibly stock but emmerich conjoins it up in a visually stimulating manner sadly thats not a recurrent theme throughout the picture  so fast foward so many years and we are introduced to nick matthew broderick a nuclear scientist who seems to have an affinity for radioactive wormshowever events in asia involving capsized fishing trawlers and one mammoth of a foot print lead the government to recruiting nick as to what the hell might be going on it quickly becomes apparent theres a giant monster on the loose and hes arrived in manhatten after the initial destruction the beast goes into hiding but nick is beggining to believe theres a reason this creature has arrived in new yorkone that could spell the end for humanity  the biggest problems with igodzilla iare its stilted performances and weak screenplay matthew broderick is a poor lead he can be good as displayed only a year after in ielection ibut when hes bad boy can the man be a poor actor the entire film is anchored around the character of nick so the fact hes so 2d and poorly written really isnt a good start we are also offered up a romantic interest in the form of audrey maria pitallo but sadly that is equally as weak in its creation pitallo was cast here but i havent seen her again in the 10 years since the fact her emoting ability is so crap here probably had something to do with it the reast of the characters are largely walking and uninteresting cliches jean reno and hank azaria inject enough energy into their roles to almost make them work but sadly ive seen these characters one to many times and in several better movies  devlins scripting is obviously weak at the worst of times though his work was little better on iindependence day ii see where the man is coming from when you listen to him in interviews and his heart always seems in the right place but hes just not a particularly good writer one wonders that the reason he shadowed emmerich so closely for the first few years of his career wasns simply due to the fact the germans visual bangs and action sequences didnt sort of cover his weak dialougue sad but when you think about it it sort of makes sense  img  at least emmerich does deliver on the wizzs and pops however igodzilla iis primed with several fun and totally outrageous action moments simply watching the animal run rampant is a hoot and a half but emmerich keeps the action original he moves from locale to locale the giant animal battling in land sewer and water the film also cooks up a very exciting finale a genuinely great car chase followed by a memorable sequence on the brooklyn bridge this follows another enjoyably daft scene set in madison square gardens and so it is obvious that as a film igodzilla icertainly still has its advantages and at the best of times succeeds quite wonderfully as a summer event movie its just that those moments are bogged down in poor acting and an overlong production the movie runs to nearly 140 minutes at least 25 minutes to long  the visual effects are pretty impressive and whilst in the minority i thought the creature design quite cool hes almost like a bipedial iquana crossed with a velociraptor hes got the bulk and strength but the animal can certainly move fast when it needs to on a few occasions the beast looks a little to digital and pixilated but overall the animal is an impressive bit of cgi work the destruction and action sequences are also well rendered especially the big bombs finale  so really igodzilla iis the perfect 510 movie basically because it only half succeeds it is thrilling exciting and expensive looking but by turns it also manages sections of pure bordom and as a rule is overlong and poorly written and acted my final thoughts would be to comment that its better than youve likely heard but still be cautiousis a patchy and largely mediocre event movie going to be worth 140 minutes of your time ponder with care  img
Mar 16 2008,negative,okyou make one of the best scifi movies of the ninetiesindependence day that is one of the biggest films ever madeyou basically can do whatever you want in hollywood rightso what do you doat the height of your career when people are throwing big projects at youyou make this mind numbing piece of shit that plays like a shitty jurassic park knock off set in new york city that is totally reduntant and has no sense of styleflair or personality whatsoever and that also has a lousy scriptabsolute rubbishthis represents the worst of hollywood
Mar 15 2008,negative,if you liked this filmyour mother
Mar 15 2008,negative,the only things i liked about this film was the soundtracks and the effects other than that a bit of a bore

Mar 13 2008,neutral,quite amusing to watch it qualifies as passable i suppose
Mar 13 2008,negative,to the star of tideland  an 8 year old girl  derivativedo you know this word no why not welluh derivative its like roland emmerich he made godzilla and the day after tomorrow  he is derivative because all his shots derive from steven spielberg he doesnt make original films so makes movies that look like someone elses
Mar 13 2008,negative,running would be a good idea
Mar 13 2008,positive,kinda lame and the idea of blowing up madison square garden is hurtful
Mar 13 2008,negative,waste of money i prefer the japanese version
Mar 13 2008,negative,there was one great moment in that film when the car tire was rolling through on the screen 
Mar 12 2008,neutral,eh it was alright baby godzillas weak twist much
Mar 12 2008,positive,i love godzilla thats it
Mar 12 2008,negative,really really bad
Mar 11 2008,neutral,too bad they didnt give the beast some powers
Mar 11 2008,negative,a monumentally stupid film

Mar 8 2008,negative,man who woulda thought that the lame suit ones woulda been sooo much better way too long in the making for such a red ass in the endthink people think
Mar 8 2008,positive,quite entertaining without having any substance to it the effects are excellent and the chases are well done however i just cant get my head round how a 100ft lizard can outrun about 20 army helicopters at full pelt yet even after 20 minutes of pursuit it still cant catch a battered new york yellow cab that probably never gets much above 40 mph based on the number of corners it takeslol
Mar 8 2008,negative,all i remember is that i fell asleep in the theater
Mar 8 2008,negative,theres just no excuse for this
Mar 8 2008,neutral,fun little monster movie i actually saw it more than once at home dont feel likt doing anything and nothing to see on tv but yeah godzilla
Mar 7 2008,negative,what really bothered me with this film was the fact that emmerich tried to insert pieces of comedy and romance in his disastermonster movie and failed at both attempts  the actors are perfectly miscast and delivers cliches portrayal of their characters the french guy the arrogant mayor the annoying girlfriend the plot is well who needs a plot for a disaster movie anyway  unfortunately the effects havent withstood the test of time so we are left with pretty much nothing but an unnecessary and childish remake of a japanese classic do not waste your time  if you wanna see a disastermonster movie also set in nyc go and see cloverfield instead 
Mar 7 2008,positive,didnt care for this
Mar 6 2008,negative,why on earth did they set it in new york  not everything revolves around america  george bush puts a gun to my head ermm yes the universe revolves round america

Mar 5 2008,positive,funny in a horribly corny way
Mar 5 2008,negative,nobody likes this movie i dont hate it but you have to realize that the script is absolute crap and there are no characters unless you count matt brodericks insanely gay scientist who only speaks in cliches the special effects are good but not great you never see the whole lizard in daylight hes always ducking around buildings and being masked by darkness and rain and whatnot fun to watch and laugh at with buddies and beer at best
Mar 5 2008,negative,a little too jurassic park for originalitys sake but entertaining still predictable action sequences and quit different than the originals
Mar 4 2008,positive,action fun some romanceliked it a lot
Mar 4 2008,positive,l was pretty obsessed w this movie when it came out l saw it 3 times in theatres l think
Mar 4 2008,negative,the worst movie ever actually worked for me it felt exciting back when i was 8 and the visual effects looked terrific but i suppose its crap after all
Mar 4 2008,positive,oooh boyit seems im the only one here who didnt find this movie to be made of pure fail dont get me wrong this critter is a pansy compared to its japanese counterpart but we need to remember is that it isnt the japanese version and thus should be treated as its own separate entity i personally found it to be a fun movie with good special effects its lacking a bit in many departments but this film gets a lot more gripe than it genuinely deserves
Mar 4 2008,neutral,its an ok movie the effects are great and some fun characters but its quite ordinary and done without real passion at least thats the feeling i get

Mar 4 2008,positive,not bad but doesnt hold a freakin candle to the originals
Mar 4 2008,negative,well i didnt see the original godzilla so i guess this was the next best thing no intentions of seeing it again but again its probably difficult to get an extraordinary film out of this type because you cant really tamper that much with the plot
Mar 4 2008,negative,absolutely ridiculous  jean reno cant save this
Mar 3 2008,neutral,half of the stuff in this film is great the other half sucks

Mar 1 2008,negative,a spectacular example of completely unfulfilled potential instead of taking advantage of great cgi work and a good cast this movie instead chose to anger and disappoint all who view it
Mar 1 2008,positive,look      i love the old japanesemade godzilla movies from the 50s  60s 70s 80s and 90s  theyre kitchy and corny as hell and i love every second of every one of thembut people want to slam this film    its the best godzilla movie ever made      what godzilla wasnt some ridiculous man in an equally ridiculous rubber suit    what the plot actually made a little bit of sense    what the acting was miles and eons ahead of anything weve ever seen in any godzilla film to date    let me guess you were disappointed at how realistic the destruction and action looked    cmon people like i said i love the old godzilla movies and this one might not be an academy award winner  but dont try to tell me that any of those other godzilla films are better than this one    dont expect high art folks  its just fun
Feb 29 2008,negative,some day people will stop giving money to these two hacks emmerich and devlin some day
Feb 29 2008,positive,singing in the rain im singing in the rain

Feb 22 2008,positive,obviously a big letdown at the time this is obviously not as bad as people will have you yes the leads are dull dull dull see earthquake for how this sort of thing should be done but the support from the simpsons regulars azaria and shearer give some humor but do we want humor with what could have been so shitscary the effects are great but theres a bit of a bmovie vibe emmerich is much better than this and should have served up something more memorable after the worlds greatest trailers

Feb 19 2008,neutral,i give this film a round of applause for the beautiful cg animation they used to represent godzilla in this us installment but that is not what godzilla is supposed to be godzilla is a giant monster suit with someone inside it that wreaks havoc to a miniature city set which is what makes the creature look so god damn real this version i saw the creature was very realistic no fire breaths looks like a reptile etc but again that is not what godzilla is about i enjoyed the movie but they brought the true godzilla series to shame

Feb 5 2008,negative,fun monster film with hank azaria
Feb 5 2008,neutral,i own this movie why

Feb 5 2008,positive,i love movies that make fun of themselves
Feb 4 2008,negative,who didnt know this was a bad idea

Feb 4 2008,negative,horrible horrible movie
Feb 4 2008,positive,my guilty pleasure of all movies lol along with jurassic park although i laugh when i watch it now adays
Feb 4 2008,neutral,ehim a sucker for monster movies but this one was still kind of bad
Feb 4 2008,positive,i hope it will not come true toothis is so massive destructive creature
Feb 4 2008,negative,go see cloverfield instead
Feb 4 2008,positive,this was a good movie for its time im sick of seeing people give an older movie bad reviews because they see it again and it doesnt live up to their expectations of a good movie based on how movies are made now i saw this as a kid and loved it
Feb 3 2008,negative,a travesty to godzilla this wasnt godzilla it was a giant lame lizard
Feb 3 2008,positive,a lot more believable that the japanese versions
Feb 3 2008,positive,pretty good movie i liked the action
Feb 3 2008,positive,i love it even though it is total crap
Feb 3 2008,negative,ack ack acksorry just removing my finger from my throat given the acting and technical talent available this could have  been a great movie sadly it was put together by a bunch of selfindulgent asses who couldnt find their own ass with a satnav and jeremy clarkson reno et al must have had problems going to the bank because they had to stop laughing and pick their cocks up 1 star for the fx
Feb 3 2008,positive,godzilla 98 was a great movie i dont why people say it was horrible cuz it wasnt its basicaly about godzilla attacking new york and this guyforgot his nameand his friends try to survive the attack and at the end of the movie one baby godzilla survivesi still think there is gonna be a sequalone dayhopefully
Feb 3 2008,positive,a big loud and really dumb action film  the effects were sometimes cool sometimes shitty and godzilla is never the same size  that said somehow i had a ton of fun watching this movie  you have to be in the right mood to watch it because there are tons of unintentionally hilarious moments and horrible lines of dialogue  roland emmerich proves that he can direct an action scene but not much else  he also loves to destroy manhattan as he has in 3 of his films  a good way to kill a couple of hours on a weekend
Feb 3 2008,positive,i love godzilla pure and simple the japanese one i mean this is a fun monster romp with some excellent special effects but it isnt godzilla despite what it says on the tin hollowood missed the point and tinkered with the formula making godzy too real for most of its running time this is a good exciting romp it just didnt need all the intrigue and the baby godzillas     having watched this in preperation for cloverfield im at a loss to see why it was so rounded vilfied by the critics its a ronsil movie and by no means dreadful
Feb 3 2008,positive,saw as a kid so was obviously giddy on pop so i loved it bought the toys but i can see why its not likedit does have most of the simpsons voice cast in the filmstrange
Feb 3 2008,neutral,not brilliant but nowhere near the gigantic turd that many would have you believe
Feb 3 2008,positive,i used to love this film when it first came out its got some good action scenes and shots of new york and loads of destruction time to move over now tho godzilla cloverfield is in town 
Feb 3 2008,positive,the people escapin godzilla r so stupid they shoot at doors that will weaken it for the monster duh but any way it is good
Feb 3 2008,negative,godzilla keeps changing sizes what the hell how did he fit in the subway how did he lay eggs in madison square gardens how
Feb 3 2008,negative,we sat in the front row so godzilla had that in your face feelings
Feb 3 2008,positive,big dumb action film besides the name and the nuclear explosion doesnt really have anything to do with the original film or meaning saying that though could have been better because strangely there is not enough of its titular star
Feb 3 2008,positive,big dumb action film besides the name and the nuclear explosion doesnt really have anything to do with the original film or meaning saying that though could have been better because strangely there is not enough of its titular star

Feb 3 2008,positive,well i havent seen it but most peopel say its nice
Feb 3 2008,negative,an orgy of cgi manages to leave any sense plot or acting behind kinda enjoyable if youre sitting on a subwoofer
Feb 3 2008,positive,i like this film alot its one of them you can watch over and over my boys love it too and they do watch it over and over  i do think though that it is a bad remake of the japanese godzilla but as a film on its own without the ever popular godzilla name tag its pretty awsome
Feb 2 2008,positive,ha matthew broderick hes some kind of scientist
Feb 2 2008,positive,not bad but not as good as other like for like films
Feb 2 2008,negative,a bit of cool a lot of dumb
Feb 2 2008,positive,extremely underrated  dont go into this movie thinking about the original godzilla movies because you will be disappointed  this is a whole new monster movie that just happens to have godzilla franchise name on it  if this movie was named something else then people would look at it for the movies worth rather than the franchise name
Feb 2 2008,negative,killed a perfectly good japanese franchise with americas obsession with bigger is better a pathetic waste of what could have been a great movie see the japanese version
Feb 2 2008,positive,if its the one im thinking about for some reason i really love it
Feb 2 2008,negative,i enjoy this simply because i was working at the theater when it came out and our projectionist literally destroyed the print i would watch it again if i could find a version that choppy it was hilarious
Feb 2 2008,negative,thanks for selling out jimmy the seventies called you ruined music forever pissed on diddy matthew slap how dare you

Jan 31 2008,negative,too much copied from jurassic parknamely the baby godzillas chasing the castluckly there rights to godzilla has expired years ago
Jan 31 2008,positive,there were people who hated this movie and ill admit it had its share of flaws but i thought it was enjoyable and shouldnt be hated on as much
Jan 31 2008,negative,this is an american piece of garbage  long live japanese godzilla
Jan 31 2008,negative,worst possible thing to happen to a classic  soooooo much product placement the most i had seen up to 1998
Jan 31 2008,positive,when isnt it fun when the states gets its ass kicked by a huge monster
Jan 30 2008,negative,the biggest scam of 1998 and one of the worst monster movies ever made  poorly acted directed and made with no originality or thought involved in trying to create its own godzilla
Jan 30 2008,neutral,i thought this film was ok as the story was a little predictable but the action scenes were fairly good plus i thought matthew broderick and jean reno did a reasonably good job throughout
Jan 29 2008,positive,all that is movie is in this movie
Jan 29 2008,positive,is it  bad that i thought this was a decent movie
Jan 29 2008,positive,i love this film i went through a spell of watching it daily i dont know what it is but it grips me and makes me smile  jean reno is excellent
Jan 29 2008,neutral,this was not godzilla
Jan 29 2008,negative,this one sucked emm i dont remeber godzilla being a lizard type a godzilla in japanese means gorilla whale so that means it was a mammal not a reptile and since when was it a girlthe whole thing was just wronggodzilla was done better the second time around when it was done the right way
Jan 29 2008,positive,if you like your monsters big and your action bigger you will probably enjoy this popcorn treat
Jan 29 2008,positive,its ok but godzilla dosent even breath fire
Jan 29 2008,positive,i actually thought it was good and watch it every now and then
Jan 29 2008,negative,could have been so awesome if done better and if everything wasnt ferris bueller in jurassic park ripoff scenes
Jan 28 2008,neutral,your standard hollywood summer blockbuster
Jan 28 2008,negative,to drawn out there was really no need for the babies
Jan 28 2008,positive,it wasnt godzilla but as a monster movie it was pretty good
Jan 28 2008,positive,way better than cloverfield i know its filmed differently but the scenerio is the same

Jan 28 2008,negative,i miss the guy in the rubber suit
Jan 28 2008,positive,lots of explosions jean reno and an uncredited eric stolz as the monster make for a reasonable time wasting experience
Jan 27 2008,negative,dumb movie with little love or respect for the socalled source material  paying out to japan to use the name and roar did more to overhype and destroy the film than help it
Jan 27 2008,positive,good and fun always put it back to my dvd player
Jan 27 2008,negative,you know this is a guilty pleasure of mine sure its insulting to hardcore godzilla fans which im apart of but it also has jean reno in it i dont know its just mildly entertaining but entirely stupid if you want to forget about that brain of yours perhaps you enjoy this tumori did
Jan 27 2008,negative,what  i cant give it zero stars  it didnt give me anything
Jan 27 2008,negative,the sound of joe torre in the taxicab advising to use sealtbelts was probably the only time i had a moment of enjoyment here
Jan 27 2008,positive,i hat the damn ending
Jan 27 2008,negative,nonsensical and poorly plotted but the mayhem is enough for an entertaining time killer

Jan 26 2008,negative,i was so disappointed by this film i like the actors in it but i hate the movie matthew can do better
Jan 26 2008,positive,thats not godzilla at all  but i like the movie a lot
Jan 26 2008,negative,easily one of my picks of the worst american movies in the last 25 years i give it a half star for the mere fact they got jean reno to be in it hes coolcheck out the professional if you dont believe me roland emmerich shouldnt be allowed to make movies and thankfully hes slew of big budget crapfest like independence day and godzilla arent being repeated by this director however on the flip side hes inspired plenty of other horrible films directed by no talent hacksavp  avprequiem need i say more
Jan 26 2008,positive,it was way better than the old onesit was my first bigmonsterreptileman eating movie i sawi think i saw it when i was 5hmm

Jan 26 2008,positive,a normal entertaining movieit was better than cloverfieldthe only problem is matthew broederick
Jan 25 2008,negative,animation better than the others but plot is weak
Jan 25 2008,positive,highly underrated movie im getting sick of people saying it sucks because its not like the original godzilla they simply tried a different approach and the special effects were amazing sure it has some slow parts but the scenes with zilla do more than compensate for them
Jan 25 2008,negative,cant watch movies like this its too sad
Jan 25 2008,neutral,there was a thunder storm that knocked out the power at the theater i was at when i saw this movie and it was during the scary part  lol
Jan 25 2008,negative,kinda sucks  i just saw it again last night and it blows  i remember i liked it 10 years ago when i saw it in the theater but its kind of a stinker now
Jan 25 2008,positive,i liked this movie more than most people nice action and it kept moving alongsee it
Jan 25 2008,negative,matthew broderick just isnt good in movies like this  it was great cgi especially considering how early the technology was in 1998  not a very good one overall though
Jan 25 2008,neutral,whenever godzilla was on the screen this movie was great  to bad the rest of the movie was ridiculous and forgettable
Jan 24 2008,negative,this movie was fucking bullshit
Jan 24 2008,positive,good movie id watch it again if i wanted to own the dvd but it would have been a lot better if perhaps they had made a sequel
Jan 24 2008,positive,i loved this movie especially the lil raptors in madison square garden plus the actors in the movie were awesome
Jan 24 2008,positive,i thought this was fun i dont know why people whine about it so much being a longtime fan of the godzillagojira films as a youngster i remember seeing this with great anticipation i unlike a lot of people was not at all disappointed this film was exactly what i was hoping it would be at the time sure it certainly wasnt as charming or as funny as the films i loved as a kid but it was a lot of fun i loved the action scenes the look of the monster was crazy to me and the plot was simple enough for a first time viewer to get right into seeing it again 10 years later i had the same reaction my opinion of this film hasnt changed one bit i guess everybodys complaints stem from how this has no charm or any kind of attempt at being cute or original i guess thats understandable but i still dont see what everybodys problem is this was supposed to be a fun exciting and action packed thrill ride thats all it is no more no less i personally think that it succeeds at what it achieved to be perfectly matthew broderick may not exactly be an action hero but his character sure was quirky and funny jean reno was as good as usual
Jan 24 2008,positive,well made american transition of godzilla
Jan 24 2008,negative,better than cloverfield
Jan 24 2008,negative,ive seen enough bits and pieces of this movie to know how frickin stupid it is
Jan 24 2008,positive,oh man  i love when godzilla is chasing the man in the helicopter and the guys screaming i cant shake him i cant shake him  dude youre in a helicopter  go up  a flawed poor remake of the original but godzilla still contains entertainment value
Jan 24 2008,neutral,is it stupid yes is the acting poor probably  is it fun to watch definately  i love the effects and the way they made godzilla look more like a lizardsnake thing
Jan 24 2008,neutral,ill agree this movie now is a little on the crappy side but it still has some pretty cool action scenes with godzilla even if it does have a lot of cheesy moments
Jan 24 2008,positive,not bad i like it  a while ago but great animation for its time
Jan 24 2008,negative,what a fucking disgrace to the original godzilla my god
Jan 24 2008,negative,this movie is why toho and sony wont let anyone make a godzilla movie til 2013
Jan 24 2008,negative,the most memorable thing about this movie was the commercial with the taco bell chihuaha trying to catch godzilla in a little box and he says i think i need a bigger box yeah
Jan 24 2008,negative,what a piece of crap this movie is i love giant monster movies and i couldnt wait to see this in theatres when it came out back in good old 1998 it had a wicked campaign that never showed you what godzilla looks like and it got me really pumped so i get there nice and early on opening day possibly skipping a few classes in the process and stood in line the theatre was buzzing wonder what godzilla looks like this is gonna kick ass i hear hes the size of the empire state building i hear he looks like a trex so the lights went down the movie played and it started off pretty well it had a good build up the suspense was laid on thick then godzilla shows up its all downhill from there the buildup was much better than the payoff thats for sure    where do i start ok well start with the star godzilla i dont mind the design too much he looks like a cross between a trex and an iguana whatever the fx are pretty cool and hes pretty big unfortunately he nevers kills anybody he manages to walk perfectly between the buildings only occasionally scraping one with his tail i mean come on where is the desctruction the killing the rampage the mass hysteria what the fuck then he dissapears yeah dissapears giant fucking lizard and no one can find it    so we have the mayor of ny and his assistant who are basically siskel and ebert who thought this was a good idea was this emmerichs way of getting back at them for giving independence day two thumbs down at some point didnt someone in the studio read that and say hmmm guys this is stupidly retarted change it jeez then we have hank azaria being the comic relief the problem here is two fold one he isnt funny two who is he reliefing everyone in this movie is a joke dont even get me started on broderick ive never been a fan horrible in this movie he looks totally out of place he sounds like a high school actor who forget half his lines i mean really hes horrible and i dont just mean his character is badly written which it is but his acting is shit stained     thats when it dawned on me whats wrong with this movie i was hoping for something bad ass and scary now if i cant have both id take at least one make godzilla either scary or bad ass i think the idea of a giant lizard rampaging through ny kinda scary but this movie is a comedy a flat out straight edge comedy im surprised they didnt just get adam sandler to play the lead    now im only scratching the surface of why this movie sucks  the most inept military in the world i think they caused more damage than godzilla did  helicopter pilots who are unable to pull up  stupid french undercover agents pretending to be americans  dumb shit baby godzillas total raptor rip off    this movie sucks
Jan 24 2008,negative,they drive a cab off his tongue thats just stupid
Jan 24 2008,negative,i felt nothing for this movie  it is dead to me
Jan 23 2008,neutral,more of a satire than an actual zilla film emmerichs godzilla americanizes the japanese lizard and mortalizes the name and physical structure of the behemoth    while much more action oriented and using top notch cgi sequences the film really loses quality in the fact that it stipulates a sort of a pact that it will try to be as original as possible    seriously i felt that if the original godzilla were made with these effects the films premise would be much more appreciated than using some mutated iguana
Jan 23 2008,negative,i dont remember seeing this so i guess thats not too good
Jan 23 2008,neutral,great soundtrack though
Jan 23 2008,positive,good for its time some cool special effects some parts didnt make sense or were lame

Jan 23 2008,negative,a sad disappointment and a poor adaptation
Jan 23 2008,negative,is there anything lower than half a star on this    sucks
Jan 22 2008,neutral,as being a fan of godzilla i seemed to be attracted to ths movie when i was little so i went to the movies and i loved it but now as a intelligent person i got the true meaning of this movie the original one was better it was more thought out and well plained they rushed the new design of godzilla to cg and made him basicaly a trex with spikes this movie did have some strong points but just to many week ones my rating it you realy want to watch it
Jan 22 2008,negative,terrible terrible terrible terrible fuck movie  this movie is awful  this movie is bad it sucks it is horrible  bad acting ok cg horrible plot not even jean reno can save this  bad bad bad bad fcking bad

Jan 22 2008,negative,at least the buildings wherent made out of cardboard
Jan 22 2008,negative,not bad for an american remake
Jan 22 2008,negative,the best giantlizard movie of 1998  featuring a pintsized matthew broderick
Jan 22 2008,positive,amazing film hopefully this is the monster in cloverfield but really doubt it such a good storyline and ends with a cliffhanger where you see spoiler another egg
Jan 22 2008,positive,not as bad as i thought it would be but still not great
Jan 22 2008,positive,ha ha what a thrill ride
Jan 22 2008,positive,this is a classic movie and thats why i like it
Jan 22 2008,negative,the yanks rip off the japs puff daddy rips off led zep downtown cinema 8 rips off m oliver  the circle of life is complete
Jan 22 2008,negative,so cheasy decent soundtrack though
Jan 22 2008,positive,better than the japanese version
Jan 22 2008,negative,a truly awful movie that makes even the silliest toho outing look like a masterpiece
Jan 21 2008,positive,i used to love this movie when i was in elementary school xd
Jan 21 2008,positive,an atpar american remake of a tired classic worth seeing though matthew broderick was way not meant for the leading role
Jan 21 2008,positive,try not to think of it as a godzilla film and it can be much fun  mindless dumb jean reno but definately will accidentally insult the japanese  if you dont take godzilla too seriously its worth seeing
Jan 21 2008,positive,it doesnt scratch below face value but is nevertheless enjoyable to watch at least once
Jan 21 2008,negative,god awful in everyway imaginable
Jan 21 2008,negative,most disappointing movie of alltime
Jan 21 2008,positive,i actually liked this movie better than i liked any of the japanese versions  it wasnt a masterpiece by any means but it was pretty good
Jan 21 2008,negative,blah blah snore snore i did actually literally fall asleep in this movie yes watching it on the big screen with all the noise and stuff that boring
Jan 20 2008,neutral,not bad but has nothing on the japanese versions nostalgia
Jan 20 2008,negative,the biggest budget for scifi channel fare ever has little to show for itself nothing in it is even sobaditsgood except of course for puff daddys rendition of kashmir
Jan 20 2008,positive,haha saw this on tv the other day not great but not terrible either
Jan 20 2008,neutral,originals are better
Jan 20 2008,positive,ahhahahahahahaha its funny i quote it often
Jan 20 2008,positive,liked the japonesed movies better
Jan 20 2008,negative,after seeing cloverfield this shit is even more stupid
Jan 20 2008,neutral,on its own its not a terribly bad movie but a comparative rating against original godzilla movies show how disappointing it actually is the older godzilla movies were pretty shitty but when this came out im sure the movieloving population expected more destruction more firebreath and not so much a giant pussy of a lizard
Jan 20 2008,positive,i had watched a few of the japanese movies but this one was completely off the hook funny scary and mediocre at times godzilla was one hell of a movie and man oh man what a soundtrack
Jan 20 2008,neutral,it was alright but not fantastic i can live without seeing it again although i must admit watching those giant monsters wrecking the place and the soldiers trying to blow the crud outta them was awesome
Jan 20 2008,positive,i dont really think its as horrible as everyone says it is its rather comical and some pretty good effects for the time matthew broderick does a good job of playing the innocent kindhearted nerd of course its always good to see jean reno in anything even if it is something like this i really think everyone gives it a bad rap because it completely changed everything about godzilla to be honest im really not that worried about it i enjoyed this movie when i was younger and it still entertains me
Jan 19 2008,positive,nice special effects and sound
Jan 19 2008,positive,what do this guys got against new york city
Jan 19 2008,negative,godawful and lacks the amusing nature of other wretched godzilla movies it left a really bad taste in my mouth that made me pretty much just hate movies
Jan 19 2008,negative,i hated this movie they kept getting into impossible situations and then miraculously escaping with barely a scratch on them  when they drove out of godzillas mouth that was the end for me
Jan 19 2008,positive,against all reason i own this to i also enjoyed it
Jan 19 2008,positive,thoroughly awesome just for kicks
Jan 18 2008,negative,matthew broderick that winey bitch with the ugly wife
Jan 18 2008,neutral,godzilla had previously been a guy in a big rubber suit  now hes a giant mutant iguana  i think i prefer the old stuff
Jan 18 2008,negative,so sad after the original  the cgi effects seem exceptional at first until all the baby godzillas run without their feet realistically touching the flooroh my god did i just give away the many babies shocker
Jan 18 2008,negative,very poor modern day remake of the classic and my pick for worst movie of 1998 the trailer involving the fisherman for this one was terrific unfortunately the movie itself was nowhere even remotely close to matching what it seemed to be bragging about godzilla himself was rather lame looking too unexciting and boring a lot of hard work here went down the toilet with this one if only audiences could have seen nearly 10 years into the future and known about cloverfield which utterly beats the tar out of this
Jan 18 2008,positive,godzilla godzilla i love the soundtrack too
Jan 18 2008,negative,poopy pooppoop not even matthew brodericks dazzling charm and boyish good looks can save this stinker
Jan 18 2008,negative,godzilla  in name only
Jan 18 2008,negative,just your bigbudget action movie not really anything to do with godzilla aside from the name
Jan 18 2008,neutral,this movie is no more a godzilla movie then ai was the sequal to et    that being said if it was a generic monster movie i would store it 3 as it fits all the rules for the genre
Jan 18 2008,positive,i know people really disliked the movie itself but i thought it was kinda neat nonetheless  the action scenes are pretty fun and i liked the effects for the most part
Jan 17 2008,positive,surprisingly enjoyable
Jan 17 2008,negative,this was not a good movie at all it was the worst remake ever and will never want to see it again
Jan 17 2008,negative,i wish this movie was better 
Jan 17 2008,positive,i used to have the soundtrack to this movie and i memorized the whole puff daddy song
Jan 17 2008,positive,its was ok but the lizard shouyld have been bigger but that was ok
Jan 17 2008,negative,the first movie i saw that had an hour and a half denouement
Jan 17 2008,positive,really really good
Jan 17 2008,neutral,pretty funny could have been much better
Jan 17 2008,positive,nothing like a good monster flick good effects and light entertaining  if you have a choice between this and cloverfield  watch cloverfield
Jan 16 2008,negative,fun fact it took me no less than 8 rentals to finish this gargantuan missedopportunity without falling asleep the effects are nice but everything else just stalls and never ignites into anything remotely interesting
Jan 16 2008,negative,over ambitious production and a lazy script
Jan 16 2008,positive,all these nerds give it horrendous reviews it is an epic blockbuster not very deep obviously so dont take it seriously its about a huge monster that battles submarines piss off criticising it too deeply

Jan 14 2008,negative,great soundtrack shitty movie
Jan 14 2008,negative,i suppose i am a little biast on this subject as i am comparing it the jurrassic park    after seeing that this just doesent really look good the plot moves too fast and you dont get a chance to feel anything for anyone its just problem bang solution    dissapointing
Jan 14 2008,positive,i watched this only because i adore anything jean reno does  and came away  both surprised and delighted  an overblown updated take on our favorite japanese monster godzilla actually works  ps jean reno is great
Jan 14 2008,positive,pretty good monster movie but dont go in expecting your traditional godzilla
Jan 14 2008,positive,it has action and has good actors but i expected more of the godzilla image and of the whole story  you will be entertain but will not classify it as a good movie

Jan 14 2008,negative,horrible movie  this is not godzilla  it may have been okay if it was just another monster movie but this has nothing to do with godzilla  fans call this creature gino godzilla in name only and the original creator calls it zilla because they took the god out of godzilla never watch this movie

Jan 12 2008,negative,god i hope cloverfield erases this from my memory
Jan 12 2008,negative,cloverfield got me to thinking about what a good monster movies going to be like the americanized version of godzilla is not that movie nor is it very entertaining it just is an excuse to see stuff blown up and matt broderick to chew the scenery with his other castmates
Jan 12 2008,negative,im going to puke if i ever have to suffer through this action packed movie again
Jan 12 2008,positive,you know what  screw you all i like this filmalmost as much as jurassic park

Jan 12 2008,positive,good film great graphics and music
Jan 12 2008,positive,nobody can say this is a bad film in fact this film is a true monster movie great with a great cast and gripping action sequences and touches of light humour you betta step on it mr french  especially when godzilla is chasing the taxi through new york fantastic
Jan 11 2008,negative,just doesnt have the inherent camp that makes the other godzila films amusing

Jan 11 2008,positive,ah idk its ok i guess
Jan 11 2008,negative,ok  so the special effects are way better then the old toho rubber suit g films  a not so good plot and g is too different  i thought it funny that most of the audience got up and started to leave when they thought the movie was over when it wasnt yet  stupid
Jan 11 2008,positive,not very intelligent but htere is something about this movie that really appeals to me  maybe it is the great big monster that is totally misunderstood by those that are inferior to him  no that cant be it

Jan 10 2008,positive,campy  predictable  but sometimes you just need a thoughtless action flick
Jan 10 2008,negative,the fishy cgi godzilla with little godzillalings and matthew broderick this godzilla has no heart and the whole point of a godzilla movie is to laugh at the effects and fightingum if its cgi theres no man in a rubber suitlame
Jan 10 2008,negative,everyone hated the fuck out of this movie but it wasnt that bad as far as bigbudget blockbusters go still it was pretty bad

Jan 9 2008,positive,dont remember much about it
Jan 9 2008,negative,only film i ever showed my anger when watching i was massive fan of orginal versions during the first showing full of familys at the slapstick moment the little godzillas slipping on gobstoppers and basketballs i bolted up of my seat and started swearing at he screen before the guilt set in as it was only 1 pm on friday afternoon but it was worth getting off my chest
Jan 9 2008,negative,i thought it was really good back when it came out  not so much now
Jan 9 2008,negative,the hilariously obvious product placement overkill was more memorable than the film
Jan 8 2008,negative,defecation all over godzillas holiness

Jan 6 2008,positive,jurassic park on steroids this is a good action movie some parts are corny but its fun to watch
Jan 6 2008,positive,the only line i remember from this is wrong floor when dr niko guy escapes from being eaten on some other floor he gets in the elevator and goes up and stops on some floor and it had more of godzillas babies eating everything  popcorn and he says wrong floor thats the only funny line and actual line i still remember to this day from that movie
Jan 6 2008,positive,guilty pleasure its entertaining
Jan 6 2008,positive,keep thinking cloverfield is going to be a remake of this remake o boy
Jan 6 2008,negative,the originals were far far better
Jan 6 2008,positive,it was okay i still cant get myself to call it godzilla needs a better cast you know you have a problem when the supporting cast is better than the lead actors
Jan 5 2008,positive,other than the asexual reproduction stuff i liked the remodeling of godzilla  might have been better if he went up against another creature though i think
Jan 5 2008,positive,fun to watchbut nothing like the first black and white  one
Jan 5 2008,negative,why did they fox i believe have to mess with the old faithful rubber suit and go with computer effects  nifty soundtrack though great how green day changed one of their greats to incorporate godzilla sounds

Jan 5 2008,negative,it stunk we will never speak of this again
Jan 5 2008,negative,fun but poorly acted
Jan 5 2008,positive,well what can i sayi didnt mind this film it was quite entertaining a great popcorn film that kept me satisfied leaving the movie theater my 2 problems  i had with the film was the name of the creature its clearly not godzilla aka gojira ok sure its been rewritten to cater to the north american audiences but come on it felt like it was written for kindergarteners the movie was quite dumbed down and i think it was its downfall and hurt everything else that was great about the movie it should have been called the beast from 20000 fathoms
Jan 4 2008,positive,as a major godzilla fan i saw this on the opening night at the theatre and was not terribly disappointed my only real big question was why in the hell would a giant nuclear iguana choose to migrate all the way across the worlds largest ocean cross central america on foot then swim up to manhattan to make a nest theres so many major cities he skipped
Jan 4 2008,negative,this is not godzilla this is american cg trash

Jan 4 2008,positive,this isnt godzilla godzilla doesnt run terrified from humans godzilla doesnt spawn hundreds of baby raptors and godzilla was not the result of french bomb testing the monster is wrong the ideology is wrong the movie is wrong its not that the film itself sucked this just isnt what the title claims it is

Jan 3 2008,positive,you know i actually remember having a good time at this onebut i was also 13havent seen it recently so take this for what its worth
Jan 3 2008,neutral,the us shows it has no idea how to make a godzilla movie  no theme songs or anything

Jan 2 2008,negative,godzilla in name only
Jan 2 2008,negative,the bw toho version with the raymond burr inserts is light years better than this remake  should be reclassified as porn because it has no redeeming social value

Dec 31 2007,negative,you dont kill godzilla with 6 sidewinders  you just dont  and you dont put matthew broderick in the movie too  goddamn
Dec 31 2007,positive,bfonttimes new romangodzilla 1998 starring mathew broderick and the brilliant people behind independace day seemed to have a lot of things going for itthat seemed for a while it may have been good but what went wrong with it well a lot of thingssee below  1 horrible storyline  2 godzilla never has babies  3 he doesnt run away from threats  4 vague predictable and boring   however the design of the creature is simply fantastic it has b acting but the beginning of this film keeps you on the edge of your seat which gives it a 710 fresh  fontb
Dec 31 2007,negative,i saw this when it came out and i was like what 9 yeah i cried at the end because of animal cruelty  lol
Dec 30 2007,negative,this jurassic park remake thought nobody would notice what a fuckin ripoff it was

Dec 30 2007,negative,fluff plus jean reno seemed to think he was in a nescafe advert
Dec 30 2007,positive,not bad for a hokey scifi film
Dec 30 2007,positive,i have a problem with the amount of criticism that godzilla received when it came out in 1998  it seems as though this is one of the most hated movies of the 1990s and i for one cant see whats so awful about it    depending on your taste in movies roland emmerich is great or awful  he is never going to win an oscar for directing but he has been involved in lots of major popcorn movies such as independence day 10000 bc 2012 the patriot and the day after tomorrow  for me godzilla is his best    anyone who enjoyed jurassic park should love this and considering the level of acclaim that movie achieved godzilla has been really hard done by  emmerich has created a great action movie and whilst it maybe doesnt stick to the traditional japanese godzilla it is entertaining  the us military and the french secret service attempt to stop the huge lizard that is terrorizing new york city  along the way the special effects are great the characters are well cast and the actors do a good job with the script which isnt acaademy award worthy by any means but is certainly servicable enough for this kind of movie    on the whole if you like action movies and have a couple of hours to kill godzilla is a lot of fun  dont expect a classic and be aware that the movie doesnt stick to the japanese godzilla blueprint but if you accept it for what it is this is really good fun stuff
Dec 29 2007,negative,this movie was really awful
Dec 29 2007,negative,i like the old godzillas better

Dec 29 2007,positive,find this film mysterious and worth watching
Dec 29 2007,negative,the japanese monster yay
Dec 29 2007,positive,what made me love tihs movie and watch it over and over and over again s a combination of brodericks acting expression not to mention that baby face looking face the awesome visual effect and yes new york city  my favourite scene would be one where he was chased down manhattan and down to brookln bridge awesome movie
Dec 28 2007,positive,all around good movie

Dec 23 2007,negative,i do not understand why this film is hated so much i remember seeing it on its release when i was 7 and it is still visually amazing the storyline is not too bad and the acting reaches the required level its a rollicking rollercoaster ride blending humour action drama and horror in to a fun family film fantastic
Dec 23 2007,negative,what a missed opportunity sony really dropped the ball on this one
Dec 23 2007,neutral,the acting is pretty bad but really this was better than any of the japanese godzilla movies thats not so much a comment on the quality of this as it is a shot at the lowquality of the others
Dec 22 2007,negative,if theres any moment in hollywood history that made me hate hollywoodthis is it tohos godzilla is among my fave cheezy film series thankfully in one of the newer godzilla movies toho made fun of usas shitty godzilla clone that was pretty funny

Dec 21 2007,positive,who wouldnt like to see ny destroyed
Dec 21 2007,positive,the story line had obvious problems and sometimes the general effects were seriously underdone but all in all this movie will keep you interested with enough action and comedy mixed together
Dec 21 2007,negative,watched it but was not impressed with it the love story was a cure twist
Dec 20 2007,negative,well it filled most of an evening  thats about all  why was it constantly raining during the film  how did a car stay in front of godzilla when helicopters couldnt keep up  ugh

Dec 17 2007,positive,godzilla can hide like a mad fiend seriously he should just trashed the city until they nuked him i would liked that movie

Dec 16 2007,negative,ok cgi for 1998 but the acting was so terrible  i would never watch this movie again

Dec 15 2007,negative,the graphics are good the soundtrack is cool hank azaria is cute but ill never intentionally watch this movie again
Dec 15 2007,neutral,it was decent but come on a godzilla movie should be more badass than this matthew broderick saving the world from a gigantic lizardha i laugh in the face of this movie i have to admt that godzilla was pretty cool looking though
Dec 15 2007,neutral,a fun movie but far from great  the new design for godzilla was cool but poor graphics kept it from looking real  jean reno was the best part of this movie
Dec 15 2007,positive,the only reason it was really trashed is because true godzilla fans hate intensive plots i  guess im not one of them then
Dec 15 2007,negative,the best bit is the end creditsbecause the nightmare is over
Dec 15 2007,positive,would never say a bad word about the broderick
Dec 15 2007,negative,run its godzilla no i mean run away seriously this movie bites
Dec 14 2007,positive,theres some decent fun to be had with this monster movie imperfect though it may be shouldve been called something else though theres a reason why the japanese have dropped the god from this monsters name whenever they refer to himher this kaiju aint no godzilla
Dec 14 2007,negative,horrible matthew broderick you suck balls
Dec 14 2007,neutral,should have focused more on godzilla and actual destruction than the characters a problem similar to transformers
Dec 14 2007,negative,this was a horrible movie
Dec 14 2007,negative,godzilla looked too much like a trex
Dec 14 2007,positive,mindless action pretty cool when it came out
Dec 14 2007,negative,the only movie i have ever walked out in that i can remember
Dec 14 2007,neutral,i didnt know godzilla was a velocoraptor
Dec 14 2007,negative,my buddy cried at the end seriously heres to you psycho c
Dec 14 2007,negative,one of the worst films i had to see in theaters  not only were dumb parents letting their kids run up and down the asiles of the theater until i tripped one but the plot was so stale and boring
Dec 13 2007,positive,yes it was bad i admit it but i kinda liked it
Dec 13 2007,negative,most of this movie was boring and the acting was pretty bad
Dec 13 2007,positive,absolutely hilarious

Dec 13 2007,positive,i like it and i dont care
Dec 13 2007,positive,funny as hell especially when the taxicab is inside godzillas mouth maybe our jokes about 4wheel drive and etc made it fun
Dec 13 2007,positive,what can i say i am a sucker for big visual effects the writting is horrible but david arnolds score and the great visual effects keep me glued to the screen it is my guilty pleasure
Dec 13 2007,positive,great special effects
Dec 12 2007,negative,this movie didnt do its previews justice
Dec 12 2007,positive,blargh japanese godzilla is better still zilla was enjoyable
Dec 12 2007,negative,the only hollywood film to have the soundtrack outsell the movie
Dec 12 2007,negative,this movie did not do justice to the ultimate force that is godzilla  he can fuck your day up real good and they killed him with a few missileslame  if i was godzilla id start spitting nuclear fire all over the placenot swimretards
Dec 12 2007,negative,people missed the point with this film  it was no longer a japanese gojirra film but rather a blockbuster noholesbarred action film  the problem is it still sucked as one of those movies
Dec 12 2007,negative,it made me throw up really it was that bad
Dec 11 2007,negative,wow used to love this movie as a kid  looking back it makes me regret ever liking it
Dec 11 2007,positive,my 13yr old self liked it but my 22yr old self thinks its ok
Dec 11 2007,negative,nothing can beat the origials
Dec 11 2007,positive,i liked it but i havent seen the original yet maybe its just matthew broderick
Dec 11 2007,positive,the special effects in this movie set a new standard for high budget movies the rest of the movie doesnt even matter godzilla looks beast
Dec 11 2007,negative,was stupid predictable and probably didnt do the japanese godzilla any justice
Dec 11 2007,negative,not sure if i have seen a worse movie
Dec 11 2007,positive,was a cool movie back in the day the ending bought out promises of a sequel but that never happened decent movie for its time i guess
Dec 11 2007,neutral,i remember getting a godzilla cup that could latch onto the car window from taco bell
Dec 10 2007,negative,the nice thing about godzilla was how cheesy it was then this movie tried to take the topic seriously bad move
Dec 10 2007,positive,gino for sure but another movie where it gets more shit than it deserves
Dec 10 2007,negative,cloverfield better get here fast because the way new york got trashed in this movie was pitiful
Dec 10 2007,negative,its not the real thing  go japanese
Dec 10 2007,positive,one of the better monster movies
Dec 10 2007,neutral,would have been really cool if jurasic park was never made
Dec 10 2007,negative,what in the hell were they thinking
Dec 10 2007,positive,this wasnt a bad movie at all it was kinda cool to see a good monster movie set in america
Dec 9 2007,positive,a nondisputedthatitsbad movie but i think it still offers a tiny bit of entertainment value like that the military did more damage blowing up famous landmarks than godzilla did i also find it humorous that even though theres a giant lizard monster hiding in all these ny underground chasms the majority of the public just kinda sticks around goes about their daily lives no big deal a godzilla remake couldve rocketed the story to fun creative heights but this remake didnt really strive for anything special im not sure what emmerich was trying to accomplish in this other than bombastic silliness
Dec 9 2007,positive,i think im the only person alive that enjoyed this movie
Dec 9 2007,negative,i think everyone owns this soundtrack
Dec 9 2007,negative,oh my god does this movie suck i figured after seeing all three jurassic park movies again i should check out the 1998 american remake of godzilla too this movie might as well be called jurassic park 2 12 because thats exactly what it is godzilla is just the trex and its babies are the raptors they look the same move the same make the same noises there is a complete and total lack of originality here not that i should have expected anything different from a roland emmerich movie after all hes also responsible for train wrecks like independence day and 10 000 bc now im not really a fan of the japanese godzilla movies but i know a disgrace when i see one if anything they should have been inspired by those films and then put an american twist on it godzilla in those movies was way bigger and way more powerful he was immune to just about everything he breathed deadly radioactive blue fire he walked around comfortably on two legs etc this godzilla was easily destroyed with a few missiles they actually never even adequately explained why he was so invincible in the first half of the movie and then ultimately killed so easily in the end the attempts at a love story and the story of the woman trying to become a reporter were only outdone in cheesiness by godzilla himself and i cant help but laugh that ferris bueller matthew broderick is the hero of this movie anyways its just a cheesy stupid wannabe jurassic park and i strongly recommend you avoid this disaster at the end of this movie an egg hatches suggesting theres going to be a sequel im sure glad that never came to pass apparently there was a japanese movie done a couple years after this where the real godzilla destroys the bullshit godzilla from this movie now thats a film i should track down and see
Dec 9 2007,positive,atleast the jurassic park computer software still made some money  actually the movie is not that bad but the baby godzillas look a lot like the raptors from jp
Dec 9 2007,positive,i like the big monster and the main theme music deeper underground produced by jamiroquai is also great
Dec 9 2007,positive,a classic broderick is the shit
Dec 9 2007,negative,ruined the godzilla franchise period
Dec 9 2007,neutral,i probably shouldnt review movies that i dont remember  or maybe that just tells you what youll think of it 9 years later
Dec 9 2007,positive,yes yes i liked it
Dec 9 2007,neutral,gawddd watching this 9 years later makes me puke the actiing was bad the cgs are bad and look at the panels on the helicopters and shits they looks like star wars wt the hell  and most of all godzilla looks fake very fake
Dec 8 2007,negative,boo i like the old school shit better
Dec 8 2007,positive,excellent soundtrack  jamiroquais deeper underground wallflowers heroes   puff daddys come with me  saw this around the time it came out   do remember enjoying it a lot shame there wasnt a sequel
Dec 8 2007,positive,greatest movie soundtrack ever
Dec 8 2007,positive,i dont know why i was so hard on this film when it first came out  looking at the film 10 years on i was impressed by how good the sfx still look  some of the scenes in nyc are a little hard to watch in a post911 world but otherwise its a greatly enjoyable blockbuster and ive not seen one of those for a very long time    jean reno is particularly good here although the rest of the cast are pretty good too  the main reason i wanted to watch this again is because it leads directly into an animated series that came out afterwards  it has a big fanbase and after seeing the first two episodes im hooked
Dec 7 2007,negative,this movie just makes me angry as a rabid fan of godzilla movies
Dec 7 2007,negative,painfully stupid at points but breathtaking at others a particularly salty failure especially since the japanese have made better g movies since with a fraction of the budget
Dec 7 2007,negative,seems awful and frivolous in retrospect but at the time i watched it i think i had fun
Dec 7 2007,negative,rape of the legend that is godzilla
Dec 6 2007,neutral,what was broderick thinking when he took this role he was thinking about much money they offered him thats what
Dec 6 2007,positive,yeah so what if im one of those people that likes this movie  i like matthew broderick and things go boom
Dec 6 2007,negative,if you are going to remake a monster movie classic you couldve at least tried to inject some of the charm the original had or even better give us a more refreshing plot audiences were wise to just run away at the mere sight of this monstrosity
Dec 6 2007,positive,any movie that blows upmadison square garden
Dec 6 2007,neutral,guilty pleasure of mine anything made by devlinemmerich im watching
Dec 6 2007,positive,decent movie but thats not godzilla
Dec 6 2007,neutral,its not supposed to be a comedy but its damn funny
Dec 6 2007,negative,audreys gonna stay with us tonight  cool threesome
Dec 6 2007,positive,a sleek realistic godzilla sure beats a rubber suit unfortunately fan outcry will prevent sequels
Dec 5 2007,positive,the best part was puff daddys theme song that song was stuck in my head forever
Dec 5 2007,positive,really enjoyed this moviewell acted i thoughtkept it interesting
Dec 5 2007,neutral,i so badly wanted to give godzilla a thumbs up review and for the longest time i gave it a thumbsup rating because this is a movie i loved as a child now that im older however theres just too many shitty moments in this movie that make me have to give it a negative review  but ill start out by praising it on a number of accomplishments first of all jean reno who played the french guy gives us an excellent performance he seems genuine and acts in the way we would expect any patriot to act he was always the highlight of the film for me  i also want to acknowledge matt broderick his performance certainly isnt spectacular but its not bad either and i want to praise him for not being awful he put in effort and it shows  ill also give praise to the visuals the visuals werent amazing but they did their job and i would congratulate the people doing the effects for a particularly splendid job  the music was also certainly worth listening to  however roland emmerichs direction is far from satisfactory he rips off great movies like jaws star wars and jurassic park throughout the picture ive seen him do much better work than this in independence day but here i suppose that he thought that since he was already using someone elses monster he might as use other peoples action sequences etc as well  and that damn woman who played audrey always plucked my nerve its not so much that she was a terrible actress though she was as much as the character itself was extremely poorly written shes stupid and selfish and is exceptionally dull i never could figure out why brodericks character wanted her so badly  i also noticed that emmerich didnt show a whole lot of the monster im assuming that this was because he was doing what spielberg did in jawsdont show the monster to build suspense this might have worked if they hadnt analyzed the damn thing to death all the talk in this movie is either directed at that or how retarded the military is for not being able to stop the beast realistically emmerich treats the army more like the shark from jaws than he does godzilla the effect is incredibly displeasing  i think the highlight of the film would be when they find godzillas nest and all the thousands of eggs the lowlight of the film would be pretty much any action sequence in the movie  this film had potentialbut emmerich did not  510
Dec 5 2007,positive,it was exciting on the first part now come the little godzillas god get me out of the theater
Dec 4 2007,negative,cheesy monster movie should have made it ratedr
Dec 4 2007,negative,why was this created
Dec 4 2007,positive,look outit godzilla  said the chineese   
Dec 4 2007,positive,i loved the movie sole because i love godzilla and i liked how he looked and i some what like the rest of the movie
Dec 4 2007,negative,nah man this movie got me so upset  anthony threw a full jumbo cup of pepsi at the screen and lots of folks cheered after he threw that thing  i give it a star because of nostalgia and because of anthonys behavior and because i also like godzilla
Dec 4 2007,negative,people who rate this movie disturb me
Dec 3 2007,neutral,didnt do the king of monsters justice
Dec 3 2007,negative,rubbish absolute garbage but all my love in the toho scheme of things it turns out to be a new monster in pantheon of kaiju tremendousness see final wars all out monster attack
Dec 3 2007,negative,nothing much in it except the nostalgia and deeper underground
Dec 3 2007,positive,i prefer the japanese version
Dec 3 2007,positive,i enjoyed the originals better but this was ok
Dec 3 2007,negative,utter utter garbage only gets half a star because it spawned a good cartoon series and jean reno was in it matthew brodericks first attempt at raping my childhood
Dec 2 2007,negative,the best thing about this movie is that silverchair is on the soundtrack
Dec 2 2007,negative,soso when i was a kid probably awful if i were to watch it now
Dec 2 2007,positive,a victim of high expectations this is a solid little monster movie when all is said and done the monster himself is a great design theres a nice jaunty tone to the whole thing and jean reno kicks some significant ass undeniably flawed but for me the positives outweigh the negatives
Dec 2 2007,negative,things don make any sense in this movie bad script jean reno and matt broderick earn the two stars but thats about it waste of my time
Dec 2 2007,negative,jean reno has been in so many better movies
Dec 2 2007,positive,funny and entretaining
Dec 1 2007,positive,jean reno and matthew broderick made this movie fun along with the destruction that godzilla leaves behind when the entire like airforce and such try to take him down is sweet
Dec 1 2007,positive,muhahaha p so funny and so poor 
Dec 1 2007,negative,travesty to all things godzilla
Dec 1 2007,positive,i saw this in theaters when it came out  it was kinda tight if i remember right
Dec 1 2007,negative,not good  matthew broderick is adorable but this movie was just laughable
Dec 1 2007,negative,i wish i could give this no stars
Nov 30 2007,positive,special effects were fine some of movie plots were so stupid
Nov 30 2007,positive,love any movie that destorys a big city
Nov 30 2007,positive,am i the only person who likes this movie everyone ive talked to hated it but ive always liked it whats the deal how could you not think that its badass remember when matthew broderick is in maddison square garden and all of the baby godzillas are like trying to eat him and then matthew broderick is all like i dont think so bitch and then he escapes only to moments later go on a 10 minute chase from godzilla in a taxi cab somebody please tell me that they liked it too
Nov 30 2007,negative,liked it when i was a kid but now i just wonder why they had to make a godzillz movie with something that looks nothing like godzilla
Nov 30 2007,positive,godzilla looks nothing like the orginal
Nov 30 2007,negative,this was not godzilla  this was giant fking lizard that eats new york  fish breath no no nuclear fire breath  and whats with the baby raptors  feh
Nov 30 2007,negative,godzilla is awoken by nuclear testing in the pacific and hides out in new york city although it isnt explained how the hell it got to the east coast of america  zilla gives birth to some raptors from jurassic park and the cast run around screaming except for maria pitillo who is presumably using the movie to audition for a tv sitcom
Nov 30 2007,negative,how could they have gone so wrong
Nov 29 2007,negative,bad  you sure this wasnt directed by michael bay
Nov 29 2007,negative,it had the guy who played joey jeremiah in it
Nov 29 2007,negative,not even the legendary jean reno can save this film a top actor in a shit film mildly entertaining one of the worst of 1998
Nov 29 2007,negative,needs to bring back the dude in the foam suit
Nov 29 2007,negative,pathetic attempt at hollywoodizing the original masterpiece godzilla 1998 should be arrested for rape
Nov 29 2007,negative,godzilla manages to hide in new york 3 times have you seen the size of it
Nov 29 2007,negative,what happened why didnt they just make stargate 2 instead
Nov 29 2007,negative,didnt jurassic park cover this
Nov 28 2007,negative,what a joke as the man who played godzilla in the original movie said its not godzilla it just doesnt have the same feel
Nov 28 2007,neutral,was ok nothing very god like from zilla the toho movies are alot better
Nov 28 2007,positive,no its not the classic of childhood but i didnt find it as horrible as some did  i liked the mutant iguanas  nice
Nov 27 2007,positive,i actually liked it not for any good reason i just did
Nov 27 2007,negative,the rifftrax version is good for 25 stars
Nov 27 2007,negative,i prefer the original japanese dude in a rubber costume version of godzilla not some huge ass female dinosaur that looks ridiculous
Nov 27 2007,negative,so freakin bad
Nov 27 2007,neutral,it looked kinda cool
Nov 27 2007,negative,entertaining but nothing to take home about
Nov 27 2007,positive,it shows the need for 3d animation story is shit pictures are still amazing
Nov 27 2007,negative,remakes arrrr  funniest bit in this movie was  when he was kicking little godzillas in the head pushing them back into the elevator
Nov 26 2007,positive,i kind of liked this
Nov 26 2007,positive,really good remake on the original great cast excellent effects
Nov 25 2007,negative,i saw this with my mom
Nov 25 2007,neutral,weak but unreasonably entertaining american adaptation of the japanese monster classic the excellent support from jean reno and hank azaria is enough to nearly amend for matthew brodericks typically flat starring role it may not be particularly well done but it is exhillerating at times and far more fun than it should be
Nov 25 2007,negative,puff daddy and jimmy page making a song together was the worst idea every i guess puff wouldve just sampled kashmir off of led zeppelins album anyway
Nov 25 2007,negative,i miss the guy in the rubber suit after watching this
Nov 25 2007,neutral,i can think of worse things than spending 139 minutes in the couch with a bag of potato chips and a can of coke
Nov 25 2007,negative,hollywood moreisless
Nov 25 2007,negative,holy shit this a cinematic turd the size of godzilla
Nov 24 2007,negative,puff daddy did a song for this when he was still called puff daddy if that doesnt turn you away i dont know what will
Nov 24 2007,negative,lots of sound and fury signifying nothing
Nov 24 2007,positive,is it bad i actually like this film  perhaps but i dont really care

Nov 21 2007,negative,single handedly shit all over a legend
Nov 21 2007,neutral,i saw this one at the movies when it came out hahaha godzilla is cute i dunno i find this movie a bit underrated i mean its not good but come on its not that bad  roland emmerich is pretty much terrible though
Nov 21 2007,negative,yet another amazing japanese franchise that dies a horrible corporate death at the hands of hollywood hacks
Nov 20 2007,neutral,soundtrack was the best part
Nov 20 2007,negative,just just  just dont watch this film  please godzilla should be remembered in his japanese form even if some might say they are stupid
Nov 20 2007,negative,i wish i was a big lizard that could hide in a city of 20 million people
Nov 20 2007,negative,could have been way better
Nov 20 2007,positive,i always watched this when i was a kidlove it

Nov 19 2007,positive,now this is another goodbad movie  its got bad acting bad effects bad writingbut put it all together and its the kind of movie i like watching with friends
Nov 18 2007,negative,this movie is a travisty to everything godzilla thankfully this godzilla gets his ass pwned by the real one in the final godzilla movie
Nov 18 2007,negative,sucktastic  even if it had been called big lizard in new york so that it did not take the name of godzilla in vain i still would have hated it
Nov 18 2007,neutral,if only they left out the unrealistic ending
Nov 18 2007,negative,godzilla needs to be purposely destructive not some mindless giant iguana
Nov 18 2007,negative,like a slap in the face for the originals and on top of that it was just mediocre
Nov 18 2007,negative,doesnt work on any level plus matthew broderick is not an action hero
Nov 18 2007,negative,would have been a decent blockbuster is the monster was actually godzilla and if there was a decent plot and characters
Nov 18 2007,positive,i know its silly   but jean reno is über cool 
Nov 18 2007,negative,why wasnt godzilla in this movie

Nov 17 2007,negative,i liked the old movies way better
Nov 16 2007,positive,substantially better than the other hollywood attempt at the japanese franchise
Nov 16 2007,negative,it has its entertaining moments but its not a good movie
Nov 16 2007,positive,this is a very underrated film its not really a godzilla film but only named so as the japanese sailor in  the first few minutes names the monster godzilla if you just watch it instead of trying t o classify it youll get more out of it
Nov 16 2007,negative,this is the only movie ive seen at a drive in im not sure whether that made me like it more or less
Nov 15 2007,negative,why watch this when you could watch independence day or jurassic park
Nov 15 2007,negative,hilariously bad   watch the robot chicken parody of this

Nov 15 2007,positive,still waiting on a decent sequel
Nov 15 2007,negative,i wish i could give it negative stars
Nov 15 2007,negative,great apostasy for most self respecting kaiju eiga fans this film simply has never existed  godzilla gets stripped of his japanese identity and of all the wwii memories he represents in the original gojira film of 1954 in an insulting rewrite of the plot for the sake of box office exploitation  won 2 razzie awards for worst remake or sequel and for worst supporting actress nominated for 3 more razzies worst director screenplay and picture
Nov 14 2007,positive,my grandpa sleep threw this movie and it was the second loudest movie of the year back then
Nov 14 2007,positive,godzilla is a mommy
Nov 14 2007,positive,freakin sweet the ending was kickass too
Nov 14 2007,negative,crap i had blocked this movie out of my mind until nowit sucked
Nov 14 2007,positive,ok so everyone is criticizing this movie for its unoriginality since godzilla is japanese and it almost directly takes off of jurassic park truth of the matter is its much better than jurassic park 3 so just consider it that instead plus it has a great soundtrack
Nov 14 2007,negative,i was so disappointed in this movie and it really could have not sucked it so could have
Nov 14 2007,negative,they spent money on this
Nov 14 2007,positive,again i dont know why i can watch this movie over and over and over
Nov 14 2007,positive,like the music score a lil overated

Nov 11 2007,positive,i personally liked it i think that if there were to be a lizard like this it would be more like this one instead of a guy in a rubber suit clearly throwing punches at another guy in a rubber suit granted that back in the day thats what they had to work with but i think that this is what they were trying to achieve
Nov 10 2007,negative,so theres this giant lizard named godzilla right except hes not really godzilla just some scenerychewing cgianimated dinosaur knockoff and get this  he lays over 200 eggs in madison square garden where no one would ever notice such a thing great huh    i think ill stop there

Nov 9 2007,positive,do i remember a bit of sarcasm in this
Nov 9 2007,negative,this is by far the worst godzilla movie ever   why well maybe its because our good buddy mr roland emmerich would rather shove  huge piles of fecal matter in our faces than make a decent fn film   this human being makes movies for the lowest common denominator imho

Oct 25 2007,positive,broderick and reno as freaking sweet together
Oct 25 2007,negative,godzilla works on one simple level mindless but unfortunately this mindless isnt fun like indepence day it just plain stupid the acting is poor and the script is so bad its almost like a comedy the cg isnt even that great jp is 100 times better and it was made five years previous this junk the action sequences work and the opening is strong and has possibilties but overall a terrible monster flick heres what i say jurassic park is way better
Oct 25 2007,negative,go pick up something from japan  this thing is detritus

Oct 25 2007,neutral,kinda good kinda crappy the begininng starts off good but once it gets to the end with the baby godzillas who from birth can run at full speed and already have a taste for fish on humans it just gets dumb

Oct 25 2007,negative,see backdraft change billy baldwin to jean reno
Oct 25 2007,positive,im going deeper undergroundsmells like fish but definately one to watch
Oct 25 2007,negative,oh man godzilla never looked so good but then he never shared a screen with matthew broderick either shearer and azaria do provide some good laughs but jean reno seems to be impersonating billy joel and it tries to do jurassic park when it should be doing king kong
Oct 24 2007,negative,hahaha has some good fun i liked jean reno and hank azaria matthew broderick gives an annoying smart person performance
Oct 24 2007,positive,rememeber the hype remember the soundtrack remember how bad this movie was yep it rocked

Oct 24 2007,neutral,not up to the japanese stuff but fun

Oct 23 2007,neutral,this shit was ten times better than cloverfield
Oct 23 2007,positive,i like godzilla and i dont care loads of people hate it but are they blind theres a dirty great big lizard smashing loads of gear up the clue is in the title it makes me laugh when people criticise this film what did they expect the old godzilla was so pikey it was unbelievable destroy all monsters looks like it was filmed by a bunch of crack heads using sock puppets when godzilla sunk the submarine it was great i wish eveyone who hates this film was on that submarine
Oct 23 2007,neutral,i scared me senseless when i was a kid
Oct 23 2007,negative,matthew broderick needs to be punched in the face

Oct 22 2007,negative,make it stop surely among the worst bigbudget action films ever baby zillas come on poor broderick reno and azaria deserve much much better than this
Oct 22 2007,positive,aside from some bad acting this was a really good movie in my opinion the effects were great the concept of a more realisitc godzilla was quickly welcomed by me
Oct 22 2007,negative,this movie is an absolute train wreck right to the end where the cab peels out on the monstas teeth and jumps to safety
Oct 22 2007,negative,can you say bad dialogue  i thoughtcha could
Oct 22 2007,negative,loved it when i was 13 but nownot so much this movie has not aged well
Oct 22 2007,negative,as a fan of the older godzilla films this is a mockery to giant monster films a knock off of jurassic park and a special effect snorefest which makes cheap pot shots at siskel and ebert its a film with no substance no weight nothing to make it good the question is though how do you mess up a film about a monster destroying new york city it shouldnt have been so hard to mess this up but completely changing everything about godzilla which made it what it is well this movie should have never been associated with the original giant green nuclear lizard
Oct 22 2007,negative,its alive the incredible crap monster that is
Oct 22 2007,positive,enjoyed it despite it being slated
Oct 22 2007,positive,never get tired of it
Oct 22 2007,negative,broderick was okay his character kind of brought me back to ferris bueller  not what i expected godzilla to look like  was expecting more
Oct 22 2007,negative,how could you make a monstrosity bigger then the titular lead hire roland emmerich avoid and get the old toho classics
Oct 22 2007,positive,i actually quite like this never seen the original ones and this possibly shows how hollywood i am there is some cheesy dialogue and i think they get the scale wrong at some points but other than it its fairly enjoyable
Oct 22 2007,positive,totally 90s action movie goodness
Oct 22 2007,negative,this could easily been the best monster movie ever made i mean the effects of some things are so awesome and classic  but argg the main womans character is so hatable its unbelievable she breaks her friends trust she steals something from him she shouldnt and guess who should apologize he should wtf
Oct 22 2007,positive,i had to hide behind the couch the first time i watched this
Oct 21 2007,negative,too long  the godzillas kept coming back
Oct 21 2007,positive,this is a very underrated movie the effects are mindblowing for 1998 and the acting is fine a good action flick
Oct 21 2007,positive,i know people dont like this movie but i thought it was great xd 3
Oct 21 2007,negative,ugh all i can think of is matthew broderick saying thats a lot of fish and then i died on the inside
Oct 21 2007,positive,no 21 the best of all the monster films
Oct 21 2007,positive,one of the top 10 godzilla movies ever made
Oct 21 2007,negative,quite likely the worst monster movie made the movie focused too much on special effects the plot was horrible acting was bad and overall its very silly the jamiroquai song from the soundtrack is good though

Oct 20 2007,negative,matthew broderick actually runs worse than like a girl in fact i think he needs his own category so next time you seem someone run really poorly forgo the run like a girl and jump straight to you run like matthew broderick itll sting more

Oct 16 2007,negative,i love jean reno but even he cant save this from being more than anything pretty boring its one sin to be stupid its another to make the audience not care
Oct 16 2007,negative,try to make a franchise like godzilla into something thats actually serious and good and you end up with this mess  it was fine the way it was
Oct 16 2007,negative,matthew broderick sucks
Oct 16 2007,positive,its cool movie i think japanese godzilla is way better

Oct 11 2007,negative,oh man i saw this movie in theaters i got bored about half way through the movie and started counting product placement i was up to about 280 piece of unique product placement and thats only in like the last 60 of the movie if you count repeated product placement its up around 400
Oct 11 2007,positive,gojilass c mon im still waitin for the sequel
Oct 11 2007,positive,actually pretty good good effects story line and casting
Oct 11 2007,positive,im pretty sure there is not one single review for this film that is actually good  and you know what those people are dead wrong  this movie rocks  come on it has leon the professional in it  what else could you ask for  you know whats really good about roland emmerich films  there is absolutely no thinking involved d

Oct 11 2007,positive,urban renewal was invented in this movie
Oct 11 2007,negative,good lord i cant believe what a high score this film has got it was just plain awful a complete waste of what could of been a great monster movie

Oct 10 2007,positive,the french people in this movie are hilarious
Oct 10 2007,negative,jean reno was the only good thing
Oct 10 2007,positive,my favorite movie of all time seen it over 20 times
Oct 10 2007,negative,lets take this awesome old movie and remove all the good parts and replace them with mediocre special effects also lets turn the volume way up
Oct 10 2007,positive,pretty good movie  hank azaria is a great actor and hes in it so that makes it even better
Oct 10 2007,negative,broderick was just sooo wrong for this part plus godzilla looked all wrong gong
Oct 10 2007,positive,wasnt that good but its an american notaremake makeover of the japanese legend with many different ideas  i may get flamed for this but ive enjoyed this movie more than the original japanese flicks which could never hold my attention doesnt help theyre only broadcasted at 3 in the morning most of the time and outside of the really hit or miss read as brick and many airballs with one luck dunk contrived loved story it added a perfect realistic touch to the folk story and made it seem that much real  if a nuclearenhanced skyscapertall lizard entered any major city i expect this to be more true than what happened in all those beloved japanese flicks  forget the originals go in with an open mind and really youd maybe find yourself atleast not wanting to throw the cat  i thoroughly enjoyed it and puff daddys song rocked back when
Oct 10 2007,negative,to much people not enough godzilla
Oct 9 2007,negative,in between ferris buellers and the producers matthew brodericks blue period
Oct 9 2007,negative,why spend the money
Oct 9 2007,positive,i love this film it is bad but good because of it and why are so many of the actors who voice the simpsons in this film check the end credits if you dont recognise them
Oct 9 2007,neutral,saw it when it first came out and ive never wanted to look for it to watch again since
Oct 9 2007,negative,and that song by puff daddy was really really co
Oct 9 2007,negative,attack of the 50foot iquana
Oct 9 2007,negative,holy helli gave spiderman 3 a better rating than this  whats up with that
Oct 9 2007,negative,doesnt capture any of the good points from godzilla movies this film is lost in the era of big budget sillyness
Oct 9 2007,neutral,a little disappointing not terrible just could have been more fun
Oct 8 2007,neutral,anything for broderick
Oct 8 2007,neutral,not really my favorite i dont like such movies where there is absolutely no thinking involved and the storyline is as simple as hunting for an oversized lizard   the graphics are quite okay though as well as the music
Oct 8 2007,neutral,wow  americans sure know how to scrap a chinese classic
Oct 8 2007,neutral,i was gonna rate this movie horribly but once you get down to the nitty gritty this movie isnt terrible sure it runs incredibly longer than it has to and yes its not godzilla persay but the toys were kick ass
Oct 8 2007,negative,so godzilla is now the trex from jurassic park
Oct 8 2007,negative,why did they bother it wasnt even godzilla it was just a bigdinosaur
Oct 8 2007,negative,movie producers hey roland emmerich were remarking godzilla who do are you going to cast    emmerich i think matthew broderick would be a great hero you know that ferris buller kid hes such a rebel    movie producers but that was like 12 years ago you really think hed be a good action hero star    emmerich well ill just cast 2 of the voice actors from the simpsons to compensate    movie producers sounds like a hit
Oct 8 2007,negative,it didnt really phase me
Oct 8 2007,negative,crappy film with some nice effects
Oct 7 2007,positive,i liked the remake what can i say
Oct 7 2007,positive,classic sure its older and its godzilla but come onnn gotta love it
Oct 7 2007,neutral,grr they ruined godzilla
Oct 7 2007,negative,has cool monster scenes  cool action scenes and cool story  however the original japenese godzillas most definately surpass this movie
Oct 7 2007,positive,i prefer the japanese originals but jean renos character was a giggle
Oct 7 2007,negative,the only scary part was that they made this movie at all
Oct 7 2007,positive,its so sad that a movie that could have potentially been good was messed up with the poor script contrived love interest and unrealistic chemistry     in fact the only thing that saved  this movie for me was the one creature that wasnt even real the design is gorgeous and i totally believed him     favorite scenes  godzilla shots
Oct 7 2007,positive,gotta see godzilla screw up new york classic stuff
Oct 7 2007,negative,still cant figure out why the helicoptor couldnt just pull up
Oct 7 2007,negative,like the iguana sequences at the beginning
Oct 7 2007,negative,soincrediblybad
Oct 7 2007,positive,cool for its time
Oct 7 2007,negative,really bad avoid at all costs
Oct 7 2007,negative,jean reno saves the movie from total disaster to bad movie 
Oct 7 2007,negative,i first saw this film when on acid wasnt quite the asian version id been hoping for but non the less some good effects on a monster scale
Oct 7 2007,negative,theres a horrifying and painfully stupid moent in this movie when godzilla chases an army helicopter and destroys it  rather than the pilot flying up he flies in a srtaight line away from godzilla who then has troble keeping up with a taxi      the only reason ill rate this movie as i do is for the novelty value of singing the up for the deep 50 stories high  theme from the cartoon series when godzilla sinks the chinese boat      if you want a really good godzilla film i recommend godzilla final wars  it even has a scene where he gives a hiding to the one from this movie
Oct 7 2007,negative,they godzilla somehow
Oct 6 2007,negative,revisiting this i was perplexed in just howshitty the acting was  the creature himselfs fine but the humans are well unbearable
Oct 6 2007,negative,this is the worst godzilla movie ever not nearly wacky and unbelievable enough
Oct 6 2007,positive,it was supposed to be so good but it just lacked something maybe a script but effects made up for it
Oct 6 2007,negative,haha wow this was so fake
Oct 6 2007,negative,i recently rewatched this having loved it as a kid mostly because of the hype looking back its not really the redesigned monster that killed the movie it was the weak cliched script the poor production design on a location shoot in nyc even and the lame casting decisions matthew broderick is not an action hero not even cheesy enough to be funny
Oct 5 2007,negative,matthew broderick and a giant lizard what a wonderful combination
Oct 5 2007,negative,if you are tierd and hanging with your friends this is a good comedy otherwise skip this one
Oct 5 2007,negative,jean reno what the hell are you thinking
Oct 5 2007,positive,oh how underrated was this i loved it godzilla  guns rockets planes and tanksthe monster smack down that jurassic park never was shame it was aflop then no sequel
Oct 5 2007,positive,this movie gets me every time its funny it has a nice story and build up plus i keep my thumbs up for the monster all the way during the movie godzilla rocks never mind the human race    all in all the movie doesnt have the plot of the century but its tasteful its visuals are satisfying the story moves along in all the right ways and provides a laugh here and there bringing together characters who under pressure mix together quite well     definitely a good watch now and again
Oct 5 2007,negative,i hate godzilla to begin with this movie was absolutely terrible even worse the soundtrack ugh
Oct 5 2007,negative,what is the difference between this and a dead pile of fish about a hundred tons
Oct 5 2007,negative,ive seen better effects on a 1995 laptop screen crud tho not 100 unwatchable 9798 sure but that 2 sets it apart from moulin rouge
Oct 4 2007,negative,rage against the machine did a song on the soundtrack other than its got nothing
Oct 4 2007,positive,i dont know why but this was my favorite movie when i was younger so im sticking to my old self
Oct 4 2007,negative,preferred the original in japan
Oct 4 2007,positive,its kinda scarey but kool
Oct 4 2007,positive,i prefer my godzillias to be a little more i dunno a little more like a japanese guy in a rubber suit but this was okay i suppose
Oct 4 2007,negative,ferris bueller has a different day out
Oct 4 2007,positive,a big lizard attacks new york to rid the united states of assholes only to be twarted by ferris buehler
Oct 4 2007,negative,fun to watch and pick apart  but overall its pretty bad
Oct 3 2007,negative,jean reno is awesome but the movie is terrible
Oct 3 2007,positive,as shitty as this movie is it reminds me of good times in summer of 98
Oct 3 2007,positive,this movie is so bad its good
Oct 3 2007,positive,have itwhat a classic
Oct 3 2007,positive,it was an alright portrayal of a traditional story  entertaining and fun to watch
Oct 3 2007,positive,roland emmerich who directed the critically panned independence day tries his hand at an american entry to the muchloved japanese godzilla movies  and for the most part he succeeds in creating an enjoyable mindless action romp  the characters are somewhat interesting but not too compelling except for jean reno who is just awesome in the film but what emmerich is really interested in is showing our favorite monster destroying cities and decimating military advances  ill admit i had a good time while watching this movie and the action scenes were entertaining and the dialogue is often witty and clever  as for mr godzilla himself hes never looked so good
Oct 3 2007,positive,this is another movie that would be amazing if it was remade
Oct 3 2007,negative,could have been sooooo good insteadwell you saw it
Oct 3 2007,negative,what a piece of shit this was
Oct 3 2007,positive,its not good of course but its a silly fun monster movie
Oct 3 2007,negative,should be seen only as an ode to box office receipts and not the original masterpieces the hype surrounding its release was all that made it fun does not stand the test of time like the originals do
Oct 3 2007,positive,the french guy was cool all action styled
Oct 3 2007,negative,if you like the genre watch out for the multiple cliches
Oct 2 2007,positive,love them little zillas however i dont understand why there are stores open and people still in the city after the military are making the city in a warzone where the hell is the  evacuation and hysteria
Oct 2 2007,negative,what an empty movie
Oct 2 2007,positive,nothing spectacular but alright
Oct 2 2007,positive,an interesting take on this theme needs to be in a separate category from the other godzilla movies
Oct 2 2007,negative,what a pile  the damn dinosaur didnt even look rubbery
Oct 2 2007,neutral,i loved it when i was younger
Oct 2 2007,negative,not a bad monster movie but made to be way better than it was effects were good for 1995 but this was 1998
Oct 2 2007,neutral,i love this only person in the world i think but if only it wasnt mathew brodrick and the french dude who are the only thing wrong with it
Oct 2 2007,positive,why does jean reno always get type casted as some sort of policemilitary official
Oct 2 2007,negative,they fucking ruined it
Oct 2 2007,positive,damn good for its day
Oct 2 2007,negative,shocking remake give me a man in a rubber suit anyday
Oct 2 2007,negative,lied to by the trailer
Oct 1 2007,neutral,one of the only movies that broderick is in without singing
Oct 1 2007,negative,omg dumb  sadly this was the first movie i ever saw in la while here on vacation  i felt bad broderick was in something so stupid
Oct 1 2007,positive,awsome and very funny
Oct 1 2007,negative,whew what a bomb broderick in a bigbudget action film what
Oct 1 2007,negative,man what a terrible movie  i mean thats not to say that the toho godzillas are exactly masterpieces but at least some of them are enjoyable  this is just a soulless attempt by emmerichdevlin to recreate some of that independence day event movie heat  and they thought theyd bank this movie on matthew broderick and maria pitillo  its all been done before in either the japanese godzilla or jurassic park  the characters are poorly drawn the effects are really bad the humor falls flat and none of the action is exciting  theres no awe here just boredom and embarassment  plus this movie sort of led to puff daddy ruining a little piece of led zepplin for me  bravo godzilla
Oct 1 2007,negative,yeah this sucked pretty hard
Oct 1 2007,positive,an honest attempt but comes off lacking the creators just sacrificied too much of the original godzilla without making up for it with original stuff ultimately the film fails to stand on its own
Oct 1 2007,neutral,for its time this was a decent enough film  it runs a little long but i remember being thrilled with watching the taxi chase scene and watching the helicopters battle it out in nyc  the effects are slightly dated now but for the time they were awesome a decent enough summer blockbuster type film
Oct 1 2007,positive,jean reno kicked so much ass
Oct 1 2007,negative,this is not godzilla
Oct 1 2007,positive,great then terrible now
Oct 1 2007,negative,matthew brodericks finest role since ferris  not
Oct 1 2007,neutral,this was just a knockoff of jurassic park
Oct 1 2007,negative,i wish id never seen it i dont think anyone actually enjoyed this film
Oct 1 2007,negative,i was expecting way more in this movie
Oct 1 2007,positive,great monster movie even if a bit long
Oct 1 2007,negative,this movie wasnt as good as it could have been i dig monster movies
Oct 1 2007,negative,hardly a trace of irony or worse a hint of homage to the originals i dont know which is worse the movie or the pwhateverthefdiddy jimmy page single never mind i know which is worse
Oct 1 2007,neutral,cgi destruction good  story pbbbtt
Oct 1 2007,negative,broderick can do better than this
Oct 1 2007,negative,crap godzilla as expectant mother is a weak plot device to futher sequels and the love interest isnt believeable action weak as well but least the cgi doesnt disapoint
Oct 1 2007,negative,special effects couldnt save this one
Oct 1 2007,negative,not bad surprisingly
Sep 30 2007,negative,this was on tv about a week ago and i watched a few minutes and remembered how dumb it was one point for hank azaria
Sep 30 2007,neutral,the old cheesy japenese versions were better
Sep 30 2007,positive,i liked this alot freaking giant lizards excelent for what it was
Sep 30 2007,negative,an insult to the japanese films of old they try to americanize it too much and demonize godzilla not to mention the horrid acting

Sep 29 2007,positive,the characters are stupid in this godzilla is stupid in this and yet some how i cant help but give it points
Sep 29 2007,negative,painfully bad especially seeing it for the first time in the wake of cloverfield
Sep 29 2007,positive,everybody knows godzilla  was it a good movie  doesnt really matter
Sep 29 2007,positive,a modern take on a classic movie  while a bit cheesy at times it strives to keep itself internally serious
Sep 29 2007,negative,cute babys godzillas
Sep 29 2007,negative,jean reno is the only think mentionable of this lameass film
Sep 29 2007,negative,how bad can it be
Sep 29 2007,negative,good music but the rest was crap
Sep 28 2007,negative,not as good as jurassic park
Sep 28 2007,negative,vile if you love the original japanese movies youll hate it if you hate the original movies youll hate it if you have a functioning braincell in your head you will fucking hate it
Sep 28 2007,negative,it was pretty exciting
Sep 28 2007,positive,dreadful but somehow i liked it 
Sep 28 2007,positive,hehe so funny  but so sad that they had to kill him

Sep 27 2007,neutral,i remember erics birthday i saw this was ok
Sep 27 2007,negative,the original was better
Sep 27 2007,positive,good if youre up for a brainless action movie good soundtrack

Sep 27 2007,negative,its a bad sign when a guy in a rubber suit outclasses you
Sep 27 2007,positive,awesome film what better than a huge 100 story lizard to destroy things with
Sep 27 2007,positive,godzilla without the cheesy dubbingsubtitles is not the same
Sep 27 2007,negative,havent seen it in a longgggg time
Sep 27 2007,negative,pathetic american remake of a japanese classic watch gojira and try to tell me this is interesting at all

Sep 26 2007,negative,special effects were ok for the time  hank azaria is always great
Sep 26 2007,negative,silliness and fun but not much there for adults
Sep 26 2007,negative,i dont think there is an option to give a movie zero stars so i am begrudgingly giving it a half star
Sep 26 2007,negative,a better title would be king iguana bites the big apple
Sep 26 2007,negative,the movie was garbage way to ruin something awesome the only good part of this movie was the rage track no shelter
Sep 26 2007,positive,awesome movie but it wasnt godzilla they should change the title to giant lizard who fucks everything up

Sep 25 2007,negative,only a butcher could mess this up more
Sep 25 2007,negative,i think the fact that i remember nothing about this film except its soundtrack is a testament to the acting and filmmaking
Sep 25 2007,negative,hahaha what a joke a 14 year old boy could never stop godzilla
Sep 25 2007,negative,this is one of the most completely hateful movies of modern times the worst monster movie of recent times it is so insipid and so childlike it manages to put characters in a movie based on roger ebert and gene siskel who both ripped on roland emmerichs previous 2 films
Sep 25 2007,negative,embarrassingly bad godzilla somehow hiding in a city 20 helicopters charging down city streets babies that look like velociraptors but worse fx than jurassic park no tension and a tacked on unimagined ending
Sep 25 2007,positive,mathew brodrick fights radioactive lizards enough said
Sep 25 2007,negative,i saw this twice in theaterstwicewhat was i doing
Sep 25 2007,positive,is this the only movie besides the producers and ferris that matthew broderick has been in probably not but its the only one i can remember and it wasnt that good

Sep 25 2007,positive,my fav flick as a kid
Sep 25 2007,negative,the soundtrack was better than the movie
Sep 25 2007,neutral,wasnt very good in the end it was basically something developed for kids really  basically hollywood again copying films off other countries and praying to pull it off which usually fails    i am yet to see the old japanese version which i was told would be millions of times better
Sep 25 2007,positive,yes i know it was a major dissapointment yes it was an embarassment to all godzilla movies  oh well
Sep 25 2007,neutral,it all went south when they brought in the baby godzillas
Sep 24 2007,positive,godzilla is so amazing he is the best mutant ever
Sep 24 2007,negative,pure crap  ugh  by halfway through we were rooting for the little godzillas to eat all the main characters  im not kidding
Sep 24 2007,negative,i grew up on the old godzilla movies  this one doesnt comparehowever i love the soundtrack
Sep 24 2007,negative,matthew broderick staring in an action movie is a bad start they made hank azaria annoying which is had to do it could have and should have been better

Sep 24 2007,negative,im a godzilla fan  im supposed to hate this movie with the rest of them  well i have no problem doing that    gets a full star because they tried to change up the look of mr zilla  even though they failed miserably i appreciate the effort of trying to make it your own
Sep 23 2007,positive,the ratm song in this is worth the film and bumbling matthew broderick
Sep 23 2007,negative,matthew broderick should be castrated and then shot just to be sure also the science of this film entirely precludes the fact that godzhira is an embodiment of the lost souls of hiroshima and nagasaki enacting their revenge on the lax and hedonistic technological future of japan
Sep 23 2007,negative,the only good thing was the jamiroquai song in the soundtrack
Sep 23 2007,positive,i love this movie full of action mathew broderick was perfect for the job

Sep 23 2007,positive,i liked it  screw everyone else
Sep 23 2007,negative,is this the worst movie of all time well its pretty darn close i cant think of one positive thing to say about this movie except jean reno was kinda cool and deserved a much better film godzillas powers and size were extremely inconsistent and the cgi was godawful to call the characters sketched in would be a complement beyond my abilities just a ridiculous piece of shit at least its funny to give the mst3k treatment to ill give it that  
Sep 23 2007,positive,kinda made this one cheesy
Sep 22 2007,negative,compared to the original godzilla films this is about as good as a snow blower running over old yeller

Sep 22 2007,negative,baby godzillas were jurassic park rip offs raptors godzilla didnt spew radioactive breath no giant monster fights no man in a rubber suit but i was a kid and still enjoyed seeing a giant lizard destroy new york
Sep 22 2007,positive,sucked so bad that it was awesome
Sep 21 2007,positive,i know this a bad movie but it was a fun bad movie i would call it the definition of a guilty pleasure it was way too long probably at least 2530 minutes but i still had a good time besides the dialogue and acting i had very few problems with the movie it is exactly the type of movie you would expect from roland emmerich cheesy but fun  3 12 stars or 710

Sep 21 2007,negative,this is not godzillathis is a cg fake
Sep 21 2007,negative,good remake but like most of these movies there is a lot spent on special effects but not too much on plot development
Sep 21 2007,negative,fuck every other way to critique this movie the only thing that made it unforgivable was turning ferris buller into a nerd i would have put up with godzilla having pauly shore as a head if they had decided to save ferris but they didnt so fuckem
Sep 21 2007,negative,could have been better

Sep 21 2007,negative,they have the damn nerve to call this atrocious film a movie about godzilla gah have to give it half a star wish i could have a zero option
Sep 21 2007,negative,everyone was all excited about what godzillas face would look like  turned out to be a big lizard face
Sep 21 2007,negative,not cooler than the japanese handmade costume godzilla where you can even see the zippers and allnow thats cool    this is like the aliens for babies to watch
Sep 20 2007,positive,only because i loved godzilla growing up as a kid as well as king kong this movie might not be the greatest thing made but i enjoyed it
Sep 20 2007,negative,this was not godzilla it was giant lizard monster attacks ny  if you dont understand the difference dont ever speak to me

Sep 20 2007,positive,this is a popcorn movie get over it how matthew broderick got sucked into this i dont know in this kind of film its not really about the plot or acting its about what you can do to new york city with a 300 ft lizard and 100 million dollars
Sep 20 2007,positive,i thought this movie was messed up
Sep 19 2007,neutral,the americans took the god out of godzilla

Sep 19 2007,negative,kinda awful matthew broderick should quit acting and only do broadway unless its  ferris bueller 2 the retirement years
Sep 19 2007,negative,i saw this on opening night and it was clear that the audience was not impressed however this was a lively audience and it made the whole expierence worth it    example when mathew broderick is walking amongst all of the giant eggs someone in the audience yelled out look out rippley pure comic genius

Sep 18 2007,negative,holy fuck this was painful
Sep 18 2007,negative,this bastardised version of godzilla doesnt hold a candle to the original  and doesnt in the latest godzilla film to come out of japan either this version called simply zilla because hes hardly godlike lasts only 5 mins against the big man himself
Sep 17 2007,negative,uhg i watched this in the theater and we just talked through it
Sep 17 2007,positive,i enjoyed this remake when it first came out  fun movie and jean reno is le awesome
Sep 17 2007,negative,amazingly bad even though i love jean reno
Sep 17 2007,neutral,unlike independence day which had you wondering gleefully how an abudget could produce a bmovie this movie will bore you and wonder how the hell it even got made at all never in my life have exploding buildings and people getting squished been so boring this movie made me hate matthew broderick and its basically a waste of your time king kong pulled off the whole monster movie remake thing a lot better

Sep 17 2007,positive,hahah at least it was fun
Sep 16 2007,negative,my bro and i used to watch old godzilla movies with our dad we both saw this with our dad this movie sucked six missles and godzilla dies what the eff plus he doesnt breath radioactive fire and hes asexual which means hes also a mom come on
Sep 16 2007,neutral,the plot could have been way better
Sep 16 2007,neutral,this movie was interesting but seriously did the mother really need to die just because she was trying to raise her babies she did nothing wrong to warrent such behavior from the crazy people what is the deal here

Sep 15 2007,neutral,great when you just want to let your brain fry
Sep 15 2007,negative,i havent seen it since i saw it in theaters but from what i remember the cast is pretty good and they do what they can with the material there is no reason to make a godzilla movie these days especially one that takes itself so seriously have fun with the material guys also it rips off jurassic park and leaves itself open for a sequel that thankfully never happened
Sep 15 2007,negative,i remeber seeing it but didnt have much of an impact

Sep 13 2007,negative,maybe the worst movie ive ever seen
Sep 13 2007,negative,sooooooo bad  have you heard the green day song brain stew with the godzilla remix  yeah this movie is even more ridiculous than that
Sep 13 2007,positive,i really liked this film i still hadnt forgiven director roland emmerich for the travesty that was independence day but this went some way to ease the pain   the effects are already looking a bit rough around the edges but its still a good romp okay i concede theres not much to it but hey its a creature feature surely ang lees hulk proved that monsters and character development mix like oil and water
Sep 13 2007,negative,its not a good movie if you feel badly for godzilla dying at the end
Sep 13 2007,negative,a couple somewhat decent action scenes are the only things that are at all notable in this mess of a movie characters and story are completely idiotic and there is basically no reason to care about anything the best scenes are basically ripped right out of better movies like jurassic park
Sep 13 2007,negative,talk about ruining godzilla

Sep 12 2007,positive,i like this version i really do i like matthew broderick and i love jean reno and hank azaria  hes great comedy relief its somehow serious  unlike today watching the old japanese godzillas who we would just laugh at because were too busy staring at the effects um godzilla acrually has character in this movie there is the plot aspect of it which is a little too extreme things dont mutate that fast people truly they dont but i felt really bad and sorry for godzilla and i thought he had a kick ass design and i loved the action during the part in madison square garden and i liked doug savant as sargeant oneal
Sep 12 2007,negative,terrible merchandising campaign

Sep 11 2007,positive,a great new twist to an awesome classic
Sep 11 2007,negative,has matthew brodericks most zany antics since ferris beuler
Sep 11 2007,negative,couldve been so much better if godzilla was actually in it for more than 5 minutes and not just an angry mother trying to protect her babies
Sep 11 2007,negative,who let americans make a godzilla movie and starring matthew broderick this is what happens when you take a sweet japanese and distinctively japanese idea mind youwe have not experienced hiroshimanagasaki on these shores and americanize it feces
Sep 11 2007,positive,actually better than i thought it would be
Sep 11 2007,negative,deserves nothing short of movie crucifixion even ryuheis try at it was more respectable and that didnt even have jean reno
Sep 11 2007,negative,worst adaptation of antony and cleopatra ive ever seen

Sep 9 2007,negative,it was quite the stinkin cheesefest
Sep 9 2007,positive,fastpaced giantmonster movie where new york gets leveled pretty much has very little in common with the original godzilla so as long as you just forget about the name you should enjoy it however there are some moments of cheesiness and horrible dialouge that not even the best of actors could save but overall it was a pretty entertaining movie too bad they never went ahead with the sequel and instead put out that crappy cartoon series in place of it
Sep 9 2007,negative,why do we have to remake things so much worse than they were to begin with
Sep 9 2007,positive,seen it its pretty good
Sep 9 2007,neutral,i went to sleep halfway through it
Sep 9 2007,negative,the only movie ive gone to the premiere of and fallen asleep twice during
Sep 9 2007,negative,this movie just sucks   the graphics obviously trying to build off jurassic park just suck the character story works off of strange coincidences and poor dialogue  and i still dont understand why the french were involved and what they were trying to hide even though they knew as much as the americans
Sep 9 2007,negative,horrible movie roland emmerich should stay away from filmmaking permanently
Sep 9 2007,positive,i dont like broderick but the movie altogether was cool
Sep 9 2007,positive,big dumb fun not the epic it wanted to be but its damn entertaining and some of the effects are great i love seeing godzilla slip over in the final chase
Sep 9 2007,negative,granted it was at least better than all of the japanese godzilla sequals to the originalbut why americanize this to begin with thumbs down
Sep 9 2007,positive,entertaining but campy this is fun like the old batman tv show there are too many cast members of the simpsons involved not to be rediculous

Sep 8 2007,negative,as a genuine fan of kaiju movies this was an all around piece of shit not only was the movie a piece of shit undeserving of the title godzilla but it also gave us kashmir lovingly remade by papa diddy puff boy wasnt that a hoot

Sep 2 2007,neutral,at first i was excited the movie kept me on the edge of my seat yet they tarnished the name of godzilla with this movie it was good for a refreshing kick to bring godzilla back but this movie was still a total insult to godzilla the other fact is that it wasnt even godzilla in the movie it was zilla or gino whichever one you like

Sep 1 2007,negative,i dont like one single thing about this movie anymore the shots are nonsensical and confusing the characters are stupid and dominate the plot the special effects pale in comparison to those in jurassic park which was made 7 years earlier the movies over two hours long which is way too long for this kind of movie godzilla fluctuates in size it focuses on the army which i think were all sick of in movies at this point it continually feeds its three totally unfunny running gags one being that nobody can pronounce the main characters name one being that the french guy hates american coffee and the last being that the mayor of new york city and his assistant are roger ebert and gene siskel and it insults the viewers intelligence over and over again with shockingly flawed physics and absolutely ludicrous plans that all somehow work terrible its a shame that my job at quiptrackscom forced me to watch it about 14 times

Aug 31 2007,negative,2 stars for the awesome promotion taco bell did for this movie maybe my memory is flawed but didnt they introduce the gordita for that exact purpose i know they didnt invent the term gordita but it was introduced either as part of the godzilla promotion or as a new and sexy item within  2 months of the godzilla promotion
Aug 31 2007,negative,these stars are sympathies for reno and azaria
Aug 31 2007,neutral,i remember this not being too bad but being excited that matt broderick name in the movie was nick i was a child and easily amused

Aug 31 2007,negative,if youre a fan of the toho godzilla films you probably wont like this  if youre a fan of noncheesy noncampy movies you probably wont like it either  it has its moments and the special effects arent bad but overall its just a runofthemill scifiaction flick

Aug 31 2007,positive,french ninja people  and jean reno
Aug 31 2007,neutral,not too bad but gets too long towards the end
Aug 31 2007,positive, an expertly designed theme park ride of a movie that packs nonstop thrills the plot is about as ridiculous as youd expect but for the most part its absurdities are tolerable there are some clever and exciting sequences but this 120 million epic of reconstituted atomic age trash lumbers more than it thrills it probably would have benefited from a 20 to 30minute trim and certainly a smarter script but the special effects truly are amazing the movie is of minimum interest the story of the movie however  or rather of the way in which it has been engulfed by its own publicity  is bound to fascinate connoisseurs of cultural meltdown      verdict matinée  mixed reaction these kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things but some bad things kept it from being amazing this rating says to pay matinée prices to see at a theater or buy an ex rental or a cheap price the dvd to own
Aug 31 2007,positive,i didnt expect much and actually got a little more than i asked for while i thought broderick would be a bit annoying in this movie i actually thought hehis character made me more interested in the movie it was his ex gf that really annoyed me every scene she was in was a pain to watch the movie however is exactly a godzilla movie so there werent any surprises i did feel sorry for it though   must be all those animal planet shows ive been watching recently 
Aug 30 2007,positive,i really liked this movie i was one of the only ones

Aug 30 2007,negative,roland emmerich does it again dreadful and blatantly disrespectful to both the french and the japanese take away emmerichs big budget and theres not much to write home about size doesnt matter
Aug 30 2007,neutral,a godzilla movieand never does it promise to be anything more for that reason the movie succeeds but in what the marketing promised it fails it is not a big movie nor is it a deep one its a shallow monster movie with effects that in 1998 seemed kind of stateoftheart but now seem tired and old the acting is sometimes decent except for jean reno who does pretty well but most of the time is very wooden and boring if youre into godzilla dont see it if youre looking for a good movie overall dont see it if youre looking for a waste of two hours see it
Aug 30 2007,negative,absolutely barbaric shameless ripoff
Aug 30 2007,positive,yay godzilla he likes to smash

Aug 28 2007,neutral,its not a proper godzilla film
Aug 28 2007,negative,i think roland emmerich should just put on puppet shows of the movies he likes in his basement or something instead of bothering the rest of us with his pathetic apeing of far superior fare  he says he likes to make the movies he would go and see on a friday night but i think hes really just remaking the movies that he did go and see on a friday night  hack  dork  child
Aug 28 2007,neutral,dont you understand the audience wanted to root for the big g not against him  hes the hero and this film cast him as the villain thereby sealing it fate

Aug 26 2007,negative,big stupid blockbuster all special effects and no charm
Aug 25 2007,positive,at the time this was the event movie  as a kid i absolutely loved it  did i notice it had serious story flaws and questionable acting  no i was a kid   subconsciously i recognized there was something lacking in the movie but when youre a kid you love seeing this monster terrorizing your city and all the craziness that happens within    i had seen the original godzillas before this movie so i knew it was different but it was fun  it was wacky  matthew broderick was a poor casting choice and so was jean reno  but i probably blame the story the most  here we are focused on a stupid romance between broderick and pitillo while a freaking nuclearaffected dinosaur is stomping your home  the military and science angle was slightly boring too  the action scenes were clever and for the most part it was fun to see the military fight the monster  but when the babies were introduced as a conflict and then became a survival movie it became freaking jurassic park  a monster feature it was no more    i look forward to the remake and new design of godzilla
Aug 25 2007,negative,i just wanted to see a big lizard smash stuff and they messed that up
Aug 25 2007,neutral,i didnt want to but i liked it

Aug 23 2007,negative,the best part of this movie was when taco bell spoofed it in a commercial
Aug 22 2007,negative,another dull blockbuster who cares about a giant lizard
Aug 22 2007,neutral,this movies biggest problem is its title  despite being entitled godzilla this is not a godzilla movie and the monster in this movie bears little resemblance to the japanese monster in either look or behavior the creature effects are really good for the time but most of the human characters are bland and the movie is overly lengthy spending too much time with a bland forgettable and sometimes unlikeable cast  while not a real godzilla movie its still occasionally fun to watch when the monster is reeking havoc but it was not the movie we should have gotten
Aug 22 2007,positive,if you dont love giant lizards as much as i do this movie sucked p
Aug 22 2007,positive,this movie is tight yall haha

Aug 21 2007,neutral,one godawful godzilla movie but a fairly decent monster movie if you can ignore the fact that this is supposed to be godzilla that is     this is really more a remake of beast from 20000 fathoms than anything else and warner bros should sue
Aug 21 2007,positive,the only thing that i truely loved from this movie was the soundtrack lol

Aug 20 2007,negative,the original japanese version was better even though it is a lot older
Aug 20 2007,negative,a movie thats filled with godzilla sized plot holes and sheer stupidity its exactly waht youd expect from a roland emmerich film i didnt think it was that easy to screw up a godzilla film though there is some guilty pleasure to come form watching it
Aug 20 2007,neutral,the movie just collapsed under the tremendous hype still on its own its a decent monster movie just dont call it godzilla

Aug 20 2007,negative,with some very good special effects and action scenes this is another disaster film from roland emmerich thats well presented but lacks good actors and proper storyline maybe will smith would have saved it like he did with independence day before it but as it is matthew broderick is a poor substitute

Aug 18 2007,negative,overblown monster mash recycles the godzilla name while pissing on its legacy substituting a feeble lizardthing for the king of the monsters in this soggy retread of the beast from 20000 fathoms an embarassment for all concerned

Aug 18 2007,negative,not sure what i felt about some of the redesigns of the creatures defintely cashing in on the popularity of jurassic park a couple of years earlier and all of the big product placement ie within madison square gardens was very distracting and off putting was a bloated mess for the visuals with extremely cheesy dialogue that was unfortunately scripted

Aug 16 2007,neutral,japanese are the best at it

Aug 14 2007,positive,i like american godzilla  as if there was any question whether or not ours was better than those commies
Aug 14 2007,positive,a giant dino destroys new york and the military must kill it good film with good scenes but japanese godzilla fans dont like it a favorite film of mine

Aug 13 2007,negative,a bit of a jurassic park ripoff plot line

Aug 12 2007,positive,my favorite thing about this movie is the giant hole godzilla left in the office building where i used to work
Aug 12 2007,negative,this is a disgrace to the original godzilla
Aug 12 2007,positive,i remeber as a young lad i always saw the godzilla cartoons where they would be on a boat and push a switch to make him come and fight for them this movie is nothing like that or anything like the very original godzilla movies i just didnt like how it was a godzilla verse humanity thing
Aug 12 2007,negative,event pick that forgets to be entertaining rather than just dumb improves with second viewing but only just
Aug 12 2007,neutral,i like the old godzilla movies
Aug 12 2007,neutral,this was worth seeing once and even then its not great the effects are well done but broderick seems out of place

Aug 12 2007,positive,really cool movie i watched a while ago

Aug 12 2007,positive,i really enjoy this movie and ithink it is an excellent example of a creature feature  if you ignore the cost of the movie everything fits a cast with no major star effects which at times arnt amazing a humourous script  hugly underated for what it is it is cheese and workswell with it
Aug 12 2007,positive,i loved this movie when i was little it scared me origianlly lol
Aug 11 2007,positive,i dont get the godzilla cool factor

Aug 11 2007,neutral,i know everyone hated this but heaven help me i enjoyed it could it be due to my affection for matthew broderick
Aug 11 2007,neutral,watch godzilla destroy all monsters crappy american godzilla has a scene in which he gets killed by the real godzilla
Aug 11 2007,positive,despite horrible animation and a cheesey love story of a plot this movie wasnt half bad especially considering the fact that it was made in 1998 id say the cgi wasnt all that bad it has a bit of re watchability and it is no doubt a classical remake but i wouldnt be surprised if within the next 20 years we saw this movie remade with even better cgi and a more explosive plot
Aug 11 2007,positive,im a fan of godzilla movies the older ones seem silly but just consider the times
Aug 11 2007,neutral,the problem with this movie isnt necessarily with its redesign of the classic monster but its script and cast just flat kinda cool but kinda crappy too i look forward to a more serious remake ala king kong
Aug 11 2007,positive,big action maybe not good action but big action
Aug 10 2007,negative,haha matthew broderick

Aug 10 2007,negative,lame they made godzilla a girl not to mention godzilla isnt suppose to be serious

Aug 10 2007,negative,blockbuster pop and blockbuster fizzle
Aug 10 2007,positive,i loved this movie but i was also a huge fan of godzilla when i was a kid so its hit or miss for some people
Aug 10 2007,negative,wheres the flame breath
Aug 10 2007,negative,boy did i want this to be good  im a godzilla fan from watching them as a kid and the cast especially reno and azaria has so much going for it  except a script  caught in yet another of emmerichs formulaic disaster films this godzilla loses not only its maninsuitness but even a hint of the cheesy but earnest flavor of the original  it gets two stars because removing my disappointment leaves an almost passable explosion filled fx flick that might get someone through a sleepless night
Aug 10 2007,positive,sick movie seen it a million times always good
Aug 10 2007,positive,very stupid movie but i had so much fun yelling at matthew broderick the first time i saw it at a friends house that i still think its fun but only when you actually yell at it think mst3k for that this movie is excellent

Aug 9 2007,negative,jean reno is the master
Aug 9 2007,neutral,some great effects and fun tongue and cheek dialogue but seriously why must they ruin the iconic image of godzilla and put him in new york matthew broderick and hank azaria

Aug 8 2007,negative,they blew it utterly fucking pointless go back to any one of the toho originals and have 100000 times more fun
Aug 8 2007,positive,i watched this on christmas of that year with my brother and our best friend at the time the acting was okay and the plot shallow  nostalgia points are rocketing this baby to three stars honestly

Aug 7 2007,positive,although the original godzilla will always be the best our american version of him wasnt so bad though
Aug 7 2007,positive,yeah matthew broderick
Aug 6 2007,neutral,i am curious why japan decided they wanted to go back to making those corny movies after this one was made  dont get me wrong this movie was a disappointment but it was much better than watching a man in a godzilla suit rampage a city or try to kick the ass of another man in an equally dorky suit
Aug 6 2007,positive,fun but not worth it for fans of the japanese films
Aug 6 2007,negative,i was disappointed i think i was expecting something more like jurassic park maybe

Aug 6 2007,positive,the best ole gojira has ever looked and it didnt hurt that matthew broderick and hank azaria were hilarious
Aug 6 2007,positive,ill confess i have been a godzilla freak since i was in preschool but compared to some of the older godzilla movies this one is really really good  even though it is a bit tedious and the acting isnt very good a la mathew broderick good movie
Aug 6 2007,neutral,one of the first times that i experienced the effect of hype and not living up to it

Aug 6 2007,positive,oh this is one of my favorites i always did love giant mutated lizard freaks
Aug 6 2007,positive,decent movie has some slow parts but it gets better as it goes on brodericks acting flys in feris buellers day off because it works with his character but this movie makes me wonder how he keeps getting work
Aug 6 2007,negative,wow and its not a good wow either
Aug 6 2007,negative,oh mathew broderick why cant you make money an honest way prostitution is for the weak
Aug 6 2007,positive,this song has the kashmir remix by puff daddy or whatever the fuck his name used to be

Aug 6 2007,positive,what did you see old man godzilla godzilla love it

Aug 5 2007,negative,ughright from the beginning i knew this film was going to suck they didnt put out any excitement until the last 45 minutes in the 2 12 hour borefest not to mention they pull some of the worst special effects and the cast decided to mail it in and cared more about cashing their paychecks the action sequences are lame and the dialogue is a joke somebody please knock this movie to the late night saturday movie its where this cheesy monster belongs

Aug 5 2007,positive,the old ones with people in rubber suits was better than this
Aug 5 2007,negative,this was 5 years after jurassic park and yet the computer effects are somehow a step backwards  also the plot and characters are laughable  although that might be the point given the casting
Aug 5 2007,negative,not nearly as good as the japanese version of godzilla
Aug 5 2007,negative,its probably bad that i remember a song from the credits more than the film itself right

Aug 4 2007,neutral,no its not japanese godzilla so of course its not gonna be a great movie  however it is good to watch if you are really bored and there is nothing else on tv
Aug 4 2007,neutral,theres too much panic in this town im going deeper underground d
Aug 4 2007,negative,this is a piece of crap that does not deserve to call itself a godzilla movie  this is the shitty way hollywood tries to capitalize on a great franchise like godzilla  who cares if the special effects look good the fact that the others arent good adds to that great godzilla movie feel  this movie lost touch with it and tried to hard and failed miserably
Aug 4 2007,negative,i liked it when i was little

Aug 1 2007,neutral,ooo it was interesting

Aug 1 2007,negative,matthew broderick stop this nonsense
Aug 1 2007,negative,jean reno is a bit of a badass
Aug 1 2007,negative,an absolute disaster that unleashes as many cliches as possible in the audience hoping something sticks this is indicative of how misguided filmmakers became in the 90s if it wasnt for the insane success of independence day its our fault really emmerich would have never been allowed to make this it also doesnt matter if the special effects are ever any good they actually are everything is set at night a sign that the special effects arent flawless we at least got to see some of the dinosaurs in jurassic park in daylight and just about none of this movies problems would be corrected if this were titled something else this is a movie of pure hatred
Aug 1 2007,positive,godzilla is the bomb so under rated even matthew broderick is watchable in this movie

Jul 31 2007,positive,pretty good and funny

Jul 31 2007,positive,not as cheese as the originals which hurt it
Jul 31 2007,negative,they took all the fun out of the movie all the personality out of the creture godzilla and tried to make it into a jurassic park on steroids  sad

Jul 31 2007,positive,not as amazing as the japanesse godzilla but the work was still topnotch
Jul 31 2007,negative,bstards how can you throw hundres of millions of dollars at something as good as gojira and rse it up to this extreme plus matthew broderick is really annoying in it
Jul 31 2007,positive,i like this move but many were upset the lizard wasnt a monster  some tense moments where i wanted to take matthew and dangle him over a shark pit  that is fear and acting bud  it was a summer blockbuster that came too that day
Jul 30 2007,negative,godzilla what have they done to you you are a giant iguana
Jul 30 2007,negative,the first time i was bored in a movie theater ever was when i was watching this movie

Jul 30 2007,positive,a cool monster movie there i said it
Jul 30 2007,neutral,could have been better but worth the watch
Jul 30 2007,negative,a remake in which one of the main concepts is that godzilla goes into a city and the army who are usually getting the st kicked out of them cant find him  in one scene godzilla runs yes runs past one building and a chap inside misses him and then looks around saying what was that  while slavishly copying the original isnt a good thing the makers of this one should at least have looked at one or flicked through a few manga  godzilla walks into tokyo and kicks it to bits along with other baddies them walks home  what didnt they get about that
Jul 30 2007,negative,matthew matthew matthew 
Jul 30 2007,positive,need i say more

Jul 29 2007,positive,it was cool when i was like 8

Jul 29 2007,negative,another w t f moment in american cinema
Jul 29 2007,positive,crappy as a godzilla movie but i liked it as a standalone monster movie
Jul 29 2007,positive,even though it was horrible with the inconsistant size of the monster and just bad story line  it was still head and shoulders above any of the old godzilla movies

Jul 29 2007,negative,a flaming ball of crap just shows what garbage the film making machine called hollywood can spew out some times
Jul 29 2007,negative,when this first came out it was one of the best action films ever now that is in question after rewatching this recently i realized just how awful this one is aside from the awesome soundtrack it really is pathetic and pales in comparison to todays special effects which is assumed but still  come on  its hard to believe that what is in this movie is groundbreaking this is one that will easily be forgotten and will not stand the test of time  doesnt stop me from enjoying it it is a good laugh and somewhat entertaining though long
Jul 29 2007,positive,i love huge mutated creatures that destry shit
Jul 29 2007,negative,great effects but dumb story and bad actors

Jul 28 2007,positive,ah the modern day godzilla there is something sad and nostalgic as i watch this movie and realize all of their lip moves are matching up with their words its what made its perdecassors so great but this was a fairly entertaining movie godzilla looked fantastic and it was amusingly action packed not something that takes itself too seriously it was a good movie
Jul 28 2007,neutral,i remember seeing this with my dad in theaters

Jul 25 2007,positive,an update that was good in some ways  at the same time rubbed the wrong waythe wallflowers hit gold with the bowie cover heroes off of this flick
Jul 25 2007,positive,it didnt breath fire fuck that shit
Jul 25 2007,negative,blue oyster cultgo go godzilla in this caseno no godzilla
Jul 25 2007,neutral,as a hardcore godzilla fan i felt obligated to see this movie  i actually enjoyed it as a monster movie but its not quite the godzilla i grew up with  the miniature effects and cgi are awesome and blew the japanese version into oblivion the new character design also affected future generations of tohos rubber suit designs to come
Jul 25 2007,negative,well just a clash of mediocre special effects and just boringness not sure if boringness is a word but you get the point im sure
Jul 25 2007,negative,all the bloat of a michael bay movie with none of the style
Jul 25 2007,positive,i liked ity not sure possible just pining for a jurassic park installment at the time

Jul 25 2007,positive,i quite enjoyed this stupid ending though
Jul 25 2007,positive,i thought this was really good when i was 13 years later i would find out that the mayor of new york and his assistant were  supposed to represent siskel  ebert because they had given the writers last movie thumbs down jean reno was good in this and matthew broderick is always a pleasure probably cause he doesnt do that much acting anymore my favorite part is when godzilla is chasing those helicopters through a destroyed manhattan
Jul 25 2007,positive,earns points for being simultaneously lush to look at and damned preposterous regretfully the leads are all turd apart from jean reno and hank azaria and everyone suffers accordingly people say the nonsensicality of this curiosity weighs it down  i say its the deplorable human element what a bunch of nogood selfinvolved saps zilla should have eat the lot
Jul 25 2007,negative,i saw this movie on the airplane and i swear jumping out was a viable alternative  the little size does matter tagline on the box cover is the best part of the movie  im not kidding
Jul 24 2007,positive,i saw it then it blew my mind i saw it again and relized it was kinda crappy
Jul 24 2007,positive,history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men  godzilla
Jul 24 2007,positive,as a remake its terrible as a normal huge monster breaks a lot of stuff how the heck do we stop it movie its good
Jul 24 2007,positive,i thought it was an okay film not as bad as everyone said roland emmerich is known for his huge scale films such as independence day and the day after tomorrow so this film keeps with his reputation not the best cast but action packed for sure gotta love ny being destroyed
Jul 24 2007,positive,actually a movie i liked when it came out now that i have common sense i would probably hate it but whatever
Jul 24 2007,negative,more like crapzilla i enjoyed the cheesy old overdubbed original japanese godzilla movies
Jul 24 2007,positive,i loved it the first time i saw it
Jul 24 2007,positive,you know it was actually pretty good the whole giant creature thing didnt make it seem really cheesy or anything
Jul 24 2007,negative,pile of shit the worst part was when my mate chris got in for free and i had to pay and waste over 2 hours of my life message to the guy on the door you are an absolute cunt   you know who you are
Jul 24 2007,negative,the most notable thing about this film is that footage was reused for a doritos commercial
Jul 24 2007,negative,i really wish those bastards were not let anywhere near godzilla my hatred has just deepened immensely for the filmmakers
Jul 24 2007,positive,its really awesome during some parts and really dumb in others overall i liked it but not enough to pay more than a bargain bin price for it at walmart
Jul 24 2007,negative,good attempt im still fond of the original cheesiness
Jul 24 2007,negative,stupid movie  visually it is fun to look at and it even sports a couple of solid actors hank azaria and harry shearer  was it a simpsons reunion film but it is certainly a letdown as a film
Jul 24 2007,positive,i liked iti know it was terriblebut i liked it
Jul 24 2007,negative,wow as disappointed as nacho libre
Jul 24 2007,positive,for me it never will fun to watch when there is too many of themlike the japanese version is sometime better got one big godzilla onlyno need to think too much p

Jul 24 2007,positive,a good english version
Jul 24 2007,neutral,i was forced to watcheed this by mitchell and peter my cousins
Jul 24 2007,negative,haha where is the man in the green suit stomping over a mini version of japan while fighting things suspended from the ceiling by wires that you can see that is what godzilla is all about this doesnt quite cut it
Jul 24 2007,negative,i saw this movie at the cinema  with my good friend liz lewis  during the scene when godzillas babies were all running around running the standard big budget monster action amock she leaned over to me and said i loved this movie when it was called jurassic park      yeahso did i    this film signalled the dawning of a new age of really expensive really nicely done special effects that no longer had any power to impress moviegoers anymore      it also signalled the death of the artist formerly known as ferris buellers charm
Jul 24 2007,positive,i remeber i was mad on this film when i was a kid i watched it every day
Jul 24 2007,positive,guilty pleasure this film is just two and a half hours of utter nonsense and sometimes thats exactly what is needed if you see this film for what it is trying to be innocent entertainment then i dont really see how it can be as bad as people claim twas silly fun
Jul 24 2007,positive,i saw godzilla at the movie theater it is one of my all time favorites the ad campaign was awesome as well

Jul 23 2007,negative,godzilla was much worse than it should have been  the cgi wasnt great and neither was the plot or acting  godzilla would have been better if godzilla actually battled someone but instead this was just a bad remake of king kong
Jul 23 2007,negative,nice soundtrack at least
Jul 23 2007,negative,i was so pumped to see this and was so disappointed when i did see it i was twelve i liked just about everything when i was twelve yeah this is a bad movie
Jul 23 2007,negative,good idea terrible exection
Jul 23 2007,positive,coolest movie ever as far as visuals go the american godzilla is a much better monster unfortunately the plot and acting in this movie sucked majorly zilla as they call him was not given justice
Jul 23 2007,positive,japans best creation everyone should see any godzilla movie
Jul 23 2007,negative,i blame mathew broderick for this movies failure  it sucks and now because of him so does godzilla
Jul 23 2007,negative,you know godzilla is a recognizable film characterand to have his image changed just didnt do it for me
Jul 23 2007,negative,this much cheese should come with chips and salsa
Jul 23 2007,positive,the action was great except for the cruddy effects on the baby godzilla things  and matthew broderick doesnt look like much of a hero  the movie dragged on a bit too  i still enjoyed it though because it doesnt end when you expect it to
Jul 23 2007,positive,ok i know its awful beyond horrible but really make your mind think inversely and this movie is amazing
Jul 23 2007,neutral,source material  a man in a rubber suit stomping on cardboard models  result comparable
Jul 23 2007,neutral,i used to think that this was the single greatest thing ever committed to film  not so much now
Jul 23 2007,positive,not that bad i think i appreciated it more when i was a kid
Jul 23 2007,negative,i love hank azaria but this movie is totally useless
Jul 23 2007,negative,sucked maybe that new jj abrams movie that might be about godzilla wont suck
Jul 23 2007,negative,sorry yet more evidence to show that the original japanese version cannot be topped or replaced
Jul 23 2007,negative,the godzilla in this movie is too skinny and walks like a trex
Jul 23 2007,negative,horrible hank azaria and harry shearer should stick to the simpsons
Jul 23 2007,negative,rage against the machine
Jul 23 2007,positive,now i like matthew broderick  dont get me wrong  i just thought that this was not his movie  it was stupid but that didnt stop me from enjoying it
Jul 23 2007,neutral,quite fun roland emmerich loves destroying new york in various new and exciting ways  this time a giant lizard steps on it
Jul 23 2007,positive,2 words giant lizard
Jul 23 2007,positive,not that great  the star of the movie has the smallest role

Jul 22 2007,negative,the never ending movie
Jul 22 2007,positive,ooooooooooh this was awesome wen it first came out
Jul 22 2007,negative,graphics were good but that s the end
Jul 22 2007,negative,really unexciting blockbuster that manages to botch a very simple concept  two men dressed as giant lizards trampling over a cardboard model village of tokyo  this could have easily been updated but no an attempt to take the material too seriously combined with a turgid stillborn script and murky cinematography make this godzilla a complete chore to sit through unless youve already had that lobotomy youd promised yourself
Jul 22 2007,positive,fun in the same way that the 2nd jurassic park was fun although godzilla is kind of a sweetheart in this movie but her kids are little bitches
Jul 22 2007,positive,a good movie good acting and a good plot not bad for a cgi godzilla
Jul 22 2007,neutral,i remember seeing this movie a while back and i can just remember how awful it was why do directors assume that making movies of mutated animals are going to be somewhat successful and interesting to watch    i got some news for those who assume that thought stop making fucking movies on this shit i rather watch a baby play with hisher rattle for twelve hours straight while eating dog shit
Jul 22 2007,positive,not the original but it wasnt bad

Jul 22 2007,positive,whole city full of godzillawat to do
Jul 22 2007,negative,from what i bothered to watch this film is shite with a capital s
Jul 22 2007,negative,cg monster not much different from the puppet monsters of the monster island films given that many thought the original godzilla films were a metaphorical look at nuclear weapons couldnt we have expected something deeper from the hollywood remake no i guess not this is just surface dross and eye candy with a morally dodgy ending not worth watching
Jul 21 2007,negative,i love the japanese version gojira
Jul 21 2007,negative,tried too hard to be realistic and godzilla really needs a refund on his breath weapon best part the french posing as americans
Jul 21 2007,negative,complete dross not even lame enough to be funny
Jul 21 2007,negative,hated it i want my money back from the theater so stupid
Jul 21 2007,positive,the effects were good but the acting um wasnt
Jul 21 2007,negative,the definition of worthless
Jul 21 2007,positive,this was a god film with good use of cgi and the acting was fairly good i would say it is a rental or a possible bargain buy
Jul 20 2007,positive,meh its a half decent movie
Jul 20 2007,positive,the real godzilla fans whine about this version but whatever i thought the visuals were great for its time who cares if its cgi
Jul 20 2007,positive,so bad its awesome
Jul 20 2007,positive,love it roland emmerich is one of the best directors out there id4 the patriot godzilla the day after tomorrow 10000 bc this guy rules
Jul 20 2007,negative,never thought color would ruin a movie
Jul 20 2007,negative,so bad i walked out of the theater
Jul 20 2007,positive,the french guy is really cooljean reno
Jul 20 2007,negative,fuck you america if i want godzilla then i want to see guy sweating it out in giant rubber suits
Jul 20 2007,neutral,cool visuals of godzilla but there were times in the film that just made me yawn
Jul 20 2007,positive,why on earth you think im yenzilla
Jul 20 2007,neutral,its jay lenos sonin monster form  look at the chin on that thing
Jul 20 2007,positive,theres a lot of hate for this movie and i cant really see why i liked it good effects just because it doesnt look like some moron in a monster suit doesnt mean its not godzilla
Jul 20 2007,positive,this is a good film better than i was origionally wanting to give it credit for the only problem being that this big giant lizard that likes hot temperatures decides to go to new york which is mostly a cold place what a plot hole    now with that out of the way lets say what is good jean reno charasmatic jean reno plays a french spyagent in a similar vein to james bond this is a lovely concept  jean reno is a good actor  when he does the elvis impression in order to sound american this speaks volumes about how the french must live thier lives that they only know of america through elvis    matthew broderick well he aint little mathew bratterick anymore no now hes matured hes little matthew broderick  he conveys jealousy and a little bit of intensity what can i say perhaps jean reno passed on some tips    they also have an army captain guy they have an american army captain guy who stutters wow what is this i thought only the british stutter the american army has never been portrayed in such a positive light this guy is smart  caring    the car chase is genuinely pacey  exciting totaly overblown and ridiculas but what does that matter when the mechanics work so well    i really enjoyed this film    ps look out for little godzillas slipping on   gobstoppers a riot    pps i know that godzilla is godzilla but this is different and if you can get over that then youl find an enjoyable film with a slightly off beat sense of humour
Jul 20 2007,negative,great special effects but horrible script
Jul 20 2007,positive,whatever andrew sucks dick this movie is pretty fucking good
Jul 19 2007,negative,fucking poor excuse for a kaiju piece of trash vomit asshole bitch tits
Jul 19 2007,negative,fuck matthew broderick and why is jean reno in this garbage
Jul 19 2007,positive,you never said off the record
Jul 19 2007,negative,matthew broderick is outperformed by a cgi lizard    and the lizard is quite a poor actor  sad when ferris buellers day off is the pinnacle of  an acting career   
Jul 19 2007,negative,nice action shitty movie
Jul 19 2007,negative,i honesty couldnt tell you anything about this movie other than the soundtrack was worn out during my sixth grade year

Jul 18 2007,neutral,i liked the remake of godzilla    i just dont understand why in nyc and not tokyo
Jul 18 2007,negative,the only roland emmerich film i have absolutely hated so far  destroyed the good name of an iconic character with a wimpy wannnabe iguana monster
Jul 18 2007,positive,was real good i was actually impressed
Jul 18 2007,positive,was nice to see an attempt at a modern godzilla but the classics are too awesome to be real
Jul 18 2007,positive,dude they need to make another one
Jul 18 2007,negative,took away the brilliant original brilliant creation

Jul 18 2007,negative,americanized blunder of a great japanese idea
Jul 18 2007,positive,the best godgilla movie ever made
Jul 18 2007,negative,somehow its not the same without the man in the godzilla suit
Jul 18 2007,negative,was it just me or did this movie go on forever  it was almost as if the footage of godzilla stomping around the city was looped
Jul 18 2007,positive,being japanese i was brought up w the radioactive bluefirebreathing monster who actually had a hand in defeating greater evils at times so this was weird for me  independently of that not too bad
Jul 18 2007,negative,my brother made me watch this movie over and over and over
Jul 18 2007,negative,the only good thing was the soundtrack
Jul 18 2007,negative,i know i saw it but i dont remember much which means it wasnt very good
Jul 18 2007,positive,you cant go wrong with this concept either you make a great movie and people like it or a bad movie and it adheres to the godzilla standard set throughout time    this goes for the latter approach though what make it lose a star is the jurassic park ripoff at the end
Jul 18 2007,negative,heaping pile of dinosaur shit
Jul 18 2007,positive,it wasnt bad for a us version but its nothing like the japans version
Jul 18 2007,neutral,some great ideas and cool looking effects brought down by really stupid characters and storylines

Jul 18 2007,negative,not the real godzilla but zilla makes an appearence in the real godzilla series the movie was horrible and the actors
Jul 18 2007,negative,theres no way matthew broderick could ever be a scientist

Jul 18 2007,neutral,i liked it when it came out but upon recent viewing not so much anymore
Jul 18 2007,negative,this movie became a little crazy for me i like these type of movies but didnt think this one was great this was not like the godzilla from the old japaneze movies this was the american version that was too unlikely
Jul 18 2007,negative,ever wondered how watching a giant mutant dinosaur destroy downtown new york could be mindnumbingly tedious then check this one out

Jul 18 2007,negative,horrible utterly horrible ive never actually been able to finish watching this terrible movie even when i got a copy for about 1 i dont care that its not godzilla or any of that fanboy crap all i care about is that its an absolutely crap boring worthless pile of trash
Jul 18 2007,positive,a far cry from the godzilla we all know extremely well done though there are some really exagerated scenes

Jul 17 2007,positive,old nd a bore now but stil ok
Jul 17 2007,negative,nowhere near the japanese version
Jul 17 2007,neutral,an american godzilla yes its as bad as it sounds so bad in fact taht the godzilla had to be disowned fromt he asian story arc and dubbed its own branch of the monster the monster was nice and the effects were good but its a weak movie
Jul 17 2007,positive,i think i was the only one who enjoyed this movie
Jul 17 2007,negative,sorry ill take a guy stomping a diorama in a rubber lizard suit over this movie any day
Jul 17 2007,positive,one thing  this is not a godzilla movie godzilla is he shows up kicks around a couple buildings fights another monster then leaves if youre looking for that dont watch this but with that in mind this movie is pretty good it has some parts jurassic park which i didnt think was necessary but on its own i liked it a lot the soundtrack is awesome and it meets the actual origin headon rather than dancing around it like the japanese movies which were a silent protest anyway
Jul 17 2007,negative,i enjoyed this remake
Jul 17 2007,negative,i wanted that godzilla wannabe to stomp matthew broderick and maria pitllo
Jul 17 2007,negative,damn americans destroyed the aura of invincibility that is godzilla
Jul 17 2007,neutral,oh god what a fuckin let down
Jul 17 2007,positive,this film has been bashed from every which way and of course we all know why  but if you ignore the fact that this is part of a classic franchise its not bad as a movie  matthew broderick was good and godzilla himself looked pretty slick
Jul 17 2007,positive,see i love matthew broderick and i love hank azaria and i love harry shearer and jean reno is always fun i really didnt mind this movie all that much in fact i rather enjoyed it
Jul 17 2007,negative,i was excited about this movie but then i saw it
Jul 17 2007,positive,not a bad movie and we get to blame the french for what happened  all good in my book
Jul 17 2007,neutral,it was pretty cool when it first came out now its almost silly when i watch it
Jul 17 2007,negative,boo boo boo and hiss this is not godzilla godzilla is a man in a big rubber outfit kicking the beejeezus out of another man in a big rubber outfit with some sort aesopesque morality tale at the end even jett jaguar says this movie is a cowpie
Jul 17 2007,negative,they stole the raptors from jurassic park and made them baby godzillas
Jul 17 2007,negative,chantals favorite man is in this movie though the graphics could have been better
Jul 17 2007,negative,not what i expected it was pretty bad
Jul 17 2007,negative,memorable for a few things like jean reno otherwise a travesty to diehard godzilla fans and a joke to the rest of us
Jul 17 2007,positive,need to finish watching this although i love classic godzilla
Jul 17 2007,negative,a bland rehash of the godzilla story it was seemingly more interested in selling music videos than telling anything like an interesting story ishir hondas original film was an allegory for nuclear war involving 3dimensional characters this version was very much the polar opposite
Jul 17 2007,negative,umm killed ferris buellers already terminally ill career but umm great song by jk
Jul 17 2007,neutral,would have been god if godzilla was in it
Jul 17 2007,negative,this was not a godzilla movie  anymore than the first casino royale was a james bond movie

Jul 15 2007,positive,aww it was a good movie i like to watch it over and over
Jul 15 2007,negative,this is why godzilla movies should only be made by the japanese  what a way to destroy a timehonoured tradition of campy movies with horrible special effects than to create a godawful boring as hell jurassic park ripoff with stunning special effects
Jul 15 2007,neutral,pretty crappy but id be lying if i told you i wasnt entertained at the cinema

Jul 14 2007,positive,i cant get enough of this moviegodzilla is awesomelove this movie
Jul 14 2007,neutral,this is a decent monster movie if you pretend like it isnt called godzilla and ignore the fact that the baby godzilla sequence stole shamelessly from the raptors in jurassic parkbut hey jean reno is cool

Jul 14 2007,positive,ok moviei mean what more could one make out of a mutant reptile special effects leave a lot to be desired and the female lead blew more than a five hundred dollar whore apart from that

Jul 13 2007,positive,my brother likes it alot so i have seen it meny times it is ok
Jul 13 2007,negative,godzilla was always meant to be a guy in a rubber suit smashing cardboard cut out buildings a cgi godzilla destroyed everything that was great about godzilla to begin with
Jul 13 2007,negative,really not good at all  special effects are cheesy  plot is out of no where  follows none of the original godzilla plot ideas  comes of as some large wild animal on the loose as opposed to an intelligent creature  oh and that description goes for matthew broderick as well  okay well add lame and boring to that description and then you have matthew broderick
Jul 13 2007,neutral,but the really good ones are the old ones
Jul 13 2007,positive,im a big fan of the original godzilla it seems like an unwritten rule that if you like the japanese godzilla then you must hate the american godzilla im determined to defy that rule    first off id like to address the general criticisms levied at this film i personally thought that the writing plot and characters were adequate for the monsterontheloose film that this film is besides these things arent what one would watch a monster movie like this for we watch monster movies like this for the monster action and on that level this film delivers its mindless fun for people who just want to turn their brains off for 130 minutes and watch some good old city stompin besides its not like these aspects are any worse than what youd find in one of tohos godzilla films yet they arent as universally reviled as this film    now i would like to address the godzilla fans criticisms of this film yes this godzilla is vastly different from the japanese g we all know and love yes it lacks the charm of the japanese films however thats not to say it doesnt have any charm of its own the film is not inferior just different i understand that these differences really irk off a lot of people the key to enjoying this film is to stop comparing it with the japanese godzilla because it isnt the fans are right in labeling the american monster as gino or godzilla in name only however that does not mean that the titular lizard in this film has to be the same as its japanese counterpart as a matter of fact i found the changes refreshing after watching 28 films of a man in a rubber suit not that that gets old or anything its just nice to see something different    the main issue that most fans seem to have with this film is that the monster is called godzilla if the monster was called rhedosaurus and the film was a remake of the beast from 20000 fathoms nobody would be complaining its the expectation of something similar to the japanese godzilla which is what disappoints most people no zilla is not godzilla and thus he should not be held to the same standards i realize that what im saying is basically that people should lower their expectations to enjoy this film but thats not necessarily a bad thing it may sound cynical but when it comes to this film youll find yourself enjoying yourself more if you do that    i am glad to call godzilla 98 one of my favorite guilty pleasures and the fact that i first saw this film in theaters when i was seven probably influences my opinion on this film    whew that was the longest review ive ever written on flixster
Jul 13 2007,negative,why matthew broderick why youre better than that
Jul 13 2007,positive,matthew broderick wasnt the best choice and the girl lead was awful  but other than that it was pretty good

Jul 13 2007,negative,i walked out of the theater
Jul 13 2007,negative,way to make godzilla into a jurrasic park ripoff

Jul 13 2007,negative,biggest movie flop ever awful idea in the first place made into a really bad film
Jul 13 2007,positive,i think i saw this good action sequences if i recall correctly
Jul 13 2007,negative,uhh i think i saw this one
Jul 13 2007,negative,this is not godzilla  i cant really say anything bad about the effects side of this movie except to say that the godzilla on display here looks more like a trex than the classic atomic horror of japanese cinema  the story is very weak however and the characters are uninteresting  i cant recommend this to anyone who has fond memories of the original movies
Jul 13 2007,positive,good monster film could watch it over and over
Jul 13 2007,positive,haha i liked this movie wikid plot p
Jul 13 2007,negative,without jean reno it would have gotten a lower score

Jul 13 2007,negative,very disapointing i hope clover field is a better version of a mythical creature
Jul 13 2007,negative,it was cool to see a different version of godzilla made and portrayed as just some lost confused huge radioactive disaster running around the story was dumb but when this came out i was a preteen and the hell did i care about story but in the end i prefer japanese godzilla hes my homie
Jul 13 2007,negative,godzilla having kids is a stretch i prefer the old school cliche of little japanese people screaming and running away its good to see that godzilla doesnt discriminate about who he steps on by race though two stars for racial harmony
Jul 12 2007,positive,would still like to see more of this storywhat happened to them all
Jul 12 2007,neutral,corny not the best actionmonster movie broderick isnt my favorite actor though

Jul 12 2007,negative,not quite the dumbest idea ever but close

Jul 12 2007,neutral,so much potential behind this movie and i had been looking forward to it forever  the cgi and action scenes were awsm but the story sucked  since when does godzilla come to a city to lay eggs  he comes to a city to completely destroy it and thats all he should have done
Jul 11 2007,positive,that thing is huge
Jul 11 2007,negative,godzirra the old floppy costume movies were 20x better

Jul 11 2007,negative,in the aftermath of jurrasic park but i guess if you like movies like theese
Jul 11 2007,positive,not bad but there are better movies for mindless entertainment
Jul 11 2007,positive,it has to be good its a movie about a giant monster destroying everything
Jul 11 2007,negative,i dont know what they were doing here whether it was trying to take a new turn with a different type of godzilla or have it be in its own franchiseeither way they never have or did succeed with this new take on the japanese classic monster
Jul 11 2007,negative,the soundtrack was ok and the movie has a cool idea but it just stunk

Jul 11 2007,negative,i was not impresssed by this movie it should have had a different title
Jul 11 2007,negative,i remember thinking this was awful in 8th grade unti i saw it again now it is still just as awful and makes me wonder why jean reno would have signed on to this shit and how matthew broderick still finds work
Jul 11 2007,negative,jurassic park but bigger and less fun
Jul 11 2007,neutral,i remember cool graphics a decent plot line and puffy dropping that song havnt viewed it in a while tho

Jul 11 2007,positive,it was ok i here their going to make a second one
Jul 11 2007,positive,great movie for 1998 technology
Jul 11 2007,positive,kind of generic action flick apart from the special effect  even then i cant really remember it too well what i do remember is loving the jamiroquai song on the soundtrack  bonus points right  there
Jul 11 2007,positive,you caught me its a guilty pleasure
Jul 11 2007,negative,so mad about this i cant even speak
Jul 11 2007,negative,i grew up with the old poorly dubbed japanese godzilla movies they were much much better
Jul 11 2007,negative,godzilla should remain in japan where he belongs and hes supposed to be a man in a rubber suit hellbent on destroying tokyo for waking him up not a misunderstood cgi lizard who just wants to find a quiet spot in nyc to have babies a bad idea to begin with not made any better by all the stuff they stole from jurassic park
Jul 11 2007,negative,liked the movie saw it in 5th grade at the theater front row seatdont sit there
Jul 11 2007,negative,worst incarnation of godzilla ever

Jul 11 2007,neutral,remember how this made its way into all kinds of ads like pepsi and then pepsi brought back that ad earlier this year and thought no one would notice well i noticed  i liked the wallflowers david bowie cover i suppose
Jul 11 2007,positive,better then jurassic park
Jul 11 2007,positive,i dont care what anybody says this was a pretty sweet flick if you forget it was about godzilla
Jul 11 2007,neutral,bit of fun on a grand scale
Jul 11 2007,neutral,hmmmokay i guess  but its less about the monster and more about mr sarah jessica parkers character
Jul 11 2007,positive,this was a good movie
Jul 11 2007,positive,go godzilla hes my favorite giant radioactive lizard and my only
Jul 11 2007,positive,entertaining with a slight overdose of cheese
Jul 11 2007,positive,i liked it when the french guys chewed gum and tried to talk like john wayne to make themselves sound more american
Jul 11 2007,negative,terrible terrible film godzilla is a wuss in this film i think the americans failed to realise that he isnt a dinosaur ffs just leave japanese films alone unless you are going to make them better like ring does
Jul 11 2007,negative,i think i saw this
Jul 11 2007,negative,an embarrassement to the godzilla film history everyone involved should be shot
Jul 11 2007,positive,i barely remember this movie but i liked it when i saw it i used to think matthew broderick was so hot back then lol
Jul 11 2007,positive,its an action film with a big lizard what could possibly go wrong
Jul 11 2007,neutral,geh i mean it was alright i grew up on the original godzilla movies though and for them to change the details to such an extent was a little insulting if this had been an independent franchise film i would have enjoyed it more
Jul 11 2007,positive,one of the funniest movies
Jul 11 2007,positive,i somehow prefer the man in costume godzilla but how can you beat the visuals of hollywood special effects
Jul 11 2007,negative,not even jean renos gum chewing could save this one
Jul 11 2007,positive,i loved this movie as a kid very good special effects for the time makes me mad how it was set up for a sequel but there never was one
Jul 11 2007,positive,its a typical monster movie but not phenomenal
Jul 11 2007,negative,great soundtrack horrible movie
Jul 11 2007,negative,loved reno and the soundtrack the resteh
Jul 11 2007,neutral,i saw this when was a kid and though it was cool but i saw it again and realized how silly the whole thing was

Jul 11 2007,positive,dont like matthew broderick but i liked this movie
Jul 11 2007,negative,best thing about this was the jamiroquai song at the end
Jul 11 2007,positive,i still enjoy watching this when the mood strikes me
Jul 11 2007,negative,to make a serious minded disaster film is like making power rangers to shakeserpian dialogueit jsut doesnt make a whole lotta sense still it has flashes of cool action since thats all that roland emerichs good at too bad he pumps the proceedings ham fisted drama turning this into basically another king kong off without either the depth and story of its a formentioned rip off
Jul 11 2007,negative,decent movie if you arent a godzilla fan  horrible tragedy if you are
Jul 11 2007,negative,this isnt godzilla its a big lizard movie they lost the focus of what godzilla was about by making him less of a character and more of an animal you dont really care about the humans and evidently they didnt care about the plot of this lifeless action film
Jul 11 2007,positive,not much for writingbut its a pop corn movie
Jul 11 2007,negative,a poor imitation of the japanese clasics
Jul 11 2007,negative,nowhere near as good as the rubber suit orignal
Jul 11 2007,negative,could have been soo much more but wasnt
Jul 11 2007,positive,though its more of a jurassic park in new york than an actual godzilla movie its actually alright the cast works well with the bmovie quality script and it keeps up with the total cheeniness quality kind of like inframan with a 150 million budget

Jul 9 2007,neutral,the cgi is awfully dated and broderick is atrocious but this cheesy big budget popcorn blockbuster still has a special place in my heart
Jul 9 2007,negative,the only thing that this had in common with matthew brodericks funnier and better movie ferris buellers day off is that they both had dragged out chaserunning scenes

Jul 9 2007,negative,captured the fear that a godzilla movie should have but i have to say im not a matthew broderick fan at all  the acting sucked
Jul 9 2007,positive,    size does matter following the french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific an unknown creature is spotted passing eastward through the panama canal scientist niko tatopoulos is called in to investigate the matter and he quickly arrives at the conclusion that a giant irradiated lizard has been created by the explosions godzilla then makes its way north landing at manhattan to begin wreaking havoc in the big city even with the combined forces of the us military to fight the monster will it be enough to save the people of new york            this thing is much too big to be some lost dinosaur and since its being based on the popular japanese film series of the same name this is way too americanized to be a real godzilla movie given that the storyline was remade and so was the main setting as to let that big monster have a big bite on the big apple dr niko tatapoulos  whose personality was well done by matthew brodericks acting performance  is so smart that he knew that the titular monster is no dinosaur but rather the abnormal result of radioactive fallout independence day amazed me a lot that if i knew that roland emmerich was going to direct more movies of catastrophic proportions then i would enjoy it and when i did watch godzilla i thought he did a good job reimagining it with all the great action sequences throughout the film received mostly a negative reception from both audiences and critics but i should pay no attention to them  if they thought the monster here lacked the monstrosity of the japanese original then they didnt see the fun of it even if it looked more of an overgrown classroom iguana than tohos version itself as i can tell by its appearance for me i thought that lizard here still has the mad look on its face cause i knew that its main objective is to destroy all of the property on its intended path while it may not be perfect as all the other godzilla films the remake still packs a lot of punch and if i hear any more criticism from the critics then ill have that monster stomp onto them that theyll be flattened
Jul 9 2007,negative,i absolutely loved this movie 9 years ago
Jul 9 2007,negative,only slightly better than king kong
Jul 9 2007,positive,i actually thought this movie wasnt bad i dont know why it got such a bad rap
Jul 9 2007,negative,total garbage terrible effects even more terrible story
Jul 9 2007,negative,in one scene matthew broderick buys pregnancy tests from the local store and uses them to find out godzilla ispregnant he deduces its because godzilla is asexual to which his girlfriend replies wheres the fun in that this is an example of how remarkably lame and poorly constructed this film is dismissing the fact the monster keeps changing size as well as stupid mayor ebert and his sidekick gene way to bash the critics roland emmerich godzilla is a lame studio attempt to cash in on the jurassic park craze by using an established brand but like xander harris said matthew broderick killed a big dumb lizard that was not godzilla
Jul 9 2007,positive,could have been better
Jul 9 2007,positive,its been a while i thought there would be a sequal though

Jul 7 2007,negative,this was an awful movie  the only reason i saw it twice was because i had a major crush on matthew broderick at the time  jean reno makes this film enjoyable watch it if its on tv
Jul 7 2007,negative,uhhh what happened in this movie again
Jul 7 2007,negative,i wish i had only seen the trailer
Jul 7 2007,negative,i watched it opening day it was really bad not even the loud roars and explosions could keep me awake
Jul 7 2007,positive,omg i havnt seen that sence i was a kid but i can remember is watchin it over and over
Jul 7 2007,positive,quite possibly the result of the best marketing ever no godzilla shots in the previews roland emmerichs remake of the 1951 original ups the ante with effects and a sillier storyline the characters namely simpsons veterans harry shearer and hank azaria make this one of the more entertaining summer blockbusters that ive seen
Jul 7 2007,negative,i dont know what that thing was but it wasnt godzilla
Jul 7 2007,positive,cool movie nice effects and a solid cast just one beef why do french special forces die so quickly
Jul 7 2007,positive,i thought this was by far the best godzilla movie besides the very first one in the 1950s
Jul 7 2007,neutral,i never saw the whole movie but what i saw didnt make me interested enough to finish it
Jul 7 2007,positive,this movie gets a bad rap for being silly and dumb but it really isnt that bad not that great though
Jul 7 2007,positive,all i have to say is it smells like cheese
Jul 7 2007,negative,i slept the entire movie
Jul 7 2007,positive,its sad i love the cute lizard why does he have to die tear
Jul 7 2007,negative,oh jeezwent and saw this in high school with friendsall i remember is us almost getting kicked out of the theatre and people asking if it was done yet and it would just go on and on
Jul 7 2007,positive,not as bad as everyone groans about but not good
Jul 7 2007,negative,watch the original this is just hollywood bullcrap
Jul 7 2007,neutral,mmmmm not the worst but still pretty bad but come on a big huge lizard destroying one of humanities greates achievements ooo yes
Jul 7 2007,negative,i went to see it the day it came out it wasnt that great
Jul 7 2007,negative,hahahahaha  this one was somewhat good  the japanesse ones are soo much better even if the visual graphics suck  d
Jul 7 2007,positive,despite the critics bad reviews this movie was surprisingly entertaining though its not the quality id give king kong it was still entertaining
Jul 7 2007,neutral,take great effects a good storyline for a monster movie and combine it with great actors and apparently you get eveyones worst performance ever  seriously disappointing
Jul 7 2007,positive,not as bad as everyone said good effects
Jul 7 2007,negative,way to ruin godzilla with a lot of hackneyed effects and acting  just takes itself too seriously
Jul 7 2007,negative,the previews for 1000 bc just reminded me of how much i hate this piece of shit
Jul 7 2007,positive,good special effects for the time but with a terrible story and disappointing lead godzilla is not the towering film it could have been
Jul 7 2007,neutral,hahai was so into this movie when it came out
Jul 7 2007,positive,i saw this movie in theaters
Jul 7 2007,positive,just a lot of buildingsmashing newyorkcrushing fun not a classic but worth watching once or twice
Jul 7 2007,negative,a visual marvel a cinematic shitstorm
Jul 7 2007,negative,the original is better
Jul 7 2007,positive,ha havent watched this one in forever i liked it though
Jul 7 2007,negative,wasnt all that impressed but the soundtrack confirmed to me that p puff daddy diddy doesnt know any other words in the english language other than uh huh and yeah
Jul 7 2007,negative,probably the worst movie ever the characters were in a taxi cab in godzillas mouth and still made it out alive lame
Jul 7 2007,neutral,classic yet rather badhehe
Jul 7 2007,positive,i actually liked this remakealoti know i suck 
Jul 7 2007,positive,shlock artiste emmerich regurgitates his blockbuster formula and directs a bigger leaner cgi generated fire breathing lizard from traditional home stomping ground japan to new york city where we discover  but that would be telling  jean reno is the most fun as the frenchman in the big apple this film is one of my guilty pleasures
Jul 7 2007,negative,yes spend 20 million dollars on creating some crazy cg godzilla and then focus the climax on stupid baby dinosaurs
Jul 7 2007,negative,this movie is not worth seeing it does not represent the true godzilla with bad dubbing that we all know and love
Jul 7 2007,negative,doing nuclear tests in the french polynesian seas was a bad idea just as making a film about godzilla like this one
Jul 7 2007,positive,i wasnt overly impressed
Jul 7 2007,positive,was a fun movie but no where near being a masterpiece
Jul 7 2007,neutral,gud bt not nice to c same old godzilla
Jul 7 2007,negative,how do you screw up a movie about a giant special effects monster this is how
Jul 7 2007,negative,not all that good but if you like big lizard things then i guess its good
Jul 7 2007,positive,now that was a cool movie
Jul 7 2007,positive,grandest of all monsters  godzilla godzilla
Jul 7 2007,neutral,this movie is sooo old
Jul 7 2007,positive,i remember seeing this in theaters
Jul 7 2007,positive,honestly all i can remember about this movie was the awesome special effects
Jul 7 2007,positive,i dont remember this whole movie but i think it was alright the special effects were probably pretty good too um i do know that theyre coming out with a new one next year i think anyway
Jul 7 2007,negative,another movie to piss on
Jul 7 2007,negative,this is not the cute and adorable monster we all know and love nope this is lame and what was up with all the raptors runnin around sigh
Jul 7 2007,negative,the effects were cool but that was about it
Jul 7 2007,negative,i would say it was laughable but that would insinuate that i actually laughed there were a bunch of famous faces and i think only one of them has ever done an action film before not the worst movie ive ever seenbut it was pretty close
Jul 7 2007,negative,ha ha ha ha ha isnt the scene in the tower block a shot for shot rip off of the lost world
Jul 7 2007,negative,i saw this movie and wondered how you could mess up a giant monster flick and i thought they couldnt have made it any worse then i saw peter jacksons king kong and realised they could have peter jackson your a hack
Jul 7 2007,negative,couldnt stop falling asleep to it
Jul 7 2007,positive,cheesy yes predictable yes good movie with good cast yes sir
Jul 7 2007,positive,remake of the 1000s of japanese movies of the same name  not bad not great
Jul 7 2007,negative,eek  not just bad but so bad
Jul 7 2007,neutral,haha giant lizzardahh run for your lives flick
Jul 7 2007,negative,terrible remake of original films  american producers butchered a classic
Jul 7 2007,negative,made my brain hurt just like the wallflowers cover of heroes for the soundtrack made my ears hurt
Jul 7 2007,positive,shes just a mom wanting  to protect her babies  those horrible army guys
Jul 7 2007,negative,well its not how i would have done it but it could have been a little bit worse where was peter jackson when we really needed him
Jul 6 2007,positive,it was good for its time plot is a little thin but the special effects were revolutionary
Jul 6 2007,neutral,gojira  yay  nice special effects
Jul 6 2007,positive,its an ok movie verging on pretty bad but i enjoyed it
Jul 6 2007,negative,cant believe i liked this as a kid
Jul 6 2007,positive,i actually loved this when i was younger
Jul 6 2007,positive,its good the first time
Jul 6 2007,positive,im the only person on the planet who loved this film im convinced of that
Jul 6 2007,neutral,so the cgi was great back in 98 big whoop thats all this movie had going for it now its just a pathetic demonstration of how too many movies depend solely their initial shock value be it cgi battle scenes what have you and pay no attention to the importance of character development
Jul 6 2007,positive,great soundtrackshitty movie
Jul 6 2007,negative,well its matthew broderick and godzilla and jean reno too why dont really know well it looked cool
Jul 6 2007,positive,well not the best work that matt brodrick has done but it was halfway descent
Jul 6 2007,positive,pretty decent action movie though the girls acting was slightly subpar the french guys were hilarious
Jul 6 2007,negative,only good part is the soundtrack
Jul 6 2007,negative,the classic movie monster godzilla or gojira has been around in japanese pop culture since the 1950s in 1998 the famously campy creature got the us blockbuster treatment with several significant changes instead of godzilla destroying tokyo the setting has changed to that of new york city which you may remember was the city which king king ran amok in which is a little strange godzillas appearance gets an upgrade which is slick and mean and resembles a cross between a dragon and a trex i think thats one of the main things i liked about this movie he just looks so cool unfortunately this movie is a disaster of a disaster movie the plot makes little sense with plot holes including how do you lose a giangantic lizard the size of skyscrapers in nyc  how is it that the military are unable to shoot the damn thing which is right in front of them causing the military to blow up the buildings around godzilla there are literally too many ridiculous and moronic situations and questions raised from this film than i care to mention here but despite all its flaws i still like this movie ok so its big and dumb and makes no sense but so what i enjoyed it i loved seeing that big massive bastard destroy the city guilty pleasure it sure is a movie i absolutely loved when i was ten and still hold it close at heart now
Jul 6 2007,negative,original ones are better
Jul 6 2007,positive,good effectsnot great actingbut it portrayed the story well  ending kinda sucks
Jul 6 2007,neutral,matthew broderick was the only good part about this movie
Jul 6 2007,neutral,oh god please stop the bad remakes to bad ferris bueller didnt get eaten that would have ruled
Jul 6 2007,negative,out of all the godzilla movies i own this american one is the worst shit acting by matthew broderick made it even worse the story is just way to drawn out and it felt more like a jurrasic park movie there should have been another monster then it would have felt more like a toho classic
Jul 6 2007,positive,i personally think the timeless classics are better than this present day remake  it wasnt a bad movie but it just couldnt compare to the originals
Jul 6 2007,positive,matthew broderick kicks ass the producers ferris bueller etc but this movie just wasnt idk it was okay i guess
Jul 6 2007,negative,i wanted to kill myself during this
Jul 6 2007,positive,pretty sweet matthew broderick did a pretty silly job although i thought this could be a bit better
Jul 6 2007,positive,extremely disappointing
Jul 6 2007,negative,i think this is widely accepted as one of the worst films of all time  it might not be number one but definitely makes it into the top ten
Jul 6 2007,negative,how in the hell does one make a bad godzilla movie
Jul 6 2007,positive,hey i enjoyed it a little
Jul 6 2007,negative,i remember this movie lolit was horrible
Jul 6 2007,negative,a bad joke all that budget and id still rather watch a guy in a rubber suit stomp all over models of tokyo divesting the creature of his history as the personification of the nuclear bombing of japan makes him little more than a big dinosaur godzilla was never meant to be a jurasic park sequel it gets 1 star for jean reno
Jul 6 2007,positive,loved it new one comes out next month
Jul 6 2007,negative,like crap through a goose
Jul 6 2007,negative,havent seen some of the originals in a while but they were way better than this dogshit sure it has nice special effects but that seems to be the only thing going for it and emmerich is one of the most talentless directors in the business
Jul 6 2007,negative,no  old school godzilla much better  this was dumb
Jul 6 2007,positive,i like godzilla half a star more than everyone eles
Jul 6 2007,negative,only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack
Jul 6 2007,neutral,after independence day devlin and emmerich never got their swing back what could have been a great spectacle becomes defnitively mediocre it is still kind cool to watch godzilla break shit though
Jul 6 2007,positive,i really like this movie i felt very sorry for the poor creature
Jul 6 2007,positive,for some reason i really like itcant say why
Jul 6 2007,positive,i know its cheesey but i loved it
Jul 6 2007,negative,attaway to completely ruin one of the coolest monster franchises ever matthew broderick has the most irritating role and the script is ridiculous also why is such a great actor like jean reno wasting his talent on this trash definitely forgettable
Jul 6 2007,negative,look when you snap all the suspension cables on a suspension bridge it falls down  thats it movie over
Jul 6 2007,negative,holy crap this is bad
Jul 6 2007,negative,i love the old school godzilla seriesso when this first came out when i was 12 i was very excited to watch it in the theater now its not as enjoyable at 21yrs old
Jul 6 2007,positive,i like the soundtrack
Jul 6 2007,positive,something about matther broderick and jean reno i like
Jul 6 2007,positive,with a film about a 60foot lizard smashing up manhatten you dont expect serious cinema    extremely enjoyable monster movie which effectively mixes action with comedy  and the music is good too
Jul 6 2007,negative,why does godzilla keep changing size
Jul 6 2007,neutral,didnt blow me away by any means but still a pretty decent movie    joey jeremiah plays hipachi pilot  3 by the way he gets eaten by godzilla
Jul 6 2007,positive,for jamirqouais soundtrack alone
Jul 6 2007,positive,enjoyable pap creature feature on a big budget with another thinly vieled ecomessage from the director with a conscience emmerich
Jul 6 2007,positive,i liked it a lot it was def better than the old ones
Jul 6 2007,positive,i was expecting more
Jul 6 2007,positive,i like it the egg part creeped me out though
Jul 6 2007,neutral,it was an alright modernization of classics matthew broderick will forever be ferris though
Jul 6 2007,positive,how you not like the big scaly thug from japan  even though he is not classified as a good guy or a bad guy ya still have to cheer him on no matter what he is doing  the poor guy is just in the wrong place at the wrong time  being a longtime godzilla fan i will always enjoy all adaptations of him
Jul 6 2007,positive,love the soundtrack
Jul 6 2007,positive,the definition of the secret favorite godzilla is wunderbad  their monster is any whatsoever size that the plot necessitates an ebert lookalike is the nyc mayor and for 20 minutes we slip into jurassic park as raptorssorry baby godzillaschase people through madison square garden  seriously what the hell is happening in this movie  i dont know and i frankly just dont care
Jul 6 2007,positive,the first time i saw this i was so what  the second time i began to think about the idea of willing suspension of disbelief and suddenly it was really good  see what you think
Jul 6 2007,negative,terrible godzilla looked like a giant iguana and ferris bueller didnt match his role
Jul 6 2007,positive,this movie mad me cry when i was 6 cuz i loved godzilla
Jul 6 2007,negative,my mind aches simple missiles cannot defeat gogeera
Jul 6 2007,negative,i dont really recall anything from seeing this movie aside from the fact that it was all special effects
Jul 6 2007,positive,it was better than the old version
Jul 6 2007,positive,i rather enjoyed this one its a break from the cheesy japanese godzilla and doesnt disappoint plus both hank azaria and harry shearer are in it so theres no complaints here
Jul 6 2007,positive,pretty good godzilla movie for the time
Jul 6 2007,negative,good lord i had almost forgotten about this movie and its suckiness
Jul 6 2007,neutral,points for matthew broderick  i support the man in all that he does
Jul 6 2007,negative,one word  remake  and not a good one
Jul 6 2007,positive,surprisingly i didnt hate it
Jul 6 2007,negative,i saw this in the theatre
Jul 6 2007,positive,a great monster movie remake of the japanese classic stunning effects outdo everything attempted previously and no bad lipsync
Jul 6 2007,negative,what a load of old shit
Jul 6 2007,negative,this movie had a great ad campaign so that gives it bonus points but it also had that godawful puff daddy song that sampled kashmir by zeppelin so that takes away bonus points that leaves the movie to stand on its own merits which is unfortunate because there arent many
Jul 6 2007,negative,strange how a man in a goofy rubber suit can seem both reasonable and tasteful in comparison
Jul 6 2007,positive,well i digged it coz i dig monster flicks with good lookin monsters i wish they made a second
Jul 6 2007,positive,godzilla is pretty good
Jul 6 2007,neutral,it wasnt that bad jamiroquai did the soundtrack ok so it was rubbish but hey
Jul 6 2007,positive,ive been defending this movie since it came out and now that ive seen it again after years ill still defend it givin bueller is not an epic film star but he does the job especially considering how poorly the rest of the movie is cast the lame dad from transformers has been a lame dad his entire career and i belive even at this time he was already a disney dad actor the leading lady is  brutal and for some reason there are two simpsons voice actors playing major parts in this flick moe and mrburns but all that doesnt matter cause to me making godzilla modern and american was one of the best ideas of the 90s he looked awesome and putting him in modern new york was a lot of fun to watch im sure this seems strange since i shit all over both transformers and jurrasic park similiar films but this flick is better cause the overall feel is consistent unlike transformers and the monster is more than just a mindless killer that unexplicalby wants to eat peopleunlike jurrasic park but a nesting animal acting in its natural pattern it also brings me back to a classic time when movie soundtracks were way more hyped than the movie itself all i can think of when i see the poster for this flick is puff daddy and the wallflowers just like men in black armageddon and batman forever essentially this movie is more than godzilla shows up chaos ensues
Jul 6 2007,negative,this movie sucked hardcore
Jul 6 2007,negative,doesnt do the great lizard justice
Jul 6 2007,neutral,let me be clear this is not godzilla this is an impostor    for the love of god can we please stop ruining perfectly fine japanese movies
Jul 6 2007,positive,love it so underated
Jul 6 2007,negative,how can you screw up a godzilla movie shame on you
Jul 6 2007,positive,running would be a good idea
Jul 6 2007,neutral,graphics is good but not to the mark
Jul 6 2007,negative,i dont really remember it that much
Jul 5 2007,negative,this movie was so cool to my nine year old brain but looking back retarded
Jul 5 2007,negative,horrible movie like dont even watch it on tv its a waste of your life that youll never get back
Jul 5 2007,negative,a totally crappy americanized remake of japans giant lizard not the japan one is any better
Jul 5 2007,negative,wow amazingly terrible
Jul 5 2007,positive,a blunder but a one i wish they would have keep going with
Jul 5 2007,negative,me and mom saw thisit was so bad
Jul 5 2007,negative,heart toho godzilla triumphs over money devlinemerich godzilla once again the wallflowers song on the soundtrack is good though
Jul 5 2007,positive,used to be my favorite movie when i was little but wheres the sequel
Jul 5 2007,negative,haha it was kind of funny but arent all godzilla movies
Jul 5 2007,positive,i was in the theater for this like an hour before the comercials for the theater started
Jul 5 2007,positive,english dubs are hilarious
Jul 5 2007,negative,i still maintain that jean reno was the only reason i saw this movie with that in mindi wish i hadnt
Jul 5 2007,negative,underrated but still bad
Jul 5 2007,positive,jean reno makes the movie worth it
Jul 5 2007,positive,any movie with godzilla or shaq in them automatically get two stars
Jul 5 2007,neutral,not as enormously bad as everyone makes it out to be dont expect intelligent plots or believable dialogue but if you want huge special effects monsters destroying everything this is where its at
Jul 5 2007,positive,not the worst thing to come about
Jul 5 2007,negative,i saw this when i was a fan of hank azaria back when that meant something
Jul 5 2007,negative,quite interesting when it was released but nowadays every other movie has a plot reminiscent of this one id have much rather watched kurosawa direct this movie when he was alive too bad it was just his dream
Jul 5 2007,negative,o manthis was a pretty decent remake
Jul 5 2007,negative,doesnt this look stupid it does and it was so screw it
Jul 5 2007,neutral,plot matters true then and today
Jul 5 2007,negative,nope kinda sucked balls the origionals were too far diferent
Jul 5 2007,positive,eh it was entertaining
Jul 5 2007,negative,for the first 5 minutes i was psyched for a massive lizard destroying a city it sort of happened i guess they didnt really show it but there was a few glimpses of the beast a few lights here and there would have worked wonders also less acting less humans altogether their main role is to scream and run
Jul 5 2007,negative,ha ha ha oh matthew broderick  jean reno
Jul 5 2007,negative,from what i remember of this movie i was blown away by the special effects but then again i was 13 for nostalgic reasons i give it two stars the soundtrack is phenomenal i still listen to it
Jul 5 2007,negative,great idea and godzilla looked the best in this film terrible though for the cast it had
Jul 5 2007,neutral,good but didnt have the same vibes as the old ones
Jul 5 2007,negative,i think ive seen this but i cant remember anything about it that cant be good
Jul 5 2007,negative,being a fan of the real godzilla movies this is one of my least favorite movies
Jul 5 2007,negative,could of been so much better
Jul 5 2007,positive,i liked this movie i dont care what people say yeah it was big flashy over the top but it is godzilla it has to be that way i think people werent ready for the darker tone of the movie which most were thinking would be like id4 it was a movie i will watch a lot
Jul 5 2007,positive,its a giant fucking lizard wreaking havoc that makes it plenty good
Jul 5 2007,negative,part of the reason people seem to like the older godzilla movies is the cheesy special effects and bad translation why take those away
Jul 5 2007,negative,why why why did they remake this
Jul 5 2007,negative,good special effects and action but its just not godzilla unless its battling another giant monster in the streets of tokyo
Jul 5 2007,positive,could have been done better and people seem to hate it fraudzilla lol
Jul 5 2007,positive,fan of the origional new one is a nice modern retouch of the creatures mythology
Jul 5 2007,negative,whod have really believed that a guy in a suit would be sooo much better than a cgi epic
Jul 5 2007,positive,some say its crap but i happen to like my 30storey tank destroying mutant lizards broderick and reno give good performances reno is great but then this film isnt really about the acting its about the zilla which looks great if not a little dated by todays standards
Jul 5 2007,positive,many say this was crap but i loved it  the effects were amazing the story was good some of the characters were good namely jean reno and godzilla was spoton awesome
Jul 5 2007,positive,  want to see
Jul 5 2007,neutral,i liked this movie and i wish they would make a new one
Jul 5 2007,positive,honestly im not sure why people hate this movie so much  it came out and was immediately panned and its heralded as one of the epic busts in cinematic history  it really wasnt that bad  it was fun even though it had a stupid ending and the cgi was good even though they made godzilla look kinda stupid
Jul 5 2007,negative,stick to the japanese godzillas
Jul 5 2007,positive,godzilla plays for keeps
Jul 5 2007,negative,i remember thinking it was kind of cool but also kind of really lame now that i think about it its mostly the latter

Jul 5 2007,positive,i thought it was going to be dumb but i honestly thought it was a pretty good action movie with oversized reptiles
Jul 5 2007,negative,matthew broderick who told you it would be a good career choice to star in this film
Jul 5 2007,negative,watch this movie again and during the end make every french joke you can think of it works fantastically

Jul 5 2007,positive,now this film was ok it didnt really have  the godzilla feel to it but it was ok to watch
Jul 5 2007,negative,this movie really was a waste of time
Jul 5 2007,positive,the best thing about this movie was the soundtrack  it was greatotherwise a fun movie that copied jurassic at one point then got annoying
Jul 5 2007,neutral,i dun remember much about it i think its ok
Jul 5 2007,positive,omg i remember this movie i allways used to describe the lead actor as the guy from godzilla
Jul 5 2007,negative,ultimate hollywood suckage
Jul 5 2007,positive,the graphics are horriable but at the time i really wanted to see this and thought it was good 7 out of 10
Jul 5 2007,negative,horrible a huge iguana attacks new york and lays eggs in msg its a fucking iguana  not godzilla
Jul 5 2007,negative,i keep picking this up in the sales thinking it has to be better than i remember then i watch it and it doesnt want to end
Jul 5 2007,neutral,i love the castunfortunately the script just wasnt that great

Jul 5 2007,negative,dont remember what happens here
Jul 4 2007,positive,i loved it but then again anything with giant reptiles is my kind of movie definitely not as corny as the old jp ones but still not that good overall
Jul 4 2007,negative,really weird   not in a gewd way
Jul 4 2007,negative,good visuals but lacks the charm of the originals
Jul 4 2007,negative,how did they take a series about japanese stuntmen in rubber suits and turn it into something cheesy stupid and intolerable

Jul 4 2007,neutral,how do you lose a 10 story monster could have been so much better
Jul 4 2007,positive,i think i was the only person who liked this movie    toxic waste created godzilla and now hes on a rampage in new york instead of japan  one of the first cgi creature created the godzilla is really cool looking and the plot is different then the other godzilla movie the movie kept my attention the whole time give it a try

Jul 3 2007,negative,how big is godzilla apparently she changes depending on the shot the director wants

Jul 3 2007,positive,the best part about this movie was the puff daddy  remix of led zeppelins kashmir uh huh yeah

Jul 3 2007,neutral,i used to think i liked this movie but i watched it recently and now i think it is kinda corny

Jul 3 2007,positive,high action thrill ride see it
Jul 3 2007,negative,what happened to the sequel
Jul 3 2007,neutral,there could have been great things done with godzilla but instead this was done  its awful and its probably going to prevent future attempts at an americanized godzilla for at least a while  i mean cmon he never really goes away  even the movies fun cast couldnt save it  crap

Jul 3 2007,negative,man its an old movie i havent seen it in forever

Jul 3 2007,positive,could have been better if they didnt kill it
Jul 3 2007,negative,oh man was this bad
Jul 3 2007,negative,ugh  how could they do this to one of the coolest monsters ever  some of the effects were amazing but past that the plot was weak and the ending is incredibly awkward  if they do a sequel i hope another studioteam does it

Jul 2 2007,positive,i didnt hate it as much as most but very cheesy makes the mummys shitty lines look good
Jul 2 2007,neutral,hmm one of the better modern emmerich movies but no comparison to his former work in germany a monster movie as bad as jacksons king kong you can never really sympathize with the characters brodericks love interest story submerges almost entirely and its a cheesy addition to an already cheesy movie oh yeah the effects are great thats about it dont look for a plausible story line and tiny raptors at madison square garden cmon gimme a break id rather watch the japanese originals at least they have a cult factor bigger aint better come back to europe roland

Jun 29 2007,negative,best song at the end
Jun 29 2007,positive,i gotta admit its pretty awesome the special effects are absolutely amazing and not only for their time 90s effects are not know for there excellence but even now many years later those effects are impressive half the movies that come out now would wish to have the effects that godzilla provided this movie manages to keep you on the endge with lots of tension but at the same time in some parts it feels light and laid back and that is definitely thanks to matthew broderick anyone whos an 80s fan love this guy no matter what and hank azaria both guys give out a chilling presence and with thei jokes make this story really pleasant  then theres jean reno great actor and gives and his character is one of the coolest in the whole movie for years i said that this film was overrated saw it again and shut my mouth because its actually pretty awesome and definitely immensely entertaining

Jun 28 2007,negative,if i had 130000000 im not too sure what id do with it    id probably buy a couple of houses go on a long holiday maybe give some to charity    i emphatically would not make a truly terrible monster film and if for some reason i did i definitely wouldnt cast matthew fucking broderick in the lead role
Jun 28 2007,positive,corney but what else would you have for the giant lizard
Jun 28 2007,positive,coulda been better coulda been worse  but you cant go around setting up the movie for a sequel and not make a sequel

Jun 28 2007,positive,corny like every disaster movie but godzilla does kick ass
Jun 28 2007,negative,matthew broderick really pisses me off and this was just very lame
Jun 28 2007,negative,films released in the years just before this one forced them to find new buildings to blow upmadison square garden  sure the effects were better in this than in previous godzilla movies but half of them were shots of a tail sliding into an alley or an eye in a window partially obscured by a venetian blind  oh my its like he was right there
Jun 28 2007,positive,actually it was pretty fun
Jun 28 2007,neutral,poor matthew broderic was not cast well here

Jun 27 2007,neutral,humorous but the effects in jurrasic park were better
Jun 27 2007,positive,a good monster movie
Jun 27 2007,negative,this was supposed to be the great summer blockbuster that could revive the great godzilla legacy it was expensive had a ton of promotion and excellent high profile soundtrack to push the movie and it failed miserably godzilla ends up being a stealthy ninjalike monster that disappears in new york which is a disaster godzilla is supposed to be a force of nature that hides from no one and nothing the movie rightfully tried to add depth and characters to add complexity to the legend but this was in vein the plot ends up being a weak point of the movie with the mayor making overly stupid bad choices matthew broderick and his crew adding nothing of value somehow it managed to be boring and fails at one of the simplest forms of movies ever the monster flick it lacks finesse fails to form a plot and does not even make a good use of its extensive special effects but at least the soundtrack was excellent if you are even considering watching this movie stop yourself and simply rewatch jurassic park
Jun 27 2007,negative,run matthew broderick run
Jun 27 2007,negative,when i first saw this movie i was very young and i enjoyed it but now that ive revisited it i see how hokey it is and i dont mean good hokey like the japanese ones cranked out practically bimonthly but bad hokey matthew broderick is fun to watch when hes playing hookey or producing a play but otherwise not so good alltogether not that great
Jun 27 2007,negative,i love the originals  but this wasnt a fitting homage

Jun 27 2007,negative,never again  why matthew broderick  why
Jun 27 2007,positive,for what you would expect from this film you do get what you want and its not too disappointing good special effects action scenes and suspense fun and entertaining looooooooads of ludicrous bits especially when it comes to miraculous escapes from death and it looks as though the giant lizard changes size at times
Jun 27 2007,negative,deserves to be buried under the earth
Jun 27 2007,positive,the more you watch it the better it gets though the creatures look dated now
Jun 27 2007,negative,the only thing right in this movie is jean reno
Jun 27 2007,neutral,this lizard is not gojira
Jun 27 2007,negative,i fuckin love the originals this was terrible horrendous mistake why do we americans keep making japanese gold into shit except for some but for the most part its shit and where the fuck was mothra

Jun 26 2007,negative,horrible  simply horrible
Jun 26 2007,negative,watching a movie called godzilla should not compare unfavorably with scraping a cheesegrater against ones scrotum  completely stupid and boring

Jun 26 2007,negative,one of the worst films ever  poor matthew broderick
Jun 26 2007,neutral,i was excited for thisthen disappointed
Jun 26 2007,negative,i barely remember this movie being quite funny
Jun 26 2007,positive,matthew broderick is not an action hero the leading lady is not appealing and sexy but theyre both loveable plus the twist that gives the godzilla creature its motive is interesting its an american comedy of a japanese cheesefest and it looks it but its enjoyable all the same
Jun 26 2007,positive,this movie was ok  a one time watch kinda movie
Jun 26 2007,negative,prolly the worst godzilla adaptation ever
Jun 26 2007,negative,terrible terrible terrible seriously this movie was bad

Jun 26 2007,positive,ill give it 312 because i liked it when i was so young and naive
Jun 26 2007,positive,solomonster loves this
Jun 26 2007,negative,further proof that roland emmerich knows nothing about cinema  and annoying music  and matthew broderick
Jun 26 2007,positive,see waterworld not the worst thing you will ever see in your life but others would have you believe that because of the disappointment they felt when the legendary rubber suited monster was given an average summer popcorn flick as tribute
Jun 26 2007,negative,maybe it was better when i was a kid
Jun 26 2007,positive,watched it so many times in theatre
Jun 25 2007,positive,i used to be blinded by the then spectacular and still believable special effects but this movie could have been better broderick is in gawking scientist mode and the french save the day that alone makes it irksome

Jun 25 2007,neutral,i actually enjoyed this
Jun 25 2007,neutral,i wish broderick would have busted out in song and dance rather than kill the giant lizard
Jun 25 2007,negative,watched about a million times
Jun 25 2007,negative,how could roland emmerich matthew broderick and a budget of cosmic proportions fail so miserably easy by rejecting the source material and so an amazing opportunity to bring back giant monster movies passed our country by leaving behind only a sour taste and a surprisingly good animated series but it did revive godzilla movies in japan so i credit where credit is do still avoid it
Jun 25 2007,negative,a big boooo good effects though
Jun 25 2007,neutral,when i first saw it when i was young i thought this was totally awesome now looking back it kind of sucked
Jun 25 2007,positive,i cant believe it was that long ago
Jun 25 2007,negative,oh man is this crap and its a shame too because it has some good people in it
Jun 25 2007,positive,cool movie but what comes after the end  it sets up for a sequel
Jun 25 2007,positive,i finally got around to seeing the japanese version and it could be described in one word  shit  the american version is one million times better
Jun 25 2007,negative,is this real unfortunately it is
Jun 25 2007,neutral,cool when it came out boring now  give me the classic
Jun 25 2007,negative,all godzilla movies are stupid and need to die
Jun 25 2007,negative,uh decent but not worth seeing unless you feel like wasting a few hours that could be spent doing something productive i would have had more fun playing wesnoth
Jun 25 2007,positive,i wonder if i could freak out one of my friends with itim so mean
Jun 25 2007,negative,i saw this movie when it came out and i was even dissapointed as a kid
Jun 25 2007,positive,i love big lizard movies this fit the genre
Jun 25 2007,positive,i laughed all the way through this one xd
Jun 25 2007,positive,this is the film that really makes godzilla look cool
Jun 25 2007,negative,too bad jurassic park had rendered large reptiles nonfrightening
Jun 25 2007,negative,i still cant decide if this is just funny and kinda good or really really horrible
Jun 25 2007,negative,its just not the same without mothra and mechagodzilla
Jun 25 2007,positive,oldie but kinda scary
Jun 25 2007,neutral,ehcool when i was younger
Jun 25 2007,negative,a pile of giant mutated iguana feces
Jun 25 2007,positive,except for patillo and broderick i enjoyed this one  but it coulda been a whole lot better
Jun 25 2007,negative,one of the worst movies ever made i put 12 star but it deserves minus 5 stars
Jun 25 2007,positive,a godzilla from japan very great special effect has to mention the story is ok fine
Jun 25 2007,positive,great classic  i loved it
Jun 25 2007,negative,all i recall is p diddy sang on the soundtrack lol
Jun 25 2007,negative,i had the soundtrack to this movie
Jun 25 2007,neutral,it was my sisters favorite  but its also because she was 7 years old and liked dinosaurs godzilla etc  although the movie devalues jean reno a bit his performance in movies like ronin or professional gives him alltime respect
Jun 25 2007,positive,i like godzilla especially the cheesy japanese men in suits version godzilla combat as it were the power rangers fight scenes with zords are a good example of godzilla combat this is an interesting spin on what godzilla might have been like with a touch more reality minus japan plus new york again why not st louis i liked this film when it first came out
Jun 25 2007,negative,the worst of the godzilla movies and thats really saying something
Jun 25 2007,positive,slated by all comers but i liked it broderick has the charisma to carry it through and the monsters are better than any jurrasic dinosaurs who cares if the plot was mangled when the damn things about a giant lizard in the first place
Jun 25 2007,negative,fuck you matthew broderick
Jun 25 2007,negative,this movie sucks not for what it is but for what it isnt a godzilla movie  this movie borrows so heavily from jurassic park that you wonder if the godzilla name was bought just for the purposes of branding  if this movie didnt have the godzilla name it would be another highconcept emmerichdevlin creation a la independence day  unfortunately they picked up the godzilla property from toho and did not respect it which is a shame because this movie could have brought godzilla to the american mainstream instead he remains something that you have to be a fan to seek out
Jun 25 2007,negative,that is not godzilla
Jun 25 2007,negative,figuresit was the damn french
Jun 25 2007,negative,i still think they shouldve done it old fashioned with a guy in a suit
Jun 25 2007,neutral,from the makes of independence day and what a step backwards
Jun 25 2007,negative,what was the point of making this film again
Jun 25 2007,positive,lacks the charm of the old japanese ones but it doesnt totally suck awesome cgi work and the acting is at least tolerable
Jun 25 2007,negative,roland emmerich has never been known for master pieces but coming off of independence day he seems to have hit a new low the movie isnt entertaining and the bad thing is that they left it open for a sequel
Jun 25 2007,negative,step up from the rubber monster suites
Jun 25 2007,negative,it stinksthe critic
Jun 25 2007,negative,its a good movie if ur in to giant lizards
Jun 25 2007,positive,hey give the poor lizard a break willya
Jun 25 2007,positive,this movie is awsome
Jun 25 2007,positive,i only like this becuz my borhter was obsessed with godzilla when i was younger

Jun 25 2007,negative,every movie on this site is rated 35 youre killing me here
Jun 25 2007,positive,leaves you hanging at the end
Jun 25 2007,negative,i wish there was a way to indicate no stars i wouldve walked out of this movie if i hadnt been with a friend
Jun 25 2007,positive,for some reason i own this movie i randomly had the urge to purchase it for the price of 5 at walmart i remember being in awe of it in like 7th grade now its eh is it stupid yes is it fun yes hard to rate this one
Jun 25 2007,positive,could have been so much better
Jun 25 2007,negative,horrible typical disaster movie that would not end jurrassic park and independence day combined into one
Jun 25 2007,negative,this cannot compare with the original japan godzilla series period
Jun 25 2007,positive,actually a decent update movie  i enjoyed it the song by gob and i actually like matthew broderick no i havent seen ferris bueler
Jun 25 2007,positive,the 1st godzilla film with special effects and amazing ones too great film with great actorshow cool is a humongous walking and trashing everything dinosaur walking in a city like he payed the bill very cool awesome
Jun 25 2007,positive,good cg for its time i think they would have taken over ny personaly i think they down played godzillas ability to have a sequel
Jun 25 2007,negative,who made godzilla the french
Jun 25 2007,negative,should end before it does
Jun 25 2007,negative,this is not good this is not good      omg it couldnt be more true    well its a remake of the fabled legendary mythical japanese creature godzilla      matthew broderick  dr niko tatopoulos    jean reno  philippe roaché    size matters the movies tag line well yes it does in fact especially when you take into account your dealing with a pile of steaming turd aka this film    there was a reason i got out of bed and godzilla is not one of them  jurassic park was good king kong the original godzilla cloverfiled this on the other hand is what critics eat for breakfast    matthew broderick needs to stick to worms or get a new agent  noted his career is on its way out  jean reno come on man pink panther with steve martin and this  your making a scene  poor france    the effects are good but its so been there done that it goes without saying  and as for little godzillas another drought in script writing    the plot the music its all senseless box office mush      roland emmerich shame on you for inflicting this on me when i was younger    thank god for independence day
Jun 25 2007,positive,what did they do to godzilla also sprach bhavin

Jun 24 2007,negative,matthew broderick is a fag  this movie coulda been soo much better
Jun 24 2007,neutral,the only good thing to come out of this movie was the soundtrack

Jun 21 2007,neutral,nothing like watching this movie on a plane
Jun 21 2007,neutral,while this is certainly not great it is entertaining  although it is sad because godzilla wasnt a real bad guy  it was just trying to find a suitable place to lay eggs and get back to the job of being french  but the humans were scared and they had to kill it blah blah blah    some good moments and in 1998 it looks great  however now in 2011 it does not look good at all   that being said though it was fun and mindless
Jun 21 2007,positive,okay so it tried too hard and pulled a lot from jurassic park andokay maybe this was worse than i thought but its got hank azaria and that makes it cool
Jun 21 2007,positive,i loved this movie alot of fun but i love moster movies to so meh
Jun 21 2007,positive,even though roland emmerich and dean devlin totally destroyed what godzilla truly is an allegory of war and made him a giant lizard its still quite good the special effects and jean reno are just spectacular in this tongueincheek take on the monster genre

Jun 21 2007,negative,didnt really like this one didnt make any sense really from beginning to end and didnt keep my attention
Jun 21 2007,positive,it somehow makes us feel bad for a giant lizard running around stepping on people and thats good enough for me sure it has very little if any relevance to the original 1954 godzilla but that doesnt make it bad in its own way its brilliant the effects are among the best ever in a movie and the story drives it furiously
Jun 21 2007,negative,hank azaria was alright i wish more people died
Jun 21 2007,negative,i dont know how this ended up on my favorite moviesit destroyed my childhood
Jun 21 2007,negative,while hated almost unanimously i have to say that it is a pile of crap but at least its a dry pile of crap

Jun 21 2007,negative,godzilla ruined  tenyearold alex tomchak who had waited a month to have a birthday party so that he could watch this movie when it came out heartbroken
Jun 21 2007,positive,i like the movie for what it is but lets be frank for all of those real godzilla fans out there this lizard looks nothing like godzilla
Jun 21 2007,positive,aha all dinosaur movies appeal to me especially ones ending in death destruction and humans getting eaten alive
Jun 21 2007,negative,is matthew broderick ever good
Jun 21 2007,negative,a travesty  close your eyes and pretend the legend of godzilla wasnt tainted by matthew broderick in plywood mode

Jun 21 2007,positive,not the level i like seeing big g but i had to deal with it
Jun 21 2007,neutral,way to ruin 60 year old movies with men in lizard suits
Jun 21 2007,negative,loved jean reno i cant really remember the rest of the movie i think i was asleep
Jun 21 2007,neutral,its not so bad but its no jurassic park in new york it serves its purpose but theres nothing amazing going on here
Jun 21 2007,negative,i actually took a date to that movie i only liked the theme song from p diddy due to him using a jimmy page rift in it uh hu yeah
Jun 21 2007,positive,ok i loved this movie but i understand that there is a very slim minority that would cry as i did at the sight of madison square garden being blown up by two f16s
Jun 21 2007,positive,i have watch almost every godzillai like this oneagainguns violence end of humanity
Jun 21 2007,negative,bad piss poor casting and a bad story that spawned a even worse saturday morning cartoon
Jun 21 2007,positive,actually really cool film
Jun 21 2007,negative,you think they couldnt make a crappy godzilla movie  well they can and here is the proof
Jun 21 2007,negative,forgettable and unremarkable does not do justice to the godzilla legacy

Jun 21 2007,positive,to think i only saw this because hank azaria and harry shearer were in it
Jun 21 2007,negative,saw it on tv recently i wasnt that impressed i was amused that they blamed godzilla on the french though thats classic it was totally the uss fault in the original
Jun 21 2007,negative,hmmmm well it was ok
Jun 21 2007,positive,its not great but as a kid i loved it godzilla looks brilliant and it just really works as a kids film ive seen it many times
Jun 21 2007,negative,not entertaining not fun just a drab irritating waste of time
Jun 21 2007,positive,love the soundtrack
Jun 21 2007,positive,ok this movie was just about godzilla layin eggs and theres no follow up which in my opinion was good so this movie i think was pretty decent least they explained pretty well how godzilla came to be but what i wonder is where the hell godzilla has been for all these damn years
Jun 21 2007,negative,jean reno gives this a little credit not much though
Jun 21 2007,negative,watch the japanese originals instead please this borders on pathetic  is just  below amzingly bad the acting is so lame  unimpressive that i found myselft siding with the monster hoping it would put them all out of their missery

Jun 17 2007,positive,i liked the movie although it didnt really seem much like a godzilla film
Jun 17 2007,neutral,what ever happened to godzilla 2 did i not buy enough copies of the dvd
Jun 17 2007,neutral,this movie was even worse then i remember  i went into it thinking that it was going to be one of those so bad they are good movies but it fell short of even that  the whole it felt like a really bad rip off of jurassic park with even worse special effects  2
Jun 17 2007,neutral,when i saw this in 1998 i was actually sort of enjoying the experience it wasnt very godzillaish but a nice city stomping was pretty fun and then it got to the scene where the monster gets trapped in a bridge and planes shoot missiles at it and im sitting there in my seat thinking ha ha silly planes missiles only make godzilla angry    and then it died like a bitch    that was the day i lost my youthful innocence damn you american godzilla damn you
Jun 17 2007,negative,another 90s action flick with a monster thrown in seemed to be trying to ride off of the jurassic park wave in its style
Jun 17 2007,positive,better than it gets credit for does some incredible stuff with rain and searchlights is engaging is it great fuck no but its good
Jun 17 2007,positive,i thought this was a lot less terrible than most people did  of course i love a certain level of camp and this had said level  also i adore broderick  and terrible lizards  and jean reno  and the soundtrack  so really i love this movie  get over it
Jun 17 2007,positive,one of the oddest remakes ever but i didnt hate it surpisingly they made a bad cartoon after it came out but i digress i watch this from time to time

Jun 17 2007,positive,yesss i completely loved it
Jun 17 2007,neutral,ok only cause jean reno is in this
Jun 16 2007,neutral,for some reason i got more enjoyment from watching the old godzillas
Jun 16 2007,positive,this movie is good but it is not as good as the original godzilla movies those were fun and campy
Jun 16 2007,positive,underrated film by roland emmerich that is fun and actionpacked take it for what it isand jean reno
Jun 16 2007,negative,i was so let down that even at the age of 11 i was pissed off
Jun 16 2007,neutral,really dumb and corny  but a pretty entertaining scifiaction flick jean reno is bad ass as usual and the special effects are good
Jun 16 2007,neutral,dumb but i love matthew broderick and i love a good cheesy creature feature
Jun 16 2007,negative,watch tohos godzilla final wars  unfortunately its not as good a movie as it should have been but at least theres a good scene where the american godzilla is dispatched pretty easily by the the true gojira
Jun 16 2007,positive,pretty awesome actually
Jun 16 2007,negative,one morning i woke up with gut pain running to the toilet i winced in agony as i shat out the biggest smelliest turd ever i named it godzilla in honour of this film half a star cause jean renos in it
Jun 16 2007,positive,good but not my favorite movie
Jun 16 2007,neutral,uhmm i have this movie and i watched it b4 but all i can remember is tha song at the end
Jun 16 2007,negative,the creators of independence day ruin godzilla sure every godzilla film after the first is cheesy as hell but they are all more fun to watch than this one
Jun 16 2007,positive,why did they never make another one they set it up for a sequel and everything
Jun 16 2007,negative,a massive letdown and a betrayal of a fifty year legacy  only jean reno is watchable in this film  emmerichs particular attempt to smear siskel and ebert is particularly embarassing
Jun 16 2007,negative,this movie should die in a fire  d
Jun 16 2007,positive,uhi was actually trying to find the newest godzilla movieso thats the one im rating
Jun 16 2007,negative,its impossible to make a bad godzilla movie  its supposed to be bad so its cant be i said going in to the theatre    coming out of the theatre my fists were clenched in rage at the writer and director silently cursing them for obviously working their hardest to make a bad godzilla movie and prove me wrong    i hated hated hated this movie
Jun 16 2007,negative,godzilla invades new york in this film and its bad
Jun 16 2007,negative,if it wasnt for jean reno this a total waste just a bad copy of jurasic park
Jun 16 2007,negative,computer graphics suck i enjoy my nonovergrown iguana gojira back in the day when weird little japanese men got into some suit with spikes and flailed themselves around thats the good stuff
Jun 16 2007,negative,great fx appalling script characters acting and cast a complete botch of the ideas and character of the japanese movies make this the 25th movie on your list of godzilla films to watch
Jun 16 2007,negative,i had low expectations for this movieand i wasnt disappointed
Jun 16 2007,negative,doesnt do justice to the classics
Jun 16 2007,negative,seen half of itpfft
Jun 15 2007,positive,good would recommend
Jun 15 2007,negative,japanese versions are betterdont waste your time
Jun 15 2007,negative,a story takes a back seat to spectacle  b the plot when not abstruse is nonexistent which is mitigated only slightly by the fact that it is also irrelevant  c the whole thing was dreamt up as a marketing and merchandising campaign long before the screenwriters ever put pen to paper  the fact that the film gives a big fu to movie critics siskel and ebert is a dire warning kids because movies that have contempt for critics cough ladyinthewater cough usually have a pretty low opinion of their audiences too  personally im not a fan of movies geared towards the lowest possible common denominator
Jun 15 2007,neutral,this movie lacks something very important and thats a frequen shot of the head of godzilla most of the time you see its feet but hardly do you ever see the head worth a rent if youre going for the action mostly just mindless fun
Jun 15 2007,negative,monster movies are not done right anymore
Jun 15 2007,negative,atrocious in every way possible
Jun 15 2007,positive,haha not good but i love it
Jun 15 2007,positive,the better of all the godzilla movies there are
Jun 15 2007,positive,jean reno fights baby mutant lizards whats not to like
Jun 15 2007,negative,the only reason i watched this again is because my son loves dinosaurs
Jun 15 2007,negative,well they pretty much screwed up this film but if you want a laugh and see godzilla kick some butt then watch it
Jun 15 2007,negative,im curious as to exactly what everyone involved in this movie thought they were doing the end result bears almost no resemblence to godzilla and in actuality is nothing less than an uncredited remake of the beast from 20000 fathoms which was the movie that inspired godzilla in the first place the design of the creature supposed to be godzilla is actually quite nifty  too bad hes become a cowardly mortal hermaphrodite there is something seriously wrong when you call your movie godzilla and the titular monster does not destroy any cities the military does more damage than the lizard this time gets killed by three f18s and does not even breathe fire the film is somewhat entertaining if youre in a forgiving mood but there is certainly a lot to forgive
Jun 15 2007,negative,right off the bat i dont follow the series of godzilla movies based in japan ive only seen clips on tv or the internet so i fairly cant give any comparisons between this movie or the older japanese ones anyways roland emmerich is a bad director and i know i say that about many directors but hes just awful sure the man makes great stunt scenes but he just cant tell good stories to go with a giant monster cavorting through new york now im not really sure how this happened but he got some of the best talent in hollywood including broderick and jean reno and all that was left was bad acting all around if you just want to watch a cgi monster destroy new york go see cloverfield its much better for me this movie is short on keeping up with expectations cheesy and even was so sure of being a hit they included a sequelobvious ending that was just stupid
Jun 15 2007,negative,matthew broderick was the only saving grace in this film  otherwise its basically jurassic park 4  giant velociraptor in new york      on second thought i take it back  vicki lewis  shes totally hot hot hot hot hot hot in anything shes in even if its a turkey like this  
Jun 15 2007,positive,apparently im one of the few who dug this back when it came out  matthew brodericks kinda lame but cmon a giant lizard attacking new york  thats gold
Jun 15 2007,negative,this movie sucksreal bad
Jun 15 2007,negative,a cgi extravaganza and thats about it  go see king kong instead for the same effect only better
Jun 15 2007,negative,this is the only movie i have walked out of at a movie theater please save yourself the 2 hours and do something worthwhile with your life
Jun 14 2007,negative,i was a big godzilla fan but after i saw thisnever again

Jun 14 2007,positive,alot better than some
Jun 14 2007,neutral,this movie is dorkily awesome its amazing fun and totally asexual
Jun 14 2007,negative,godzilla in name only poor effort if you pretend that the creature on screen isnt godzilla you may enjoy it
Jun 14 2007,positive,i liked this movie when it came out
Jun 14 2007,positive,love it classic story
Jun 14 2007,neutral,it was quite the spectacle in the theatres and it packed a monsta soundtrack back when but broderick is a ridiculous headliner for an otherwise cool cast
Jun 14 2007,negative,i am a big godzilla fan and this was by far the worst godzilla movie i have ever seen godzilla doesnt have a littergezze louise american film directors went too far with the lizard concept hes godzilla not  izzy the iguana i was so glad when godzilla 2000 rolled on the scene
Jun 14 2007,negative,pretty lameit ends as tho there was gonna be a sequel but i think it would have been pointless
Jun 13 2007,negative,could have been a cool movieand then you realize that that interesting monster on the screen is supposed to be godzilla aaarrghh terrible all this movie did was prove that america cant handle the art of giant monster movies boo
Jun 13 2007,positive,blahtoo much fun for too little substancekiller effects tho
Jun 13 2007,positive,nottttt bad for a movie made in 98 another nice remake next to king kong
Jun 13 2007,positive,this was way better than everyone says it was yeah it doesnt live up to the japanese originals     but come on
Jun 13 2007,negative,so disappointing its kind of cool when the beast is running a muck through new york but the second half of the movie turns into a poor jurassic park knock off questions just have to be asked how the hell was it meant to get into madison square garden a building its bigger than and lay all those individual eggs stupid
Jun 13 2007,positive,this movie is quite similar to jurassic parkthe lost world honey i blew up the kid and the incredibles with a huge creature tromping around the city
Jun 13 2007,positive,ive only seen it 1000 times and every time i just love the movie more and more
Jun 13 2007,positive,while the acting in this movie sucks balls the action rules i liked godzillas new iguanaish look sure he didnt breathe atomic fire or beat the shit out of mothra but he did thrash the hell out of new york besides at least its not as cheesey as the old godzilla films
Jun 13 2007,negative,a giant walking pile of monkey crap can i have those 2 hours of my life back please
Jun 13 2007,positive,a well done update of godzilla
Jun 13 2007,positive,ok for kids a bit too long with way too many places where it could have ended

Jun 12 2007,neutral,it was cool but just wtf
Jun 12 2007,positive,it was a decent movie pretty good plot good graphics and fx
Jun 12 2007,negative,a fun movie on its own but an insult to the true godzilla
Jun 12 2007,neutral,an ok flick but looks a bit dump next to jurassic sounds track was the best thing of the movie
Jun 12 2007,negative,god  why    killed a classic 
Jun 12 2007,neutral,ending blows but its fun most of the way
Jun 12 2007,negative,this movie blew and puff daddy wrecked a fucking zeppelin song for it for that this movie deserves to get shoved up a 3 hookers ass and never be seen again
Jun 12 2007,positive,ive no idea why but i just love this film ive seen it countless times and still dont get bored i think matthew broderick is fantastic as well as much loved hank azaria action packed and emotional towards the end with a hint of an idea for a sequel that never was fantastic
Jun 12 2007,positive,great movie i liked it but its just not the samei mean come on godzilla is saposed to be trashing tokyo not new york
Jun 12 2007,negative,history shows again and again how nature points out the folly of man
Jun 12 2007,positive,its a guilty pleasure i love this movie
Jun 12 2007,negative,disappointing beyond comparison  nowhere near the quality of the japanese franchise
Jun 12 2007,negative,if i were to type the word filth as many times as it took for you to understand just what a travesty this film was it would encircle the milky way galaxy three times in size 12 font the effeminite monster was a weakling and a coward and a complete disgrace to the name of the king rent final wars instead and relish its demise at the hands of the king
Jun 12 2007,positive,a wonderfull movie for those who didnt really like the ones with a man in a costume wrecking a model tokyo this one needs a sequel
Jun 12 2007,negative,abomination is far too kind of a word to describe this mess  the original godzilla is far superior to this mindless overhyped pieceofcrap movie i wish i could give this movie a zero  the lowest i can go is just a half a star thanks to this rating system
Jun 12 2007,negative,id be a little more disappointed if the originals were good but since they are not i am not to broken up that this remake was crap too
Jun 12 2007,negative,aka how to ruin a monster movie
Jun 12 2007,positive,lol only reason i will watch this movie is because matthew broderick was my hero in ferris
Jun 12 2007,negative,this movie fails hard
Jun 12 2007,positive,props to the cgi i still love this movie for its action and sound effects really requires a movie like atmosphere to exprience the most out of this movie
Jun 11 2007,negative,one of the few movies i wanted to walk out on
Jun 11 2007,negative,only hollywood could crush a beloved franchise this bad  good thing toho studios reclaimed this title
Jun 11 2007,negative,things i learned from this movie   it is possible to ruin a movie about a giant monster that destroys cities
Jun 11 2007,positive,nowhere near as good as the japanese godzilla movies but it was pretty good nonetheless
Jun 11 2007,negative,yeah another goddamn crappy hollywood remake for mindless masses pure entertainment and pure special effect feasts yes there are people who like this stuff i mean do you really call that acting it became literally painful at some point    33100
Jun 11 2007,positive,this one sucks asss but godilla does own
Jun 11 2007,neutral,it was entertaining 
Jun 11 2007,neutral,this scared the shit out of me i was sitting in the front row ill never forget it
Jun 11 2007,positive,was a good movie but i like the original godzilla movies better
Jun 10 2007,negative,ahah did anyone notice how fast gino get his ass kicked in final wars ahahah i gave it half a star for the excellent car chase scene
Jun 10 2007,negative,pathetic just pathetic is it any coincidence that the baby godzillas resemble the raptors from jurassic park
Jun 10 2007,negative,lets not talk about this one
Jun 10 2007,negative,from the makers of independence day nuff said
Jun 10 2007,positive,this movie could have been a whole lot better  the story pretty much sucked and godzilla looked very very fake
Jun 10 2007,neutral,the beginning was good up until you actually see gino then it goes down hill yeah personally i would have gone with the original script where american godzilla battles gryphon
Jun 10 2007,negative,the only movie i truley wanted to leave the theater during
Jun 10 2007,positive,eish they should never have called this movie godzilla as this isnt the godzilla most people will know in that era but was still fun to watch a typical storyline about a creature coming to destroy the city and the heros saving the day verdict watch if you bored still entertaining wit the chasing running and screaming
Jun 10 2007,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i like the new look to godzilla the classic look is cheesy and if phenomenas like this happen this look seems more realistic than some stiff lookin guy in a costume the acting wasnt bad i liked hank azaria and jean renos characters the best and actually even that dude from desperate housewives i thought he did a good job playing his awkward character everyone here whos rating it a one i think was expecting some epical movie or something well its not get over it and just enjoy whats been done
Jun 10 2007,negative,roland emmerich goes from success to disaster with this his first movie since the 1996 blockbuster independence day  matthew broderick is totally miscast as the movies main character  overlong and with crappy action scenes the only good thing about this film is jean renos performance as the french secret agent felipe
Jun 10 2007,positive,those that side with traditional godzilla may not like it but its still a good flick
Jun 10 2007,negative,why the gum it makes us look americain   1 star just for jean reno giant killer lizards stopped floating my boat a long time ago

Jun 9 2007,positive,pretty good for a godzilla movie i thought  hank azaria is really funny
Jun 9 2007,negative,rather terrible but it has mathew broderick who sucks but not as bad as the movie does thats why i gave it 1 star
Jun 9 2007,negative,i cried in this movie because noone could understand her painshe just wanted to protect her children then i realizedhey i have postpartum depression and received counciling and realized the movie was crap
Jun 9 2007,negative,the ultimate failed blockbuster of 1998
Jun 9 2007,positive,probably my favorite action movie of all time along with jurassic park pirates and spider man movies
Jun 9 2007,positive,sure the godzilla purists hate it but i think its a great take on the story plus it looks pretty darn good still holds up a decade later to the cgi thats coming out today  plus it has hank azaria in it
Jun 9 2007,positive,at least it wasnt a guy on a costume stepping on models
Jun 9 2007,positive,i enjoyed this movie and appear to be in the minority  who cares if he is a lizard or a dinosaur  it was an entertaining movie and thats what movies are supposed to be  so suck it haters
Jun 9 2007,positive,good mathew brodrick flick
Jun 9 2007,positive,it is what it is i enjoyed watching it as a kid
Jun 9 2007,positive,certainly not great but it entertains me im in the extreme minority of people that likes the look of godzilla
Jun 9 2007,positive,the action sequences were amazing special effects were decent and it includes humor and thrillz all around every corner very good keepsake dvd
Jun 9 2007,negative,well now i know i never want to see another godzilla movie again in my life
Jun 8 2007,negative,i really didnt much like this movie just for the simple reason that it didnt really capture the feeling of a true godzilla movie for me yes i do prefer the cheesy feel of the older godzilla movies
Jun 8 2007,negative,not godzilla i only liked matthew broderick in this movie if it was called giant lizard who people think is godzilla but isnt then it might have been two stars but that is to long of title
Jun 8 2007,positive,it sucks but i love it
Jun 8 2007,negative,terrible first movie i ever walked out of the theatres on
Jun 8 2007,negative,its hard to watch this movie and not ponder what couldve been some of the action setpieces are excellent and a few of the jokes are funny but theres too much painful dialogue and snarky selfreferentialism to stomach
Jun 8 2007,positive,certainly not great but it entertains me  im in the extreme minority of people that likes the look of the iguana godzilla
Jun 8 2007,negative,worse than godzilla vs megalon
Jun 8 2007,positive,pretty sweet little monster movie
Jun 8 2007,positive,it was what i expected it to be
Jun 8 2007,positive,godzilla is an awesome dinesour hes one of my best friends best movie too i think a new one is coming out soon looks good
Jun 8 2007,positive,entertaining but nothing special
Jun 8 2007,negative,this is simply horrible  its been clear throughout the entire run of the japanese series that godzilla is actually a dinosaur  why would making him an iguana somehow be more plausible  its a fucking giant monster movie    also did they even audition people for the roles in this movie  i think the best actors in this movie are probably the ones who are voice actors from the simpsons  i mean seriously    also what the fuck is up with cheapstereotypical shots at french people and siskel and ebert  devlin and emmerich have proven themselves to not only be incompetent filmmakers but immature childish assholes at that    there is no better way to put it  this movie eats balls and washes it down with diarrhea
Jun 8 2007,positive,cheesy as hell but sometimes you just need a good bad movie
Jun 8 2007,negative,even the adorable matthew broderick was not enough to make up for this atrocity they shouldve picked a size for mr godzilla and stuck with it
Jun 8 2007,positive,this might be blasphemous coming from a huge fan of the toho godzilla but i enjoyed this film for what it is the cast is likeable and talented the special effects are good and the production values are off the chart emmerich and devlin manage to do what they do in every movie create an air of true discomfort about the security of our world whether the threat comes from aliens giant monsters or the environment as long as you get past the fact that its not the real godzilla you should have a good time
Jun 8 2007,neutral,not as good as the japanese version
Jun 8 2007,negative,hype kills case point
Jun 8 2007,negative,yea what to say about this onehmmm  first off not godzilla just some big trex this movie could have passed as a jurasic park addition if you watch the movie not knowing that its supposed to be godzilla its not all that bad but since it is supposed to be godzilla major point loss
Jun 8 2007,negative,this is the wrong godzilla the original one is great
Jun 8 2007,positive,i can beleive broderick as a worm scientist its a good fun action movie roland emmerich is a good big budget mess everytyin up director
Jun 8 2007,positive,matt does a gd job in this film all th trimmings included
Jun 8 2007,positive,what more can i say p diddy and jimmy page were my reason for liking this movie so much

Jun 8 2007,negative,pfff bit lame  a couple semiinteresting bits but overall lame
Jun 8 2007,negative,it just didnt know when to quit
Jun 8 2007,negative,an abomination our nation probably should have been wiped from the earth for producing this feces
Jun 8 2007,positive,amazing there better still be a second one tehe
Jun 8 2007,negative,yes run for your lifeits that bad
Jun 7 2007,negative,this was not the big g this was a trex crossed with an iguana this was garbage and an abomination in the face of the big g
Jun 7 2007,negative,bullshit fucking redo of everything and it shit all over the franchise glad this godzilla got its ass kicked in final wars
Jun 7 2007,positive,youll never look at reptiles the same way again
Jun 7 2007,positive,apparently not many people like this movie i suppose i am the odd one out on this one
Jun 7 2007,positive,this movie had an ending like it was prepping for a sequel but one never surfacedwhat happened tri star
Jun 7 2007,positive,broderick was not meant for a godzilla movie and who is this blonde chick seriously a love story in a godzilla movie  the only thing that saved this movie was the special effects what have you done to my  gojira america
Jun 7 2007,positive,saw this one and i did enjoy it
Jun 7 2007,positive,its ok loved it as a kid
Jun 7 2007,positive,not enough raptorserr baby godzillas
Jun 7 2007,positive,the movie was great it just wasnt really godzilla 
Jun 7 2007,neutral,i dont mind it too much
Jun 7 2007,positive,never seen a godzilla movie before i liked this movie i dont get why so many people didnt
Jun 7 2007,neutral,me gusta es soundtrack
Jun 7 2007,negative,this is not godzilla this is manure  you cannot or at least should not do godzilla without having badly dubbed english over japanese actors it just sucked
Jun 7 2007,negative,this movie sucks im a big godzilla fan the partners who made independence day cant make a good films
Jun 7 2007,negative,why the fuck did they make this movie 
Jun 7 2007,negative,i wanted to walk out but we were in the middle of the row and the german who i was watching this with  was too embarrassed to walk out
Jun 7 2007,negative,this is one of the loudest movies ive ever seen and i still managed to sleep through most of it you do the math
Jun 7 2007,positive,actually more of a remake of godzillas inspiration the beast from 20000 fathoms this is a fun romp  diehard big g fans tend to hate it but thats their problem 
Jun 7 2007,negative,what a piece of junk godzilla is americanized and looks and acts nothing like his japanese counterpart thankfully the real godzilla destroys this one in 5 seconds in the film godzilla final wars
Jun 7 2007,negative,i ran out of the theater upon watching this why because it was my second time watching it and i came to the realization that it was that horrible only thing worth while in it was jean renos preformance
Jun 7 2007,positive,raaahhhhh gd old 90s epic so its bit poo i like it merghh
Jun 7 2007,negative,this definately took something away from what godzilla had in those classic films
Jun 7 2007,neutral,i saw this when i was small it was boring
Jun 7 2007,positive,another film thats stupid but fun to watch
Jun 6 2007,negative,as much as this film ruins my favorite childhood monster theres something slightly entertaining about emmerichs overblown remake of jurassic park in the city
Jun 6 2007,positive,i dont know what that was but that giant green monster was not godzilla
Jun 6 2007,positive,ok okit sucked at the box officebut i liked it
Jun 6 2007,negative,an insult to the real godzilla and fans like me
Jun 6 2007,negative,this american redesign of the classic japanese series was doomed from the beginning really apart from a cool godzillas eggs concept this is just blockbuster rubbish
Jun 6 2007,negative,they ruined it utterly
Jun 6 2007,negative,garbage at least the david bowie cover by the wallflowers was badass
Jun 6 2007,negative,oh no there goes tokyo go go godzilla this movie was crap as i recall
Jun 6 2007,positive,robot chicken reference but it is quite interesting
Jun 6 2007,negative,a pretty lame attempt to cash in on godzillas name and jurassic parks popularity the american godzilla fails to capture the charm of the old godzilla movies actually it fails to capture anything that made the godzilla movies enjoyable or the awe of jurassic park and it only really works if youre ridiculously obsessed with dinosaurs and jurassic park doesnt satisfy youre craving for them plus the godzilla in this movie looks hideous in a bad way
Jun 6 2007,negative,it was so bad when i saw itso bad
Jun 6 2007,neutral,i really wanted this movie to be amazing because i grew up on godzilla but it ended up being ehhh so so
Jun 6 2007,negative,now i know why they wouldnt show godzilla in the trailers nobody wouldve gone to see it if they had
Jun 6 2007,negative,total stinker    read the original screenplay online  lament the loss of a decent modern gojira pic    roland emmerich  dean devlin can go fuck themselves
Jun 6 2007,positive,jean reno is too cool
Jun 6 2007,negative,i looked this movie up just so i could give it a terrible rating thats how much i hate this movie the plot devices in this movie are so contrived that it defeats the purpose of a 500 foot lizard rampaging in a metropolis the characters are so weak and 2dimensional that the more they try to act dramatic the more you are prone to spontaneous brain hemmorages by watching it so godzilla can jump through a sky scraper whilst it remains standing afterwards just like real life but cant push its way out of suspension cables riiiight if i could give less than 12 a star i would
Jun 6 2007,positive,not bad considering it is a remake of a japanese movie series
Jun 6 2007,negative,boring  i really hate to see matthew broderick wasting his talents on this sort of productplacement disguised as entertainment
Jun 6 2007,negative,the only reason i watched this movie was to give it the mst3k treatmentit worked
Jun 6 2007,positive,first movie i owned in wide screen so i have a soft spot for it
Jun 6 2007,positive,cheesy and corny and enjoyable
Jun 6 2007,negative,this movie puts a nice spin on the old classic
Jun 6 2007,positive,theyve eaten all the fish
Jun 6 2007,positive,suprisingly good cheesy in some bits and some jurrasic park inspired bits but enjoyable overall
Jun 6 2007,positive,solid film nice take on it but meh
Jun 6 2007,neutral,i absolutely loved this movie as a kid but looking back on it and watching it again yes it sucked it had a couple good parts though the classic godzilla movies are forever
Jun 6 2007,negative,i love jean reno but this is not the best thing he has ever done and might come close to being the worst
Jun 6 2007,negative,seemed great when i was 13 i must have grown out of it great score by david arnold though
Jun 6 2007,positive,one of those movies when youre in the mood for action and big lizards
Jun 6 2007,negative,sure size does matter but if its bad its bad
Jun 6 2007,neutral,this was kind of disappointing
Jun 6 2007,negative,if the puffy song is the best part of your movie you might want to check the story line
Jun 6 2007,negative,the trailers remain some of the best ever made but sjoe wot a kk film
Jun 6 2007,positive,entertaining and very i just did id4 emerich tragedy movie

Jun 5 2007,positive,this was like the first pg13 movie i saw in theatres
Jun 5 2007,positive,a lot of people bashed this movie but i really enjoyed it i would have liked to have seen some sequels to this movie but at least the cartoon series made up for it
Jun 5 2007,negative,the only redeeming factor is jean reno who automatically adds a star to where ever he appears
Jun 5 2007,negative,what probably sounded like the sound of cash registers ringing to many of the filmmakers of this update of the classic disastermonster movie sounds more like moans and groans to many audience members    i remember being really looking forward to this one but was highly dissapointed the story effects acting are all second rate and have been done in far better movies     think independence day mixed with king kong but worse    i must agree that the best to come outta this was a solid soundtrack including the heroes cover
Jun 5 2007,positive,i havent seen much of the old godzilla movies in a while but when i first saw this one i thought it was a great movie of its own  from the the opening battle between the us army and godzilla up to the air force neutralizing him was filled with so much action and andrenaline  the physical appearance of godzilla i thought was pretty cool even though the old godzilla looked pretty cool in itself
Jun 5 2007,neutral,silverchair are on this soundtrack too n
Jun 5 2007,negative,i realize why it was ridiculed
Jun 5 2007,positive,a good movie with a good plot and some serious scenes that were unbelievable
Jun 5 2007,negative,there is decent enough action and suspense in the film but as a godzilla fan i have to mark it down tremendously since this is a poor attempt at a godzilla film  in fact this film is about 100x more of a remake of beast from 20000 fathoms than it is a godzilla film
Jun 5 2007,negative,biggest flop of the year and well deserved effects were ok but acting was so bad youd almost think they flubbed it on purpose as a goof if they had spent a little less on marketing and  a little more on a script and acting lessons it might have been better
Jun 5 2007,negative,another piece of crap
Jun 5 2007,neutral,this was alright but when i said godzilla was a favorite movie i meant the original 1954 version

Jun 3 2007,negative,i thought this movie was mildly entertaining when i was 10
Jun 3 2007,negative,if matthew broderick had been replaced by christian slater this movie would have easily been ten times more of a blockbuster    were in his mouth man were in his mouth
Jun 3 2007,positive,come on you fucking snobs you know you got excited when the raptors are in madison square garden

Jun 3 2007,neutral,i was really disapointed when i saw the moviei expected much more than thatwell at least puff daddys song was good
Jun 2 2007,positive,a decent storyline but took a while to get to the good stuff i kinda figured out that godzilla was reproducing when you saw the blood between godzilla and the babies i think the babies were more into kililng then anything else more on a personal note dont piss off giant lizardz lol
Jun 2 2007,negative,awful and thats from someone who owns 28 of the 19 godzilla films in existance
Jun 2 2007,positive,i thought this one was super fun i know there are tons of people who didnt like it and to be honest im not really sure why taken for what it is a true amped up summer popcorn flick its big loud fast and fun its got just enough story just enough human dialogue and a whole lot of destructive monster this one is up there with some of my favorite summer action flicks
Jun 2 2007,positive,yes bring him to america
Jun 2 2007,negative,there are some things you dont do one of them is dont try to change the look of godzilla and another is dont make a godzilla movie two hours and twenty minutes long i mean come on i thought this movie would never end
Jun 2 2007,negative,pretty badwatchable yet roland emerich didnt get it

Jun 1 2007,negative,terrible this marketing blitz saw the plastic toys and lunchboxes completed way before the movie was
Jun 1 2007,positive,not as bad as people said  its light popcorn fare
Jun 1 2007,negative,ferris should have taken another day off i remember godzilla walking tall what the hell was this thing oh lets make it more realistic yes because a gigantic rampaging lizard can be slightly believable
Jun 1 2007,positive,after recently watching this again ive decided to rerate this sure its a terrible adaptation of the original godzilla films with little actual reference to the original films outside of the name however its very entertaining and the cgi is topnotch especially for its time
May 31 2007,negative,this flixster facebook app seems to have confused this film with the one i actually liked  gojira  and i cant seem to change my favorites

May 31 2007,positive,liked it even though it wasnt a popular movie
May 31 2007,negative,i just could not get through this movie  nothing against godzilla  when i did finish it i was not awake and i just never get that bored unless of course im watching another movie on my movie list movies that make you want to stick a knife in your head  then and only then
May 31 2007,positive,mediocre  i didnt have high hopes for this film and i was proved right this film is an all round mediocre affair some previous years summer blockbuster it has none of the original film in it of what it symbolized and meant for that era and audience though im sure that wasnt this filmmakers intention anyway i only got this film out because it has two of my favourite actors in it but what are the wonderful hank azaria and genesis jean reno doing here and what were they thinking its beyond me the cgi godzilla is impressive in size and design but im afraid there isnt a lot else to recommend this film to you the plot is completely predictable and they seem to want to squeeze the thing out as much as they can so that it really does get ridiculous and very boring the only other good thing about it is of course the jamiroquai song and i think the video is one of the extra features on this dvd still i give it 3 stars as there are worse things out there this film isnt offensive in anyway at all and will provide you with a distraction on a bored evening when there is nothing better on offer if you really want to see a big scary animal film watch anything else how about jurassic park or deep blue sea for starters
May 31 2007,positive,rolland emmerich has a thing for terrorizing new york from independece day to the day after tommarow to bad he didnt get king kong
May 31 2007,positive,its not really a godzilla movie but a good action flick about a giant lizard
May 30 2007,positive,who doesnt like a giant mutant igwana in there back yard
May 30 2007,negative,for the sake of humanity i implore you to not only to shun for viewing this monstrosity but also to discard or destroy any copy for death by suffocation is more humane than watching this movie

May 30 2007,positive,could have been better
May 30 2007,positive,love this movie sooo goofy

May 30 2007,neutral,the first act before godzilla is seen is pretty good
May 30 2007,negative,this isnt a godzilla movie
May 30 2007,positive,godzilla is a good movie now i know that its not true to the classic japanese films but to be perfectly honest i dont care the only downside to this film is that it drags a bit in the middle jean reno as always a legend
May 29 2007,positive,a great action packed movie i love the car chase scene near the end
May 29 2007,negative,come wit me    come wit me again
May 29 2007,negative,i was really disapointed with this movie
May 29 2007,positive,good but lacking raymond burr
May 29 2007,positive,really good  but killing off godzilla is unacceptable
May 29 2007,neutral,an american godzilla with an ending that begs please let us make a sequel we dont have any other jobs lined up
May 29 2007,positive,altough its a movie with poor reviews i somehow fell in love with it the best clichedmovie to watch
May 28 2007,negative,hollywood once again destroys a good thing  next time i hope they just burn the money rather than fund something this flawed
May 28 2007,neutral,watching this film was disappointing not a big fan of the way godzilla was created either robotics or computer generation falls short too modern
May 28 2007,neutral,not a bad movie just overhyped  probably not a movie youd watch again and again because its too damned predictable but good to watch if youre that bored
May 28 2007,negative,its a shame they cast broderick in this role because he is completly wrong and kills it if they removed the comedy this could have bin big but sadly just as it gets going it is made unrealistic by a terrible scrpit
May 28 2007,positive,not the godzilla i knew as a kid but not a bad movie
May 28 2007,positive,its awesome my son watches atleast once every day
May 28 2007,positive,pff they always kill the good things on earth

May 27 2007,positive,shrugs i dont think it was bad im one of two people but i enjoyed tristars godzilla a hell of a lot more than tohos original rubber fiend that i watched in my childhood    the movie was pretty well written it had its holes and problems it wasnt perfect but it was a good movie the effects were cool the plot was legitimate and well done the acting was good especially by french star jean renoand i dont care what you say the us godzilla or zilla as he is often known is way cooler than the original sorry
May 27 2007,neutral,its an ok monster movie  but its not godzilla
May 26 2007,positive,i want to see this again so badly the best godzilla movie ever
May 25 2007,positive,many hate the american godzilla but i dont this godzilla is plausible and much more of a real threat than any man in costume
May 25 2007,negative,come on the best part of the real godzilla movies were the bad rubber lizard suits stomping around mini tokyo
May 25 2007,negative,a dude in a suit is more entertaining  and its kids at the end were a total ripoff of jurassic park
May 24 2007,positive,cool as a mother fucker

May 22 2007,positive,this movie is alright

May 22 2007,negative,i hate roland emmerich films
May 21 2007,positive,the story sucks the monster is great
May 21 2007,negative,let the japanese make godzilla films  and why does godzilla look nothing like godzilla

May 20 2007,positive,the soundtrack was great
May 20 2007,negative,what a horrible movie i thought better of roland emmerich
May 20 2007,negative,godzilla looks awesome and has a greater emotional range than broderick or parker
May 19 2007,positive,cool cgi and action sequences but it still doesnt beat the original japanese gojira
May 18 2007,positive,so graphic and cleaver

May 12 2007,positive,absolutely awesome movie gr8 special effects loved it
May 11 2007,negative,piece of crap and big waste of money matthew broderick was totally miscast and some of the plot points are ridiculous and completely goes against anything you know of godzilla
May 11 2007,positive,great action monster movie
May 10 2007,positive,not bad  the premise is a little shaky but otherwise its an okay movie
May 10 2007,negative,this movie really should have been called time for gym class since its just as much that as it is godzilla

May 8 2007,positive,amazing grafics and great adventure
May 7 2007,positive,the american remake of godzilla is loud  the special effects are good but are about the same as jurasic park  taco bell promoted this movie  i still have one of the plastic cups they sold their pop in that summer  they kept the general premise of the original story a monster created by a nuclear blast  except being a dinosaur hes a giant iguana  they also blamed the french  the usa set of abombs in the south pacific too  but we get an interesting french character that way  and iguanas are from south america and the caribbean  there are a few species of iguana in a few pacific islands but not where the nuclear testing took place  but its science fiction that nuclear radiation would cause an iguana to grow to the size of a sky scraper or bring a dinosaur back to life anyway  basically the story is that godzilla sinks a japanese factory ship then crosses central america and jamaica and goes to new york city  in new york he hides in the sky scrapers and fights the army and trashes the city  they made the movie with a little tongue in check humor  in a way the movie turns out to be prophetic  this was before 2001 so the world trade center is in the center of all the skylines shown in the movie  on september 11 2001 the world saw the sky scrapers of new york trashed for real  it kind of takes the humor out of watching this movie
May 7 2007,negative,this movie takes the god out of godzilla
May 6 2007,positive,broderick was so good in this movie
May 5 2007,neutral,not as good as it is made out to be

Apr 22 2007,negative,hollywood really shouldnt remaike japanese movies
Apr 22 2007,negative,another terrible flick with a good soundtrack
Apr 22 2007,neutral,yeah i paid to see this one too  it was alright i guess
Apr 22 2007,negative,centerimg       leftsize3the 1998 american version of igodzilla iis cheesy ridiculous stupid poorly actedand somehow very enjoyable it kept me fairly entertained the majority of the running timeat least when godzilla was squishing helpless new yorkers and there were random explosions but whenever a human character came on screen i immediately felt bored the acting is very stiff and dull and the characters are downright idiotic but this movie isnt about characters thankfully its about the monster and whenever hes on screen i was happy sizeleft     leftsize3igodzilla iis exactly what youd expect from a movie directed by roland emmerich iday after tomorrow independence dayi its loud explosive and downright laughable turn off your brain and maybe youll end up enjoying it sizeleft       centerimg       centerbsize4colorlimethe bottom linecolorsizebcenter  centersize3big dumb and sillybut almost always entertaining even if it is for the wrong reasonssizecenter

Apr 20 2007,positive,ok saw it when youngforget the climax already
Apr 20 2007,positive,it was a good movie back when it first came out these days it doesnt really messure up

Apr 19 2007,positive,very long film too long
Apr 19 2007,positive,great film love watching godzilla destroy things war on monsters great film
Apr 19 2007,positive,seen itits well better than the jurassic park with well badly drainded mebored
Apr 18 2007,negative,this took everything that was fun and interesting about the original godzilla flicks and just took a big old dump right over it  painfully boring
Apr 18 2007,positive,wouldve been a lot better if they had lost the godzilla moniker  it was okay as a giant monster movie but in no way resembled a godzilla film  too bad godzilla is good for everyone
Apr 17 2007,positive,yes its a bmovie and yes the writing could be better but like most other roland emmerich flicks its got enough entertainment value to go around i cant quite explain it but ive always had a thing for stories that features giant monsters on a path of mayhem and destruction leastways as long as the special effects are good which is definitely the case here i can understand why some may dislike this film or even hate it but in my eyes this is an enjoyable guilty pleasure kind of comical though that they hired matthew broderick to play the main role not that hes a bad actor but he just looks a bit misplaced here  like a pacifist at an nra meeting or a teletubby at a rock concert well you get the point
Apr 17 2007,positive,when a movie is so bad its good it usually gets 3 stars and this is no exception
Apr 17 2007,positive,que in music any thing the japs can do we can do better we can make a better godzilla than u but at least they have the samurai and we can never take that away from them though tom cruise got close
Apr 17 2007,negative,you can tell that the guys that made independence day did this because they forced the classic monster movie formula into their cookiecutter disaster movie mold thus destroying the very essence of what makes godzilla entertaining a godzilla film isnt supposed to be humans vs a monster its supposed to be godzilla vs a monster with humans caught in the middle this film proves once again that all the cgi in the world cant make up for a single page of crap writing neither can crap acting for that matter as for the cgi vs rubber suit debate godzilla couldve been a fat guy in a green tshirt for all i care this movie sucked the end
Apr 17 2007,negative,the soundtrack was better than the movie
Apr 17 2007,positive,one of my all time favorites
Apr 16 2007,negative,if your a godzilla fan do not watch this  there was nothing that made me think of godzilla here  there was no main theme and not even another monster for godzilla to fight  they should have left this concept with toho and japan  if you get the chance to watch godzilla final wars you can get the chance to see this cg godzilla get destroyed by the guy in the rubber suit
Apr 15 2007,positive,i realy like this mutated lizard
Apr 15 2007,negative,this was really bad its right up there with the hulk movie
Apr 15 2007,positive,updating this classic monster movie series didnt do it for me sure godzilla seemed pretty intimidating on film but presenting him in this manner and making him actually a she given the gender was made female stole something from what made the movie so fun i guess the series really needs to be campy in order for it to remain entertaining
Apr 15 2007,positive,pretty good wished it would look more like the original godzilla
Apr 15 2007,neutral,great monsters and lot of destruction
Apr 13 2007,negative,its ok just a big lizzard really

Apr 12 2007,negative,starring matthew broderick jean reno maria pitillo hank azaria kevin dunn michael lerner harry shearer and vicky lewis  directed by roland emmerich  written by dean devlin and roland emmerich  rated bpg13b for scifi violence and peril and for some language  running time approximately 2 hours 19 minutes     centerimg  centerihmmmcause that looks totally real i am scaredicenter     not for the life of me can i figure out why roland emmerich is even allowed to make films his movies are always hugebudget scifi epics istargatei iindependence dayi this film and ithe day after tomorrowi and they always underwhelm this one seeing as its been years and years since i saw the travesty that is istargatei is the worst of his trasher films igodzillai is not at all frightening and the monster itself looks like a plastic toy the special effects are to be completely cliche and unoriginal anything but and the performances are poor at best trash b12 out of  db

Apr 11 2007,negative,the real godzilla would kick this ones ass and did in godzillafinal wars
Apr 11 2007,positive,amusing but not for long the time it takes for godzilla to make his first appearance is rather lengthy every second is spent waiting for the beast to appear and then suddenly out  of  the  blue  freaky noises fair entertainment
Apr 10 2007,negative,a ridiculous retread of an idea that only would have worked during the 50s  some impressive effects work but the plot couldnt be more unbelievable  matthew broderick just isnt right as a protagonist in this type of movie either

Mar 8 2007,negative,this is a perfect example of what not to do when reimagining a classic character  you want to take something that everyone knows and loves and give it new life thats fine  but dont loose sight of what made the character so popular in the first place  the monster in this movie was nothing like the godzilla that i fell in love with in the sunday mornings of my youth  had they have called this movie giant monster lizard attack it would have earned a half a star more  it still would have sucked though

Feb 17 2007,positive,i had hopes but then again i had doubts too im very glad that my hopes werent in vain the monster is hugemonstrous duh  well made and its motions are fluid and smooth yet massive and heavy the plot is pretty credibleif there would exist creatures as giant mutated lizzards to begin with that is 
Feb 16 2007,negative,hank azaria is the only thing in this movie worth seeing
Feb 16 2007,negative,dont like this film

Nov 2 2006,positive,dont ask me why but for some reason i like this movie
Nov 2 2006,negative,its time for another good idea  bad idea good idea  a modern day blockbuster retelling of the classic godzilla monster movies directed by one of the new generation of big budget bmovie makers which lends itself perfectly to the big screen bad idea  casting the hero as a bemused geeky wisecracking worm expert and thinking a bemused matthew broderick had the charisma to carry a bucket let alone a blockbuster and the leading lady being as desirable as a cold trout and as annoying as herpes and a truly woeful script which has no idea whether its a comedy thriller action film or gentle homage and making almost everybody less likeable then the big green monster and shamelessly stealing so many setpieces from jurassic park and so on and so on only jean reno as an oftunintentionally hilarious secret service man seemed to get the joke and played it as such and apart from the tremedously satisfying scene of the american gungho military getting their ass kicked satisfaction is at a minimum you will watch it but in disbelief as it sinks below the horizon marked quality
Nov 1 2006,positive,good movie but godzillas size didnt really seem to be consistant
Nov 1 2006,neutral,i loved this i felt so sorry for godzilla at the end of the film when will there be a sequel
Oct 30 2006,positive,if you dont mind its sheer ridiculousness its another great popcorn flick from the 1990s  and youve gotta love matthew broderick
Oct 28 2006,positive,this is a movie that had so much potential but failed to live up to the hype they kept some of the elements from the japanese verisons like the basic look of godzilla godzilla attacking a major city and causes chaos with the inhabitants and the army but the fx was excellent compared to any original godzilla movie in the past the bad side i found was the overall story most of the characters were not needed in the story plus some of the dialouge and humour was not that great plus the baby godzillas made me feel like i was watching a rip off of jurassic park if some of these elements could have been done different then maybe i could have given the film a much higher rating the film is still watchable if you have never seen a godzilla film in the past then you might come out watching this as a great film worth only a one time watch
Oct 28 2006,negative,proves you cant improve on a japanese man in a monster suit
Oct 26 2006,positive,this was a good movie
Oct 26 2006,positive,colonel hicks we didnt accomplish anything   dr niko tatopoulus no we fed him

Oct 24 2006,negative,whatwasthat
Oct 24 2006,positive,mike my bro loves this movie i think it is just ok lol
Oct 24 2006,neutral,bad ending but not a bad go by a hollywood person
Oct 23 2006,positive,get the feeling no one really likes it doesnt quite deliver everything youd expect but it is a good attempt and will hold the attention well just couldve focused more in other areas rather than filling the gaps with baby godzillas
Oct 23 2006,negative,forgettable the original 50s flicks were much better dispite the bad dubbing
Oct 21 2006,negative,weirdest monster flick i have ever seen extremely stupid story line and bad acting i graphics were pretty good considering it was made in 1998
Oct 21 2006,positive,a very good action movie on godzilla

Oct 11 2006,negative,ive seen this movie three or four times but can never remember anything about it  what does that say about this film or about me
Oct 10 2006,negative,without doubt or consent the absolute worst film in cinematic history

Oct 10 2006,positive,ultimate movie gotta love itexpecially if you ahve a large projection screenyes
Oct 10 2006,negative,i dont like this kind of movie
Oct 10 2006,negative,crap crap crapi hated this film one of the wrost films ever made
Oct 8 2006,neutral,what can now easily be described as classic roland emmrick          img           godzilla like much of directorwriter roland emmricks work is that amusing blend of entertaining logic meets the completely ridiculous  the science or reasoning triggering the plot and its continuing twists always plays better then any of the characters it involves  matthew broderick is hard to swallow and one can rightfully expect him to start whining directly to that fourth wall at any moment while on the other end of the spectrum we care far too much about godzilla  this isnt king kong this is a 200 foot tall about 10000 meters for my friends in iceland cold blooded lizard that is just a powwittle ittybitty baby versus the evil humans who end up killing it  notice the violin strings never play when any of the humans die now all we need is jack black walking up looking at the dead thing and exclaiming it was loving the bomb that killed liz  this paragraph sponsored by kleenex and dr strangelove          img           i give this movie a 54 out of 100  a great american twist to the godzilla tale that doesnt exactly accumulate to a great movie but it is quick hollywood fun
Oct 7 2006,positive,i think i saw the remake not sure
Oct 7 2006,positive,we are talking about roland emmerichs hollywood version not the terrible japanese version with blokes grappling in suits and falling on cardboard cities this film was slaughtered by the press who were clearly disappointed at it being a hollywood movie and not some deep emotional movie like schindlers list for those who just wanted godzilla to smash new york to pieces then the film did exactly that and surprisingly made godzilla almost seem like a victim for a film from 1998 the special effects are pretty outstanding and could stand up to comparison to some of todays lower budget movies im talking about the disaster that was resident evil apocalypse it was big and it was clever but thats all anybody would surely want from a movie about a giant nuclear infected lizard that attacks manhattan if you wanted something deep then dont watch this but if you want something that is bad ass and is filled with hollywood cheese and explosions then look no further to the true godzilla movie
Oct 6 2006,positive,in my opinion one of the heavily underrated disasteraction films of the last twenty years there is so much charm and delight here fun dialogue lovable characters action sfx and brilliant creature design its a shame they dont make more films like this these days of course if youre looking for any kind of realism youre at the wrong place and perhaps you need that special dont take it seriously blend of tea to appreciate this and other disaster movies often critiqued for their larger than life ridicule but damn is it a good ride
Oct 6 2006,positive,i like and i love the soundtrack c
Oct 6 2006,negative,this is a big steaming godzilla crap
Oct 3 2006,negative,the worst thing to ever happen to godzilla

Sep 26 2006,positive,love this film godzilla rocks
Sep 25 2006,positive,always good to watch
Sep 25 2006,positive,a massive trex goes to city and distrolls the city
Sep 24 2006,positive,i love this remake of the godzilla series i hope they make a sequel sometime soon
Sep 24 2006,negative,the worst godzilla movie ever made  plain and simple    if you want to see the true godzilla film watch the original 1954 gojira  no not the 56 americanized version with raymond burr but the original japanese cinematic response to the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki  gojira is so much more than a mindless monster film but instead proves to represent an extremely bold allegory against nuclear weapons
Sep 24 2006,positive,i watched it wen i was 5 an i had nightmeres
Sep 23 2006,negative,is it sad that godzilla is hotter than sarah jessica parker i saw this flick for a toonie shortly after they came out in a tiny movie theater in scarborough i also saw titanic there i think it was the same day actually wow i had my bad movie cherry popped that day twice ouch
Sep 23 2006,positive,im glad i bought this movie

Sep 23 2006,positive,fantastic another one of my faves
Sep 22 2006,positive,this is why i left tokeo its a gooden not a sceryb one like the lst just an action that pretends to have feelings everone loves a movie where america gets destroyed
Sep 22 2006,neutral,eh  decent graphics and the revitalizing of mathew brodericks career  so it was okay
Sep 22 2006,negative,bad acting and i wished they would show more of godzilla wehhhhhhh
Sep 22 2006,negative,that is one sexy mutant lizard
Sep 21 2006,negative,matthew broderick does not belong in this movie
Sep 20 2006,negative,it has its mildly pleasing comic one liners but that is it
Sep 20 2006,positive,i barely remember this but i remember i liked it more than the consensus
Sep 19 2006,positive,whos zilla and what kindof god is he
Sep 19 2006,positive,this movie scared the crap out of me
Sep 18 2006,negative,matthew broderick        im in charge of sympathizing with godzilla and being a geek lets kill it and act all sad     jean reno        first let us stare dumbly at it until it is too late to run     matthew broderick        many times     jean reno        yes
Sep 18 2006,positive,pretty good considering special effects could have been better
Sep 18 2006,positive,pretty good for a monster film kind of believable in a way it was good non the less
Sep 18 2006,positive,watch it for jean renos performance of an american
Sep 18 2006,positive,bsize3sunday sept 17size    54 langoliers part 1  2  1995 b bad acting doesnt railroad this cool stephen king miniseries  it is probably my favorite tv movie based on a king story  i love the material and how it plays out over its nearly 4 hour running time  for twilight zone fans and those who just like a weird story and dont mind some aging cgi visual effects and high school drama club acting  810 img        img        b55 godzilla  1998 b staggering effects staggeringly awful live action bits  yep the french guys are good but the rest is mostly terrible and groaninducing  unlike a good french wine this aint aging so well  i might even put this away until 2011 and then watch it again  although another big budget godzilla flick is being made godzilla 3d  610  img        b56 plunkett  macleane  1999b  i know  not horror  but it has a nice grimm look at times especially the exciting opening scene looking all sleepy hollow and stuff  i let it pass since im pining for another film starring robert carlyle called iravenousi but im saving that one for october  but this one is good with a terrific use of a modern score in an 18th century setting  the closing shot is great too  too bad the dvd is oop in region 1 because id love to watch this more often  ill have to stick with my lame vhs and one yearly viewing until they start printing this again  810 img          img    bsize1tagline  they rob from the richand just keep it sizeb d          b57 the beyond  1981 b i dont like this fulci horror favorite  it aint my bag for some reason  the dvd is oop now so im thinking of selling it for 60 or 70 on amazoncoms marketplace  its like brand new  want it  write me a check  its a really great movie i promise  p  510  img
Sep 18 2006,negative,doesnt even look like godzilla just looks like some giant iguana plus the story sucked
Sep 17 2006,positive,not bad better than thoughs camp japanese ones where u could tell it was some guy in a suit

Sep 14 2006,positive,lolloved this movie
Sep 13 2006,neutral,special effects were cool
Sep 13 2006,negative,centerimg   fontcourier newsize1godzilla sure does love that buildingsizefont   center   fontcourier new   roland emmerichs igodzillai opens up with various shots of nuclear bombs going off on an island filled with lizards jump forward a few years and a japanese fishing ship is destroyed at sea by some large creature in the water while this is being investigated more fishing ships are pulled under the water but many miles from the last incident      enter dr tatopoulos matthew broderick who is a researcher on the affects of radiation on animals he is pulled from his research in chernobyl to help figuring out what creature could have destroyed all these ships and left huge foot prints in the ground when it traveled across land it is soon discovered that this creature is making its way toward new york       the remake to igodzillai was a film i was excited to see back in 1998 i remember the huge promotion that was going on for the film which started many months before the movie was actually released so i went opening day with one of my friends and prepared to be entertained about halfway through the movie i leaned over to my friend and said this movie sucks to which he responded it blows      indeed igodzillai did blow very much for a film that was supposed to surpass emmerich and dean devlins previous film iindependence dayi  a film i dont think is all that great  igodzillai seemed to be void of anything remotely entertaining it had some elements that reminded me of the original igodzillai but this film was way off course for trying to be a igodzillai film      i dont care that the design for godzilla in this film which has gone on to be called gino godzilla in name only by fans of the original igodzillai films looks nothing like the rubber suit menace we have all come to know and love what i hate is that while he retains the same name he has none of the same attributes that made godzilla such a memorable character it takes about an hour before we actually see godzilla in this film and he is quickly shot at and runs away and it is almost another 25 minutes before he returns only to run away from gunfire this thing sure does love to hide       i have always thought that the worst part of igodzillai films are the human characters and their stories sometimes they work and other times they dont in this films case its characters are about as interesting as watching paint dry everyone in the film seems so lifeless and they all spout lines that are tailor made for a movie trailer but have no place in an actual film but because godzilla likes to hide we have to deal with these people a lot in the film      my final complaint is the jab that devlin and emmerich took at critics gene siskel and roger ebert these two gave negative reviews to all the films that these two men had made before igodzillai so i guess they thought it would be funny to create two dimwitted characters in the film and name them after these two look these two werent the only critics to pan their films and if they honestly felt the need to fire back at them for their thoughts then devlin and emmerich obviously take themselves too seriously       the first 40 or so minutes of igodzillai did keep my attention and i thought while rewatching this i was actually going to like it then godzilla appeared and the film fumbles from there and clocking in at a little over two hours the film feels long and it takes forever for anything to happen then the monster is destroyed in one of the most cheap ways i have ever seen size might matter for this film but apparently nothing else seemed tofont
Sep 13 2006,negative,hollywood ruined a good b movie
Sep 12 2006,negative,at least the cheap plastic suit godzilla had personality  the american godzilla is not horrible as a simple monster movie but not horrible is not exactly a recommendation and in the end this film just doesnt work  the main problem is this the two leads matthew broderick and maria pitillo are quite boring  not their faults perhaps since the roles are so badly written  meanwhile there are a number of great supporting performances jean reno vicki lewis harry shearer hank azaria etc  maybe if some of them were leads then the film might have worked better  oh well this is what it is an okay uninspiring monster flick
Sep 12 2006,positive,it was awsome in theathers
Sep 11 2006,positive,hmmmmmm  the giant lizard

Sep 8 2006,positive,not as good as ithought it was going to be
Sep 7 2006,positive,ridiculous comedy but entertaining as just a comedy jean reno is cool and mathew broderick is cool but we cannot shake off that ferris buellerness even in this movie

Sep 4 2006,negative,typical hollywood crap
Sep 3 2006,positive,141018 i will give this film a 3 again sounds like godzilla but is not the gojira we all know and love i assume they planned on making a sequel hence all the babies being born well hate to break it to them but the real godzilla aka gojira made a comeback this year a weak come back in my humble opinion but a comeback nonetheless not sure how someone couldve thought this film a suitable tribute to the original maker of godzilla tomoyuki tanaka but they did anyway in regards to this film i found it entertaining when i got over the lack of resemblance to the original enjoy it for the action film it is diehard godzilla fans will gripe and rightfully so but standing alone this film is a reasonably decent monsteraction film and will entertain for a couple hours oh yeah worth noting in 1998 according to a news reporter in this film the worst disaster in new york history was the bombing of the world trade centre both towers prominently make an appearance in the film wish they couldve anticipated what would occur in a couple years

Jul 4 2006,positive,great for its time though would probably be washed away by modern titans such as king kong i remember being intensely captivated by the story and acting and throroughly believing that it was all real ah how things have changed you should watch this and then see a recent blockbuster to see how cgi has improved
Jul 3 2006,positive,the main character wore an ugly hat
Jul 3 2006,negative,a monster bomb teehee
Jul 2 2006,positive,wow i have not seen this movie in ages but this was an exellent movie 2 seei think the director of this action  adventure science fiction  fantasy   movie had done a good job of directing this movie because he has made some good movieshe has made this the day after 2morrow independence day id4 nd a few other moviesthis has got some good special effects throughout this moviethis has a good cast of characters throughout nd the soundtrack is pretty kewl as well throughout the movie
Jun 30 2006,negative,img  right im probably being harsh on this film because i love the original so much basically the original is a wonderfully atmospheric morbid film with a strong moral message and a decent human story along with the godzilla rampage as well as a truly fantastic score this movie has none of that all this movie has on its side is some of the simpsons cast this is a generic crappy blockbuster action film but the badness is amplified because its supposed to be godzilla     personal enjoyment rottenb310b  as a film rottenb310  b
Jun 30 2006,positive,movie was too far fetched to be believable mathew broderick gives a good performance
Jun 29 2006,negative,ahahahai dont eve remember the moviewat happend
Jun 28 2006,positive,hey im all for dinosaur movies  size does matter im all for the tagline too   we have a young cute matthew broderick playing dr niko tatopoulos  a smart talking scientist hes called into investigate an unknown creature thats been spotted he realises that due to nuclear testing a rather giant lizard has been created  first sighting of godzilla was greatalright only got to view his feet but the impact of such a thing roaming around the city was huge  they set to evacuate the city meanwhile people turn to looting which is obviously the first thing that youd do in a crisis  seeing more of the godzilla really makes you appreciate the special effects in this movie good god the thing looks realwell as real as a giant lizard can look  i cant believe it uh he did all of this and we did nothing to him  ah thats not true we fed him  its discovered that the lizard reprodces asexually without sex but by cell divison the thing is nesting in new york and collecting fish to feed its young  the us military fail to kill godzilla after several attempts as if guns would do that much damage  we need bigger guns  its discovered that godzilla has made its nest in madison square garden there is over 200 eggs which rather predictably  start hatching five minutes after they are found meaning the team get chased by over 9ft tall baby lizards all born pregnant but initially trapped inside the building  which needs to be destroyed in order to prevent them being a threat to civilization  happy ending death defeat love etc etc godzilla 2  and yes this is similar to jurassic park although any movie where dinosours terrorize humans is
Jun 27 2006,positive,i have it and this is about godzilla
Jun 27 2006,positive,havent seen it in a while actually i thought it was was scarey when i was 8 tho
Jun 27 2006,positive,loved godzilla 1998 version its all i expected  and some i was really fun seeing something so old turn out so good well the original is the original but with the special effects of modern movies it was strikingly entertaining to watch godzilla was really huge and feelt as he she actually was really there and then not an obvious piece of animated clay or a puppet some critics has really sawed this jem of action it is pure entertainment and as that  it is brilliant highly recommended
Jun 27 2006,negative,ugh i was so scared during this movie the whole idea of some big monster attacking a city freaks me out i dont like the whole concept oh and the ending still sends shivers up my spine

May 30 2006,positive,sergeant oneal we need bigger guns     a giant lizard faces off against ferris bueller leon the professional and hank azaria in an epic showdown about radioactive tests big lizards with raptorlike children and the madison square garden    the team behind independence day brings an event film version of godzilla to the big screen its a big loud terrible movie that i cant help but enjoy due to its stupidity    dr niko tatopoulus the radiation isnt an anomaly its the clue     awful dialog awful casting and other strange issues make this into a terribly enjoyable film    it is fairly cool to see godzilla terrorizing new york even if some of the effects are iffy    colonel hicks we didnt accomplish anything  dr niko tatopoulus no we fed him
May 30 2006,positive,i love this movie and my fave godizlla too
May 29 2006,positive,so much destruction that i get it mixed up with that german band
May 28 2006,neutral,here we have godzilla the 1998 film i liked this movie in some parts it had its moments but you couldnt laugh at it and have fun with it like the japenese gozilla movies and i hated the ending where a new godzilla hatches when i left the theater i was just like oh no not a sequel but its 2006 and its pretty pointless to make a sequel now and it was pointless back than but either way i dont think they will come out with a sequel like 7 years after unless they come up with some great idea anyway overall i thought this film started out good and than it got ok and than it got really bad by the end but i still wanted to stay in the theater to see what would happen even though it was predictable im not the person who usually leaves theaters no matter how terrible a movie is i just sit there and watch anyway this movie is aok for a monster movie but it could have been alot better and when i say alot better i mean alot better anyway this is worth a rental to you know like see how it is but nothing more and i am out
May 28 2006,negative,can i rate less than half a star  screw matthew broderick for sucking as anything other than ferris beullers day off and screw roland emmerich for trying to make godzilla computerized and completely lame
May 27 2006,positive,godzilla man you rock personally i always liked you more than king kong and in that crappy imitation movie they made about you losing to kong its bull
May 27 2006,neutral,had great potential but just fell short of being something great
May 27 2006,negative,we didnt do anything to him  we fed him    cloverfield is on the horizon so it was time visit the last monster movie to hit new yorkand yes is still so so so bad     the biggest issue i have outside the faxct this is a shambles is you dont really see godzilla for the most part and when you do you wish you hadnt as he runs away from the armygodzilla doesnt run away from the army idiots  then you continue not  seeing godzilla when heshe hides like a lizard idiot and has some babies then another 60 minutes pass and its like watching a mini plastic jurassic park with all those babies running around    then you get a pretty great if not bat shit crazy taxi bit and a poor very rip off of king kong except you feel nothing for this monster as you aint been given the oppotunity    this movie was a huge disapointmentthe trailers were epically good it followed id4  the stars alligned for greatness andbam a giant lizard shaped dung calling itself godzilla lit up the cinema screen and you just feel abused this movies gets 25 rather than 15 because if it never got made the real godzilla never would have got to kicks its ass in godzilla final warsand thats worth all this heartache alone damn this movie is ass what were they thinking    youve caused more damage than that goddamn thing did 
May 27 2006,negative,thats a weird movieloll
May 27 2006,negative,ack roland emmerich again
May 25 2006,negative,horrible and pointless
May 25 2006,neutral,dont watch at 2am in a storm
May 23 2006,neutral,over the hedge 2006    yay cgi and adorable little animals what possibly could go wrong with ithis imovie not much actually its not dreamworks best movie but its a hell of a lot better than ishark tale iand imadagascari    godzilla 1998    i hear a lot of negative things about this movie especially from fans of the wellknown japanese lizard who think this movie is absolutely blasphemous to tohos traditional suitmation daikaiju movies im a godzilla fan myself but i didnt think this movie is as horrible as people say sure its pretty mediorce but the kaiju known as zilla or gino is incredibly cool sure it cant breath atomic breath like its japanese counterpart nor has it starred in campy 70s movies but i thought it had an awesome design    but still the zilla from the fox kids cartoon series that was based on the movie was a heck of a lot better than the movie zilla    godzilla final wars 2004    this is supposedly the last godzilla movie that tohos making for the next 510 years i guess godzilla needs a vacation from beating up king ghidorah or something anyways this movie boasts an impressive number of kaiju ranging from the okinawan shiisa god king seesar the american attempt known as zilla the sludge monster hedorah and even the kaiju godzilla fans love to hate minilla some monster even got a wellneeded redesign such as gigan who now looks more badass then ever despite all this many of the fights are pretty short and lacking a bit of that pizzazz that many of tohos monster fights have boasted over the years oh well awesomelooking kaiju suits and plenty of action makes this a movie that fans of the legendary lizard wont want to miss
May 23 2006,negative,so much hype so little substance
May 23 2006,positive,yes i acually liked this movie and i still do
May 22 2006,positive,i watched dis film when i was really small da night before i went thorpe park wiv ma family
May 22 2006,negative,from blockbuster veteran who gave us the day after tomorrow independence day patriot roland emmerich gives us some amazing special effects but the giant lizard deserved a much better update than this terrible annoying cheesy effort
May 21 2006,positive,i have no idea why a whole bunch of people around me say that they didnt like this movie it was a huge upgrade from the chinese versions of it long ago the visual effects were insane for it being a while ago the story was well written and i liked all of the characters especially matthew broderick i think that this version of godzilla is way underrated

May 13 2006,positive,ha ha ha so funny the love story between nick and that reporter is so cute

May 9 2006,negative,pretty bad broderick sux ass
May 8 2006,positive,this was a good movie much better than godzilla 2000 which came out afterwards
May 5 2006,negative,big monster runs around smashing things at times ridiculous and pointless however we are dealing with a giant monster movie here still consult king kong on how to do this well
May 4 2006,positive,the godzilla itself is an improvement from the rubber suits but the mushy areas in the plotline are pathetic long live godzilla
May 3 2006,positive,a guilty pleasure of mine
May 3 2006,negative,couldnt be worst
Apr 30 2006,negative,what the hell does this have to do with godzilla

Apr 23 2006,positive,very good most people think it is stupid but you gotta see to believe
Apr 23 2006,negative,at times the fx were topnotch for 1998 but the movie is just a steaming pile  plus it isnt even godzilla its a jurassic park knockoff  a cashgrab exploiting the popcult name recognition you might call it a trashgrab
Apr 23 2006,positive,haha the lizards at the beginning watching the nukes is awesome sheeeeeit this is like all i seem to be watching lately and i have no idea why late 90s early 2000s surprisingly i still dig this movie even though the cg gozilla is pretty brutal and honestly it does seem like a kiddie monster movie i wonder if they intended that but whatevs its still decent maybe a little long though
Apr 21 2006,negative,very disappointing and the end turns into the last twenty minutes of jurassic park maybe i just dont like matthew broderick as an actor hank azaria and harry shearer are wasted in this bigbudgeted dud
Apr 20 2006,negative,big stupid blockbuster all special effects and no charm
Apr 19 2006,negative,not too good no  but may as well watch the giant reptile do her thing
Apr 19 2006,positive,i think this is quite good its sooo japanese cliche though hehe
Apr 16 2006,negative,wow this was horrible the worst was puff daddys take on kashmir by led zeppelin but there were many ways in which this movie sucked
Apr 16 2006,negative,img    its taken me what 56 years and seemingly thousands of recommendations to watch this one  now i had a bit of a hard time rating this one  im not a huge fan of the mockumentary but this one is definitely one of the better ones ive seen  fred willard was fine as the commentator albeit not quite as good as i had heard  to me the funniest parts revolved around cookie  anyway since im about the last person on earth to see this one im not really offering anything new here     as for godzilla it took me 8 years to watch that one but there were no recommendations  it was better than i thought but it still ends up in the rotten category  ridiculous needless ebert  gene parody and campy but not campy in a good way
Apr 15 2006,positive,love monster movies this didnt change my mind at all
Apr 14 2006,positive,one of my favourites
Apr 14 2006,positive,i was gonna rate it 3 stars but when i got into it it was actually quite good especially near the end but i predicted the very end lol like soo typical
Apr 13 2006,positive,a bit excessive and more than a bit rediculous great visual effects cant make up for schmaltzy storytelling and godzillas original appeal was more political than emotional like king kongs all things considered though the film impressively delivers what it promises
Apr 7 2006,positive,good film as good as i expected when i first saw it worth buying just to own
Apr 7 2006,positive,some people had a big problem with this one i didnt i went for a monster movie and thats what i got personally i think its great and the special effects are some of the best ive ever seen in the cinema this was immensely enjoyable due to the big spectacular effect of it all but even at home though not as spectacular it is still a great watch
Apr 6 2006,negative,as im a big fan of godzilla and there are a lot of movies starring him that ive seen its easier to do them in groups    godzilla vs king ghidora good movie with the evil godzilla returning great scene with godzilla coming face to face with one of the japanese soldiers he saved on an island    godzilla this is the american godzilla the adverts for it were great the actual movie is not    godzilla vs mothra he sure was vs a lot another decent movie for all you godzilla fans out there    godzilla vs gigan if im honest this movie is really worth about a 4 or 5 but its a sentimental favourite of mine cause its one of the first godzilla movies i watched    son of godzilla sure its pretty dumb and all but theres some fun to be had here the more hardcore of godzilla fans will believe me    to sum up if you dont really care or like godzilla you arent going to be converted by any of these movies but for those he do enjoy him check out these except the us one stay away from that
Apr 6 2006,negative,a great way to ensure therell never be a sequel see example
Apr 6 2006,negative,im rewriting my review of this film because i didnt really explain why it got a bad rating off myself  i think that this is too corny and predictable i guess i had heard so much about it i was really let down and just couldnt stay focused on it
Apr 5 2006,negative,no reasons no excuses this film is poo
Apr 5 2006,positive,makes me smile the goodies rule all
Apr 4 2006,positive,people will not agree with me but this movie is excellant
Apr 4 2006,positive,not bad tho im still waiting for the sequwill
Apr 3 2006,positive,i know its bad  but i still enjoy this movie probably largely due to the fact i love hank azaria doug savant and matthew broderick  but also because there are some great funny moments that rescue this film from being a complete disaster there are also some good monster movie ideas here  but i accept there are also some awful bits
Apr 1 2006,positive,it creeped me out at partsbut cool movie
Apr 1 2006,positive,very good slightly far fetched
Apr 1 2006,negative,cheesy and badly directed just another wanna be jurrasic park
Mar 31 2006,negative,piss poor shouldve been called shitzilla the giant iguana crap movie doesnt deserve the name seeing this guy getting his ass served to him by the real g in godzilla final wars though worth sitting through the crappy plot of that movie
Mar 31 2006,negative,godzilla cannot be killed by missiles this americanized version of godzilla is hideous beyond belief
Mar 27 2006,positive,why is it raining in every scene matthew boringerick  godzilla looks cool
Mar 26 2006,positive,i actually thought this wasnt too bad of a movie  i thought it was pretty good and interesting  wouldnt mind a sequal like it is set up for
Mar 26 2006,positive,i just saw it because harry shearer nancy cartwiright and hank azaria from the simpsons is in it 
Mar 25 2006,negative,whoever said yeah lets do an american godzilla for the 90s was probably the same person to think hmm yeah actually resident evil does need a sequelwhat was that plot nah we dont need one of those
Mar 25 2006,negative,jean reno is in it that might be the only reason to see it i dont remember this movie that well but i think its because the space where the memory was has become a vacuum godzilla turned that part of my brain into a blackhole of thought i knew that watching completely mindless films would have an impact one day who knew
Mar 24 2006,negative,takes too long before we see the beast the storyline seems to be the same throughout the whole movie too
Mar 23 2006,negative,shoulda left the lizard in japan
Mar 23 2006,negative,the original japanese godzilla may have been nothing but a man in a rubber suit destroying cardboard buildings and roaring like an old armchair spring he still could have kicked the ass of this overgrown trex wannabe anytime  why is it that now that we have stateoftheart technology we cant even match the coolness of the originals  basically this film proves my contention that in some cases simplicity is a much better option  do yourself a favor and rewatch the classic installments directed by inoshiro honda a true master of the genre
Mar 20 2006,positive,always expected a part 2
Mar 18 2006,negative,ermwhat happened to his nuclearfire breathing abilities bitter dissapointment in that area redeems itself for graphics and godzilla himself
Mar 16 2006,positive,this movie took a lot of flack but its a great remake of a classic godzilla is cool and there are lots of action moments the babies are a bit of a let down though and reminds me greatly of jurrassic park
Mar 13 2006,positive,when this first came out there was huge hype and when i saw it at the theatre where i was expecting perfect it was anything but so i hated it  recently watched it again and while certain scenes like the baby godzillas chasing instep look silly the movie is fun to watch for the godzilla running through new york scenes  its a popcorn flick nothing more nothing less
Mar 13 2006,positive,i think this is the right film so many godzillas s okay so this was a good movie sham godzilla died
Mar 11 2006,positive,not great but not bad
Mar 11 2006,positive,its an ok movie for how farfetched it is  it done well 
Mar 11 2006,positive,a good film really good in parts
Mar 10 2006,negative,its not even fun on a stupid level
Mar 10 2006,negative,the name godzilla is misleading this cowardly lizard isnt him
Mar 10 2006,negative,the only reason i didnt give it one star is because of jean reno
Mar 8 2006,negative,it wasnot as good as it looks lets put it that way
Mar 8 2006,negative,hollywood took everything good about godzilla and fucked it up quite simply dire
Mar 6 2006,positive,wow this was a freaking movie especially at the end when you see the last egg hatch
Mar 5 2006,negative,honestly i hated this version of godzilla the fact that he died pissed me off they didnt call him godzilla for nothing but for what it was worth it was a semi decent monster movie
Mar 4 2006,negative,i used to like dis movietill i grew older n find it nonsensical
Mar 4 2006,negative,terrible film the producers of this film really seem to have ruined gojira if you watch this film you will see why they didnt make a sequel despite the plot twist at the end as if gojira would ever stoop so low as to bother attacking an american city anyway  tokyo is gojiras stomping ground and it should stay that way  other japanese films ruined by hollywood include ringu and sequels juon the grudge etc
Mar 2 2006,negative,he he he ferris bueller fighting a monster
Mar 2 2006,positive,good film similar to jurassic park the very end was predictable
Feb 28 2006,negative,yeah  whata waste  
Feb 28 2006,positive,hmmmok i guess reminded me of jurassic park
Feb 27 2006,negative,what a hunk of junk it shouldnt be allowed to be called godzilla
Feb 25 2006,negative,lets take a legend strip him of everything that made him who he was toss in the worst acting performance ever shot maria patillo and straight up rip off king kong and jurassic park mix it together and pretend its godzilla blasphemy
Feb 24 2006,negative,godzilla in name only just a movie about a giant lizard that eats tuna  watch godzillafinal wars if youd like to see him get annihalted by the real thing
Feb 24 2006,positive,this is a good film i wanna be godzilla yay bye bye buildings p
Feb 23 2006,positive,i like this movie i thought this movie was good though a lot of people i know wont agree with me though
Feb 23 2006,negative,an insult pure and simple not only are the plot i hesitate to call it that character work and acting all terrible and uninteresting but the title creature bears no resemblence to the godzilla we all know and love this movie is little more than a lame jurassic park ripoff that tries to cash in on godzillas name recognition
Feb 21 2006,positive,hubba hubba matthew broderick is cute q cough anyway i really liked it actually being a huge godzilla fan i loved how it was more serious yet it still kept the spirit of the originals i loved the details cg and the characters real nifty 
Feb 18 2006,positive,on hearing that this movie was going to be created by the director of independence day i was sure it will be just as great and full of sfx as id was this i found to be entirely true every aspect of this film was extraudinary and was a great way of bringin a japanese fictional legend to the big screen after soo many years great job roland definately recommended
Feb 16 2006,positive,all points for godzilla but why did they have to kill him he was cool just like king kong they just had to kill im    
Feb 13 2006,positive,it was worth the hype
Feb 11 2006,positive,all of the godzilla movies are classics
Feb 10 2006,negative,this movie started my hatred of matthew broderick i like him now though
Feb 10 2006,negative,kinda wanted to cry during this and not in a good way
Feb 9 2006,negative,this is not godzilla fastpaced yes with some nice scenes of destruction but hardly what it should have been and why is matthew broderick here in the first place
Feb 8 2006,positive,classic  just as good now as it was 10 years ago
Feb 7 2006,positive,excellent movie nice graphics definitly not what i expected from a godzilla movie
Feb 5 2006,positive,nice movie and rage against the machine pitched in some songs 
Feb 4 2006,positive,it was ok but the original is always best
Jan 31 2006,positive,sniff i wanted godzilla to live sniff
Jan 24 2006,positive,another one of those movies that ended too soon which probably was a good thing it might have gone on for too long and gotten stale like other movies and television shows tend to do
Jan 21 2006,negative,this movie is bollox  
Jan 21 2006,positive,very good and thought out very realistic and cool godzilla is a good movie and blockbuster
Jan 14 2006,positive,i was surprised that i quite enjoyed this after hearing it was awful its silly but done in a slightly tongueincheek way and there are some good action sequences
Dec 23 2005,positive,i think this is it believe me it is really funny and wicked
Dec 21 2005,positive,coulda been better coulda been worse just turn off your brain and enjoy
Dec 21 2005,positive,a rather average movie okay story good visuals
Aug 13 2005,positive,fontarial blacksize3colorlimeit may not be godzilla in a traditional sense but its still a decent monster movie i like the fact that the creature is explained insted of most of the original godzilla moviesexcluding the very first one the cgi was okay for 1998colorsizefont
Jun 11 2005,neutral,yesterday i watched 2 movies one was a film about a gigantic lizard that runs amok new york and destroying everything the other one was a film by the worlds greatest director about a guy stuck in an airport      godzilla the movie with the lizard is a film i had already seen i was about 7 when i saw it now that i am older and would probably understand i sat through it again it isnt hard to see why so many critics hated it so much but i felt the reason they hated it was because it was stupid thats not the reason i dislike it the reason is because of the movies slow pace and the constant reapearing of godzilla when he should be dead also it showcased mathew brodericks bad acting he is usually ok but he wasnt very good here the best i will say is jean reno and hank azaria godzilla merits  out of      the terminal the other movie was funny and depressing at the same time altough not spielbergs best efforts it was still a good movie it is almost shocking to learn that tom hanks wasnt even nominated for an oscar for this role before watching it i felt that itw as going to be the wrong ethnic casting but boy was i wrong watching hanks is like watching a completely different actor and you remember why he one 2 oscars back to back because he deserves them even though i dislike cast away i think he was better than russell crowe in the overrated but still entertaining gladiator the terminal merits 12 out of 
May 13 2005,positive,films deserving an honorable mention part iii     1  bmommie dearestb  faye dunaway does a fantastic job portraying the manicdepressive joan crawford  no wire hangersever     2  bshowgirlsb  so bad that it is goodpresents a nice opportunity to laugh at deceit     3  bgodzillab  yes it is a jurassic park ripoff but the manhattan setting was an interesting twist  i found myself feeling sorry for the big reptile     4  bjurassic parkb  the seminal dinosaur film  iffy storyline but great effects and action     5  bjawsb  ive never been able to swim in anything in which i cannot see the bottom since seeing this movie  dont go into the water
Nov 28 2004,neutral,centerimg    center   today i visit one from my movie vault godzilla movies are one of the best worst monster movies ever made no matter the cheap tricks and poor costuming from the old versions this new one brings us excellant visuals ok acting and the basic movie plot for a godzilla movie    center    center   the movies graphics were entertaining and some of the best at its release the scenes were dark and rainy in a manhattan island were a beast could stomp on a city other than tokyo so let that beautiful bean footage run and enjoy the new sceneray       the scenes were also laid out well you start the movie hinting and hinting towards the full picture of godzilla which leaves the first time watcher anticipating however it does get a little tiresome but how they did it and filmed it remains a plus       now that i have talked about the good points of the movie i shall diss it the acting was like a soap opera gone wrong nuff said       the story line isnt brillant but hey its a godzilla movie shut up the military blasts at it and tries the same idoit tricks like they did in old movies no change there the guy and the girl and a few men is of coarse that is all that stands in the way of godzilla and a group of idoits and guns like in the old movies however the change in the regular plot comes with a nest of little cute viscous and hungry godzillas this is a nice change but it comes in too late into the movie so its like trying to spark the interest of a sloth within 3 seconds       even though the idoit military is well ummstupidthey still managed to produce some nice action scenes and the tunneling of godzilla is way cool i kind of wished they would of used this more in the movie plus the entire evacuatiing new york is stupid because nothing happens with godzilla in that scene just some dump trucks the mayor complains about godzilla likes food they give him fish however a beast that size would have devoured all large quantities of fish in the area by the time the evacuation happened and would have gone after the people on the pridge which would have been cool not once were the people actually in major danger       despite what probablly would of happened the movie ends up with godzilla on a bridge after the people and fish are gonelol the big nest will be resolved things looks good however the surprise in the end make you think sequal instead they make a cartoon series it is noe 2004 the movie was made in 1998 thats 6 years of a possibly good movie and sequal turned into a crappy cartoon for saturday mornings for like a year the cartoon was so terrible i wished they never made it and they made a sequal so i could just skip the movie without a possiblity of accidently watching it like the cartoon
Jun 24 2004,positive,not quite amazing but still good what is with emmerich and destroying new york the guy really has it in for that city i like godzilla i think he looks cool i dont terribly mind that they changed his look every human in a monster movie seems to be a total idiot lets stare at the giant lizard while he thinks of how hes going to kill me when i could easily run away anyway still good fun some good cgi at times something about big things destroying little things thats always fun to watch its obvious its not totally based on godzilla just the giant lizard concept its still cool to have a modern hollywood movie with some better graphics and more money to put into the project not that the original godzilla movies are bad just a good modern western look at it fun movie 7 on 10
Jun 24 2004,positive,really not as bad as everyone makes it out to be i felt really bad for godzillai guess i was supposed to though typical roland emmerich stuffhe has to destroy new york mercilessly in every movie he makes        buprosub    some pretty good special effects  jean reno is always great  good animation of godzillas body  some interesting destruction moments        buconsub    some terrible cgi moments  i really dont like the changes to godzillas head and facei prefer the older version that doesnt try to look like a supedup veloci raptor  the combined iq of the people in this movie probably wouldnt match a person with downs syndrome  constant loop holes and bad writing make me wonder what they were thinking when they cleared this script
Apr 8 2004,negative,posted on 40804 0239  i corrected something 191110    i cant write this opinion as id like without giving away the ending i detest giving away the ending but given that everyone knew how titanic ended and yet went to the movie anyway i am excusing myself this one err     there arent many movies where im inclined to side with the villain generally especially in monster movies there is a clean clear line between who is good and who is bad this is not the case with godzilla     the stateoftheart special effects of godzilla can not remove from me the general meanspiritedness of the entire vehicle i dont recall a movie which while watching i found myself more inclined to support the monster over man mankind is nothing more than a kneejerk reactionary more inclined to wipeout than investigate      i realize that the premise of the film was that without mans violent intervention godzillas galore would roam the planet moreover i know that given the speed with which godzilla seemed to reproduce time was of the essence and mankind had to get the killin real quick     on the other hand everything man did in this film was based on assumption and fear yes thats how most beast oriented movies work but lets not forget that man in this film was represented by two ostensibly intelligent factions science and the military this wasnt a group of teenaged dweebs stuck in a cabin somewhere     it seemed to me from the start of this film mankind had one goal kill the beast kill the beast kill the beast except for the lack of torches and black and white film the people in this movie were no more sensible than the people who charged victor frankensteins castle     lets for example examine madison square garden fiasco here we have dozens of newly hatched godzillalings roaming around looking for food     what is our answer to this discovery blow it up and blow it up good could have gassed them but no  we had to ensure every morsel of lizard was obliterated     and godzilla himself  what to do about him why not give him some of the same first entangle him in hightensile cable which evidently would have been enough to subdue him  but hey now well never know and then pummel him with rockets until his tiny brain and big parental heart give out     was i supposed to feel badly at the end was i supposed to dislike the good guys and pity the bad was this some sort of strange statement about mans inhumanity to animal is godzilla some misguided environmental impact statement     now given my obvious dislike of this movies tone you might wonder why i am giving it any stars     the special effects are excellent the cast is a talented though wasted group of people and there are small touches that make it worth seeing and watching with utter disregard for plot and tone damage is incidental  godzilla doesnt go out of his way to lay waste to new york in fact he just exists  and thats enough to fell buildings     one wonderful touch was the sweep of godzillas tail all he needed to do was turn a corner and the tip of his tail would sweep across the front of a building and rip a titaniclike hole in across three storeys i love details like that in a film     would i recommend this movie to a friend only in the waning moments of the friendship
