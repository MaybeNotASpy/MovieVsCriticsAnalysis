"Mar 23, 2024",negative,"A cash grab with lame jokes... If you like the first one, then do yourself a favor and stay away from this Megamind."
"Mar 11, 2024",positive," Kids can talk about the concept of sequels. They can take away lessons about friendship and teamwork. The film offers an avenue to explore the techniques of animation. Heroes look out for each other. Heroes come in all shapes, sizes, and abilities. Same for villains, but villains only look out for themselves. Teamwork saves the day. Megamind learns to appreciate his friends and to express those feelings; he also learns the value of teamwork. Roxanne and Chum are loyal friends. Keiko learns not to listen to what others say about her and to only try to live up to her own expectations. Female characters prove themselves smarter and braver than some of their male counterparts. Animated characters are a variety of colors and shapes. A lead villain is a Black female, and a new tween character named Keiko (voiced by a Japanese American actor) says that because of her name and looks, she was teased and excluded, leading her to fulfill the negative expectations society had for her. A male villain is a mime with a stereotypical French accent. Female characters repeatedly correct, explain, pick up the slack for, outwit, and ""villain-splain"" information to the male characters. A female character is elected mayor to replace an inept male politician. First responders come to a city's aid. A tween online influencer fulfills stereotypes about her generation, which she says was ""born tech-savvy."" Cartoon violence includes all manner of threats, weapons, and injuries, but characters unfailingly survive and get back up to fight another day. There are falls, fights, electrocutions (showing flashes of a character's skeleton), hypnosis, explosions, laser-guns, and more. Kids are threatened by moving cars or falling billboards. Beloved characters face peril. Megamind and Roxanne pretend to be engaged, and there's discussion of ""romantic tension"" between them. They hug. Roxanne jokes that a tracking device Megamind has placed on her is a flattering ""invasion of my privacy."" A character makes a joke about putting on some pants. Parents need to know that Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate is the sequel to 2010's Megamind and is connected to a spin-off series as well. It's chock full of cartoon violence that isn't too scary -- threats, weapons, and injuries -- and characters unfailingly survive and get back up to fight another day. There's mild language like ""butt,"" ""poop,"" ""halfwit,"" and ""idiot,"" and adults drink from plastic cups at a party called a ""rager."" Main character Megamind (voiced by Keith Ferguson) and his friend Roxanne (Laura Post) continue their potential romance, pretending to be engaged and hugging -- it's suggested that there's ""romantic tension"" between them. Expect positive messages about teamwork and valuing your friends. Animated characters include a Black woman as a lead villain. A tween character named Keiko (voiced by Japanese American actor Maya Aoki Tuttle) says that she was teased and excluded because of her name and looks. Female characters repeatedly correct, explain, pick up the slack for, and outwit their male counterparts. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. Former bad guy Megamind (voiced by Keith Ferguson) is settling into his new life as a hero in Metro City when MEGAMIND VS THE DOOM SYNDICATE begins. But when his old villain gang breaks out of jail and comes to prepare ""phase 2"" of their original plans to take over Metro City, Megamind will have to think fast. He pretends his new hero status is a cover and that TV reporter/friend Roxanne (Laura Post) is his fiancée. Villains Lady Doppler (Emily Tuñon), Behemoth (Chris Sullivan), Pierre Pressure (Scott Adsit), and Lord Nighty-Knight aren't totally convinced, but they go along with his plot to send Metro City to the moon. Megamind is going to need Roxanne, buddy Ol' Chum (Josh Brener), and newcomer tween influencer Keiko (Maya Aoki Tuttle) to help him get out of this predicament. It's fun to see the return of this beloved animated character, both in this film and the companion series released at the same time. Even without the all-star cast of the 2010 original, Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate offers good-natured, fast-paced, kid-friendly entertainment that squeezes in enough positive messages to give the mindless action some purpose. Characters new and old are endearing: Megamind's inherent goodness, his ""complicated"" relationship with Roxanne, tween influencer Keiko, over-achieving buddy Chum, and the slightly ridiculous gang of villains. The film, from the same writing team as the original, peppers in some goofy lines and concepts, like Lord Nighty-Knight's un-scary new name and his soft spot for teddy bears, and flipped expressions like the ""bad old days"" and ""darkness fades to light."" This time around, Megamind needs to learn lessons about teamwork and valuing one's friends, while Keiko's character gives a speech about only needing to live up to her own expectations. She also delivers what must be the film's cringiest, clichéd line: ""My generation was born tech-savvy."" Likewise, female characters woman-splaining concepts to their male counterparts is not an especially subtle theme. The ideas are perhaps more obvious than in the original, which might also make them a tad less interesting for older audiences, but Megamind's heart remains in the right place. Families can talk about how Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate compares with the original. What's the same and what's different? What do you like better and worse about each?

"Mar 7, 2024",negative," DreamWorks as a studio is in a very weird place. Where their rival Disney is having a decidedly low moment DreamWorks is a mess of high and low quality releases with no seeming through-line between the movies and what they are doing with their brand. This was never more true than this week when we got 2 widely diverging sequels- both which nobody really asked for in the first place. Plus, we got Orion and the Dark a couple of weeks ago which they dumped on Netflix with hardly any publicity as if it was garbage (it wasn’t.) And who can forget last year when Ruby Gilman: Teenage Kraken was treated terribly by the studio and even Trolls: Band Together wasn’t given the publicity campaign you’d expect with that franchise (and it was terrible.) 
Everyone knows I am a big fan of the original Megamind. I’ve always felt it got unfairly lost in the wave of Minions and Despicable Me hype even though it is the superior of the two films. I even have the artbook for the original Megamind. I find it funny, inventive with great vocal performances. Unfortunately DreamWorks did not live up to the legacy of the original with this terrible sequel. It fails in pretty much every respect and isn’t even enjoyable as a cheap introduction to the upcoming Megamind Rules television series. It’s admittedly tough to craft a hero story around Megamind but what they come up with is so bland that the 85 minute runtime felt punishing. It isn’t funny and the loss of our original voicecast is not only obvious but a clear sign of a lack of investment by DreamWorks. I rarely use the word cash-grab but it is accurate in this instance. I know some will say ‘but it’s just a direct to streaming movie. You shouldn’t have expected much.’ I review TV movies for a living and some of them are great. Just because something is cheap doesn’t necessarily mean it is devoid of creativity or laughs- an engaging script is very cheap! If I was laughing I wouldn’t care about the different voices or the weak animation. Heck I’m someone that LOVED Son of Bigfoot and that looks like a direct to dvd animated film from the outside but it’s actually great! The fact is DreamWorks took Megamind and made junk and that offends me as an animation fan, critic and lover of the original film. How dare they! If there is a franchise from DreamWorks that is underrated it has to be Kung Fu Panda. I recently saw the first one on the big screen at Maven Cinemas and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s funny and Po isa very likable character. In my opinion all of the Kung fu Panda movies have been solid and I think I even enjoyed the last one more than most. I loved the story of Po and his 2 Dads and what it had to say. Now we have a 4th movie and once again they’ve made a solid entertaining entry in the series. In this situation Po is asked to successor to him as the Dragon Warrior and he isn’t comfortable in the teacher/master role. He doesn’t like change, which I think all of us can relate with. Then he meets a fox (who looks like a wolf) named Zhen voiced by Awkwafina and they confront a villain named The Chameleon voiced with gleeful abandon by Viola Davis. This is not a plot that will surprise or blow anyone away but it’s sweet and entertaining. I liked the way it was able to bring in the previous 3 films in both subtle and non-subtle ways and the script provided a good mixture of laughs and sweet moments. The animation and music are also up to the standards of the series. I really couldn’t ask for much more from a Kung fu Panda 4. So there you have it. The crazy thing is we have another DreamWorks film coming out later this year called The Wild Robot. It’s wild!

"Mar 7, 2024",negative,"The first had so much going for it, and this absolutely demolishes any momentum."
"Mar 6, 2024",neutral,"The effort is mostly about making noise, finding the writing unable to improve on the already low standards of the original film.

"Mar 5, 2024",negative," From the Movies We Would’ve Forgot Existed If It Wasn’t For That 14-Year-Old Billboard Still Hanging in Suburban Detroit Dept. comes Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate (now streaming on Peacock), a direct-to-streaming regurgitation of a piece of wannabe IP from 2010. Please contain your excitement. The OG Megamind was a medium-sized hit thanks to Will Ferrell and Tina Fey voiceovers, and a release during the peak CG/3-D animation era. It was perfectly OK enough to make a little scratch, but not inspire a sequel – at least until Kabletown and their megacorp ilk started plumbing musty archives for franchise revivals to fill the content menus of their money-pit streaming services. MvtDS serves as a feature-length launching pad for the Megamind Rules! series, and none of it retains the original voice cast because, well, money, probably — but also possibly the catch-22 situation of A-list talent not wanting to touch mediocre material, while the mediocre material could have been gussied up with A-list talent. As the one guy once said, so it goes.  The Gist: MvtDS is set two days after Megamind, if you’re keeping track, and why wouldn’t you be? We get a recap: Megamind (Keith Ferguson) is a bulbous-headed alien whose subsequent social alienation turned him into a supervillain, but what with one thing and another, he switched sides and became a superhero. Standing beside him are TV newscaster Roxanne Ritchi (Laura Post) and his flunky Ol’ Chum (Josh Brener), who used to be called Minion, and there’s a meta-joke here about legal reasons for the name change that’s both obvious and not funny, because aren’t the Despicable Me Minions also owned by Universal? The answer to that is “Whatever,” which also is the likely response to the existence of a 14-years-in-the-works Megamind sequel, and also the movie’s M.O. Yet we slog on, because we must. Megamind is still a Coneheadish sort blurting malapropisms, and Chum is still a strange deep-sea fish in an upside-down bowl atop a robot-gorilla body – except Chum wants to be promoted from lickspittle to sidekick, and Megamind is too thoughtless and egotistical to do it. So Chum quits to plunge toilets at a bleak greasy spoon, and eventually uses his smarts to turn the place into a hot doughnut spot. Meanwhile, Roxanne helps Megamind reorient himself as a do-gooder, and the plot introduces a Poochiesque kid character, Keiko (Maya Aoki Tuttle), a relentlessly upbeat social media whiz and Megamind superfan who wants to join his heroic cause. If any villains happen to be around, Keiko no doubt will Instagram them to death. Speaking of villains. In the local prison, we meet the Doom Syndicate: Lady Doppler (Emily Tunon) controls the weather, Pierre Pressure (Scott Adsit) is a hypnotist mime, Behemoth (Chris Sullivan) is a strong guy made of lava rock and Lord Nighty-Knight (Patrick Warburton) is a big scary warrior type. They bust out and wreak havoc and don’t know Megamind is a good guy now. They recruit him to join the evil party and he doesn’t say no because he’s a megawuss. Even though his mind is mega, it takes him a while to realize that he might be able to thwart their dastardly plans from the inside. Will Megamind get over himself long enough to reunite with Chum and defeat the villains? NO SPOILERS of course, but the villains surely won’t stay defeated, since they have eight episodes of a series to populate now.  What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: It’s about time Megamind got a sequel – even Space Chimps got one. What’s next on the list of revivals nobody asked for? Shark Tale Too? Surf’s Up and Down? Monsters vs. Aliens vs. Your Tolerance for This Junk?  Performance Worth Watching Hearing: None of the voiceover talent really stands out here, but I guess Brener seems to be enjoying himself (and is a reasonable enough replacement for the original Minion/Chum, David Cross).  Our Take: MvtDS opens with Megamind speaking directly at us, and I couldn’t wait for him to shut up – only 82 more minutes to go! The movie is formulaic down to its molecular structure: Mayhemic action, some world-building for the spinoff series, poop jokes, puns, malapropisms that are barely a cut above the Family Circus comic panel, etc. The animation looks like a glorified episode of Paw Patrol. It follows a wearisome prefab plot, and its characters are off the TJ Maxx discount rack. It’ll blend right into the Peacock kiddie menu alongside (checks notes) Dino King, Boonie Bears, Kung Food, Jackie Chan’s Fantasia and other sausage-machine fodder you didn’t know existed until now, and that I might’ve just made up? (Note: Trick question – they’re all real!) The 2010 movie, a passable-at-best superhero spoof, suffered mightily in the wake of the relatively charming Despicable Me, which bulldozed it in the popularity sweepstakes. And it continues to suffer due to a lack of creativity and the sinking feeling that none of this is anybody’s vision. The Megamind pseudo-franchise smacks of an idea spawned by marketing wonks in a boardroom hoping to generate content broad enough to appeal to “everybody,” but especially if “everybody” is a potential advertiser or branding-tie-in affiliate. (Will children like it? Who cares! The only thing that matters is if people in other boardrooms like it!) It’s definitely not art, it’s barely entertainment, and if anything ever felt like capital-P Product, this is it.  Our Call: Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate is vaguely comic genrica loitering in the Peacock menu, just waiting for exasperated parents to turn it on and keep the little monsters entertained so Mom can finally grab 10 minutes for herself and use the can in peace. SKIP IT."
"Mar 4, 2024",neutral," From the indie darling to the tips you need for day one of the biggest games to classic cheats and codes, Cultured Vultures has you covered when it comes to gaming. Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Given that it was written by the same duo that wrote the first Megamind, it’s no surprise that Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate has fingerprints of the charm and humor that made the original a cult film. Unfortunately, they’re too few and far between. Most of Megamind’s sequel is a cliched bore and has so many plot holes in regards to the first film that it’s hard to take this seriously as a proper sequel at all. In Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate, the previously evil Megamind (Keith Ferguson) is no longer, well, evil. He’s now Metro City’s hero, keeping the citizens safe and stopping villains from committing crimes. When Megamind’s old evil group hears about this in the news, though, they assume Megamind is only pretending to be good and pay him a visit, and so Megamind has to pretend to still be evil, all while thinking of a way to defeat his old villain syndicate. The continuity errors from the first film are astounding. Not a single character mentions the Doom Syndicate all throughout the original, but Megamind apparently used to be their leader. The syndicate claims they’ve been waiting patiently for a signal from Megamind, but somehow missed the events of the first film when Megamind took over Metro City. This sequel also claims that villains have been popping up since Metroman’s defeat, but the only villains we saw in the first movie were Megamind and Titan, and Metroman was defeated very early on in the film. Even disregarding the continuity errors, though, Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate is mostly just a slog to get through. The animation is a serious downgrade from the first film, and aside from one scene in the third act, there are no interesting camera angles or movements, either. That’s largely because, where the first film had all these great action scenes of characters flying or controlling grand contraptions, the Megamind sequel doesn’t actually have much for the characters to do. Instead, it’s mostly just Megamind doing his best to keep up the illusion of him still being evil, and a predictable subplot of Minion (now called Chum) quitting his work with Megamind and excelling in his new job at a restaurant. The set-up for this sequel feels more like a comedy than the first movie, and yet, the jokes also work a lot less. The majority of them are pretty groan-inducing, especially the ones that get repeated ad nauseam, and the new characters are too one-dimensional to be any fun watching. There are a few jokes that work here, however, and not just work, but boast traces of the witty writing from the first film. They’re not on the same level, but they do show both screenplays were made by the same hands, which is also evident in the way the returning characters are written. Megamind, Chum (Josh Brener), and Roxanne (Laura Post) aren’t nearly as fun this time around — and their voice acting isn’t nearly as good, either — but they also don’t seem too far removed from how they were in the first film, and a lot of the jokes that work stem from an understanding of these characters’ personalities. That said, they’ve also lost a considerable amount of their depth, mostly because they’re not given a lot to do other than try and defeat the Doom Syndicate. Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate also serves as the pilot of the show Megamind Rules!, and because of that, most of the movie feels restricted by the need to set up the foundation of a follow-up property. There can’t be any intriguing character arcs since this is mostly just a glorified prologue, and what it’s setting up isn’t compelling enough to make you want to watch the show. Whether it be as a pilot of a show or a sequel film, though, Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate has little to offer viewers that’s worth watching, especially if you’re a big fan of the first film.

"Mar 2, 2024",neutral," The original “Megamind,” released in 2010, was a fresh, funny, and heartwarming animated film with wildly imaginative visuals and A-list voice talent, including Will Farrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and David Cross. Fourteen years later, this new straight-to-streaming flick is not fresh, with derivative visuals and mostly nondescript voice talent. It is intermittently funny and briefly heartwarming, as though they ran the original through the washing machine a few times, and then faxed it. Its primary purpose is to serve as an infomercial for a new streaming series: “Megamind Rules” comes to your home screens this month. Since this generation of the intended audience was not born when the first film came out, it begins with a brief recap. Megamind (originally voiced by Ferrell, now by Keith Ferguson) was a fiendish villain in Metrocity (which he continues to pronounce to rhyme with atrocity), ably assisted by a tech-savvy fish who lives inside a bowl on top of a robot body (originally David Cross, here Josh Brener). This character was known as Minion in the original movie but is now renamed Ol’ Chum to avoid confusion with the very popular yellow Minion characters from the “Despicable Me” cinematic universe. When Megamind created an even more evil supervillain just as Metrocity’s beloved Superman-like superhero decided to retire, Megamind found that he could be a hero, and he saved the day, with the help of the city’s intrepid television journalist, Roxanne (formerly Fey, now Laura Post).  It is a promising set-up, as Megamind has to re-orient himself to consider the value of helping others and figure out what to do with the bad guys who used to be his colleagues. As the movie begins, he is going after a gang of criminals who dress as fish, though he takes a moment to say, almost wistfully, even admiringly, “It’s something the old evil me would have done back in the day.” He sighs, “Sometimes I miss the simplicity of the bad old days.” He misses even more when the previously devoted Ol’ Chum leaves because Megamind refuses to promote him to sidekick. By himself, Megamind is not even able to figure out how to use his toaster. And then his former gang, the Doom Syndicate, breaks out of prison and he must find a way to convince them that he is still evil while he figures out how to recapture them before they can proceed with their evil plan. He persuades Roxanne to pretend to be his fiancée and partner in crime. And Keiko (Maya Aoki Tuttle), a smart, brave young girl who knows all about new-fangled ideas like live-streaming and social media, shows Megamind that he can accept help from others. Ol’ Chum has his own adventures in a diner, but comes back to join the team as well. The Doom Syndicate includes a French mime, a fiery rock monster, a former weather forecaster who can control lightning, and a goth-y guy who has just changed his name from Lord Knight to Lord Nighty-Night and carries a stuffed teddy bear called Mr. Cuddly Snuggles. As this suggests, the film reassures its young audience by making the bad guys and action scenes more silly than scary, along with the ever-popular poop and barf comedy. It is less successful at understanding its intended audience when it comes to some of the verbal humor, not clever enough to entice parents to watch with their children, just out of touch, by a generation or two. Really, jokes about the “Titanic” movie, Simon and Garfunkel lyrics from the 60s, and nose hair clippers? Even more recent references are unlikely to land with elementary schoolers. When the Doom Syndicate puts on a block party the night before the big plan will go into effect, Megamind complains that he is “the victim of an impromptu rager,” urges the partygoers to use coasters, and then tells the DJ to “put another stanky groove in my pocket.” There are lessons about bullying and teamwork, and Megamind learns that what separates the good guys from the villains is concern for the safety and feelings of others. There’s also a very brief mention of the importance of voting and the power of democracy (and good candidates). But compared to the original or to more recent films like “Boss Baby” and “The Bad Guys,” it is slapdash and lightweight."
"Mar 2, 2024",negative," It’s been 14 years since Dreamworks’s least successful film of the 2010s, Megamind, hit theaters. Typically, poor box office performance spells doom for an animated film series. However, in the early days of the superhero movie craze, Megamind defied expectations. The film would go on to garner a cult following through the power of the internet. When you have a devoted fan base, the last thing you want to do is let them down. Unfortunately, that’s precisely what Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate does. The original film offered a clever take on the superhero genre with its heart and colorful characters, under Eric Fogel‘s direction, Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate feels more like a drawn-out trailer for Peacocks’s new animated series based on the franchise. Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate continues the journey of Megamind, an intelligent alien supervillain. After defeating his nemesis Metro Man, Megamind creates a new hero to fight. However, he must step in to save the city when his creation becomes an even greater threat. Just two days after the events of the first movie, Megamind’s ego is as inflated as ever. Within minutes of the opening, you can see that this is going to be a rough ride. Megamind returns to belittling his sidekick Ol’ Chum’s (formerly Minion) contributions, reminiscent of every boss who undervalues their employees’ efforts. This leaves Ol’ Chum feeling unappreciated prompting him to strike out on his own after being denied a promotion to sidekick by Megamind. Meanwhile, Roxanne Ritchi, feeling stagnant in her career, is inspired to do more after meeting Keiko Morita (Maya Aoki Tuttle), the Megamind fan club president. Despite helping Megamind save the city, Roxanne somehow feels inadequate next to a middle schooler with a large social media following. It’s jarring how quickly these characters regress after the progress after only two days since the events of the first film. Megamind’s former villain colleagues, Lady Doppler (Emily Tunon), Lord Nighty-Knight (Talon Warburton), Pierre Pressure (Scott Adsit), and Behemoth (Chris Sullivan) doubt his transformation into a hero. As the former leader of the Doom Syndicate, they believe this is just the next step in Megamind’s grand schemes. When they confront Megamind about it, plot details emerge that a younger viewer likely won’t care about. Meanwhile, adults who watched the original years ago will likely scratch their heads at the dialogue and character choices. Roxanne finds it surprising that Megamind has connections to other villains. She acts as if she is still learning new things about Megamind. All of this despite the fact that it hasn’t been two days since they saved the city. Further, in an attempt to build tension, it is revealed that Lady Doppler and Roxanne Ritchi know each other, leaving Lady Doppler as the only one who is suspicious of Megamind’s true intentions. Instead of standing up to his former colleagues, Megamind continues to play along as the Doom Syndicate. The villains want to go on a crime spree before enacting Phase 2 of their master plan, which looks to transport Metro City to the moon. This is difficult for Megamind as he has changed his mind on the villain lifestyle. It’s harder still now that he is alone without Chum there to help him. This prompts Megamind’s character journey of learning how to ask for help to defeat the villains. It’s surface level compared to the depths the original Megamind reached when subverting expectations about what a superhero movie can look like. The movie attempts to reach those same depths but never quite meets the mark. Ol’ Chum, as much as Megamind, goes through his own journey. The former minion looks to find an understanding of his worth separate from Megamind. However, since his character is largely sidelined to work at a donut shop, that is never really explored. Instead, we get a “woe-is-me” style attitude throughout, with Megamind having to solve the problems he created. As the film progresses it makes him more and more unlikable. It walks back on his growth since defeating Tighten in the first film. It makes me wonder who this movie was for. As it is it’s little more than a glorified promotion for the continuation television series. What’s most disappointing is that Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate doesn’t capitalize on its voice cast. In addition to the Doom Syndicate, Keith Ferguson as Megamind, Laura Post as Roxanne Ritchi, and Josh Brener as Ol’ Chum do their best to salvage a lackluster script that is more focused on puns and jokes than any real commentary. Voice actor changes are nothing new for animations that follow the first films. Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon have had very successful animation runs following their film releases without using the original voice cast. For the most part, this movie is passable in this department and not the distraction I thought it would be without Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and David Cross’s recognizable voices. Despite this, the plot tries to introduce characters that are the main focus of the television series. Unfortunately, this makes all the dialogue very surface-level with so many new faces. Further, the film never pays off on the career existential crisis commentary that the film began with. I came in hoping for the same kind of clever plot with the subversion of expectations that made Megamind a fan favorite. Instead, it lands as a content farm on an established IP. The result is a lifeless follow-up. While the villains are colorful and the Keiko Morita introduction is a great way to bring in a younger audience, none of these characters get a chance to shine or grow. At least, not in this film as viewers are expected to hit play on Megamind Rules! directly after the credits roll on Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate. This is painfully evident when the end credits song is the opening of the television series. While Megamind learning how to be a hero while battling villains as a concept for the series makes sense, it is lazy and disingenuous of Dreamworks to have this project be just a glorified hour-and-a-half trailer for the show. Ultimately, Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate plays like a surface-level made-for-television movie. The goal is clearly to transition viewers over to the franchise’s new animated series. While this approach has worked for Dreamworks in the past, this time they are ten years too late to capitalize on the following Megamind has. While the film boasts a strong cast, there is a clear lack of depth in the plot. This leaves it disconnected from all the things that made the original so great. In a time with so many great animated films and series of new IPs, spend your time with those and skip Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate. Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate plays like a surface-level made-for-television movie. The goal is clearly to transition viewers over to the franchise’s new animated series. While this approach has worked for Dreamworks in the past, this time they are 10 years too late to capitalize on the following Megamind has. I am just a guy who spends way to much time playing videos games, enjoys popcorn movies more than he should, owns too much nerdy memorabilia and has lots of opinions about all things pop culture. People often underestimate the effects a movie, an actor, or even a video game can have on someone. I wouldn’t be where I am today without pop culture.

"Mar 1, 2024",negative," It sounds like a perfectly good setup for some superhero shenanigans: After defeating a nemesis of his own creation, the reformed arch-villain at the center of 2010’s Megamind returns, finding himself in the crosshairs of his former allies while struggling with his new role as Metro City’s protector. But unfortunately, Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate never quite realizes its full potential. (Maybe that’s being saved for the TV series, Megamind Rules!, that’s launching simultaneously on Peacock.). Instead, this long-awaited sequel is a pale imitation of its predecessor, bringing very little to the table. The straight-to-streaming sequel is doomed from the start: Its disjointed script squanders plenty of opportunities for laughs and costumed capering. Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate doesn’t quite seem to know where the original film’s humor comes from: Megamind took some big swings, with a wondrously over-the-top Will Ferrell voicing laser-focused jabs at comic-book clichés that form the backbone of a well-made parody. This time around, however, Megamind just isn’t up to scratch. It’s telling that none of the original voice cast have returned. Sure, it would have required a miracle to get Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and David Cross back in the recording booth for a low-budget sequel. Unfortunately, their chemistry can’t be replicated, either, and while the new voice cast puts in a decent effort, it’s just missing that special something – the seemingly effortless back and forth between Ferrel and Cross, for instance. Keith Ferguson is riotously hammy as Megamind himself, but Ferrell is a tough act to follow – Ferguson never quite reaches the comedic heights of Ferrel's over-enunciated vowels and cackling monologues. Elsewhere, Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate’s voice casting is pretty so-so. Josh Brener takes over for Cross as Minion (who has been renamed Ol' Chum for... let’s just say Despicable reasons) and does an admirable job as Megamind's fishy sidekick. But there’s minimal spark between Ferguson and the Silicon Valley alum, or any of the cast for that matter, and this falls apart even further when it comes to reporter Roxanne Ritchi (now voiced by Laura Post).  The will-they won't-they tension between Megamind and Roxanne is all but gone, and a bland performance from Post leaves little room for emotion. Megamind may have gotten the girl, but now the poor guy has no idea what to do with her. This too feels like a missed opportunity – one that isn’t played for laughs but instead simply comes across as a flawed misunderstanding of the original film. Or worse still, a change of direction that makes no sense, relegating Roxanne from love interest to another dear old chum. Then there’s the Doom Syndicate itself – a ragtag band of evil miscreants that range from bland to slightly less bland. Sure, their squabbling and bickering over leadership of the group injects a shot of well-needed humor into the movie. Individually, however, they’re just not very original. Pierre Pressure (voiced by Scott Adsit) is too close a match for The Incredibles villain Bomb Voyage, and it only gets worse from there. A generic lava monster, a dark knight, and a garish version of X-Men’s storm round out the team, with designs that would look more at home in an episode of PJ Masks. Then there’s the team’s motivation: It seems as though the Doom Syndicate lacks direction, and their evil plot is as well thought out as “Let’s do something evil”. Why? Because it’s so evil! Again, this simply falls flat, turning these two-bit villains into two-dimensional caricatures. It’s a shame, really: Megamind played fast and loose with superhero standbys – secret identities, extraterrestrial origin stories, and the like – to create something that may not have been hugely novel, but was at least entertaining. No such luck here. Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate is a superfluous sequel that would be destined for the bargain bin if it ever made the leap from streaming to DVD. The over-the-top antics of the original are out, as is the original film’s cast, only to be replaced by an approximate facsimile that’s not quite good enough. The Doom Syndicate itself wrestles laughs some thanks to their bickering, but the heart and soul of Megamind has been lost in this pale imitation, despite a handful of decent performances. Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate sets up a riotous romp through superhero cliché, but simply fails to deliver."
"Mar 1, 2024",negative,"  One of the things that set the title character Megamind apart in the 2010 animated film was that his limited wits made him funny and kind of helped you root for him throughout the story. The sequel, which is coming out way later than one would expect, is tasked with showing Megamind as a full-blown hero with a villain background, as well as what that implies for Metro City inhabitants and the protagonist. But, even just a few minutes in, it becomes clear that Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate has no idea what to do with any of its characters.   Picking up only two days after the events of Megamind, the sequel centers around the villain-turned-hero (voiced this time by Keith Ferguson) learning to come to terms with his new identity. His life gets difficult when he is visited by The Doom Syndicate, his former team that still thinks that Megamind is a major villain who is devising a master plan to take over Mega City. Meanwhile, he deals with three allies who are trying to become some form of sidekick to the new hero.   The first head-scratcher from Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate is that you’d think there’s a reason for the creative decision of having virtually no time since the events of the first movie. It would make sense if the story focused on Megamind acclimating to his new superhero role and the sort of ethical decisions that come with the title. But there’s none of that here. Of course, we can’t always expect very complex storylines from a kids’ movie, but even Despicable Me’s Gru managed to have a less-than-basic journey from villain to hero. Also, the first Megamind was a wildly entertaining ride that had fun with superhero vs. supervillain tropes, while the sequel barely seems to know how to construct a story.   In Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate, the stakes are surprisingly low. While the title character struggles to protect his secret from his former friends, the group of villains never pose a real threat because they spend a good chunk of the movie waiting to see Megamind's non-existent evil plan come to fruition. Meanwhile, it’s never really clear why Megamind holds on so strongly to the façade that he’s still a villain. In the hands of more skilled screenwriters, that could make a pretty good conflict and/or identity crisis that formed the core of the story, but here it is just a stalling technique to make the movie longer than a TV episode.   At the same time, it would be better if Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate was advertised as the extended first episode of the companion series Megamind Rules!, because the production values certainly reflect it. For a feature film, Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate has a pretty underwhelming style, with lifeless production design and simple character looks that certainly don't help the story come alive. In the era of gorgeous-looking animations like Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse and The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Megamind 2 falls flat even if you lower your standards and compare it with productions from the 2010s, which would be more or less when this new story takes place.   It doesn't help that Megamind himself suffered a change in his voice. You wouldn't expect the personality of a character to be modified when the voice actor gets swapped, but this is what happens here. When he was voiced by Will Ferrell, Megamind had a fresh excitement to his tone that also hid a desperate attempt to be accepted. With Ferguson, all of that is gone (along with the strong accent), and the fact that only a couple of days passed between movies makes it seem like Megamind changed personalities altogether in the blink of an eye.   The same is true for the supporting characters’ voices and individual storylines. Roxanne (Laura Post) wants to do more than report catastrophes in Mega City, but Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons' script has no idea how to make the connection between where she starts and where she ends in the movie. In fact, her ending comes as a bit of a surprise and out of nowhere. Additionally, Ol' Chum (Josh Brener) wants to prove his worth, and that leads him to part ways with Megamind. But we never really see a journey for the character, and it seems like the movie just waits it out to put them back together, then call it evolution.   These kinds of thin plots are usually what you see in TV episodes that are basically designed to keep kids distracted. Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate ignores that there’s a whole slate of fans of the original who are now older, and the sequel offers them nothing. This would all be fine if the movie focused instead on being funny, but aside from a quip now and then, Megamind 2 is devoid of humor.   With vaguely established threats and storylines, Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate is the movie equivalent of meeting a friend you missed for many years only to realize that the encounter didn’t really need to happen. The movie does serve as an introduction to Megamind Rules! – especially due to the final scene – but it’s hard to imagine that Peacock didn’t just take some episodes of the show and bundle them together to form this movie.
