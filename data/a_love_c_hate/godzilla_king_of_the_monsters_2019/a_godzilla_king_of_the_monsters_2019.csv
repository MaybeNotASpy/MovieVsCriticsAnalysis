Apr 13 2024,negative,honestly as far as watching the third entry of the godzilla monsterverse movies this might as well be the weakest of the franchise  i have seen worse movies but in all honesty most of the human acting are just all over the place and doesnt have much of a pace to work with alongside the monsters that even i look back and see the godzilla movies back in 2014 being a fair use while kong skull island was much better  if it focused on the family and used the loss of a child and working alongside the scientists from the first movie instead of some of the rushed addons like the one guy holding the mother and daughter hostage it wouldve raised my rating higher  sadly this felt like a step backward with it  i still enjoy the cgi design of the monsters along with the fights  it was fine at its best but not the best as these movies goes  610
Apr 12 2024,positive,this was the perfect balance of an og godzilla film closes american version to a japanese version you keep getting more of the story and of the big guy
Apr 10 2024,positive,critics need to learn how to have fun not one of the best godzilla movies but one of my favourites its easy to rewatch and very enjoyable i know that the 1954 style godzilla movies tend to be thought of more highly than ones like this and i agree but its so much fun i can happily place it at 5 on my rankings its stupid but i love it
Apr 10 2024,positive,godzila go ra great effect and interesting story
Apr 10 2024,negative,it features some decent moments cool end shot but overall i was feeling rather indifferent throughout godzilla king of the monsters    a bad movie this is not necessarily though it is not one id file under good either the run time ought to have been shorter and the human characters couldve been more interestingly portrayed the big fight sequences didnt really do anything for me either which is kinda reminiscent of 2014s godzilla in truth i do like the titular character but these sole two experiences of it have been underwhelming    vera farmiga is alright as one of those onscreen im a fan since seeing 2011s source code so have been wanting to see her act further the cast including farmiga to be honest are all quite forgettable in this not helped by issues that i alluded to with their characters above  so much so im unable to pick a standout bradley whitfords rick stanton conversely is somewhat irritating    heres hoping i will actually enjoy what godzilla vs kong has to offer
Apr 7 2024,positive,l love the godzilla movies
Apr 6 2024,neutral,it failed to portray godzilla as the real king of the monsters it was good in parts but massively failed when humans took most of the stage for nearly 90 of the film
Apr 5 2024,negative,very intresting but it has the worst character in creation
Apr 4 2024,positive,this film certainly improves from the first film in some aspects but the character development is just really dumb compared to most other films however what they lack in character development makes up for pure dumb monster action everyone flocks to the theatre for
Apr 3 2024,positive,lot of action but was a little cringe
Apr 3 2024,positive,godzilla king of the monsters at first i was very excited for this movie but this movie is very disappointing the characters are really bad the decisions making of these characters horrible a character wants to portray everything than doesnt just annoying the action i really like but i was so confused where godzilla was hell be there and disappear so idk the effects are amazing like usual but everything else was not that great 76
Apr 2 2024,positive,100000010 its perfect 
Apr 2 2024,positive,very good movie the scene i liked the most was when rodan flies through mexico and when godzilla plays with one of ghidoras heads and melts it
Apr 2 2024,positive,i dont have any complaints for this movie the pacing and storyline seemed to flow very rather nicely the visuals were spectacular loved getting to see all of my favorite kaijus in action
Apr 2 2024,positive,i dont understand how people hate this movie i see absolutly nothing wrong with this film everything looks perfect rodan looks almost exactly the way i imagined it to what it would look like in the american godzilla movies its like the director put his hand through my thoughts and grabbed my ideas for the designs of the characters i also love how they brought back the old sounds from the older movies
Apr 2 2024,positive,not a bad cgi remake   decent popcorn flick
Apr 1 2024,positive,now this was the ultimate godzilla movie  the critics have no taste and i never listen to them  this is probably the best godzilla movie to me  king gidhora menaces the world to be the alpha monster  the human story was ok but you know why people watch these movies is for the monsters not for the humans i loved this movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,still my all time fave godzillamonsterverse film from the moment i saw this in theaters back in 2019 i didnt gave a damn about the mcu star wars or all the popular movies during the time the heart knows what it wants even if others are attractive in the end this is my love since i was a kid who doesnt love godzilla when they were young ill defend this movie always this is my favorite monsterverse film it gave me tears of joy hearing goji and feeling the vibration of his presence it just overwhelmed me     the good stuff    amazing bgm   amazing kaijus  amazing fight scenes  serizawas scene  godzilla  mothra  king ghidorah  rodan    lets not detail the bad stuff for this cause in the end you paid a ticket to watch these iconic kaijus not the human characters     amazing movie  king of the monsters supremacy  long live the king
Apr 1 2024,positive,every monsters are good at playing their character nothing better than telling a story on their own
Apr 1 2024,positive,long live the king
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie feels like a throwback to the earlier eras of godzilla bringing back original toho kaijus with an all new design although the humans were flawed in ways the spiritually is still represented well and does not take away from the spectacle of this movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,a letter full of emotions addressed to godzilla fans everything we godzilla fans wanted in a movie epicness in each encounter perfect villain excellent soundtrack
Apr 1 2024,positive,its out of the other world team godzilla

Mar 31 2024,positive,i loved this movie they introduced so many fan favorites from the classic godzilla series the only issue was the human drama overriding the monster fighting but the music visuals lore and creatures were amazing i highly recommend this for godzilla fans
Mar 31 2024,positive,dont like the human characters and its to saturated
Mar 31 2024,positive,this film was super interesting definitely the best godzilla film to date
Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome movie i would like to see rodan more becoming the fire rodan that breathes fire athout if he lives in volcano why wouldnt he breath lava but ok  cimenatography bgm main themes  cgi vfx sound story ok plot awesome  the movie is about godzilla becoming the alpha titan but someone else opposes him and some human organizacion fights monarc because they want zo rstore the order king gidhoradh is on their side menwille godzilla on monarchs  overall little bad story but awesome plot cgi acting cimenatography  sound  it should get oscar nomimations for  best sound  best visuals  best cimenatography  best original score
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie is amazing i gave it a 10 out of 10 i love mothra rodan godzilla and ghidorah i also love the new titans in the film i love the story and the characters
Mar 31 2024,positive,lots of your favourite titans in one place whats not to enjoy
Mar 30 2024,positive,perfectghidorah is really cool
Mar 30 2024,positive,way better than latest adaptaitons in the monsterverse last time we actually felt that its a monster movie in the monsterverse godzilla was really the godzilla in this movie and we missed it
Mar 30 2024,positive,ive seen this movie back in 5 years ago and what ive love from this is that godzilla and the military and mothra teaming up together against king ghidorah
Mar 30 2024,positive,the critics lie i say lie this movie is an excellent masterpiece filled with returning faces from the godzilla franchise but also some new faces the story could use some work but the monsters looked really good
Mar 30 2024,positive,best film in the monsterverse so far and you feel the toho era of godzilla being present yet again i dont care for the humans however the movie is saved by the blue yellow cyan  red setting mothra king ghidorah rodan  godzilla that atomic breath scene
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie of the franchise regardless of human plot its the most traditional godzilla modern day movie ever made
Mar 30 2024,positive,truly nice with many spectacles but bad writing was problem that stood as the biggest flaw
Mar 30 2024,positive,now this is p e a k godzilla everything you could ever want in a godzilla movie except the human drama the unenjoyable family issue throughout the movie doesnt fit well and pulls the movie down for me   but overlooking that this is godzilla
Mar 30 2024,positive,after rewatching its a good movie but theres way to much human story then monster story and it kinda makes it hard to watch it and king ghidorah was introduced way to early into the monster verse ghidorah should have been introduced in the 3rd movie but its still a great movie the action was fun to watch overall its a great movie for diehard fans of godzilla
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is my favorite film from the monsterverse and just everything about it is so good
Mar 29 2024,negative,everything is math    tudo é matemática    alles und mathematik    omnia et mathematica    τα πάντα και τα μαθηματικά    一切與數學    tout et les mathématiques
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was an epic thrill ride start to finish music hit hard and the visuals were amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing that we got more screen time of godzilla  enjoyed the movie a lot i loved mothra and rodan especially king ghidorah   great movie 90100
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie i liked the fun movie it was a good one
Mar 29 2024,positive,king ghidorah was such a cool titan villain its funny when one of the heads was silly
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is in my top 5 favourite movies ever i love this movie and everything in it the thing that gets it for me thought isnt any of the humans most of them were rubbish not all but most it is ghidorah and godzilla fighting that really catches it for me that final 2530 minuets of the film is just a masterpiece a must watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,the main problem here is the fact that the humans takes the center of the movie and the monsters although they are there its not the main attraction and that makes the movie uninteresting and its a pity because theres a lot of monsters but were seeing another family drama yes the humans are important but they shouldnt be the main attraction in this kind of movies
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is a masterpiece awesome visuals rodan entrance scene was magical godzilla all the way
Mar 29 2024,positive,only atomic godzilla seemed cheesy  otherwise enjoyable  much better than godzilla x kong
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the best movies everthe action and battles were next levelyes sometimes they lacked with no titans but still one of the best movies
Mar 29 2024,positive,this godzilla movie looks awesome
Mar 28 2024,neutral,not really a bad movie but a great time to see toho monsters back and legendarymade monsters created
Mar 28 2024,negative,ambitious mostly beautiful to look at but it fumbles many of its promising aspects most importantly the monsters
Mar 28 2024,positive,kotm is a really perfect film especially the fact that bringing elements from old films to current cinemas makes it more nostalgic i dont just praise it for the nostalgia but for the cgi which is impeccable
Mar 28 2024,positive,great monsters  great humans  it is the textbook definition of a good godzilla movie
Mar 28 2024,positive,the best movie of monsterverse
Mar 28 2024,positive,where  in my opinion  the movie fails is its attempt to shoehorn in human elements into the film for some reason theres an environmental message threaded into the movie that is then kinda ignored till the credits many of the humans are reduced to weird expository characters and the greatest shame is how ken watanabe is reduced from being the expert on all things muto to a guy who turns to kyle chandler and asks him for advice on everything its like they forgot the first film and kens epic let them fight    the family part of the movie is also shoehorned but at least vera farmiga millie bobby brown and kyle chandler handle it decently well and the movie is chockfull of cliches  the angry turn away and look back the general who wants to destroy everything the wise chinese scientist who understands mythology it can be a bit much when watching this show and charles dance is wasted in this show  they didnt need him    where the movie gloriously succeeds is in creating a real sense of foreboding about the titans ghidorah is especially beautifully rendered and is one of the real stars of the film its arrival is epic its presence is epic and is a worthy adversary of godzilla theres always a real sense of danger in the chase scenes including with rodan and the sound and visual engineers did a damn fine job bradley whitford is also an unexpected highlight in the movie    theres also an unexpectedly poignant sacrifice in the movie and the moment didnt feel too forced so kudos its not a perfect movie but its a kaiju movie and it is visually amazing and does a lot more to advance the monsterverse
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a kaiju loveletter at most with much kaiju fights and great visuals with a mediocre story but its all the kaijus that make this movie enjoyable and sell you into this fantasy with mostly straight action but amazing and beautiful cgi and visual effects mixed with practical leads to an amazing and good movie
Mar 27 2024,positive,i remember seeing this in theaters and thinking it was a good movie but i think i like the 2014 better
Mar 27 2024,positive,this is by far the best monsterverse film with a great human story and great action sequences
Mar 25 2024,neutral,mediocre movie basically for every good thing theres something bad
Mar 25 2024,positive,it was alright the first one was better but its setting up sequels that should suffice
Mar 25 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever watched the cgi was amazing i was actually sad when ishiro died the plot was amazing  that is all i have to say because im sure you have all watched it before and you probably agree
Mar 24 2024,negative,it was far too shoalous
Mar 23 2024,neutral,people wanted to see a lot of monsters and a lot of action i wanted to see more of godzillas atomic breath however we get the stupidest dialogues for the whole movie a weak plot and a pretty average battle at the end should i go to the cinema maybe is it fresh no
Mar 22 2024,negative,never seen a monster movie where every fight cuts away right as they start fighting like this
Mar 21 2024,positive,godzilla proved to be the king of the monsters but he hasnt proved to be the king of the monsterverse as of the release of this film king kong still remains at the top with kong skull island during this rewatch while i understand that this film serves as the followup to godzilla 2014 this film honestly shouldve been called kaiju or the battle of the kaiju being that its the direct sequel to the 2014 godzilla film i wish they wouldve made some mention of the main protagonists that being aaron taylor johnsons character as well as elizabeth olsens it wouldve been cool to see where their characters were up to this point and how they couldve been involved with this film we did however get the return of ken watanabe and sally hawkins in their respective roles from that film 2 small critiques that i have in regard to this film are first the amount of involvement the human characters have to the point where they overshadow that of the kaiju and the second is how underpowered godzilla is written to be a huge positive for this film is how cool each kaiju is and how cool it was to see them battle each other
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was in the same target than the first one no need to take your brain with but seeing all the other popular monsters was cool its just not the story why we look at this movie
Feb 27 2024,positive,this movie was great the graphics and roars just amazing
Feb 24 2024,positive,godzilla kotm is one of the best godzilla movies in the planet the monsterverse is really such a life for godzilla madison russel youve done it i really like godzillas atomic breath in the movie the cgi in the movie is insane and thermonuclear godzilla just turns him into a god killing ghidorah lengendary i am very proud with this atomic movie
Feb 23 2024,positive,ratings should be much higher
Feb 4 2024,positive,absolutely loved it the action sequences and sound editing is the best
Feb 1 2024,positive,its way more interesting than godzilla 2014 because of how many monster fights there are it is exciting to watch and entertaining human characters are still lackluster but the monster fights make up for it a couple funny scenes make it pretty rewatch able
Jan 31 2024,positive,this second one yes i can say that i liked it and yes it is better than the first one
Jan 28 2024,negative,godzilla king of the monsters feels like a movie ill imagine as a child a large budget summer blockbuster with classic japanese monsters are great to see on the big screen mothra rodan and ghidorah are welcomed and given so much love in their visuals and audio theyre a treat to watch when the movie sparingly lets them shine    though kotm has an issue focusing on the monsters consistent cuts from the center piece to show character emotions comes across more as a way to reduce budget than add to these scenes one fight between 2 of the flying monsters is almost completely missing due to the lack of focus which would of been great to see since theres a lack of flying monster vs flying monster in movies so this would of been refreshing     where this movie fails is the extremely uninteresting human characters that take up more of the screen than before a new cast of characters who never sell the audience on their presence their scenes only making you want to see godzilla do something    although this movie feels like a childhood dream  it only succeeds to the fun action scenes which are few and far between the rest are forgettable and dull
Jan 18 2024,positive,i have just rewatched this i think the story is good cgi is great i love that theres always a fight scene but i think this lacks something or something idk
Jan 15 2024,negative,boring as a cardboard sandwich hence i went out to ride my horses 
Jan 10 2024,neutral,the studios definitely took the wrong message away from the few critiques of the first movie the only gripe people had with the first movie was the lack of godzilla on screen but instead they saw what guillermo del toro did with pacific rim and said yes thats what we want however the main difference was the originalremake didnt start out as a campy monster movie it took a far more serious approach to the source material so the deviation this movie took felt jarring and unearned sure i love pacific rim and kong skull island was fun as well but the grounded approach was working
Jan 10 2024,positive,excessively silly but the imagery is often jaw dropping and honestly what more do you need from a monster movie
Jan 8 2024,positive,it was amazing and i love the fight between godzilla and king ghidorah
Jan 7 2024,negative,this is so bad the monsters are the most realistic part of this pile
Jan 6 2024,positive,hey would you look at this godzilla fighting causes the earth to grow exactly how nature works hey you know what this seems good lets try to awaken every single citydestroying monster that we can find and have them take over the world what could possibly go wrong
Jan 4 2024,positive,i loved the sounds and visuals but the human story is okay
Jan 4 2024,positive,you spend what seems to be half the movie with the humans and half with the titans in such a perfectly balanced way the movie carries you all the way through the climax and keeps you wanting more of it
Jan 4 2024,positive,way too much action that i didnt feel anything it was way to fast paced
Jan 3 2024,positive,the effects are beautiful and the action scenes are incredible but honestly this movie is crazy cringy at times the acting is over the top the dialogue is so dramatic and some of the plot points are just silly nonetheless its very enjoyable just might not be on the top of my rewatch list
Jan 1 2024,positive,nice disaster flick does a fairly decent job providing backstory explaining the existence of the titans good not great would still recommend
Jan 1 2024,positive,the best of the series thus far so of course the braindead critics didnt like it
Dec 30 2023,negative,i mean i thought the transformers franchise was a cgi mess but this movie might take the cake i forgot why the people were even in it at the end of why i was supposed to care
Dec 29 2023,positive,great fun movie turn off your brain and enjoy
Dec 28 2023,positive,this movie is really good its everything i wanted godzilla more monsters cool fights the list goes on honestly i wanted some of the characters back from the first but the characters in this movie were fine anyway some parts dont make sense but everything else makes up for it definitely see this movie
Dec 28 2023,positive,this is a giant monster fighting movie that does it perfectly it sets up the stakes early on doesnt have a bunch of unnecessary human storyline and has constant action which it should critics are just mad that the human story isnt told as in depth as they wanted to so they review bombed it
Dec 27 2023,neutral,good action mid story
Dec 21 2023,positive,this movie feels like it drags especially when the film spends too much time on the people in the story   some of the visuals are pretty damn good
Dec 20 2023,positive,i thought it was good decent monster verse film with lots of titan ready for destruction but remember godzilla is now a hero hes no longer a villain
Dec 19 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ever and iyam its my favorite movie ever its perfect in everyway with the action story and visuals its a must see
Dec 19 2023,positive,another great godzilla movie
Dec 18 2023,negative,story line was weak and boring at best the ending made me laugh so i guess thats a plus
Dec 17 2023,positive,this movie is mostly monster fights and that makes this movie 10 times better but the human characters are not the best i will try to get used to them this movie also gives off nostalgia from the showa series
Dec 16 2023,positive,i was not a fan of the human cast
Dec 16 2023,positive,excellent movie to show how strong and massive kaijus are the movie focus more on monsters than human which is perfect because thats the whole reason people come in the first place
Dec 15 2023,positive,this is a sequel to the 2014 godzilla reboot which was very good for one the absence of elizabeth olsen and her husband is palpable the movie is a good look at the core values of godzilla movies man versus nature the acting and special effects are good the story itself is the weakest aspect of this movie ken wantanabe could say anything in any role and sound believablehe is good in this mille bobby brown and vera farmiga are good the strength of the movie is godzilla and mother they harken back to the origins of why people fell in love with these films  add in roman and ghidora the mother of all bad guys and this still is lots of fun
Dec 15 2023,negative,its trash they cant keep the camera on the monsters for more then 6 seconds before cutting back to the humans whom didnt just bore me like in gvk but annoyed me really cliche phoned in film
Dec 12 2023,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is something all godzilla fans will love
Dec 12 2023,positive,we need more godzilla in the movie
Dec 6 2023,positive,the effects were incredible the monsters were actually brought to life and given the power and vision they deserved and the final fight and end scene were worth the wait this deserved so much more hype than the movies that came out around the same time like endgame and aladdin
Dec 6 2023,positive,its all action all the time  grade school plot decent acting but hard to follow with all the closeups of the monsters
Dec 4 2023,positive,godzilla carries this movie way to hard dear lord
Dec 2 2023,positive,ok bad story fun action
Nov 30 2023,positive,the perfect godzilla movie its all about the monsters  kept the human correspondence to whats needed and showed godzilla throughout the movie not only at the end like most movies
Nov 24 2023,positive,it was cool and godzilla awesome that movie has godziillas classic flying titans godzilla alpha titan  magnifient everything is amazing
Nov 23 2023,positive,this is by far my favorite godzilla movie yet the cgi is just incredible the final battle between godzilla and king ghidorah is also super cool you will definitely enjoy this film
Nov 23 2023,positive,its a great movie if you love godzilla if you dont its probably gonna be a hit or miss for you it does what it set out to do and did it more than well imo
Nov 22 2023,positive,fantastic critics suck
Nov 19 2023,positive,balanced using monsters from the 70 year history of the franchise while keeping a unique and in universe continuation fantastic battles and new and classic scores
Nov 18 2023,positive,bro i have no words to describe this wonder of cinema continue with this wonderful franchise
Nov 16 2023,positive,if you like action monster fights and awesomeness in general watch it  no clue why the low score
Nov 10 2023,positive,an incredibly enjoyable film for those who enjoy giant monsters with the power of nukes destroying heavily populated cities
Nov 4 2023,neutral,skip the humans and just watch the monsters fight
Nov 2 2023,positive,as a godzilla fan this movie was a masterpeice in my opinion
Oct 28 2023,positive,good movie gets a little boring at times but the action scenes are near perfect
Oct 15 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece  a gift to godzilla fans all over the world i love its mystical tone    the cgi is great not as good as godzilla 2014 or godzilla vs kong buts till    i love it
Oct 12 2023,positive,one of the best movies ever and one of the best movies for godzilla fans
Oct 11 2023,positive,great action and a lot more than the previous movie great sequel with more world building human story is a little better than the first but theyre just there to move everything along sound and music is great again and really helps keep these monsters scary
Oct 10 2023,positive,i loved this movie but rewatching it it was ok not the greatest movie but still really good
Oct 9 2023,positive,if your a godzilla fan then you really want a load of this monsters everywhere the plot is all mess up but to be fair all we care is a bunch a monster fightings
Sep 26 2023,negative,the plot is so awful it almost made me not notice how lame the monster scenes are in the first 23 of the film and how the digital effects are always very filter heavy  there are no redeeming qualities outside of the visuals and even those are hollow heisei gamera and godzilla films are vastly superior to this film
Sep 21 2023,positive,critics arent very good at their jobs nowadays cause this movie was and still is totally awesome
Sep 16 2023,positive,great effects and very satisfying the middle part of the plot is a little bit messy but overall good enough
Sep 13 2023,positive,epic monster brawl deep in story if you connect the story to godzilla vs kong and one of many movies ive rewatched over and over again
Sep 10 2023,positive,its big screen big budget monster action with classic godzilla characters weve been waiting to see for a long time the monsters do not disappoint and its great to see creative and well done interpretations of these classic characters like the final jurassic world installment the fractured plot and soso script do distract from what makes this movie fun to watch more than once the fricken monster battles
Sep 9 2023,positive,this shit was hype af thats it wouldnt change a thing except maybe more monster fights
Sep 5 2023,positive,love this expands on the lore beautifully very well acted magnificent special effects and a throughly enjoyable movie if you enjoy kaiju or just creature features in general like me then youll probably love this if thats not your wheelhouse then like my wife you probably wont
Sep 5 2023,positive,king ghidorah is awesome monsters are great in this
Aug 26 2023,positive,i am a somewhat intelligent key qualifier 36 year old male with a wife and 7 year old son maybe the 7 year old was a little too young to watch it but he is the only reason we would watch it again like other reviews it is exactly what you expect from monster battle movies so if you are interested in that genre of movie which you already know if you fit into that camp of people then you will rate this movie an 810 if you are too interested in asking logical and reasonable questions you will rate it as a 610 at the best very good soundtrack and character development just a little too far removed from the physical bounds of the reality of the universe that i live in to happily sit through too much of this
Aug 24 2023,negative,unfortunately breathtaking cgi cant save you movie from your easily identifiable lack of character development which is drowned out by constant noisy action anyway
Aug 23 2023,negative,this is a monster movie with way more monster than movie the effects and giant creature fights are amazing too bad theres barely a story behind it and the slight human story we do get is painfully annoying
Aug 22 2023,positive,forget the plot the plot is death and monster battles this film embraces its silliness and owns it with a whole city worth of destruction not only do we have godzilla but three other monsters and they constantly are battle together or each other and it kicks ass i love it the humans are forgettable and have so little screen time they can be forgotten back to the monsters
Aug 21 2023,negative,what kind of sick minded freak likes this shit
Aug 18 2023,positive,this movie is a huge step up from the first film i really enjoyed the film and it was amazing definitely go watch this film for the action
Aug 13 2023,positive,the monster on monster action was awesome but the story around the girl just detracts from the action
Aug 9 2023,negative,a beautiful movie  but thats about it  nothing of substance here  writing acting themes all fall flat at one point or another
Aug 5 2023,positive,really awesome scenes and photography plot is not that much but the movie deserves a watch
Jul 30 2023,negative,first the positive godzilla ii offers an interesting new take on the origin of the titan creatures and their purpose however this portrayal is a major deviation away from the origin story shown in the 2014 godzilla film that this is a direct sequel to the reliance on cgi results in a godzilla that appears both obese and far too human in mannerisms facial expressions and movement as the film progresses the story and the portrayal of the titans become increasingly ridiculous along with the destruction it all comes together in what can best be described as a truly terrible example of cultural appropriation on the part of hollywood having seen this once i feel no desire to watch it again
Jul 26 2023,positive,the visuals are astonishing but the story could use some work things feel like they just drag on a lot if you do t mi d some flaws i recommend
Jul 24 2023,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters grants fans wishes by giving godzilla more screen time and more fight sequences but the film lacks buildup and tension which is something i appreciated from its predecessor
Jul 22 2023,positive,loved it ghidorah rodan and mothras introductions into the monsterverse were done spectacularly the gmans new design is sooo good great action only thing i would have liked is less human stuff
Jul 13 2023,neutral,this movie is nice when godzilla fights other monsters unfortunately majority of the movie is not that its more about the government tracking down godzilla just like the first one no new ground is being broken whatsoever
Jul 2 2023,positive,a fan made hollywood movie outstanding cgi respectful with the original movies and godzilla man he rules a kaiju movie like it have to be
Jun 24 2023,positive,the standard for any monsterverse movie
Jun 20 2023,positive,i loved this movie one of the bests godzilla movie ive seen
Jun 15 2023,positive,remember long live the king
Jun 11 2023,positive,did the critics watch the same movie  this is crammed with references beautiful cgi and has an actual plot unlike most goji films the best film to show to a new goji fan
Jun 7 2023,positive,this movie is better movie of the monsterverse saga and better monster movie 10710 and praise
Jun 7 2023,positive,great movie certainly the most action of all the godzilla movies
Jun 2 2023,negative,as a hardcore godzilla fan this film was incredibly disappointing other fans go nuts about the fan service and the inclusion of classic monsters from the old toho movies so much so that they overlook the utter lack of satisfying monster battles the plot is goofy and dumb which is par for the course the issue is the film is afraid to show even 5 seconds of straight monster fighting before cutting away to show people doing nothing important if a godzilla movie fails to deliver good action it completely fails at its whole purpose of existing what a waste of the source material there are some undeniably amazing and memorable moments but youll be left scratching your head wondering why they end so soon
May 30 2023,positive,the greatest 02 hours and 12 minutes ever
May 25 2023,positive,godzilla 2 king of the monsters is the best film in the monsterverse im sorry that the film was panned by critics but the film is beautiful i really like the action but i dont understand how it is possible that the film obtained a 42 critics the film needs a higher critics score i would give it 84 critics i like seeing godzilla vs ghidorah but did you know that the new chapter of the monsterverse comes out next year lets hope the film gets positive reviews
May 23 2023,positive,its the goat the goat the goat
May 23 2023,positive,was great to see it go back to the good ol days it clear from reading the so called critics reviews that they are posers that never watched and understood what the kaiju films have been and are about they contradict each other and themselves in an effort to sound important and knowledgeable when in fact they sound the opposite to anyone that grew up with the classics
May 20 2023,negative,chaotic and somehow dull
May 15 2023,negative,unlike its 2014 predecessor godzilla king of the monsters is a bore the dark and serious tone that godzilla 2014 had is not here instead its replaced with cheesy and campy humor that never lands godzilla and the other titans are treated as jokes while godzilla 2014 treats them as the monsters they are its clear that legendary didnt want to grow a pair and steered the monsterverse towards children
May 11 2023,positive,this is good as all hell but how the hell can this have such a bad score i mean yeah sometimes the acting wasnt the greatest but i dont see how the plot is bad even watching and reading multiple reviews i still dont get it it has some of its imperfections but its still a great movie
May 4 2023,positive,i never thought i would like a godzilla movie but i was wrong its really entertaining all the creatures are incredible and the plot manages to give its great place to this amazing character of the japanese cinema highly recommended
May 1 2023,positive,thats indeed good and cool
Apr 30 2023,positive,great movie  loved all the action and the acting
Apr 29 2023,positive,love the monsters and the story and the music is too very good
Apr 25 2023,positive,fantastic sequel and exceeded my expectations
Apr 18 2023,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a great monster movie that gives the fans of the titular titan a satisfying watch but to normal moviegoers theres not a lot in store for them    rating 71
Apr 18 2023,positive,if you are a fan like myself of the classic godzilla then this movie will not disappoint i grew up watching godzilla as a kid i loved all the monster fighting they had in each film its what made those movies amazing thats exactly what they brought in this movie if you love godzilla and enjoy action packed monster fights than you will enjoy this movie
Apr 14 2023,positive,this is the best monsterverse movie in my opinion  it has everything i could want in a godzilla movie i mean not everything but it was awesome  and king ghidorah was just a perfect piece in this movie
Apr 6 2023,positive,it was an awesome sequel to godzilla2014
Apr 3 2023,positive,godzilla king of the monsters manages to not only patch up the most prominent issue with godzilla 2014 the lack of monster character building managing to balance the human side with the monster side but also introduces new elements new enemies bombastic action and a haywire plot that brings great promise which it delivers aptly
Mar 31 2023,positive,its awesome as the first
Mar 27 2023,neutral,its bad a little i dont really like godzilla but its ok
Mar 27 2023,positive,this movie is just pure awesomeness 
Mar 16 2023,positive,the monster fights in this movie are improved and the cgi is great but what tanks this movie are the acting and characters also in the fights they also sometimes cut away like they did in the last movie
Mar 12 2023,positive,i thought it was a good movie overall in the telling of the godzilla story but thought it was weird with all these monsters from outer space  living in various parts of the world encased in ice
Mar 4 2023,positive,this is the film i wanted to see back when i saw the 1998 godzilla movie as a kid it lacks the unintentional goofiness that the older films have but you would not expect that from a modern americanized godzilla film i dont care much for the plot or characters though they are played by excellent talent that is not why i went to a godzilla film though i went to see a faithful modern interpretation of the giant radioactive lizard from my childhood blow stuff up and beat up other giant monsters in that regard the only one godzilla fans like myself care about this film does magnificently the plot and human elements in the original films were all goofy anyway so if anything it just makes it more accurate
Feb 15 2023,positive,i thought it was probably my favorite of the current godzilla trilogy so far the visuals were amazing the stakes seemed to be way higher than the other films within this trilogy and the impact was broader i really enjoyed this film when it came out surprised by the critics reviews to be honest
Feb 14 2023,positive,i came looking for giant monsters fighting and i got that and it was great the humans part are still a bit boring but here it was quite fast but even though it was 45 mins sadly
Feb 6 2023,positive,fundamentally speaking i give it 35 but personally id give it a 4  while i thought the first was a better movie fundamentally i had much more fun with this one the acting in this is ok and filled with lots of characters but the problem is there all one dimensional forgettable and loaded with expose the cinematography is well done in this with the monsters being very well designed especially king ghidorah who is the coolest hes ever looked the only issue is really some scenes are oversaturated with cgi and many of the fights its a bit difficult at times to see whats happening like the first because its all at night the music is better in this one than in the first though it is a bit still on the generic side the editing and pacing in this are about on par with the first though there is fighting much more in this much earlier and lots of fighting at the end the middle is loaded with expose and forgettable characters that just dont build any tension you honestly just wanna keep seeing the monsters fight which is awesome especially any scene with ghidorah if your a fan of the first one youll like this one better because of the monster fights being even more in this otherwise if you didnt like the first than skip this as well
Feb 2 2023,positive,one of my favorite movies ever thats definitely overhated do not listen to the critics they are wrong
Jan 31 2023,neutral,i cant see a dang thing  and im really sick of we humans are evil because warpollution so we should all die antagonists
Jan 27 2023,positive,if there is one thing to say about the creators of this movie it is that they love and cherish everything godzillarelated all these iconic monsters have been redesinged with a big budget and with such adoration that you can feel it on the screen even if almost everything is obscured by either snow rain or dust legendary took the 2014 complaints about 10 minutes of godzilla to heart and tilted the scales to the other side  some might even say too much weve got everything mothra twins references rodan king ghidorah alien origins dead civilizations and even an oxygen destroyer on top of it all rapidfiring nostalgia at you with zero regard as to how later movies are going to have to deal with it the personalities that they gave the monsters are brilliant with zero commentary and just visual effects they communicate everything you need to know about them rodans gleeful scumbaggery different ghidorah heads having different identities which is something you probably could never do with suitmation  the obligatory human story is not great but again what toho godzilla movies have you been watching to have any kind of high bar for those im just glad i was able to connect with the human story in some way sure it was mostly out of frustration as to how vera farmigas character did think that kill billions to save millions would ever play out without killing said billions did she think rodan would just smash some coal mines and suck out their carbon footprint
Jan 26 2023,negative,it has some good spectacle and cgi but overall its just big monsters fighting for 2 hours
Jan 21 2023,positive,this has a good enough story but thats not why you watch the movie the real highlights of this movie are the awesome kaiju battles from the very first fight with ghidorah you can tell this movie has a lot of love put into the fights im not going to get into spoilers here but trust me this is a good movie
Jan 17 2023,positive,it was great movie with amazing visuals the story  action everything was really awesome and engaging
Jan 16 2023,positive,best monsterverse movie and best godzilla ive ever seen it has a perfect mixture between good characters and amazing action i know a lot of people hate the characters in this movie and think that there are too many scenes of theme but i completely disagree i actually like the characters and i think that there are just as many people scenes as there are monster scenes also something that i think this movie accomplished that the first one failed at is that it showed a lot more godzilla overall really great
Jan 4 2023,positive,unlike the first movie there were too many monsters too much action and not enough world building and character development
Dec 18 2022,positive,i understand why people dislike this movie but i personally enjoyed the battle between kaijus
Dec 16 2022,positive,as a huge godzilla fan i may be a bit biased but i loved this movie  a big improvement over the 2014 one in terms of monster footage and fight scenes this one actually shows some decent fights  id rank it up there as one of the best of the godzilla franchise right there with the heisei era godzilla films
Dec 13 2022,positive,i know what the critics say but i love this film feels just like the old toho films
Dec 11 2022,positive,another great addition to the series great effects and story
Dec 2 2022,positive,i think godzilla king of the monsters is a great movie
Nov 29 2022,positive,anyone that doesnt give this five stars is a fucking idiot godzilla is about the monsters no there is no actual storyline to follow of course not it would be like watching porn for the plot line the plot line still needs to be there of course just like the half assed storyline of godzilla it builds anticipation so i can scream even louder while monsters fuck up humanity this made me so excited that my partner kept asking when i got stoned i was high on godzilla  55
Nov 24 2022,positive,better than the first one and also prefer that gidorha is a alien and not an actual kiju
Nov 20 2022,negative,in terms of monster action and urgency godzilla king of the monsters prevails but in terms of the two most precious components plot and characters it sadly doesnt pass
Nov 13 2022,positive,ok the reason i give this a four star rating is because of the scene where monster 0 stands on the hill and the cross is displayed next to him he presents the 3 headed dragon talked about in the book of revelations in the bible but further this movie is great
Nov 10 2022,positive,8 years later and this movie is still goated  if you want an award winning movie go watch something at sundance if you want the best godzilla  giant monster movie ever with an epic soundtrack stunning visuals and killer action look no further longlivetheking
Nov 4 2022,negative,godzilla king of the monsters has a lot more kaiju screentime compared to godzilla 2014 but other than that the movie isnt really good the plot and story are ok and the jokes are pretty corny at times the battles are also heavily blocked by the weathering and the lighting it also cuts away to humans a lot so its like youre watching the fights in small snippets some characters were also wasted like vivienne graham
Nov 4 2022,negative,much more kaiju screentime compared to godzilla 2014 but the constant weathering and cutaways negatively impact the fights the story and plot are okay as well but some characters are wasted
Nov 3 2022,positive,i really liked this movie i have been a godzilla fan for a while now and this one wasnt disappointing the acting is not the best and the characters fall flat but the soundtrack cinematography and stakes are good and engaging i enjoy this movie as an action movie and it works that way it is entertaining and worth a watch and if you like godzilla this wont disappoint depending on your opinion of godzilla you will either love this or hate and that is sad but i hope you do enjoy this movie
Nov 3 2022,positive,beautiful a must see for monster movie fans ghidorah has never been so badass
Nov 1 2022,positive, the story doesnt make much sense but as a godzilla film its very underrated its a ton of fun with the godzilla action the last film was lacking
Oct 29 2022,positive,this was the best movie ever i loved the fight at the end godzilla vs king ghidorah i wish megalon was in it though but its still the best movie ever the end atomic breath
Oct 29 2022,positive,the visual effects are super duper great  this movie was super awesome not gonna lie
Oct 29 2022,positive,the story is fine and the action is good
Oct 27 2022,positive,i like that movie seeing godzilla with rodan and mothra and king ghidorah i liked it soooooo much even though they forgot angurius but still i liked it
Oct 24 2022,positive,i wanted to see more monsters and less people i dont really care about family issues in this scenario
Oct 24 2022,positive,awesome movie but some of the monster fight scene could last a bit longer
Oct 24 2022,positive,this is my favorite movie of all time it is astoundingly awesome from its breakneck action to its incredible score and even to its unconventional but good story ghidorah radiates evil in every scene hes in godzilla carries a regal presence mothra is breathtaking and rodan is cunning and fast the score is one of the best ive ever heard with each titan having its own theme that really sells what that titan represents the story and characters are better than a lot of what you see in movies the visuals are breathtaking the sounds thunderous everything about this movie is incredible cinematic perfection personified
Oct 21 2022,neutral,first time im agree with rotten tomatoes the movie didnt delivered a good story at all just big monsters rolling all out without true context they let free ghidorah to conquer the world not maintain balance as a giant mistake from the naturalist terrorists and godzilla being the earth last hope the millitaries killed him with the oxygen destroyer and we still didnt manage to understand much more about godzilla ancient times or the civilization that prosper with his assistance and such as kong so they still need to figure out a good writting transcription so the movie could work better for next time this is a honesty opinion as a godzilla fan this is the worst movie of the 4 monsterverse films
Oct 21 2022,positive,kotm tries to strike a balance between the ludicrous nature of giant monsters fighting and a realistic portrayal of how such events would effect us unfortunately it fails to varying degrees at both the human characters have barely any development and its hard to really care for any of them vera farmigas character has questionable motives for suddenly trying to destroy the world and even more questionable motives for suddenly changing her mind the main human antagonist just leaves in the third act and is never heard from again thankfully we get to see a lot more of the monster than godzilla 2014 and while they do eventually fight the majority of the destruction in the film is done by a storm and when we cut to the last battle scene in boston the damage has been done off screen
Oct 18 2022,positive,dialogue may be bad but who the fuck cares return of godzillas 3 most famous adversaries is always a win
Oct 14 2022,positive,we all know we dont come here for the good story in fact for godzilla movie this is a pretty good story the action was top notch the visual effects were spectacular and it sticks pretty close to what a traditional godzilla movie is the human story can bogged down but it was good enough
Oct 13 2022,positive,good music amazing cgi story kind of spins its wheels towards the mid half but good characters and development
Sep 22 2022,negative,the monsters are well animated but there is still a lot ob bad cgi boring story and characters you cant connect millie bobby brown has too little screen time to save this even worse than the roland emmerich version
Sep 19 2022,positive,probably one of my favorite movies i thought the storyline made perfect sense and the action was a love the godzilla franchise
Sep 7 2022,positive,fun action pack movie full of awesome scene that would looks  good like wallpaper
Sep 6 2022,positive,the story is poor and confusing but godzilla king of the monsters is still a sight to see with godzilla taking the big screen with his cgi and powerful roar
Aug 24 2022,negative,the marvel formula is a plague and it spreads beyond the mcu and this movie is concrete proof of that
Aug 18 2022,negative,compared to kong this was disappointing also they cut to peoples faces way too often a couple scenes were cool to see
Aug 18 2022,positive,so much fun the human characters are kinda lame but the action is incredible
Aug 14 2022,positive,the human and the monster is actually balanced its a movie that focuses on the monster so thats why there is more screen for the monster than the human
Jul 31 2022,negative,disappointing sequel to a disappointing reboot full of cliched moments terrible dialogue annoying human characters and far too many nonsensical events should probably be avoided by all save the most enthusiastic kaiju fans
Jul 19 2022,positive,after a great start with godzilla 2014 godzilla king of the monsters delivers improves itself from some of the flaws of the first film giving us one of the best kaiju flicks of the 2000s the only thing that this film lacks is an interest human plot the characters arent badly written but not good either they are bland and a bit boring which unfortunately doesnt improve with the next film but thats another review    godzilla doesnt fail to bring his a game this film as once again every scene hes in are great but this time hes not against the mutos as for the first time ever mothra rodan and king ghidorah have been adapted into an american adaptation of the japanese selves and boy do they not fail on representing them ghidorah is his evil conniving self and in my opinion this is one of the best versions of him ive seen you can really feel just how powerful this kaiju is in this film as for mothra shes the same old keeper of the peace just how kaiju fans like it as for rodan he was a little underused but hes still a joy to see    if you want to see a good kaiju film with awesome fight scenes check this film out just skip the human parts xd
Jul 8 2022,positive,the sequel wherein godzilla finally faces king ghidorah the monster battle is epic
Jul 6 2022,positive,all those critics talking bout the dialogue being bad or some shit but they seem to forget its about a big ass lizard that has atomic powers fighting a three headed cool dragon sick movie sick cast sick monsters sick everything
Jul 4 2022,positive,its just decent sequel to 2014 entry it just has a lot of plot holes
Jun 17 2022,positive,a film that isnt worthy for most of the critics but shall easy appeal for diehard fans of the big g himself 1010
Jun 5 2022,positive,i mean what do you expect its a film about monsters thats it dont expect some deep and calculating nuance the action pieces are there and thats pretty much all this film has to offer i was actually impressed at how clean and great the cgi looked
May 29 2022,positive,they let them fight and it was great
Apr 28 2022,positive,julian dennys on from deadpool is thick
Apr 24 2022,positive,everything i wanted in the first movie 2014 is in this movie filled with action godzilla and ghidorah get a lot of screen time the story isnt that great however
Apr 2 2022,positive,as an audience this movie is not that bad my brother and i watch it and there are no bad critics from us good movie
Mar 23 2022,neutral,godzilla 2 kotm is a clear proof that hollywood is more vulnerable in narrative quality than visual its special effects and almost the soundtrack may be admirable but it slacks too much with a not very satisfactory script with some plot errors making clear the term fan movie for fansit relies a lot on fanservice and nostalgia and the humans are pitiful in the movie serishawa is saved by being memorable but none of them shine for their acting is simply a seller of nostalgia no wonder why it is overrated the fandom
Mar 13 2022,negative,probably one of the most boring movies ive ever seen
Mar 12 2022,negative,the writing was a mess and most of the actions the characters did made no sense my life is actively worse after watching this movie if i could give up a limb so that i could forget watching it i would
Mar 1 2022,positive,not the worst in the world but still not good the characters in this one unlike the rest of the monsterverse have a semblance of character development that relates to a central theme still this is the bare minimum for a film and it isnt anything more than a movie about monsters fighting each other its not beautiful its not emotional its just monsters
Feb 24 2022,positive,well performed with good cgi still not perfect but definitely a good product
Feb 9 2022,positive,critics are wrong about this movie and they are no longer to be trusted if they dont wanna watch this movie then its not their own business look i love this movie ok ill giving it 1010
Jan 30 2022,positive,a very nice enjoyable blockbuster much better than the first part cinematography and action scenes on a very high level
Jan 23 2022,positive,seems like they took the audiences desires to heart the last two godzilla moviesmoreso in this than the last less whiny humans and more monster battlesthe formula all kaiju movies should follow also somehow kaiju movies always seem better when the main humans are kids rather than stupid adultsit just works  bravo legendary
Jan 17 2022,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was spectacular jawdropping visuals and special effects it has multiple giant creatures fighting against each other and the humans its an amazing spectacle of sights and sounds  enormous creatures and thunderous sound effects you can feel creature design was great too it didnt really bother me that the human character development and interactions were minimal because the main characters were played by very good actors i liked how they included millie bobby brown because shes a very promising actress oozing with charisma if you like lots of giant monster action you will greatly enjoy this movie the exhilarating battle scenes between the towering beasts will blow you right off your seat meant to be seen on the big screen
Jan 12 2022,positive,the first one is boring and the kong vs godzilla was terrible but this one is enjoyable the best for the series so far not great but at least a good movie
Jan 9 2022,positive,the third entry of the wbs monsterverse as well as the sequel to the godzilla 2014 film i was more eager to watch this movie after having seen kong skull island the second monsterverse movie and knowing things were going to get even bigger than the last especially given that postcredit scene    set some time after the events of the godzilla movie the film starts from the point of view of a family that has endured the effects of godzillas fight with the motu creatures the russells are split from each other after the loss of one of their own and from this end up using their contacts in the scientific and world community into attempting to resolve what these gigantic creatures serve in the higher order of things the world wants to destroy these creatures while others wish to leave them alone and protect them things come to a head when these creatures are provoked by a group of ecoterrorists that use technology that enables one of them called ghidorah to corral all the others to cause the extinction of mankind the only one that seems to be able to match ghidorah is the same protector from the first film godzilla     just as in the previous films this brings a plethora of action special effects and talented performers this film had a greater story than the first movie and better action i am not the biggest fan of godzilla but this was a great story    another great chapter to the monsterverse
Jan 3 2022,positive,godzilla  king of monsters is more ambitious and bigger than the first in all aspects its sad that motivations and script were left to the background 6510
Dec 30 2021,positive,2019s godzilla king of the monsters does prove that you can have too much of a good thing however many people myself included love it simply because its what weve wanted to see since we were children and after the incredibly lifeless 2014 godzilla this was a massive improvement in terms of sheer entertainment  now this is not a great movie by almost any other metric  the cgi is good but uneven the action solid but not quite spectacular the story is fun but dumb the dialogue fun but really dumb the pacing quick but perhaps too quick and the setpieces so big that they clearly didnt have the budget to make them longer  but as a lifelong godzilla fan this movie was the movie what i wanted to see with both the 1998 and 2014 movies and was disappointed when both completely failed to even attempt it let alone managed to achieve it  godzilla is actually a much better character in this movie than he was in 2014 where he was just a big and tough lizard and its amazing how they infused intelligence into rodan mothra and king ghidorah the last of which is the most impressive as each head is given a different personality and one even being more or less the dumb one  things did settle down with godzilla vs kong a lessthrilling but objectively bettercrafted film but this was certainly a lot of fun while it lasted and any fan of showa andor heisei godzilla needs to see this movie
Dec 16 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  has it all giant bugs madrazos i really enjoyed this movie  has it all giant bug battles and loved that they deployed mothra and rodan
Dec 12 2021,positive,while im not going to get involved in the toxicity surrounding this movie ill say everyone has a valid opinion critics fanboys and normies
Dec 6 2021,negative,apparently when you throw cool stuff like godzilla mothra and an plethora of other titans in a blender and add hundreds of millions of dollars you get a boring lizard turd of a movie that takes more than 2 hours to pass im impressed at how they managed to make something more mediocre that the one from 2014
Dec 1 2021,positive,the film which looks very epic but its not that much really the action is great and has emotional depth but the human drama makes it boring and the human characters arent iconic
Nov 29 2021,positive,there are rare moments of visual effects but the script and narrative are subpar  it made for a great clash of titans but less commanding with less surprises  it was a fun exercise in giant monster madness indulging in kaiju fight fans
Nov 26 2021,positive,love this movie it was badass cant wait for more
Nov 25 2021,negative,too dark to see much all of the action takes place at night plus there is always a love story mixed in with godzilla  thus the one star rating
Nov 23 2021,neutral,while the monster fights entice excitement the dumb human drama bogs it down coupled with an inflated runtime its not serious enough to be serious or dumb enough to be dumb fun
Nov 18 2021,positive,this film takes all of the previous installments problems and fixes them all yet it ends up sacrificing some of the goods which made the previous godzilla so unique the action is far better in this movie and the expansion of the monsterverse is really spectacular to see not to mention the large improvement of the effects as well the fight sequences are handled really well and they actually show what is happening as opposed to the previous film however where this film really falls short is in its story and characters which are not handled as well and feel so much worse when compared to how good the characters from the original godzilla were there are also loads of dumb plot conveniences and clichés that riddle the plot in the end godzilla king of monsters creates a much larger world and much better action sequences while also giving up the goods from the previous film
Nov 16 2021,negative,how many times can humans make the same mistakes considering there is a 3rd movie coming out in this franchise and this is now the 35th godzilla movie my guess is countless and lets be honesty i will make the same mistake again and watch the next one
Nov 13 2021,positive,if your looking for plot your not going to find it your looking for a rock em sock em monster epic with incredible action and some incredible action enjoy
Nov 7 2021,positive,a 5 year wait for this film probably my most anticipated film ever i couldnt wait to see rodan mothra  king ghidorah in live action brought to life if i could go back  change one thing it would probably be not seeing all the marketing for this film given it gives the whole movie away i believe it hurt the rewatch ability for me but the kaiju fan in me could oversee those issues  was just in awe seeing the monsters i grew up with brought to the big screen for the first time in modern vfx
Nov 7 2021,positive,critics can suck a fat one godzilla king of the monsters is absolute fun with great visuals and cinematography from future legend mike dougherty truly revamped my childhood favourite kaiju for me as a growing adult and making a new generation of fans bear mccrearys soundtrack plus serj tankians cover of godzilla by blue oyster cult is godly by far one of the best soundtracks of the last decade and best of the entire monsterverse
Oct 26 2021,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a decent film it is about the cryptozoological agency monarch who faces off against a battery of godsized monsters including the mighty godzilla vera farmiga and millie bobbie brown give good performances the screenplay is a little slow in places michael dougherty did an alright job directing this movie i liked this motion picture because of the action and adventure
Oct 26 2021,negative,painfully dull numbingly loud and torturously long wanted to leave the theater after the first act and sorely regretted not doing so
Oct 23 2021,positive,every childhood dream realized giant monsters  big action scenesrmtragic loss of heartfelt characters family drama interwoven and then theres mothra queen of the skies this was epic even on my 46 tv which by the way i upgraded after seeing it to 65 micheal dougherty infused as much edge of your seat action and droplets of comedy much as he did on krampus but they are two completely different movies that require we suspend all reality and just believe go go godzilla
Oct 19 2021,positive,rotten tomatoes expects this film to be more than what it is and its really dumb lets just be honest were here to watch two big monsters beat the shit out of each other and thats what we get great movie the score is just dumb
Oct 15 2021,positive,best monster movie love the intensity on scenes the actions the references to the classical godzilla movies nothing but joy when i saw the movie
Oct 8 2021,negative,great effects great sound some good action scenes but oh why so serious  and whats happening anyway i think a dozen or so monsters are supposed to be earths ancient protectors so why are they eating each other needs more cheese
Sep 23 2021,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is likely the most misunderstood film of the entire franchise and series in general because it deserves way more than it got for a score
Sep 23 2021,positive,well were watching a godzilla movie right why in the middle of the fight of monsters does the movie focus on the uninteresting characters that are humans 6510
Sep 21 2021,positive,absolutely spectacular
Sep 16 2021,negative,impossible story  terrible acting  horrible waste of money
Sep 10 2021,positive,definitely a let down from the previous movie the family drama got in the way more than it compelled me to care super 8 was a much better version of what they were going for
Sep 7 2021,negative,not as good as the first one the plot is in some parts weak the monsters are not so epic
Aug 23 2021,positive,610 meh nice fx but overall a missed opportunity
Aug 22 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this and the special effects were great
Aug 20 2021,positive,i love this movie it truly lives up to its title godzilla was kickass in this film and the human characters were just as good plus it still has that same monster brawl spirit other films do
Aug 19 2021,neutral,king of the monsters for me is a big letdown from its two predecessors in the monsterverse and lacks the finesse in the writing directing and acting that those two movies had and is the only movie to date in the monsterverse that i dislike kotm doesnt have a great story something that the characters in the movie actually recognize and act based upon this entire movie is founded on one character causing a global catastrophe because their plan didnt go according to plan meaning the entire movie was avoidable which makes it feel a bit pointless in other words the whole premise of the movie is founded in character stupidity which really hurts the story and development of the plot in essence the fates that certain characters have couldve been avoided and the global catastrophe that happens couldve been averted the way that a lot of the characters act based on all of this is actually pretty smart and they do the best they can to get the situation under control the acting however isnt great and makes some moments and scenes feel really off and awkward certain lines feel exaggerated which hurts their delivery in the movie as though they were said improperly or over acted the kaiju action however is great just as it was in the first two movies which is one redeeming quality of this movie watching the big monsters fight each other is entertaining enough to keep viewers somewhat engaged for the full runtime but the lack of a cohesive story and plot really hampers the movie from reaching the heights of godzilla and skull island there are spoiler alert a bunch of other big monsters that appear in this movie but they dont seem to do too much for the movie and feel like a hugely missed opportunity despite how many of them there are they feel inconsequential to the progress and development of the movie and the focus really seems to be on godzilla and ghidorah i do like that the humans are given the opportunity to get involved in the fight and lend a helping hand which they actually do in a bigger way in this movie than they did in any other movie in the monsterverse at the time this movie came out i appreciated this a lot as it shows that sometimes even the big monsters need some help humans play a huge role in this movie giving it a humancentric perspective which is also nice and another redeeming quality of the movie unfortunately these two highlights arent enough the save this movie from being a trainwreck compared to the other ones i dont like the ending too much since despite the fact that godzilla spoiler alert comes out victorious its really only because of the help that the humans gave him this movie doesnt live up to its title since godzilla got his ass beaten in his first two encounters with ghidorah and likely wouldnt have won the third time either without major assistance due to how powerful ghidorah is godzilla feels like a false or a rigged king in this movie which makes the end feel unsatisfying and disappointing despite some promise and good moments kotm falters in huge ways and isnt a great installment in the monsterverse
Aug 18 2021,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was the first monsterverse movie i learnt about my friend is a huge fan of kaiju movies and he showed me the trailer of this movie when it first came out i was struck in awe i couldnt believe something so legendary looking was actually going to be made while i live the poster and promotional materials were also looking so much filled with fantasy i watched the 2014 godzilla to watch this if youve seen my review of that movie you will know how much i loved it except for the human part but when i watched this movie i was very dissatisfied  the problem that plagues godzilla king of the monsters is the humans first of all they are talking so much the whole time all we see is talking talking and even more talking first madison and her mother are talking then the army is talking then the eco terrorists are talking and finally when godzilla and kong ghidorah finally start fighting then seen cuts to the humans running look i have no problem with humans being shown in godzilla movies but it should be like the 2014 movie where humans are only shown when the monsters are walking and not during the fights  the human plot of this movie is very pathetic the eco terrorists had a point and i completely agreed with them but as it was shown how they are supposed to be the bad guys was not very surprising i have never understood movies which villify ecoterrorists like why dont they ever explain why they are supposed to be bad take a moment think about valid points and just speak them out it doesnt have to be youre the bad guy boohoo this only makes us feel like the bad guys won  the cgi however is where this movie is an absolute win i will give it full marks for that i just love all the fight scenes from it when rodan seemed to have killed mothra i was feeling very bad for her but seeing how she made a comeback was very surprising the part where rodan and king ghidorah fight the planes was also very cool i really wanted to show that scene to someone else sadly im the only person who is interested in monsterverse and those who are interested already watched the movie before me  godzilla king of the monsters is a movie that completely tested my patience it was fun im gonna remember all the monster scenes but i dont think im ever gonna have the courage to watch this ever again some things are best left in memory and thats what id say about this movie its a good thing godzilla vs kong removed the bad parts and made what we wanted to see thats how this franchise is supposed to be not like this one
Aug 14 2021,positive,monsters yeah  humans meh
Aug 9 2021,neutral,its a typical overblown dumb somewhat entertaining popcorn blockbuster these kinds of movies are not meant to be thought about or considered just absorbed  my big criticism is there is too much human filler more than half the movie is superfluous dull human dialogue and backstory that nobody cares about i would be surprised if godzilla actually got 10 minutes of screen time
Aug 7 2021,positive,this film is as epic as the titans it tells the story ofwonderful cgi and non stop action make this a popcorn thriller thats hard to turn away from
Jul 26 2021,negative,the only thing compelling about this film is vera farmiga and her great performance and amazing visuals it has to offer with some action sequences that will leave you cheering and breathless but overall just a sloppy mess of a storyline to continue the monster verse which isnt that great anyway in order to shine to its fans but is just a headache of a film to watch
Jul 25 2021,positive,a feast for the eyes for godzilla fans with more monsters in one movie than there has been in a godzilla movie since final wars in saying that the story to bring these monsters together is certainly better than the last movie in the mellenium series but the story with its human characters on the other hand  the script in a godzilla film is usually the weakest part human characters with strange motives and giant leaps in logic almost becoming leaps of blind faith in hope that they can pull together anything coherent is not new to the history of kaiju movies in saying that this movie has leaps so great the fall could kill the title character himself as well acted they may be compelling they are not
Jul 24 2021,positive,perfect godzilla action i have even bought a blu ray
Jul 24 2021,positive,pure popcorn movie  wanted a ton of monsters fighting and got just that
Jul 23 2021,positive,arguably one of my favorite godzilla movies of all time next to godzilla vs destroyah and godzilla vs biolannte its beyond epic absolutely gorgeous and king ghidorah is absolutely insane its awesome
Jul 23 2021,positive,wasnt a movie that made me super think but loved the action
Jul 20 2021,positive,this will be one of the biggest mysteries  why this movie is rated poorly by critics when its actually more interesting than the big hit of the year  avengers endgame the monster fights are awesome sure the humans are terrible but thats not the point of this movie the monsters here have more expression than the lions in the lion king remake and that didnt get panned as badly as this happy to make this my guiltiest pleasure ive watched this more than 1000 times
Jul 12 2021,positive,it has the best action scenes in the monsterverse but the script and the characters are so superficial and boring
Jul 11 2021,negative,im an hour and 15 minutes into it right now and i sure wish godzilla was in the godzilla movie  when are they going to realize that absolutely nobody goes to see these movies for the humans   if youre going to make the humans the main focus and barely show godzilla in a godzilla movie then they better be some damn well written humans  not having me check my phone every few minutes out of boredom
Jul 1 2021,positive,hey its godzilla  eat your popcorn and enjoy
Jun 28 2021,positive,the visual and audio effects are breathtaking the action sequences are thrilling however rather than smashing and smashing it does not engage a good plot
Jun 19 2021,negative,dire awful script no attempt to engage the audience with the plight of anything watched 1 hour and gave up
Jun 18 2021,positive,fights were amazing and gave the fans what they actually to see giant monsters fights and kept the lore to the die hard fans without it going over the head of newer fans
Jun 8 2021,positive,this was my favorite monsterverse movie before gvk and it shows the monster action is some of the greatest ive seen in the godzilla franchise and i love the introduction to 3 of the other 4 members of tohos big five in this film it just fits for mothra rodan and ghidorah to be in this film and it reminds me of destroy all monsters where all of the monsters are fighting a bigger foe the human characters arent as good but drserizawa is one of the best human characters in this film the finale is also very spectacular and one of the best in the franchise i dont know why rt says this film is bad because this film is actually amazing and better than some of the showa era films
Jun 7 2021,positive,bad acting bad characters but extreme fun and suspense that lasts for the whole run time better than the first one in every way 
Jun 3 2021,positive,i love this movie so much
Jun 3 2021,negative,a movie about giant monsters made me fall asleep how is that even possible
Jun 2 2021,positive,great cgi and fun godzilla action but fails to keep a very interesting story
Jun 2 2021,neutral,i read another viewer put it best you tune in for a mothra vs rodan dogfight which is cut short by one of the protagonists trying to open some jammed doors the amount of poorly manufactured suspense gets in the way of a truly great monster movie just because you have an impressive cast of real actors does not mean their story should totally eclipse the titular characters the human exposition did not mesh well with the overall story    now the monster movie on the other hand was pretty awesome great action sequences as usual somewhat predictable build up always led to exciting fun payoff i always like a little jaws type buildup but this movie went quantity over quality if youre here for a good time and can patiently sit through the relatively forced story youre in for a fun ride
May 29 2021,positive,this is amazing it mixes humansmonsters besides its not like other monster movies with monsters in it and humans this film manages to connect both which is freaking amazing the only problem that i have is that the weather effects are too much we cannot see much of the fighting maybe if they reduced that i would give it 5 stars but hence i shall give it 45
May 28 2021,positive,just delivers everything you could want in a big monster movie can forgive some suspect plot pointsacting
May 23 2021,negative,the human interaction is pointless 70 humans vs 20 godzilla and 10 the monsters it shouldnt be called a godzilla movie think a different name  and why is the entire movie monochromatic    that stupid decision made this film less realistic i thought for a second that a was watching a pirate movie
May 20 2021,positive,i liked this a lot more than i expected to i would do anything for mothra and i hope she returns
May 16 2021,positive,a fun monster romp what more could you want well how about multiple more fan favorite kaijus like rodan mothra and king ghidorah plenty of fantastic monster fight scenes human plot line is kept to the background for the most part and lots and lots of godzilla dont exactly come in expecting a masterfully crafted plot or deep integral characters youre in the wrong place for that come in expecting to see fun destructive and wild monster fights and thats what youll get
May 16 2021,positive,godzilla ii it is a wonderful movie even having brought some of the classic godzilla characters is something satisfactory for the fans a good plot better effects and many more scenes of the kaijus compared to godzilla 2014 makes it look better and be one of the best godzilla movies that ever existed michael dougherty did a good job
May 15 2021,negative,i feel like this movie had to be made from a financial perspective but nobody was really passionate enough about it to invest in the story and the weak dialogue another cliché presentation of modern day cgi advancements
May 13 2021,positive,i honestly dont know whether i love or hate this movie on one hand the monster stuff is totally spectacular there are so many epic creative monster designs and there are so many monster fights throughout and it does not disappoint it shows off the brutality of these monsters brilliantly and it expands the monster universe creatively theres also a huge sense of scale with the amount of locations we go to and all the cast are great in their roles especially millie bobby brown and the special effects and musical score are phenomenal and theres some emotional weight but damn are the human characters awful theres way too many of them and other than the russel family none of them have any personality or goal and their purpose in the story is just arguing and its just a massive shame the movie tires too hard for us to care about them with 50 of the movie hinged on them but no one cares about humans in a monster movie some of the fights are also a bit top dark to see and they keep cutting back to humans and the plot is another human thinks we need to destroy the world to save it but overall while the lows are incredibly low the highs are incredibly high and i was entertained b
May 11 2021,positive,i dont know who thought this movie is dumb its not its a good movie theres 4 kaijus in the movie and theres more fight scenes but i didnt like the way they made godzilla i like 2021 and 2014
May 6 2021,positive,this movie is okay when the monster fights happen they constantly cut over to the humans we really dont care about
May 5 2021,positive,i absolutely adore this film and it is my favorite out of the monsterverse dont listen to the critic reviews on this one i dont know what they were thinking yes the human plot isnt perfect but what did we come for the monsters 
May 3 2021,negative,my expectations were no where to this cash grab go watch godzilla vs kong then you feel useful 
May 3 2021,positive,well godzilla king of the monsters is a good movie like a story and for the audience i left my 455 stars because is a awesome movie for the monsterverse
May 2 2021,neutral,its kinda boring but i am not very into this kinds of movies
Apr 30 2021,negative,it took me 8 sittings to finish this movie  thats pretty much all you need to know  extremely corny and predictable
Apr 29 2021,positive,i loved seeing all of the monsters like ghidorah  absolutley awesome
Apr 23 2021,positive,i absolutely love this movie one of my all time favorites the graphics of these creatures is so realistic i would never put faith in the movie critics who never like the movies that i enjoy
Apr 23 2021,positive,despite the spectacular effects epic battles and beautiful cinematography the film loses by having a stupid and meaningless story 
Apr 20 2021,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters is full of illogical decisions both on the part of the characters and the writers but has just enough cool monster stuff to be mildly entertaining
Apr 20 2021,negative,it was a shit film cause mothra died and didnt get enough screen time also i hate the characters with they all died to the kaiju lol fucking sucks
Apr 20 2021,negative,this is one of the worst and most repetitive movie ive ever seen in my entire life
Apr 19 2021,neutral,the movie was well made and had an allstar cast assembled but even the superstars over acted with a script that was lame and full of holes  then again its part campy that we love  godzilla the franchise lives on
Apr 18 2021,positive,its dumb its loud it does both of those things really well and i love it
Apr 17 2021,positive,the movie was great but we see godzilla for like 5 min in the movie
Apr 17 2021,negative,i filled in two stars for meh it passed the time but really i fell asleep began well and degenerated into a cartoonnotthatcartoons are bad or anything but i lost interest about half way throuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Apr 15 2021,positive,the parts of this movie where godzilla is fighting monsters are pretty cool everything else is just pretty dull
Apr 14 2021,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters has a lot of great actors but that dont make the characters good nor the story the movie does have better monster action and it was great to see ghidorah rodan and mothra back on the big screen
Apr 14 2021,positive,watched on 4k ultra hd with dolbyatmostruehd and it was incredible as a popcorn monster movie sitting as part 3 of the 4part movie series effect great picture great audii great movie story is good and the pacing with the additional scenes included is great excellent movie
Apr 14 2021,positive,is this a good movie no did i have a ton of fun anyway hell yeah godzilla vs ghidora and seeing all the other titans was so much fun and had my kaiju loving heart felt a little more full
Apr 13 2021,neutral,its really not the best movie i personally think that they didnt have the human storylines good enough but the kijus in it have very good personalities but they just didnt do a very good job on the movie
Apr 13 2021,positive,not bad wanted more monster fighting 
Apr 12 2021,positive,the monsterverse that warner and legendary have made improves with each movie honestly it lives up to everything that toho has done 
Apr 11 2021,negative,a grade z movie with a grade a budget stupid plot i mean incomprehensibly stupid with a bogus environmental message thrown in how humans are destroying the planet ho hum yeah weve heard that before and much more eloquently said its got none of the wit charm and utter weirdness of the old japanese maninasuit godzilla films and relies solely on cgi for keeping ones interest ten years ago that might have worked now it just seems so utterly silly most unforgivably theres lots more human plot offal than monsters fighting its like theyre extras in their own movie hey film makers no one gives a fck about the people more monsters please vera farmiga charles dance the girl from stranger things et al are sadly wasted
Apr 11 2021,positive,i got what i wanted big monsters fighting
Apr 11 2021,negative,what terrible dialogue  good special effects  there is really only so much good actors can do with bad writing
Apr 11 2021,positive,really great movie i recommend it
Apr 10 2021,negative,my god 1 hour and 45 minutes to get to what we all watch godzilla movies for monster rumbles the story and script is embarrassing they could have easily shaved 30 minutes off this clunker and would still have felt bloated and long nothing made sense it almost felt like there were 2 separate movies screening simultaneously id take a guy in a 200 dollar godzilla costume over this any day cgi cant and shouldnt carry a movie 
Apr 10 2021,positive,meet again with another great monsterverse movie godzilla king of the monsters is balanced with the kaiju fighting scenes with the human part
Apr 9 2021,positive,the movie is so good it has human depth good fighting scenes great cgi and score
Apr 9 2021,positive,best of the monster universe movies 
Apr 9 2021,negative,aside from a very small handful of cool scenes this movie is the epitome of cringe and mindnumbing stupidity the writing and dialogue is absolutely atrocious and ruins every single potentially redeeming factor of this movie 100 times over ive never cringed so hard at lines of dialogue in a movie to the point where even i felt embarrassed before my hype for this movie was unreal little did i know they showed nearly every fight scene in the trailers and tv spots every fight scene is also interrupted by human drama yet again thanks to this dumpster fire of a movie i actually appreciate godzilla 2014 a lot more now
Apr 8 2021,positive,a fantastic spectacle but a weak story
Apr 8 2021,positive,come for the kaiju action stay for the kaiju action
Apr 8 2021,positive,meh bad story bad plot amazing sound effects and fight scenes plus cgi was incredible the human characters are so forgettable and just blah it was really rushed of how they did things too i really wished they did more to this film and had longer scenes and would focus more on the humans but overall i would watch it if you love action but for a good important movie you probably wont like it
Apr 8 2021,positive,i think that the movie is kind of like when you eat fast food sure its not the best but its still pretty damn good
Apr 8 2021,positive,i absolutely hated the first godzilla 2014 it was boring had great actors given boring dialogue and generic backstories and bryan cranston was killed off after 20 minutes on screen i would give that film a 410 barely any godzilla in that movie and they kept cutting it off to show random human stuff however i absolutely loved this movie for what it was is it the smartest movie no but its a godzilla movie and it wasnt very stupid or anything except for one characters fate that i feel couldve been prevented are the characters straight from the godfather of course not but theyre wonderfully acted and have genuine emotion this is a godzilla movie and what is so great about it is that the director knows this the movie is really intense and massive in scale so much that it made the last film where they tried making the monsters look scary almost laughable in execution even when there are scenes of humans talking and doing things they most of the time add to the movie rather than detract from it compared to the last one this is because of the super fast pacing and the great soundtrack and visuals for one example instead of in the last movie where they kept showing people watching the news of the fights on screens this movie shows them terrified for their lives multiple times while the action is happening around them instead of cutting away from the action they instead make the humans part of it which while it sounds the same this small change in concept makes huge differences for the film overall if you are wanting monsters and godzilla in histheir own movie you will be happy if you want serviceable funny and emotional characters that add to the movie you will be happy if you want academy award winning performances analyzing different peoples  views on religion you wont get that here it baffles me that the critics hated on this film for story which is not that important even more baffling is that the story and characters are also better here than the 2014 film it gives me a headache just thinking about it definitely check out this film if you sound interested based on the title or any of the trailers which some do spoil a little too much so beware i for one had a great time watching it
Apr 8 2021,positive,the movie is for the true godzilla fans everyone elsewho caresthe criticism its getting is over the top since when do critics get anything right anyway  this movie was a blastall the titans looked great and godzilla was awesomethe soundtrack was perfectone of the best gman movies ever including the new one which focused to much on kong and his story
Apr 7 2021,positive,theres a lot human elements to this film that just flat out dont work theyre only really there to feed us the cool ass backstory of the titans and ultimately just to provide a way of bringing gidorah into the mix reviving our radioactive dinosaur and giving him a little assistance in the final battle     so with that little check list theres no way in hell we need to spend as much time with the humans as we do the first hour could have been reworked re written into 40 minutes they could have shaved a good 10 minutes off from the second hour and we would have minus the credits have an hour and 40 minute movie    this would have given us all the monster action we came to see in much faster pace with less annoying human drama and with the shorter runtime they could have been showing an additional viewing at the theaters a day    but tho this movie fails with its human characters it has some of the best kaiju action ever put out everything with godzilla and the other titans is just wonderful i come into these movies for this and it nails this so i can sit through the first half of this movie just to get the reward but had they fixed that first half this might have been in 2nd place for me in the monsterverse but even at 3rd place i still absolutely love it
Apr 7 2021,neutral,after a triumphant introduction to the monsterverse this film feels like a let down with an incredibly stupid storyline and script anytime the humans are on the screen the film drags unfortunately the kaiju monsters dont quite save the film as their action sequences are ok at best
Apr 7 2021,negative,one of the worst movies  no plot and very confusing  all special effects  id rather stare at a wall for 2 hours
Apr 5 2021,positive,although lacking in many regards with an overzealous message and some at times questionable shot composition this movie does godzilla right and as a godzilla fan i couldnt be happier with this product the music characters and respect for godzilla on display here feels right at home for the franchise especially with such an environmental message that condemns humanities problems its not a movie that will win over new fans to the series but for veterans of the franchise you cant get much better than this
Apr 5 2021,positive,feels like this is getting underrated      its a monster film  the monsters were great  thats all i need    oh and having millie bobbie brown and ending the movie in fenway park were both plusses
Apr 4 2021,negative,incredibly boring  if godzilla was independence day it wasnt it was much better this was resurgence  jurassicworldcontrolroomcomicrelief lines were made so bad in order to be translated for other countries  made sure china was happy by bringing in the famous chinese actress who is loyal to the xi jinping and the chinese communist party    every battle was forgettable compared to the first one which had unique settings and interesting ways that fights happened and ended  giant futuristic submarines and battle stations that could never have been build in a real world and nevermind physics everything is so bad
Apr 4 2021,positive,this film has irrefutable problems the rhythm is bad the human drama is boring and repetitive and sometimes it is a little pointless but the cgi and the action scenes of the monsters are incredible and well done
Apr 4 2021,positive,honestly i dont know how there is such a bad rating this is the best monster movie ever everything there is great and i enjoyed it a lot
Apr 4 2021,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a good movie but there are a few things i dont like about this movie and i have the same probably with this just as i did the last one the pacing is to slow a little worse this time some of the stuff is interesting for example the history of godzilla and ghidorah but nothing is really interesting which leads me to my second point the last movie the human parts were pretty bad but not as bad as this one the human parts in this movie are just a nightmare to watch i was about to fall asleep watching the human parts of the movie also some of these actors didnt seem to put in 100 like vera farmiga theres just some scenes were it seems she just doesnt care about the movie and it kinda just irritates me the best parts about this movie is the visuals and the fight scenes but all in all the fight scenes really makes this movie good anyway im godzilla king of the monsters a 45
Apr 3 2021,positive,much better than the critics scored more easter eggs than godzilla vs kong
Apr 3 2021,positive,godzilla king of the monsters though nothing earthshattering in the world of cinema was a fun monster flick even though theres nothing special about the story its a far more entertaining entry than its often preferred predecessor godzilla 2014 for me i watch a gian monster movie to be entertained by watching said giant monsters fight each other and this godzilla flick in my opinion delivers just that
Apr 3 2021,positive,with eyemeltingly gorgeous visuals intricate world building and a masterful score king of the monsters is a cinematic epic for the ages and an underrated masterpiece the ultimate godzilla movie 
Apr 3 2021,negative,the acting in this movie sucked
Apr 3 2021,neutral,really x50 dumb plot
Apr 3 2021,positive,king ghidra mothra rodan and more its an allout monster brawl as ecoterrorists near boston release the aforementioned titans upon our earth a scientist who lost his son to godzillas san fran attack 5 years prior works to aid godzilla battle the evil kaiju only to have his daughter and exwife aiding the opposition in essence to cleanse the earth of its cancer humanity the humor wasnt as good as the the two previous in this series nor was the soundtrack and the dialogue was miserable on the otherhand the monster designs and battles were fantastic especially king ghidra
Apr 3 2021,negative,this can only be described as big dumb fun however it is just dumb without a whole lot of fun unfortunately an over bombastic mess of of plot this was just incoherent writing the visuals looked watered down which i am surprised to say this there are good actors in this that had the most flatted and uninteresting characters godzilla had a few good fight  scenes a major disappointment
Apr 2 2021,positive,how is this movie bad
Apr 2 2021,positive,the peak of what i wanted of a monster movie  unique monsters humans hyping the monsters up and a beautiful fitting soundtrack
Apr 2 2021,positive,they fckin did it finally we get to see what kaiju movies are about and its about the damn monsters
Apr 2 2021,negative,wtf did i just watch  its so stupid  bad acting  bad plot  over all the best part was the end  
Apr 2 2021,positive,very good movie just hate the karens in this movie it really annoyed me
Apr 1 2021,positive,this movie got hate from critics but there wrong king of the monsters is the sequel to godzilla of 2014 and it surpasses the original in action and monster fest this one has a bigger cast and it only brings ken watanabe and sally hawkins and david straihairm from the original here the cast is led by millie bobby brown vera farmiga and kyle chandler in this one godzilla returns and is joined by his iconic counterparts in kaiju lore rodan mothra and king ghidorah leading to epic battles between the monsters with epic destruction the movie is plagued by stupid dialogue and jokes but the human drama allows for emphaty with the characters and gives resonance to the monster mayhem charles dance as the villain also does a good job but is the monsters that shine and make this an excellent blockbuster
Apr 1 2021,positive,awesome movie the plot and characters were a little weak but everything else was amazing this movie respects the franchise so much and remasters the old godzilla formula for a modern american audience awesome movie if i was asked to create a godzilla movie this would be exactly what i would attempt to accomplish
Apr 1 2021,positive,i do believe rotten tomatoes got it worng this was by far the best godzilla movies i have ever seen it was full of action packed excitement i had the privilege of seeing i love the the movie the story line and all of the badass monsters that came along with it i think everyone should rewatch this
Apr 1 2021,positive,like most godzilla fans of a certain age much of my love for the series comes from memories of showa era movies this is the closest that any of the modern kaiju movies has come to capturing their essence and grandiosity but with cutting edge effects the artic reveal scene was worth the ticket price alone
Apr 1 2021,positive,excellently made godzilla movie was constantly on the edge of my seataction scenes were amazing cant get enough
Apr 1 2021,negative,a shameless wannabe monster showdowns with a lot of wannabe good actions that is actually unserved by the direction how can you still do a movie with all the actions happening by night hiding your cgi behind rain and all the possible weather conditions not acceptable and notify that by spoiling this is a shame because it was the only thing the movie has for its defense because the script is just horrible poorly written with dialogues from another dimension and a plot that so bad its not even good a big let down
Apr 1 2021,neutral,the monster fighting is good but the human drama is totally meh
Apr 1 2021,positive,uniquely balanced script superb vfx cool homage to the classic franchise and awesome background score made this film a must watch for every kaiju film fans overall its a dumb but highly entertaining film and it will be worth the time
Apr 1 2021,positive,while the human drama and attempted humor weigh it down noticeably there is enough visual spectacle and monster action that its worth a viewing if not a rewatch
Apr 1 2021,positive,godzilla is a good movie but it needed more monsters fighting 
Apr 1 2021,positive,such a great and fun movie one thing that i love is that the filmmakers did a phenomenal job or portraying the gigantic size of the titans the scope of the shots make you feel dwarfed especially on a big screen
Mar 31 2021,positive,saw it when it came out and it was pretty enjoyable it was my first godzilla movie and i could follow it quite well i do get why some people would like more monster battles or scenes on godzilla
Mar 31 2021,neutral,wb took the criticism from the first film and did try to do better cranking up the monsters but they also cranked the human characters which again no one cares about in these type of films but i believe they did a worse job than the previous film the jokes were cringe beyond belief one scene that really showed that this was for a buck was when godzilla was about to clash into another titan only to see a big ass cg plane take up the fight and screen this is my least favourite of wb titan universe
Mar 31 2021,negative,a bunch of noise and dumb writing and characters this action is a diverse movie for people critics didnt really like it and audience loved it for me personally the critics are right again because this made godzilla what godzilla shouldnt be that is boring
Mar 31 2021,positive,more godzilla action than its predecessor but less of an actual intriguing story
Mar 31 2021,positive,if you take this movie for what it is its a fun ride with great action buts held back by bland uninteresting story
Mar 31 2021,positive,a completely awesome movie definitely one of my new favorites i love godzilla
Mar 31 2021,positive,great visuals solid action good story you will fall in love with godzilla at the end however the typical americanssavingtheworld cliche has just become too ridiculous now needed a more diverse range of characters
Mar 30 2021,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters is a very mediocre sequel to a much better first film the effects are good the sound is great and some of the monster fights are terrific but the movies extensive action got bothersome rather quickly the writing is very bad and all of the films actors are wasted on such bland roles the darkness in the films aesthetic was also quite frustrating
Mar 30 2021,neutral,micheal dougherty seems to be under the impression that redditworthy humor and asinine and contrived references are an excuse for a decent screenplay
Mar 29 2021,positive,the script focused on the humans is lame but seeing the wrestling between all these japanese kaijus with a proper hollywood budget is totally worth the see
Mar 29 2021,negative,with godzilla vs kong about to come out i thought id finally go ahead and watch godzilla king of the monsters i enjoyed the 1998 godzilla movie by far better than this one the dismal plot of this one does little to offset the special effects
Mar 29 2021,positive,good action  bad characters
Mar 28 2021,positive,this movie is full of great special effects and the action scenes are jawdropping i didnt care much about the people in this story i came to see monster action and thats exactly what this movie gave me if your only interested in monster action then this is a must whatch
Mar 28 2021,positive,it may not be dark as the first godzilla 2014 movie but it is action packed  it has more titans than godzilla 2014 and it shows more about the monsterverse universe  for me its a 910
Mar 28 2021,positive,godzilla king of the monsters godzillas first outing in the west in five years is a really great movie to see especially in a theatre room on a normal tv screen this movie probably wont have the same feeling as it does in a theatre but it is still a good movie nonetheless as a godzilla movie its phenomenal as a movie in general its good as you watch this movie you feel the raw power these titans have king ghidorahs role in this movie is eery and spectacular rodans was phenomenal and easily had the best cg out of the titans whenever mothra would appear on screen youd feel hopeful and over the course of the movie you really start to care about her godzilla himself was amazing it was great having a godzilla movie where you can sympathize with him and feel emotional about him for the movies faults the cgi at some points can be pretty bad and the human characters are bland and pretty stale unlike the main charactersthe titans the constant cutting from monster action to human reactions can be annoying but tolerable i definitely recommend this movie to any kaiju and daikaiju fan or just movie fan in general
Mar 28 2021,positive,a big improvement over the first godzilla but still not king of the monsterverse
Mar 27 2021,positive,this movie is just proof that amazing cgi spectacle cannot carry a movie of course there are redeeming moments but the majority of the human plot feels rather convoluted a confusing plot and poorly written character motivations make the spaces in between monster showdowns feel like an eternity this made a two and a half hour movie feel like a four hour one you will get some enjoyment from it but you could probably just google the monster fight scenes and save yourself some trouble
Mar 25 2021,positive,must watch for any fans both for starters and hardcore fans the story is pretty weird and is nothing compared to 2014 the characters are so many and so many in fact some died the pacing is fast and steady unlike the 2014 one the monsters are farbetter here introducing both old and new kaijus are really good the music is welldone and makes you think its a godzilla theme overall not bad like most critics say definitly watch this before going to watch godzilla vs kong
Mar 25 2021,positive,loved it  what i expected to watch 
Mar 23 2021,positive,solid kaiju film with some great action and visual effects but suffers from a soso story and a cast that gets lost in the chaos  while the film has a great group of actors their performances are mostly lost in the shuffle with the monsters taking center stage  director michael daugherty does deliver on the monster action but the story is rather boring the villain plot is past cliche  he does get points for some nice nods to the previous films from using godzillas original theme to giving a nod to the twins from mothra  overall a fun film but in no way a classic
Mar 23 2021,negative,this is a 2 hour movie that struggles to be more fun to watch than its own trailers beginning with the story it is unimportant and does nothing to make the viewer care while im not expecting kubrick levels of depth from a godzilla blockbuster pic i would like to at least be given any reason to care about the on screen action secondly the action the cgi is impressive but thats kind of it it is dark rainy and non descript in location in nearly all action scenes this movie simply isnt worth your time
Mar 21 2021,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is an amazing spectacle to experience as it delivers on an amazing payoff while also brilliantly setting up its universe you get what you came to see an epic faceoff against the giantsall stitched up in one easy to follow plot
Mar 18 2021,positive,this secula shows us the best visual and special effects its plot is not very good but it is entertaining in short an enjoyable movie
Mar 17 2021,positive,godzilla king of monsters will be viewed in one of two ways it is either a great improvement over 2014s godzilla with more attention to the monsters and lessening the human storyline or it is a poorly written and underdeveloped film that focused too much on the monsters  while godzilla king of monsters answered the criticism from the first film by giving us more of the monster madness this was done at the cost of a coherent story that its predecessor did have director michael dougherty while the film is a visual spectacle failed to deliver anything worthwhile  one of the driving forces behind 2014s godzilla was the cohesiveness between the human storyline and the monster madness that was more is not always better and this film proved the ageold adage  the talents of millie bobby brown and ken watanabe were wasted here they excelled in their performance over the rest of their castmates as they attempted to do something with the poorly written material provided to them  regardless the film remains a visual spectacle as watching the interactions and battles between godzilla mothra king ghidorah and rodan are absolutely beautiful  it is a shame that such iconic monsters were wasted on such a poorly executed film
Mar 17 2021,negative,absolute trash if they spent a quarter of the time on the story as they did with special effects it couldve been good no effort was put forth characters were dumb and scene after scene was ridiculousnot believable el shouldve died she shouldve been stuck under a rock at fenway and that couldve made up for everything but no she didnt and somehow passed out in a bathtub under some rubbel and passed out and revived herself without the use of cpr just straight trash
Mar 16 2021,positive,great movie made by fans for fan absolutely a fun monster film a shame that there was no wide shot fights scene or really good scene of monsters causing city destructions but this is by far one of my favorite movies in the godzilla franchise
Mar 12 2021,positive,i wasnt a huge fan of 2014s godzilla but the trailer and special effects for the sequel had my interest overall i felt about the sequel much the same i felt about the first one the storyline was meh but the effects were good so depending on how you enjoyed the 2014 installment will determine how you enjoy this years release
Mar 11 2021,positive,legendarys undeniable masterpiece
Mar 11 2021,negative,i hate humans in this kind of movies and that teen girl is the worst thing about this movie
Mar 9 2021,negative,rancid probably the worst godzilla movie of all time
Mar 8 2021,neutral,after godzilla 2014 godzilla king of the monsters answer to the audiences demand to see more monster and less human drama is bloated overlong and noisy the cgi and photography are also a noticeable step down from its predecessor
Mar 7 2021,negative,that movie is ugly i dont see any monster fight the cam is shake all time the characters dont have personality   a low drama the characters dont work they are flat without emotions the script have not sense very hard to see a decent monsters fight horrible camera zoom to godzilla that zoom of camera remember me an antique 70s movie kung fu godzilla king of monster or maybe king of nothing
Mar 7 2021,negative,this film makes 2014s godzilla look minimalist in comparison there is just so much going on in this movie and some of the ideas are pretty interesting but others feel rushed and out of place atlantis really the cgi in this movie has also taken a drastic downturn from its predecessor  most of the monsters look like they were drawn by an edgy 14yearold and it makes it really hard to take any of it seriously the humor is all pretty forced and the movie flips arbitrarily between being aware of how goofy it is and taking itself far too seriously there were a few decent scenes and some of the monster fights are pretty engaging but this whole film feels like a lazy action ripoff with no soul
Mar 6 2021,negative,not like godzilla or kong the two first installments in the series and a great start too many gadgets in this thing and the human story sucked i had thought how many people died in this and it was hohum lets used the oxygen destroyer the mother wants to destroy the world because her kid died yikes the bases were well protectednot i pray godzilla vs kong isnt a mess like this one
Mar 6 2021,positive,if you want a monster movie with tons of destruction and epic visuals this is the movie for you fantastic even with the boring people drama that was in it
Mar 4 2021,negative,nothing happened roar
Mar 3 2021,positive,godzilla king of the monsters despite a somewhat weak story is a visual masterpiece that ups the action and performances compared to the first movie and this makes it an atomic blast to watch
Mar 2 2021,positive,this movie is a great movie never mind the critics all they care about is story but never mind that this movie has the most epic monster battles of all time i also love this movie because it got me through a tough time my grandmother had just passed and i was changing schools so these events were really hard on me but i kept going and when we finally watched it i loved it please take my word for it it is great and thank you so much michael doherty for making this amazing film
Mar 1 2021,neutral,coming five years after legendary pictures 2014 reboot godzilla king of the monsters was sold as everything fanboys had been waiting for the ultimate showdown between godzilla and archenemy king ghidorah with mothra and rodan added to the mix all of tohos mightiest titans would clash in an extinction level brawl it was going to be awesome or so we thought what we ended up with instead was something of a mixed bag    overall the dark and somber mood is fitting given the massive destruction and repeated warnings that humanity is facing extinction the original 1954 godzilla was dead serious and often deeply somber that said there are times when things are a bit too dark and humorless more seriously much of the film is far too slow with too little of godzilla and the other monsters instead most of the time and focus is put on the human characters and their struggles leaving the monsters largely in the background except when the humans are fighting or running from them    this is one of the main criticisms that was leveled against the 2014 reboot then it was less of an issue because that film was essentially a disaster movie in which the monsters were presented as forces of nature much like an earthquake or a hurricane and the story about was ordinary people struggling to survive their destruction and we did see a fair amount of godzilla and the mutos rampage even if actual monster battles didnt come until the end but here in a movie explicitly sold as a showdown between godzilla mothra rodan and king ghidorah pushing their rampages to the background is the worst approach to take    that isnt to say its all bad this movie does manage to avoid the main story issue that many of the classic toho films had which was their difficulty making the human characters and their subplots connect to the monster action or have any real significance in the grand scheme of things king of the monsters takes the opposite approach the characters here are soldiers scientists and ecoterrorists who spend the movie fighting chasing and trying to contain or control the monsters while battling each other more than once the outcome the fate of the world literally depends on the heros success     plot wise there are also a lot of good ideas here many of them taken from previous godzilla films the problem is that filmmakers decided to stuff in too many of them resulting in an overly cluttered plot and because most of these ideas revolve around monarchs activities and inner working too much time spent focused on the humans to the detriment of the monster action i feel like this might have worked in a limited series but for a twohour movie it just slows things down too much    that said what monster action is featured is quite good i particularly enjoyed king ghidorahs cataclysmic awakening scene which is highly suspenseful and includes some of the movies best effects ghidorah and godzillas early skirmishes are all too brief but the final battle is a real treat mothras fight scene is also impressive although briefer than it should be  there are also some very good shootouts and aerial combat sequences and the visual effects are excellent throughout    the monster designs are very good as well godzilla appears much as he did in the previous film but with more prominent dorsal spines and claws which is a definite plus in my books rodans design which incorporates volcanic elements and fire effects may be the best yet and ghidorah is at his most powerful and menacing mothra is the one monster whos design im a bit ambivalent about theyve chosen to blend the classic design with features based on various species of actual months such as longer legs and more angular swept back wings the results are interesting and more threatening but i still prefer the classic toho design    its not surprising that reception has been largely positive among long time godzilla fanboys and less demanding viewers just looking for a big dumb action movie will probably get their moneys worth the effects and action scenes are great and it isnt nearly as boring as some have said but this still feels like a missed opportunity overall its too slow too complicated and rarely as fun as a kaiju movie should be theres just not enough monster action and it takes too long to get to the good parts we can only hope that legendary pictures has learned its lessons from kotms underwhelming box office and that godzilla vs kong will have tighter pacing and more screentime for its real stars
Feb 28 2021,positive,little choppy here and there story is meh but dammit the monster fights are epic as piss
Feb 28 2021,negative,the plot was a dumb as it gets  it was a waste of 2 hours of my time
Feb 27 2021,negative,yikes this was baaaaaaaad like reallly bad it took me two sittings to finish this i watched this on my 140 3d projector so i can usually get some sort of big screen enjoyment out of these big dumb movies but all the monster action was hidden behind the perspective of our atrocious human characters commentating on the fight and reacting to every single thing it was really cringey and hard to finish if i had paid to see this in the theater i would probably have walked out
Feb 23 2021,positive,baaam best monster movie eveeer this is me and my boys favorite its an ultimate monster movie but it came out at a time when no one cared about monster movies  it really is surprising its got piles of action and even got some plot in there and it was good plot too max stars
Feb 22 2021,neutral,the storyline is a train wreck no one cares as the plot moves along we are simply waiting for the monsterfest and battles scenes if you try to patiently let the plot stumble on youll be disappointed turn your brain off and fastforward to the battle sequences and youll have fun    oh yeah one more thing that irritates me godzilla can stand up in the ocean but then he immediately dives down into the vast water which is obviously much deeper how is doing this levitation lol so stupid
Feb 19 2021,positive,wasnt expecting to be so hyped by this what really makes this film stand out is the makers have realised how audiences care about the human stories intense action and it is intense and stunning visual sequences are fantastic but its the writing and journey of the characters in this film that makes it legendarys best so far a fun thrilling epic ride with fantastic characters and plot awesome sequel set up too cant wait for the next one
Feb 15 2021,positive,godzillaking of the monsters is an awesome monster action film
Feb 14 2021,positive,i am sending a critique not to criticize but to provide feedback for future monster movies   actually this can be more generally applied to all fictional movies in terms of cgi         im a big fan of monster movies as a kid i had a reoccurring on occasion dream of king kong trying to get me by reaching in the windows of my parents home  actually at a young age the dream was quite rational and long eg kong would part the trees in the landscape and walk down my parents back 40 to get me  i was terrified but at the same time upon waking delighted to have these dreams         just as a fan im 50 critique of monsters now versus then         king kong doesnt smile    im looking at google à images for king kong smiling  there is the old king kong with the occasional smile or other personality trait but the new king kong there isnt  i think there is an opportunity cost at pushing the narrative that war is hell constantly in combat and being tough  gorillas for example are hilarious when they smile          cgi is evolving but cgi movies are not    every time i see a cgi movie a part of my imagination closes the door  ive debated in my own mind why cgi movies have this effect over the years and a few observations      1       modern movies are too fast paced which is also exacerbated when i must turn my head  scan the theatre screen to take in all that is happening  the last movie i saw in theatres i think it was star wars  my family sat towards the front and i could not take in all that was happening    ill give you an example of what i mean  decades ago watching aliens monsters where not cgi and scenes were cost prohibitive   so what did movie creators do  slowed down expensive scene sequences gave ample time for anticipation to build and like the son of man portrait left wanting to seek out and discover the entire character  fast forward i get that every scene costs the same with cgi but it is definitely a different concept now perhaps to go with a different audience  on a side note watching the movie again at home i realize scenes ive missed and more importantly twists and turns in the plot     2       cgi movies still dont look real but i know the technology is quickly evolving and i estimate that it is probably already there in terms of resolution speed and realism   this would be in terms of physics modeling how things move in the real world and realism possible in terms of time span or feasibility  also scenes look like portraits eg have yellow light on them    3       and last of all if these are even legitimate but shape of head lol  godzilla and king kong are bigger than life giant super versions of real life  i assumed since childhood that their intelligence transcends normal gorillas or lizards and is closer to me being the super creatures they are  yes you guessed it king kong smiling with a giant brain or at least more pronounced than the real life version  fast forward godzilla and king kong have sloping foreheads with presumably limited intelligence     anyway that is what i wanted to convey and i didnt do this other than as a fan and hopefully to help you wow your audience grab their attention and engage better         best regards    sincerely    anthony p
Feb 14 2021,negative,some plot twists are so out of nowhere they are almost insulting and this was the plot godzilla king of the monsters it was an absolute chore getting through this nonsensical movie almost all the monster fights are short and have an extremely obstructed view which is exactly what you dont want in a godzilla movie it makes the same mistakes the 2014 film does but even worst also some of the worst dialogue that i wish i could laugh art but its all way too cringe to even be that
Feb 12 2021,neutral,it has some cool monster fight scenes but overall its a ok movie at best the best thing about this movie is that it make me appreciate the 2014 godzilla even more
Feb 10 2021,negative,more like godzilla king of cringy plot  this movie fails miserably at trying to continue with the midly success and surprisingly good story that its previous installment brought us all due to its weak plot and the painfultowatch performances caused by characters written with the personality of a seaweed  honestly i wish its premiere had been planned for 2020 to save us all the hassle of watch in big screen how hollywood slaughter our favorite theropodagain
Feb 10 2021,positive,its a mutha effin monster movie cmon
Feb 9 2021,negative,evetything in the movie explodes and is very expectable i would not waste my time again on this movie
Feb 9 2021,positive,everything you want in a godzilla movie 
Feb 8 2021,positive,fuck critics embrace godzilla
Feb 8 2021,positive,its so good the sound effects the actors the plot i just didnt like how the other titans dissapear during the film i hope they use them in godzilla x king kong
Feb 7 2021,positive,haters gonna hate but this movie will always be one of the most incredible monster film with the great cinematic picture and clear story by explaining each of the characters gradually that the audience understand the plot and pleased by the movie
Feb 7 2021,negative,im being very fair here with the half star because the kaiju themselves were a delight but the film feel heavily weighed down by the human characters deer god what a boring film it the transformer sequels of godzilla sequels
Feb 6 2021,negative,the human side of these movies are terrible bad acting at the end of this one your forced to root for the people who wanted to kill billions of people
Feb 5 2021,positive,this movie is very underrated i love this and think its much better than the previous the actions more enjoyable and theres real consequences to what happens
Feb 3 2021,positive,i thought this movie was extremely fun and exiting but the humans drags it down a lot and they stink but its mostly monster and it is awesome at that
Feb 2 2021,positive,i think is the best movie of the monster verse i loved kong but this is almast perfect
Feb 1 2021,positive,heres a pop quiz  question 1 what are the conditions needed  to be met for a good godzilla movie  answer huge amount of godzilla  question 2 what do godzilla fans want to see in a godzilla movie  answer huge amount of godzilla  question 3 what did godzilla fans get in godzilla king of the monsters  answer huge amount of godzilla    that huge amount of godzilla is also backed up by the other giant monsters like mothra rodan and of course ghidorah ghidorahs presence had a feeling of worry and fear he was done amazing in this movie as is the case with mothra and rodan they werent as frightening but were really well done also the movie was able to make us sorta connect with the monsters as well the monsters werent just fighting but also had a bit of emotion as well which is great the music is fantastic and nostalgic the effects are really good also im sure hard core godzilla fans like me will have a blast watching this movie    there you go case closed 5 stars    that was for it for the review    i can see why critics dont like this movie lack of good characters an ok plot or story but thats not the point huge monsters fighting each other and destroying cities is the point unlike other monsters in other monster movies the monsters in the godzilla movies or the monsterverse are the main characters the importance godzilla has represented in the big screen is almost as big as batman us godzilla fans dont care about the humans plot story in godzilla movies we care about the monsters in these movies and that is exactly what we got in the movie and it did not disappoint it delivered exactly what we wanted like i said before im sure hard core godzilla fans like me will have a blast watching this movie
Jan 31 2021,negative,godzilla king of the monsters is not very good im sorry king of the monsters like all modern blockbusters these days looks fantastic the monsters are perfect and the movie continues to use the scale of the monsters to perfection the monster fights are the best theyve ever been and the movie for the most part makes good use of godzilla ghidorah mothra and rodan but beyond that theres not a lot that i liked in this movie the characters are really boring and forgettable the story is confusing and stupid and the final battle between the titans gets to a point of ridiculousness charles dance and godzilla are the best parts about this movie but beyond that its really not something id want to watch unless i wanted to torture my soul i really wanted to love this movie but i just cant and after this i am very worried about godzilla vs kong and the future of the monsterverse if they keep hiring the same people who wrote this mess of a movie
Jan 30 2021,negative,an absolute suckfest from start to end i would rather stub my pinky toe on my mother in laws guest bed than have to endure this pile of dreck again
Jan 30 2021,negative,this is a couple years late given that the movie came out in 2019 tonight i watched the 2014 godzilla movie and the 2019 follow up this piece of crap im reviewing    warner bros you had planned to kick off an entire monster universe with the 2019 movie and we all know by now it failed big time with the movie being a big time failure at the box office and its no wonder why the 2019 film is an enormous pile of crap  the story is so far out there that its not even enjoyable to watch seriously i dont know how many times i rolled my eyes    you cant even compare the 2019 film to the 2014 film which was a great film with a much more sound story and enjoyable    i sure hope the upcoming kong vs godzilla is on par with the 2014 film    whos in charge of your film division in 20182019 when the latest godzilla was filmed would have been the same time that ww1984 was filmed which we all know that sequel was far from what it was expected to be    please take a look at your formula as it needs some updating as youre releasing crap
Jan 29 2021,positive,i like how the humans and the monsters story intertwine
Jan 28 2021,positive,that feeling everything is so colossal and the actor are just ants this is incredible
Jan 28 2021,positive,were the critics brided to fuck this movie it gives the fans what they wanted but was underadvertised and slammed by critics i hope godzilla vs kong does better
Jan 27 2021,positive,godzillaking of the monsters is a huge action fun
Jan 27 2021,positive,in the story department is is boring and not well executed but im sure nobody was here for that if you want a film with a good story with interesting characters then look elsewhere if you want a giant lizard fighting gigantic monsters in over the top explosive mayhem then sit down and give it a watch
Jan 25 2021,positive,i think its a good movie
Jan 25 2021,positive,i dont know why this movie got a trashing from critics its like critics dont know what they want from a godzilla movie either complaining that hes too dark or either too goofy anyways its nice to see these monsters finally incorporated into the monsterverse and aside from a meh human subplot i thought it was a nice throwback to the classic toho movies and am excited to see king kong fight godzilla for a second time again if you like the classic toho monsters or even pacific rim then youll like this movie
Jan 25 2021,positive,godzilla king of the monsters has all the giant monster fights you can handle
Jan 23 2021,positive,the monster story line and action alone makes it worth watching the human element was hit or miss
Jan 23 2021,positive,its better than godzilla 2014 but not as good as kong skull island to much of the humans vera farmiga is just a horrible character in this movie but the monster battles theyre just too fun if you are looking for a character driven story look somewhere else its a very stupid movie but its so fun
Jan 23 2021,neutral,cheesy plot and underdeveloped characters wont save nice effects
Jan 20 2021,positive,1010 would reccomend it
Jan 17 2021,negative,the 2014 movie had its faults but was still fun and a respectable godzilla film king of the monsters brazenly rubs all its mistakes in your face only thing that kept me awake was scorning at its numerous illogical and poorlythought out plot points plays like a b movie with a movie visual effects but with none of the artistic vision or story
Jan 15 2021,negative,the most overrated godzilla movie of all time
Jan 14 2021,positive,you have to take a movie for what its worth i grew up as a big fan of godzilla and was really disappointed in the 2014 version which spent much too much time on humans and much too little time on godzilla this movie wipes out all the mistakes of 2014 its not a perfect movie but it went far beyond the last release if you never watched godzilla movies as a kid you cant truly appreciate how far its come long live the king
Jan 3 2021,positive,fun movie i dont see why the low score im loving this series since the 2014 godzilla     longlivetheking
Dec 29 2020,positive,again  i really like this movie alot more  i watch godzilla king of the monsters 2019 in theater since my graduation   they have respect the kaiju classic and the human are absolute perfect
Dec 14 2020,neutral,sadly this film is not as awesome as the 2014 film the characters were cringe and a mess in this film keeps cutting away too much when the monster fighting the film is not as beautiful looking shin godzilla and godzilla 2014 look more beautiful too much action and not enough military and destruction scenes
Dec 13 2020,positive,lets be real the acting and story are pretty subpar but this movie isnt about all that drama bs if you wanna see big ass monsters beat the living shit out of each other for a few hours this is the movie for you watching godzilla and co straight up bop some mfers is an absolute joy fck the top critics  just enjoy our big lizard friend turning into a living nuke and fck shit up
Dec 9 2020,positive,love it some great cgi and great action
Dec 8 2020,positive,this movie is basic but still fun the dialogue is bad but the action and effects and sound made me giggle like a little girl so it okay
Dec 3 2020,negative,no amount of cool action can save this movie from being nearly unwatchable the dialogue is horrendous with scenes that drag on forever with some of the clunkiest worst written exposition youve ever heard the characters are written like cardboard cutouts and the performances are not much better than the writing the only positive was that the visuals had several moments that were truly jaw dropping job well done to the vfx team apparently the only ones who worked on this film with any level of competence even the action the only occasional positive part in this movie is often poorly choreographed and way way too fast the first godzilla got crap for being too slow and showing too little godzilla but at least that film gave you a sense of the scale and size of the monsters whos slower more realistic physics make the creatures seem plausible this sequel instead has monsters taller than skyscrapers running and jumping at each other at a pace so ridiculously fast that it looks like normal size iguanas running around a miniature model of a city much like the makers of pacific rim ii the team behind godzilla ii somehow misses the fact that speeding up action to cartoonish levels only makes it worse much much worse complete waste of what could have been an epic monster brawl popcorn blockbuster
Dec 3 2020,neutral,its not a masterpiece but its fine if you want a decent monsterbrawl to fill the time youd think though with such a good cast the story would be better but i think the writers choke on 4 too many monsters while piecing together a central idea
Nov 29 2020,positive,this was a pretty fun action movie and has some sick monster fights but the movie is mostly wasted on uninteresting human talk
Nov 29 2020,negative,this is the worst godzilla movie ever  i have seen all of the ishiro honda movies i am not saying its a ishiro honda movie but you that does like it you got to know it has way to much action  i did like how mothra killed rodan  but they do know that kijus dont die  anyways its just one of the wort movies ever  its just a wast of 2 hours and 3 mins  so obviously i dont recommend it 
Nov 14 2020,positive,wow just wow best godzilla movie ever who cares if the story is bad awesome monster action 1010
Nov 5 2020,positive,while it doesnt come close to beating the incredible 2014 godzilla movie godzilla kom is still an awesome action packed addition to the monsterverse
Oct 31 2020,positive,this time the titanstudying agency monarch along with the mighty godzilla and the magnificent mothra face off against a plethora of godsized monsters now awaken by godzillas ultimate nemesis the threeheaded king ghidorah the fight action sequences are spectacular the sacrifices are painful and even if the plot is nonsensical and unrealistic in terms of radiation exposure effects obviously it manages to be somehow entertaining accompanied by a score which returns to the original japanese roots of the most famous kaiju also kong is coming next
Oct 25 2020,positive,not a huge story plot but such a great looking movie and great battle scenes really stood out in imax
Oct 25 2020,neutral,can get a bit boring from the too many closecalls just to keep the main characters alive story was okay but the acting was not that good some scenes were nice to watch but it was just they were not done very well mainly the monster fights were the good parts but not even that was very satisfying to watch
Oct 16 2020,negative,i hope hollywood stop selling us millie bobby brown cause she sucks
Oct 12 2020,positive,my son loved it me not so much
Oct 12 2020,negative,very cringy to watch  the plot was meh but the acting was straight up hot garbage for a millie bob brown movie i was expecting way better acting it seemed way to fake normally i dont like when people do that talking to themselves when in a stressful situation thing but this was straightup fake for example when they were in the humvee the army dude said if you guys were my parents i would leave home and they instantly thought maddie was at home like what logic is that this happened many times and people are just too movie like and its to a point where you cant even think of anything realistic i regret buying this
Oct 10 2020,negative,the most nonmichael bay michael bay movie ever constant destruction and chaos halfway through i completely tuned out its like a way more mindless cgi mess of pacific rim
Oct 7 2020,positive,i think its amazing i came to the cinema to see giant monsters fight each other like old times and thats what i got fascinating
Sep 26 2020,positive,i loved the movie  i honestly had never seen such art already made on the screen of theaters what a movie i was looking so hard for a film that would make me jump and jump with emotion anger sadness and joy that film gave me more passion for cinema always on weekends i see this masterpiece of cinema sincerely there is no other film so perfect and so well done that ive already seen but of course im not here just to suck up right im here to talk about constructive criticism too for example i think they should focus more on kaijus and not on humans out of nowhere leaves for a human scene this is the only thing that bothers me the fact that focusing a lot on humans would be much better if they focused a lot more on kaijus in fact one thing that i am loving in this film is the fact that they are shipping godzilla with mothra please that this is true that you confirm that they are a couple  i will love it if that is true well more is that apart from that one detail the film is wonderful my favorite film and i just want to see er my gojira beat the kong down
Sep 23 2020,positive,was pretty good i cant exactly remember the first one but this wouldve been just as good if you hadnt seen the first i followed the story and the graphics were pretty good 
Sep 21 2020,negative,i couldnt stay interested its nonsensical and ridiculous theres too many monsters the story is absurd its mostly just giant cgi monsters crashing into each other for 2 hours
Sep 20 2020,positive,enjoy it for what it is giant monsters smashing things 
Sep 16 2020,negative,dumb so dumb if youre desperate to see giant cgi things hitting each other you could watch this but youre much better off with pacific rim
Sep 12 2020,positive,passed the time was interessting
Sep 10 2020,positive,i dont understand what critics dont like about this movie the visuals and sound design are out of this world the human characters and the monsters dont lean one way or the other and the wonderful score returns to the original musical material that true fans know and love
Sep 4 2020,negative,the only good thing about this movie is fights between monsters which like 25 of the movie rest is just boring story of main characters that you dont care or dont want to because they constantly make stupid choices and risk other peoples life to save their loved ones average acting and lame dialogue  interactions i mean why would mark tell about his divorce and becoming alcoholic because of it to a person he has met an hour ago    also all these fight sequence take place in dark and foggy environment i mean why just why the fight choreography is good but its not clear    i wanna be the first person to say godzilla this version is weak af and doesnt deserve to be ruler of other titans i mean spoiler alert  he gets his ass beat twice by the godhira and falls on the ground like a bitch and both time is resurrected by others firstly by nuke secondly by mothira who literally dies to save and transfer its power to godzilla     if you have watched kong youll know its way better the fights are visible he has a clear goal  to protect the island and its people doesnt need any help to kill other monsters he definately deserves to be king of titans i am not a fan of king kong im just saying    all i wanted was godzilla kicking the shit outta other monsters for an hour which i should be able to see clearly is that too much to ask come on man
Sep 1 2020,positive,as a godzilla fan this is incredible seeing all of the monsters from the past now revamped in this film seeing mothra rodan and king gidoriah back in action makes me smile     godzilla king of the monsters 2019 is awesome and its fight scenes are worth watching over and over again its worth watching especially if your a godzilla fan
Aug 30 2020,positive,ok mediocre godzilla sequel starring the main girl from the conjuring the one guy from bloodline and millie bobby brown this movie for me was all over the place i hated every single character in this movie they bored me to death and their motivations were week and made no sense the monster action sequences were great and thats pretty much what i wanted but after 1 hour and a half of that when the final battle happens at the end i was all monstered out it didnt feel cool any more i almost fell asleep during this movie and writing this review a day later i prettymuch forgot what happened
Aug 30 2020,negative,what did i think of godzilla king of the monsters check out my review below  
Aug 29 2020,negative,one of the most boring movies ive ever seen
Aug 25 2020,negative,godzilla king of the monsters gives us good cgi effects but with cuts that make the movie bad and mediocre
Aug 22 2020,positive,this is a great movie trashed by critics thank them for the delay of kong vs godzilla this great effects decent story and q perfect summer film
Aug 17 2020,negative,the best part of the movie was the guy who fell asleep in the seat next to me at the theater he snored loudly which was much more entertaining than this they keep focusing on the people when the obvious attraction is the monsters when the final fight happens and they spend 70 of the time on the people what is the point also the story was ridiculous and stupid i can overcome that if you would just showcase the monsters more
Aug 17 2020,positive,this is my favorite movie of 2019 as much as i love godzilla 2014 kotm is a great improvement over 2014s shortcomings michael dougherty should feel pride for creating a film that respects godzillas legacy in both serious and overthetop aspects there is a dedication at the end of the credits to two veteran toho crew members producer yoshimitsu banno and actor haruo nakajima which is well deserved and kind    on the monster side of things godzilla is honored once again mothra king ghidorah and rodan have been portrayed really well considering that this is their first film debuts outside of japan and their integration into the legendary series is welcoming bear mccreary deserves a reward for making mothras theme sound awesome the other monsters we see queen muto scylla and behemoth my personal favorite new titan may have short time on screen but if the fanbase really adores these new characters then legendary has surely done something right    on the human side of things ill delve into the returning characters first i think dr serizawa had the best character resolution to his arc it was fantastic without giving much away dr vivienne graham mary brown will be missed   admiral william stenz makes a return and it was out of nowhere which ill get to later as for the new characters i think the russell family dynamic in this film is a compelling one some people may have issue with emma russell as an antagonist but shes not villainous she is caught between her loyalty to the ecoterrorists plot and her role as a mother if anything the films human villain is alan jonah played by charles dance his titan counterpart would be king ghidorah mark and madison russell do their parts well their titan counterpart would be godzilla dr ilene chen is a welcome addition her titan counterpart would be mothra rick stantons comedic dialogue may throw some people off but he wasnt a line dispenser all the time plus stanton and chens back and forth dialogue on is worth noting    the fights are much better than they were back in 2014 back then gareth edwards made the bold move to cut to the aftermath which did spark the debate of how much a monsters screen time in a movie is enough in order to be sufficient legendarygoji in 2014 had roughly the same amount of time on still as did shodaigoji in 1954 if not more so i think people have confused cutaways with screen time which are two different things on one side people can appreciate this move because it means youre not looking at a cgi model long enough to notice how not real it is which is a criticism that ive heard for pacific rim and transformers so an argument for less is more can be made here additionally it gives the cgi animators less daunting work to do as animating a cgi model in a scene is not as simple and cheap as people think especially when compared to practical effects like suits and puppets on the other side people can find these cutaways annoying as it diverts them away from the action so they feel as though they are missing out on the monsters when it cuts away to the human cast    well in kotm the fights dont cut to the aftermath the cutaways this time are short and always return to the action so it feels as though we are not missing out on the action the people who fundamentally find the cutaways annoying are going to be the just here for godzilla crowd the crowd that doesnt care about the human cast and just shrug off the writing and storytelling of the characters rather than assessing them if you get enjoyment out of the human cast and their writing like i did then the cutaways will have little to no effect on the enjoyment you get from the monster action if you dont then youll find that the cutaways are obstructive and annoying and you may even write off the human characters as annoying as well i understand both sides of this topic because they are equally valid perspectives but they are not the objective truth a cutaway is a cutaway it is an interruption of a scene with the insertion of another scene generally related to the original the interruption is usually quick and is ended by a return to the original scene should the movie have been done this way well ask michael dougherty that the next time you meet him to say that 2014 and kotm are bad movies because of the cutaways is childish     as for the supposed awful writing criticism i dont see that anywhere by definition good writing adheres to rules bad writing forgets them this is monumentally simple kotm doesnt have any glaring plot holes or inconsistencies its human characters are wellrounded if anything the humor may set some people off which is subjective objectively the only writing issues i can find are when that one guy ejects and lands in rodans mouth for laughs and the one i can fairly say i take issue with the use of the oxygen destroyer bomb speaking of which the oxygen destroyer is utilized for the first time in this series and it comes out of nowhere i think what could have fixed this issue would be to have william stenz stand before the us government and promise the use of a powerful weapon in case godzilla attacks that would have built up the oxygen destroyer bomb so it doesnt seem out of nowhere as for the supposed misanthropic theme of humans deserve to be extinct shoved down peoples throats no the theme of kotm is coexistence    so all in all godzilla king of the monsters 2019 is an awesome movie it may have been a box office disappointment thanks to avengers endgame and aladdin but it made great sales with the blu ray and dvd home release either way as mark hamill once put it a films quality is not determined by how much money it makes screw the controversial noise coming from the critics who know nothing when it comes to godzilla and kaijueiga then again the controversy surrounding this film is insignificant compared to the controversy surrounding marvel dc star wars ect and i would rather keep it that way this was a film made by a godzilla fan for godzilla fans and im glad to see new fans coming into the fold thanks to this new film    as always stay big gfans  chris kaizen gojifan1993
Aug 15 2020,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is directed by michael dougherty and is the sequel to the 2014 garreth edwards directed godzilla and centers around a family that was split apart through a tragedy following the events of the first film the family played by kyle chandler vera farmiga and milly bobby brown are now facing a world of monsters where they have the powers to awaken the biggest and deadliest of titans which brings out our hero godzilla to defend humanity one more time from titans that toho godzilla fans will absolutely love seeing on the big screen    now i need to preface this review because its important to be transparent to the diehard fans of properties such as godzilla i do not have a big knowledge if not anything but visual references of the toho godzilla films i recall watching the matthew broderick godzilla but as a kid you kind of just think everythings great that has monsters in them what also should be said is i really could not connect to the 2014 godzilla film i felt it was far too slow never really fulfilled on the expectations you got from the trailers however the visual effects and the overall scope and scale of the big lizard was absolutely mindblowing and though it happened far too late i of course also cheered at the final battle sequence frankly i know i am the outlier here and completely respect why people love this property  i hope you take that into consideration with my review    with godzilla king of the monsters i feel they attempt to overcorrect on the complaints general audiences had with the 2014 version the action in this film is much more apparent and spread out pretty evenly throughout the film you get a lot of pov destruction shots and i felt the pacing of kotm was much more tuned to keep the audience engaged the actors do fine in their roles although they dont really have the best story arcs to expand on mainly due to the effort to steer more towards the fights and explosions i really dont have anything bad to say on the performances the standout to me was ken wantanabe he gets a really great moment with godzilla that was the heart of the film for sure    the visual effects were absolutely astounding when it comes to creature design looking at the original toho series its incredible what theyre able to do this sequel gets to use more characters from the toho universe such as king ghidora mothra and perhaps a few surprises for the diehard fans the mothra reveal for me was just jawdropping effects wise they still kept with the epic scale of the fights where everything feels slowed down but you realize its because its two monsters the size of mountains fighting each other but where it is good there is bad and the fighting its bad    i had a really hard time following along with some of the fights where the cgi effects around the monsters fog rain etc sometimes completely obstructed the view of the fight i found myself getting really frustrated during the fights because they really never seemed to be choreographed or that there was any attention to how the fights would go down you get a big moment much like the 2014 film but the difference to me here is while the 2014 end fight built to the moment kotm rushes from fight to fight and when the emotional final battle arrives i just felt numb and didnt feel the impact as much as i wanted to in the ending    also i cannot wait to move past this new trope for villains to always be ecoterrorists weve seen it with thanos and so many other iterations of the same idea that humans are the problem and thats why i can do this crazy thing the plot revolves around this and another plot point similar to the how to train your dragon series however in this case they really didnt know how to incorporate it with godzilla and just didnt work for me    its a shame because they dont do much with the story and what they do with the action often felt sloppy and unrehearsed and while maybe some people enjoy that i still felt pretty let down leaving the theater dont know if im ready to be put back into the finger for the upcoming godzilla vs kong but for godzilla king of the monsters i would say if you are a diehard fan definitely check it out im sure youll love it
Aug 15 2020,negative,about as bland as one might expect
Aug 14 2020,positive,godzilla done right modern or not so modern myth and all  theres something compelling about the sequel here and the original in this godzilla redo for our time reading alot into the classic stories horribly bad yet good as they were these modern versions find the core of the old and run with it and run with it extremely well allegory metaphor or just a good go get the snacks and popcorn flick take your pick and enjoy
Aug 13 2020,positive,i love godzilla movies but talk about going over the top with special effects nonnonsensical story writing the amount of destruction it is a miracle anyone survived and then suddenly everything in a chaotic moment goes absolutely silent the environmentalist wrote this one no i havent forgotten the smog monster but eleven was on the show
Aug 12 2020,negative,this movie was a mess great special effects cant make up for a predictable and bland storyline 
Aug 10 2020,positive,it is not the best movie in history but it is extremely fun to watch great action scenes and something that i loved is how each of the monsters has a very marked personality
Aug 10 2020,positive,this was a awesome film it did all the criticisms some people had with godzilla 2014 but if you are a godzilla fan you will love this movie
Aug 10 2020,positive,at its essence it is everything that i want in a godzilla film awesome action fun fight scenes cool world building a phenomenal soundtrack and the best kind of fan service dont watch if youre interested in the humans thats not what a godzilla film is for real fans know that the true characters are monsters
Aug 7 2020,negative,this was bad bad bad kyle chandler should not be paid he basically single handed made this a bad movie this person can not act i went and looked at his past movies to make sure i dont waist my time again with one of his movies basically the movie did have some good actors that were asleep
Aug 2 2020,negative,it couldnt keep my interest it tried to be complex but fell flat
Aug 1 2020,positive,an interesting kaiju movie with spectacular action scenes and decent other scenes this movie is far from being the best kaiju movie but its pretty good
Jul 30 2020,positive,i never thought id see an american godzilla movie that was just as good as the japanese movies this movie is even better than almost all other godzilla movies with the monsters and how they move fight and look mothra is calming rodan is   fast and terrifying and king ghidorah truly acts as if it has three heads for once
Jul 30 2020,positive,an amazing spectacle  a couple questionable decisions made by the humans but in all i think it made sense in the end
Jul 23 2020,positive,sometimes someone just wants to see a good old fashioned kaiju movie this was an amazing film action wise the human parts had flaws be it under developed characters that i wasnt fully interested in or some lines that just made me groan but as i stated before this movie is for the monsters and they are the star the cgi is quiet possibly the best ive ever seen and considering the lacklustre cgi in recent releases this was a breath of fresh air considering their was a lot to take in it felt it dragged at spots however ultimately when it came to the big final battle it was worth the wait i highly recommend seeing this movie however if your not a godzilla fan you might want to sit the one out and perhaps rent it
Jul 19 2020,positive,it would be very difficult to name a movie that matches the gargantuan ambitions and scale of godzilla king of the monsters its a real shame that it cant really back up either of its outstanding qualities with a streamlined story theres a lot going on in this film sometimes way too much for its own good even though there is little room to breathe or ponder the action scenes featuring the titans are stellar and are presented with unmatched amounts of intensity and flair
Jul 16 2020,positive,almost make me cry several times other movies that have too many villain could never have done it this good the entire movie show you in the view of human so most feeling were not like yeah fight them yeah but instead give you oh lord were so small these titans are the true ruler of the world  it gives you not only the amazing monster fight but also a good drama that maybe could make your eyes wet a little bit
Jul 14 2020,positive,while its human characters are extremely one dimensional and its plot is a little undermined as a result godzilla king of the monsters still offers great cgi and amazing kaiju action
Jul 12 2020,positive,i knew it was gonna be stupid going in and it was stupid but i also exclaimed oh shit nooooo and cool multiple times
Jul 9 2020,positive,dont care about the critics of the critics just enjoy it
Jul 8 2020,negative,sound editing so bad i dont know what they are hearing when editing but they are not doing a good job with sound on a lot of movies particularly ones with all the bells and whistles ironically enough  its like they put the sound effects volume over the voices and then digitally modify actors voices and then they put music over it as well and it just comes out sounding like shit  most likely these movies are sound edited for the big screen and nothing else    as for the movie itself i couldnt get into it  i had this on my radar for a theater viewing but i just have no connection with godzillamega monster movies  it did get better as it progressed and they werent in the dark anymore but ultimately it was just transformers with different skins and i am not a fan of those movies well maybe its not that bad     so far of the three movies in this film universe godzilla2014 kong skull island and godzilla king of monsters skull island is by far my favorite  in the end this wasnt a waste of time but it kinda just passed the time    2 of 5
Jul 8 2020,negative,bigger and more isnt equal to better  so utterly illogical cliched and senseless that it fails to connect or be believable
Jul 7 2020,positive,this was amazing i love the characters and the story
Jul 6 2020,negative,human level extinction is the only way to right the problems we have inflicted upon the earth wrapped up in flashy slick effects big epic monster fights and acting and lines that didnt seem to convey much dedication on the part of the writers actors or anyone else big monsters fight to right what humans have done to the earth humans bad and a reeeaaally cheesy godzilla song during the credits sheeple and children should love it
Jul 6 2020,positive,this godzilla movie brings back the classics
Jul 5 2020,negative,i do care plot in an action movie you can predict every 10 minutes in the future and the ending seems like nobody care about plot anymore in an action movie you can compare it to fast of the furious if you like fancy things to watch at it go ahead the moment you wanne make sense of it you lose intrest
Jul 5 2020,positive,now this movie is a set up for kong vs godzilla this one has amazing action sequences and i really do enjoy millie bobby browns performance in this
Jul 5 2020,positive,i love this movie i am very entertained every time i see it its one of my favorite monsterverse movies the battles are epic and i love that they have shown more titans and expanded their mythology i found it very interesting that they made gidhora an invader and a false king i wish i had seen more of the titans than humans but i liked it anyway i adore the titans and i hope that in the next films they show more of their mythology and origin the special effects are awesome i loved the powers and abilities that titans possess and how they vary according to the environment in which they live i definitely recommend it
Jun 29 2020,neutral,a really bad story and cringey characters visual effects cant substitute a good story
Jun 28 2020,negative,the movie is in some point fun when the monsters fight it is visually incredible but most of the movie are problems between humans and it is very boring the only think i liked was millie bobby brown
Jun 24 2020,positive,awesome monster fights what more can a true fan ask forcannot wait for the grand finale godzilla vs kong in 2021
Jun 23 2020,negative,godawful king of the monstrosity    the cast deserves better than this because its the dynamic between kyle chandler ken watanabe and ziyi zhang is what made the scenes they share more tolerable despite some atrocious dialogue and unbearably cringeworthy oneliners and because millie bobby brown could have singlehandedly made the formulaic dramatic arc work if it wasnt for the fact the film went for the action from the getgo and for almost the entire first 40 minutes which is basically consists of a set of crammed together segments of nonstop action and explosions which are all devoid of the slightest tension    after showing many monsters on screen for a reason or no reason to give those who hated godzilla what they wanted the plot began to unravel but the rest of the movie isnt actually any better as the more the story proceeds the clearer it appears how superficial and uninspired it is i liked both gareth edwardss godzilla and jordan vogtrobertss kong skull island so its not like i cant stand a mindless creature feature but this is just extremely poorly made even the cgi that most people were praising i found quite disappointing king ghidorah in particular looks so cartoonish i mean disneys herculess hydra looks more realistic    310
Jun 22 2020,positive,where as its not as suspenseful as what came before this movie was awesome definitely a kaiju film made by fans for the fans if your a critic who has to nitpick every little thing like logic or scientific accuracy youre of course going to hate it but if you just want to have a good time watching a lot of monsters kicking each others asses you are in for some fun
Jun 20 2020,positive,great movie i huge fan of the godzilla franchise they got this one right
Jun 19 2020,negative,in 2010 director gareth edwards attracted hollywoods attention with his impressive lowbudget first feature film monsters where the protagonists travel through a landscape devastated by unseen giant monsters legendary saw him as the perfect choice to take the reigns of the new american adventure of tohos favorite son edwards 2014 reboot of the series for warnerlegendary was a mixed bag made with the best of intentions and with a cast that included ken watanabe juliette binoche and a criminally underused bryan cranston it liberally transferred the nuclear symbolism from godzilla to his foes the mutos thus keeping the metaphor intact and in the same breath helping to turn godzilla from bad guy to helpful antihero a move reminiscent of the big gs own heroic role in many of tohos features the films main strengths were its striking visuals and its sobering references to the recent japanese tragedies of the 2011 tsunami and the ensuing fukushima disaster    however its focus on a soporific family drama and an annoying tendency to cut away from the monster action to better build up to a spectacular finale fight made a promising film ultimately quite irritating at times nonetheless the film was a resounding success and warranted the gamble to start the socalled monsterverse project at legendary a new reboot of king kong followed in 2017 with kong skull island by jordan vogtroberts  and now godzilla king of the monsters by trick or treat and krampus director michael dougherty    there certainly was a certain amount of wishful expectations regarding the sequel to edwards film the initial trailer certainly made it look like it was going to be gorgeous and spectacular and it is in many ways the bigbudget mayhem is one of the main attraction of the film and it doesnt disappoint on that front however the film feels a bit like guillermo del toros pacific rim the action often occurs in rainstorms or at night and is often filmed in close ups the plot is mainly centered around a paramilitary group dealing with the creatures and very few scenes gives the point of views of normal citizens caught in the midst of that destruction which is essential to establish the scope of the menace and further its emotional impact    instead to try to create a sense of identification with the viewer the film chooses to focus on how the events affects a family broken up by the events of the 2014 films the three actors all very capable do the best they can with an absurdly lame subplot and eye rolling dialogues but the overall effect is nearly as mindnumbing as the equally lame family subplot in the previous entry in the series     godzilla king of the monsters cant be blamed for lack of trying to please though it contains the required amount of overthetop show stopping moments that has become the staple of summer blockbusters it also tries very hard to pander to fans of the original toho series by making multiple references either in the script with musical nods to akira ifukubes original scores or little easter eggs dont blink but you may catch a demonstrator carrying a sign that states destroy all monsters plot points are actually ripped from earlier films in the series like godzilla vs destroyah takao okawara 1995 and godzilla vs mechagodzilla 2 takao okawara 1993 and of course the original meetup of rodan mothra ghidorah and godzilla ghidorah the threeheaded monster ishiro honda 1964 a characters sacrifice mirrors dr serizawas own in the original godzilla but with a twist that completely negates any attempt at the antinuclear metaphor that was still present albeit clumsily exploited in the previous entry    the idea of course is to ape no pun intended the marvel formula with inter locking story lines in what is called the monsterverse the 2014 godzilla and the very entertaining kong skull island introduced their own version of marvels shield monarch a group whose mission is dodgy at best serving as the glue between the films of the series it also evokes tohos gforce whose mission statement felt a bit more sane destroying godzilla as it stands im still struggling to grasp the logic behind monarchs actions and i have a feeling it wont get more logical with next years follow up godzilla vs king kong at the very least their goals make more sense than the bad guys in the film a cockamamie plot that would make thanos go now hold on guys there is something also somewhat unsettling in seeing godzilla apparently working handinhand with humans something that was only really exploited before in both american cartoon series from 1978 and 1998 godzilla should be seen as a force of nature and it is presumptuous and arrogant to think it can be harnessed by man    now as a longtime fan of monster movies i am tickled green to see godzilla being given the megabudget treatment some of the visuals in the film is terrific eye candy particularly the scenes involving mothra some of which gave me actual goosebumps assisted greatly by bear mccrearys superb interpretation of yuji kosekis theme from the 1961 film the queen of monsters veritably steals the film whenever she is onscreen    the movie sadly decided to scrap almost completely the gravitas of edwards version a bit like the follow ups to the 1954 original quickly abandoned its grim metaphorical tone for a more family friendly feel    for all its fire and fury drowned in gobs of impressive special effects i am left thinking that the ultimate interpretations of kaiju films remain the gamera trilogy by shusuke kaneko which i highly recommend for its clever use of practical effects superb mastery of the money shots and scripts that makes some of the best use of verisimilitude this side of superman the movie    all i can hope is that next years godzilla vs kong feels closer in tone to kong skull island than this gorgeous mess of a film
Jun 18 2020,positive,amazing special effects a true spectacle for godzilla fans was an experience watching this in front of the big screen
Jun 18 2020,positive,i love godzilla godzilla king of the monsters is gotta be my fave godzilla movie and fave movie   my friends think my obsession with godzilla is annoying welp i am here to review this movie so back to the review i found the opening scene in godzilla king of the monsters funny the kaiju were done so perfectly the effects just stunned me i love this movie
Jun 16 2020,positive,absolutely must see characters were rich and meaningful the monsters actually had a certain level of depth rarely seen in a monster movie  i worry how will the monsterverse top this plot and scripts were definitely top notch and kudos to whomever directed this people may have been underwhelmed because this came out during the same time as avengers endgame i guess this is called scale fatigue i guess this is the fault of jj abrams blowing up the world several times in epic fashion movie after movie
Jun 16 2020,negative,a letdown from the first one the cgi was horrible the fights were surprisingly boring and they fucked up mothras design king ghidorah had generic jurassic park trex chicken legs and not the bulky ones he had before he had this weird piss coloration to him his wings look like generic dragon wings and not the bizzare  ones from before godzilla looks horrible the cgi looks way worse than from the first one people say this is for the fans because it has shitty humans at least the old movies had a certain charm thats nonexistent in this series the older ones are shot on film had beautiful creature designs cool silly action different tone and the action takes place in the daytime so i have no idea how this modern film is supposed to be like the originals they dont even have practical effects the first godzilla movie had better cgi better action and cooler sound effects i dont know i still like first one better it just has this atmosphere that i enjoy moreso than this generic one i dont know the attitude from this film is the wrong diretion for this series and a big mistake in my opinion
Jun 15 2020,negative,doubling down on everything that made the original so forgettable the new film has bland undeveloped characters terrible editing and a tendency to not let you see the monster on monster action
Jun 14 2020,positive,a must watch for fans of the godzilla franchise this entry to the monsterverse is all about monster on monster action and it delivered truly a must watch
Jun 12 2020,positive,try to family but i dont want that i want monster fight only please give me more
Jun 10 2020,positive,one of the best godzilla movie ive seen
Jun 8 2020,positive,i freaking love this movie why did it get a bad rotten tomatoes score i think its better than the 2014 movie this movie had spectacular cgi really awesome movie
Jun 7 2020,positive,this movie is spectacular it is a thrill to see godzilla on the screen again this movie delivers amazing special effects story characters and so much more
Jun 6 2020,positive,loved this movie better than 2014 hands down
Jun 2 2020,positive,a fun movie if youre into cgi monsters going at it in the forefront with minimal story and character development godzilla king of the monsters is just the type of mindless entertainment i needed    5 years after the events of 2014s godzilla the monarch organization has identified numerous monsters throughout the world when a group of people never identified for the record steal a device used to communicate with the monsters and kidnaps the scientist who built it and her daughter chaos ensues for one i appreciated the batman v supermaninspired opening scene taking us back to the events of the first film to kick off this one while introducing the family at the center of the story vera farmiga kyle chandler and millie bobby brown the entire film is spent with chandlers character trying to stop his exwife from using the device to unleash the monsters in a bid to save the world  and rescue his daughter and thats pretty much the extent of the story oh and godzilla recharges himself in the hollow earth but it takes a while so they decide to nuke him to get him powered up enough to take on king ghidorah and followers the whole idea of godzilla needing help in this way sort of takes away from his aura of being so powerful    farmiga is great in her role even if it is a rather confusing backstory for her character chandler is simply fine while millie bobby brown is drastically underutilized the crux of the film is a dark and brooding color palette within which the cgi can be hidden and the countless monsters can try and take one another out godzilla is of course awesome and the others look great too but that is basically all you get from this film    on a side note i find it odd that there are no civilians shown on the ground or really anywhere especially when the monsters are destroying boston where did everyone go skull island which gets namedropped a few times throughout setting up the upcoming battle film with kong a hidden bunker arbys ill report back when i figure that out
Jun 1 2020,positive,its absolutely perfect a godzilla movie must be    beautiful for the eyes and there are some of the most beautiful scenes of the movie history the one with mothra under the waterfall is a monet painting   must not hat to complicated dialogs but not even stupid and its perfect    must give a sense of over and i cant believe it should do it better than this    perfect audio perfect cools good direction maybe the previous one had some more interesting camera movements but i didnt fell this lack    actors are good enough the story its good for this kind of film   the end scene its outstanding   those who thought that the film was not beautiful because of the toosimple dialogues perhaps he entered the wrong door to the cinema
May 31 2020,positive,a beautiful homage to an icon like godzilla a must see for zilla fans i gotta say legendary has really made something amazing with its american reboot of this classic toho series from 2014s installment to king of the monsters they did some amazing fan service and damage control after the less loved by toho 1998 version and personally i cant wait to see what they have planed for godzilla vs king kong i guarantee the visuals will look better vs kong in the original kong vs zilla    but im getting ahead of myself lets get back on topic of king of the monsters   its a great film its got its pros and cons for example there are some cons with human interaction there are some amazing performances i feel like ken wannabe blew it out of the park with his performance theres also the fatherdaughter played by mille and members of monarch like dr chendr rick and probably others who did a great job yet theres flawed characters like the mother played by vera that no spoilers but have issues non of which i feel are veras issue    but lets get to the biggest pros the monster are amazing there characters feel very accurate in personalitys and feel faithful to toho and its legacy and i expected nothing less from legendary and a godzilla fanboy like michael dohghtry  they handled the monsters beautifully not only visually but story wise they may not speak but you cant forget even the monsters have there story and heart in a godzilla film and i think they did an amazing job showing you the heart of these monters like godzilla and mothra and keep that aspect of toho alive in this american reboot not to mention the renditions of some of those beautiful classic toho soundtracks the score for mothra had me in tears and moved by its beauty  yes its not as perfect as 2014s zilla but it still holds the same beauty and heart that one did and i highly recommend watching this imperfect masterpiece its a must see for any zilla fan
May 29 2020,positive,this movie is so pretty uwu we stan
May 26 2020,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a tribute to diehard godzilla fans while the plot isnt great when it comes to the humans the story of godzilla verses ghidorah is basically perfect a must see for godzilla fans
May 26 2020,positive,as a fan of the recently released and generally godzilla i found this one a bit touch to watch as expected the fighting was the best part but the human plotlines were rehashed and honestly too present
May 20 2020,negative,a departure in tone from the first one   sadly even with more battles the mayor part of this movie is with humans whom fail to create any type of empathy and only serve as in your face exposition
May 18 2020,positive,if you come in and expect a literal deep movie then youll be disappointed but if you come in and expect a kaiju actionpacked godzilla movie then youll be very pleased
May 10 2020,positive,i think this has the best monster movie action but there were some parts in which i was really bored i dont expect deep human stories but still i think kong skull island is better
May 9 2020,positive,totally surprised the critics didnt rate this highly great story line feel for the characters perfect suspense a lack of corny and easy winnings for the monsters and awesome soundseffects i cant stand too many useless special effects and this movie used them perfectly plus they use godzillas original roar i was like a kid all over again
May 6 2020,positive,this movie was directed by a godzilla fan for godzilla fans it was exciting seeing all the easter eggs the creators put in the film mostly nods to previous godzilla films dont worry i am not including any spoilers not ever seeing these titans as anything but suitimation a man in a monster suit it was amazing the cgi was awesome and the movements and sound of all the creatures were unique godzilla had his original roar at times which made me jump out of my seat with excitement each creature had its own personality the story was enjoyable the characters were well thought out the movie did pull on your emotional strings a little bit as a godzilla fan i could predict some things based on how many of the other movies played out the movie tried to keep the same pattern as the past movies as a huge fan of the franchise that meant a lot to me the fights were 10 times better than the 2014 movie we are showered in titan fights everything we as fans asked for we got them i hope to see michael dougherty come back to direct another godzilla movie soon   my only complaint is that this movie lose its value for non godzilla fans it is just another monster movie for the regular movie goer   this is a definitely a must see movie
May 3 2020,positive,amazing action the most action of any godzilla movie ever
May 3 2020,positive,like most movies of the monsterverse godzilla delivers awesome cgi but lacks the epic in depth storytelling of a comic movie due to a vast amount of characters and limited runtime cast and monster development are at an all time low im not complaining it has the semblance of a generationz destruction movie and considering this was my favorite genre before getting spoiled with todays theatrical standards my opinion cant be too harsh like the critics
May 2 2020,negative,it is really tough to describe just how crappy and cliché this mess of a film actually is i would ask for my 2 hours back if i didnt honestly expect as much its completely impossible to find any positive aspects
May 1 2020,positive,to be honest i was expecting godzilla fighting all the monsters one by one like the good old japanese movie i was definitely a bit disappointed by the fact that the fight scene is so limited the writing is not the best well not good as reflected in the poor tomato score overall ok movie meh
Apr 27 2020,positive,if you want developed logical characters or a set of hard and fast rules for this film to abide by look elsewhere this is basically pacific rim but monsters v monsters instead of monsters v mechs you like monsters there are like 20 of them now and theyre going to battle it out this sunday night in madison square garden the action is a blast and the visuals are great just dont going looking for a lot of depth but for a sweet saturday night popcorn movie its top notch 355
Apr 27 2020,positive,i went back to this film a few times  first time i watched it i would have just given this 3 stars as it did just pass the time though i have watched it twice since and its grown on me i noticed all these little easter eggs and started to really enjoy it  the action scenes are fantastic and sets up well for godzilla vs king kong  i would say if you have already watched this once and stumbled on to this review then please give it another go because it deserves more credit  if you are thinking of watching it for the 1st time on the back of this review remember to go in with an open mind it is spectacularly done
Apr 26 2020,negative,this plot of this movie was so impossibly complicated i did not feel any connection to any of the characters in fact i felt more emotionally attached to godzilla the action although exciting was dragged down because of the stubborn plot and characters if you want colossal creatures and a good plot watch the original jurassic park
Apr 25 2020,positive,when i watched godzilla 2 i already knew that the critic would not like the film very much but she is right the relationship and the development of the characters is terrible but when you watch the movie just to see huge monsters fighting and destruction and action for all sides you realize that the film is great and that it is impossible for any fan of the franchise to like this film that is certainly a dish  full for who loves the franchise
Apr 23 2020,neutral,not as good as the first godzilla or skull island constantly interuptig monster action to show us what the human cast is doing even if we dont care about them the intresting characters left from the first film are killed this film makes the same mistakes as the first film but does it worse good story idea badly executed also they mess up the scale of the monsters not done as well as the first film still not the worst godzilla film and its not boring unlike 1984 return of godzilla
Apr 23 2020,negative,cool monster fights but what a ridiculous plot no sane person chooses the moral choices some of the characters choose in this completely ridiculous movie for a movie with giant lizards fighting each other the human element is the weakest and most absurd part of this movie irrational choices crazy motivations that normal people would have is it entertaining  only when you see the monsters but i would not recommend this movie its frustratingly stupid 
Apr 22 2020,negative,movie starts off with a mom lecturing her daughter about expecting too much from her irresponsible father  then she takes her daughter into a radioactive lab to witness the birth of a gigantic monster that immediately escapes destroying the lab in the process  from there it starts getting really stupid 
Apr 20 2020,positive,it is stupid that in common era media forces something simplistic like trash or perfect  affective movie about big monster fighting eachother and small stupid people fighting eachother stupid peaple are sometimes too stupid but action do not control the plot cinematic form is fixed movie is entertaining it is easy 65 movie stretching to 75 for tomatometer and 60 for me i will give it 80 because fpretentious and i can see some kind of love letter to ziyi zhang in the mothratransformationscene with was good
Apr 20 2020,neutral,very mediocre  not sure why i was expecting more
Apr 18 2020,negative,extremely boring i feel sory for all the actors that we know are good from watching them in other movies hopefully they were payed well one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Apr 18 2020,positive,come on guys as soon as there was a good monster scene the camera cuts away way too fast there werent enough good largescale impressive scenes of these monsters i guess the production crew just played it lazy
Apr 17 2020,positive,this movie wasnt as bad as i thought it would be the fight scenes are impressive and visually it is a beautiful looking movie the main problem i had with this movie is the humans my god are they annoying and theres so many of them they do things that dont make any sense and for a monster movie i do not want to see humans take the screen time away from the title character so they really make this movie frustrating to watch but the fights were cool and the visuals were great the humans however were not
Apr 15 2020,positive,very good godzilla movie  a lot of monsters fighting and it really shows just the absolute unbridled destructive power of godzilla as well as ghidorahmonster zero    the human part while definitely smaller than usual isnt at all bad and the acting for the most part is pretty darn solid watanabe dance and brown specifically i enjoyed    dont get me wrong either some of the more humancentric godzilla movies are amongst my favorites but theres really nothing wrong with this one  on a 10 star scale id go 8510 or 87510 but here we got a 5 star scale so im going with 455
Apr 13 2020,positive,an epic installment in the monsterverse cinematic universe and does a lot of great worldbuilding
Apr 13 2020,positive,best godzilla everim a huge fan since the 80s and this is what fans wanted  its more monster action and it balances the human interaction well  not the boring drag out of verbal jabbering among humans before something interesting took place the focus is monsters 1st and humans 2nd    they should all be like this
Apr 13 2020,negative,i love godzilla i didnt like this movie couldnt see anything the usual hollywood nonsense of total destruction fast edits and lazy characterisation i hope the next is better
Apr 13 2020,negative,the movie was a disappointing sequel to the classic previously made a poor storyline and plot try to hold together the vast array of illfitting monsters
Apr 9 2020,positive,the action is better than the first but the characters are less interesting and the monsters dont have the fear factor they did before
Apr 7 2020,positive,if its the storyline that makes you disgust to appreciate and the fact that the performances are very generic the special effects of the monsters are not enough to bring an excellent experience because everything is in the dark making us lose our investment with the film
Apr 7 2020,positive,spectacular kaiju film i love the monster moments in the film especially the fight scenes where the monsters clash the human subplot works well with this story too great movie
Apr 6 2020,positive,fun monster movie with a shit ton of action scenes imo it could be better if it had more practical effects but i think most people would prefer the cg a much better movie than the previous american adaptation
Apr 1 2020,positive,love the movie  my sons loves the ending  watches it over and over again
Mar 27 2020,negative,its dumb boring and stupid
Mar 27 2020,positive,godzilla king of monsters is a very mediocre film and the closest thing i can compare it to is rampage they are both decent action films with big name stars in it based on something else with big cgi monsters fighting each other in a very b grade plot that you will forget 10 minutes after you watch it but overall not a horrible film just not the best but okay i will give it a 355 
Mar 25 2020,positive,i watched this movie last night and it was very average fare as a child i watched all the toho movies for godzilla rodan mothra et al this was a bit of a cgi extravaganza with some bizarre mythology thrown in for good measure entertaining but nothing to rave about
Mar 24 2020,positive,wow critics are so wrong about this movie they do a great job with the creature entrances and fights are very well thought out and with the humans they are only there to explain the creatures and they know this i feel the humans tried as quickly as they could to get you to the next fight and were funny and light hearted about it for the most part now i would say maybe one or two of the jokes didnt land but i feel thats not bad the humans were ok in this and i feel a few of them had more depth then any of the characters in kong skull island besides john c reillys character now this film does have kind of way to many humans but ya it all worked for me 
Mar 24 2020,positive,its ok and i can appreciate what godzilla fans like about it this series is about as good as it can be and i wouldnt want to see them anywhere nearer the originals
Mar 24 2020,positive, just finished watching this in segments past two days i saw it before but this time it was super awesome unbelievable all my childhood monsters from godzilla movies were in it and cgi they looked awesome good story incredible special effects loved it 32320 worthy rewatch 
Mar 23 2020,positive,this is the best movies
Mar 22 2020,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters is the sequel from 2014 the story follows the origin of the alpha monsters and supposedly it is all the humans fault  the plot was confusing the cgi effects were pretty good the movie had an all star cast from kyle chandler millie bobby brown charles dance david strathairn and many others  i liked the fight between the monsters but it was just confusing  i fell out of interest half way thru the movie  it was good to watch once but nothing to wrote home about
Mar 22 2020,positive,this addresses the criticisms of garlands 2014 outing with the grace of a bull in a china shop placing the kaiju action in the forefront and curtailing the story to the back where it belongs a vast improvement in every facet over its predecessor but its not saying much there is a lot of potential missed here regardless of the massive strides this sequel makes
Mar 21 2020,positive,can have some borings moments but the action scenes can fix it
Mar 18 2020,positive,saw it in cinemas and many times already in blu ray never gets tiring seeing the epic fights characters are way better soundtrack is one of the bests i haver ever heard truly made for fans cinematography is incredible and a true masterpiece of the genre but mostly for fans of it
Mar 17 2020,positive,good movie and very entertaining
Mar 13 2020,negative,what is the meaning of this painful mess
Mar 12 2020,neutral,is this a great movie no is this a great godzilla movie oh ya special effects galore but the story and directing are lackluster i kept getting lost the continuity is awful i could right an essay on all the plot holes and other nonsense but dont worry i wont godzilla fans should be pleased its fun just dont ask too many questions and youll be fine
Mar 11 2020,negative,blows big time  have a bucket handy
Mar 11 2020,negative,king of the shtty human characters the creatures werent that good either  i regret seeing this dumb mess of a movie at the cinema i wanted my money back
Mar 9 2020,neutral,screw those cheesy dialogue lines
Mar 9 2020,positive,a mustwatch for lovers of gigantic monsters
Mar 8 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this film the number one complaint i see is that this movie is it does not have a good human characters i would totally disagree with that i really like how the characters were wont complain i do have is maybe to mention stalgia but i think overall its a great movie awesome
Mar 7 2020,positive,you people need to understand that good movies are good and bad movies are bad this one is good and supposed to be a godzilla movie we are supposed to action in this movie and gives the gfans what they want
Mar 7 2020,negative,this is one incredibly terrible and boring flick
Mar 5 2020,positive,well its a big budget action movie about godzilla and thats pretty much all there is to it theres no story but theres monsters fighting theres no logic but theres spectacular visual effects of monsters fighting and theres no time to get bored in its overly long runtime as the monsters continue fighting so if watching a bunch of monsters fight and destroy the world on epic proportions is your thing godzilla king of the monsters is sure to be worth your time
Mar 4 2020,negative,so boring i fell asleep
Mar 3 2020,negative,even being off my rocker while watching this movie proved that terrible movies are still terrible
Mar 1 2020,positive,this movie is weird because i understand where the critics are coming from when it comes to the storytelling but my feelings for this movie are just about the same as my feelings for transformers dark of the moon it may be weak in the story department but its an entertaining and badass movie anyway the fights in this movie when they are on screen are jawdropping to watch and all the acting notably millie bobby brown and ken watanabe is great
Feb 29 2020,positive,great cgi good movie
Feb 29 2020,negative,total turd of a film
Feb 28 2020,neutral,this movies had visuals but always focused with the more human aspects and seemed long to me and the characters were really flat 
Feb 28 2020,negative,who the f wrote this garbage
Feb 26 2020,positive,better than expected action packed classic alpha vs alpha battle throughout the movie
Feb 26 2020,positive,too many humans in my monster movie the fights were really bad ass but i wish they wouldnt have cut away so much during the fights for human story line
Feb 25 2020,negative,great to see the monsters i respect some of the sacrifices and the premise isnt horrible but the story plods along i didnt care about the characters the action is meh and the ridiculous level is constantly too high
Feb 24 2020,positive,its an awesome giant monster movie
Feb 23 2020,negative,a wacky and thin plot device moves the movies forward 90 of the action takes place in the rain or in the thick smoke and fog   the young girl is just an annoying and bratty character    the jokes are not very funny and the 3d can be bad at times but good at times   stuff gets really wacky when they tell you that the titans are coming back to kill the humans because we are a virus lol what a joke
Feb 22 2020,positive,recycled ip from japan the film has a good start but got really really bored in the middle
Feb 21 2020,neutral,my favorite part is when he makes his way to the center of town he picked up a bus and threw it back down the cinematography on the scene where he pulls the spitting high tension wires down was great too those helpless people on that subway train def worth checking out
Feb 19 2020,positive,the giant monsters to the quicklypaced action was missing from its predecessors despite the characters lacking the faith needed to care about them this is the king of a monster godzilla as his true self
Feb 19 2020,positive,good godzilla fun turn your brain off and enjoy
Feb 18 2020,positive,they are definitely on the right track some minor improvements and they will perfect the formula this is the first time i walked out of a movie feeling exhausted because of all the action
Feb 18 2020,positive,i bought this movie i cant get enough 
Feb 18 2020,negative,5 minutes in and i find myself repeating the phrase what a steaming pile shight but then tywin lannister mobs in and executes everyone which gave me a little hope but nope always trust your instincts this film was a steaming pile of shight films would be better if instead writing shighty scripts packed full of exposition and mind control that catered to their out of touch woke and jooish friends and handlers 
Feb 17 2020,positive,pretty epic monster action movie for the true kaiju fans with the amazing kaiju action and fan service it has a generic story and bad jokes   a review from a g fan
Feb 17 2020,positive,i like this movie i think it get more flack than it deserves
Feb 16 2020,positive,it was an action movie things blew up and died woo hoo
Feb 16 2020,positive,definitely one of the best experiences in cinema of my entire life rodan mothra and ghidorah are perfect anxious to see mechagodzilla receive the same treatment in the continuation  though this movie does have its flaws
Feb 15 2020,negative,easily one of the dumbest movies i ever seen
Feb 14 2020,negative,fun to see the classic monsters again but suffers from a horrible plot and the main characters are awful
Feb 13 2020,positive, godzilla king of the monsters is one of the best godzilla movies are there so far we all loved this movie so much so please all of you give this movie a good rating
Feb 13 2020,negative,good cast couldnt overcome terrible story and horrible dialog  bailed on it prior to the end it was so bad  ive only done that a few times in my life  ill never be able to get back the 2 hours and now i think theyve ruined godzilla for ever
Feb 11 2020,positive,still best breathtaking movies from 2019 especially rodan scene why rating its not good
Feb 10 2020,negative,not a masterpiece but not the worst godzilla movie ever made godzilla 98 still deserves that title
Feb 9 2020,negative,it feels as if this movie was written by someone who never has spoken to another human before like they instead have only learned about other people through movies and tv nothing seemed believable because nothing done by any human in this movie seemed natural the monsters were cool and fun but that was the only substance this movie had to offer
Feb 9 2020,negative,fights were a b  story was a f   acting was a z
Feb 8 2020,positive,some terrible dialogue and some major plot holes but it delivers on the monster fights for that alone its going to be enjoyable to fans that watched and enjoyed the older english dubbed godzilla movies this movie helps reenforce and build the monsterverse theyre trying to create even though the science explanations and reasonings given are pretty terribly written  godzilla king of the monsters and kong skull island has me very interested in the 2020 godzilla vs kong movie
Feb 8 2020,positive,i think the movie was great because i love godzilla
Feb 8 2020,positive,its a movie about giant monsters fighting each other and that part of it is awesome if youre going into this expecting more than that dont bother however if you want to see some giant monsters fight each other this is the best film to do it yet
Feb 8 2020,positive,no movie better in 2019its my favorite kotm only godzilla movie that make godzilla as a monster king
Feb 8 2020,neutral,get all your catastrophe movie clichés the usual bad cgis where relative sizes change the whole time put in all in the blender and voilà heres your film
Feb 7 2020,positive,just to be clear i never actually saw any of the godzilla movies i chose to watch with my dad i sat down watched and i enjoyed it not only are the effects astounding but the character and story while slow at times does give detail and depth to it the fight sequence to repeat are a marvel to the eye especially the titular godzilla and ghidorah they especially look intimidating especially their powers mothra especially looks and sounds beautiful and the other beasts my golly i have never heard of them but i want to know what they are i especially like millie bobby brown and vera farmiga in this despite seeing them in very few productions for those who are familiar and newcomers this is definitely fitting well for me but you decide
Feb 7 2020,positive,story flops visuals push you through
Feb 6 2020,negative,extremely corny  like even for a end of the world monster movie 
Feb 5 2020,positive,not as good as it looks in the trailer but mils was great and so was the ending of this
Feb 5 2020,neutral,the final credits song is a banger
Feb 4 2020,positive,i thought it was too long and overly done too much going on and kind of hard to believe
Feb 3 2020,negative,i love gojira i thought this particular movie was so bad that i am shocked it has more than 0 on rotten tomatoes i tried to follow the movie but how did any human survive any of the stuff that happened how did any of this movie make any sense or provide and entertainment value i wanted to like it i tried
Feb 3 2020,positive,best kaiju movie with pacific rim
Feb 1 2020,negative,the monster fighting sequences were very good although it seems like all of them were done with very little light guess they helps make up for bad cgi the story line didnt make any sense whatsoever it was entertaining if you just watch it for the action i would have totally believed it had you told me michael bay had directed this
Feb 1 2020,negative,awful writing and a thin story mixed with a lot of noise and cool cgi effects do not a good movie make  instantly forgettable
Jan 31 2020,negative,another video game movie yawn
Jan 28 2020,positive,after i watched this movie i just keep watching everything related to godzilla im begin a fan of it now
Jan 25 2020,positive,solid 7510 great monster fight scenes
Jan 25 2020,positive,you get exactly what youd expect and more with this movie
Jan 24 2020,negative,this godzilla is so bad it makes the 1998 matthew broderick godzilla look like the 1954 godzilla
Jan 24 2020,negative,horrible another hollywood woke film throwing weak male characters and powerful woman at us story line was no word for what it was this movie was just a hot mess
Jan 24 2020,neutral,what a stupid movie the visual effects and audio are great the monsters and fights are entertaining but its really hard to check your brain out for a whole movie and enjoy it the plot acting and dialogue are terrible and youll spend most of the movie cringing and face palming yourself a b monster movie with a aaa budget what a waste
Jan 23 2020,negative,when will they ever learn when will the production ever understand that we dont care about the humans on a monster movie this movie was a promise of a monsterfilled action movie and the beginning of a monsterverse but this movie is far from what they promised im just giving it a twostar because of the cgi we dont need more screen time for sjw characters just give us the damn monster fights
Jan 22 2020,positive,good not great monster movie too much going on to understand what the plot was and couldnt get into any of the characters 
Jan 22 2020,positive,brilliant movie if you are a godzilla fan reviewers say too little humans and too much monsters i say thats what makes a good godzilla movie
Jan 22 2020,negative,after a couple of really entertaining pulpy horror films director michael dougherty trick r treat krampus takes his shot at westernizing godzilla  of all three of hollywoods attempts this is the most disappointing  ridiculous levels of nonstop mindnumbing destruction coupled with underwritten characters and dumb blunt dialogue make me question if this isnt actually roland emmerichs second attempt in disguise
Jan 22 2020,negative,dry the visual effects were interesting though i think ill give up on the whole godzilla franchise it just doesnt work for me
Jan 21 2020,positive,emma and mark russell both work for monarch the organisation which may or may not have sinister intentions regarding monitoring the titans that have made themselves known in our world  it has been 5 years since the events of the first movie in which emma and mark lost their son and so have since become estranged  when emma and their daughter are kidnapped by a group of eco terrorists who have plans to release all titans to reign havoc on earth mark must pursue them in the hope of rescuing his family and preventing destruction on a massive scale   i really enjoyed this follow up to godzilla  the first movie failed to have any characters i could connect with but i found the characters in this story a lot more engaging  obviously the main attraction is seeing these titanic monsters scrap it out on screen and that is done very well with spectacular special effects  there was a decent story here that helped to build the world in which these monsters exist and would certainly be open for exploration in further films   the ending of the film leads well into the upcoming kong vs godzilla movie plus hang around after the credits because the baddies are still up to no good once the credits roll
Jan 21 2020,positive,the positives override any of the negatives in this film it has a lot of touching scenes amazing special effects and some badass titan fights
Jan 20 2020,positive,it gets better    i almost stopped watching an hour in as it was all about the individual humans despite my being there to watch monsters fight each other but the action ramps up in the second half and it turns out that these humans have interesting character development which is 100 what i dont look for in disaster flicks but they won me over worth a watch if you wait til hour two to turn it on the first half was pretty fucking terrible    i could also do without the japanese lady so smug and wise    actually youre wrong its not random    actually no fool in ancient japan monsters werent bad they were full of goodness fool    actually look at me look at me look at me you wrong people im ancient japanese lady so wise so smart so smug    vera farmiga sucked too and i love her and she acted fine i guess just some flaws in writing i guess did you know that vera farmiga and taissa farmiga american horror story arent niece and aunt or mother and daughtertheyre sisters wheres your japanese myth for that annoying smug person
Jan 20 2020,positive,its a godzilla film these movies arent known for giving a grandiose plot with nuanced character arcs and beautifully written dialogue theyre about giant monsters who kick each others asses and destroy everything around them in the process this one does it the best by far and i literally fistpumped several times when a badass moment happened
Jan 20 2020,neutral,meh just ok the plot was predictable and ken wantanabe the most likeable character dies
Jan 19 2020,negative,worse movie ever is this another chinese enterprise tossing money at actors with good reputation and creating this awful movies
Jan 19 2020,positive,hell yeah watching godzilla battle other big monsters is  awesome thrilling and exiting  the cgi is outstanding and great  810
Jan 19 2020,negative,one of the worst movies i have seen the plot does not exist and godzilla is missing for most of movie
Jan 19 2020,negative,what a mess  you can barely follow the plot if there is one  then when you finally figure out what is going on the punchline is so stupid this ridiculous environmental message that you barely care anymore  i think the dialog was typed by a room full of monkeys who randomly got some words right  my boyfriend said hed rather have his face melted off by hot pockets this watch this movie again    i love a good brainless action movie where stuff blows up and all and can enjoy all kinds of ridiculousness in the name of entertainment for example pacific rim but this was just bad  im sure you can find better things to do with 90 minutes like clean your closet  favorite quote  that is way old  random observation  we got really excited when we saw ice cube thinking he could save this then discovered it was the actor that played ice cube in straight outta compton  we nicknamed him dry ice cube
Jan 18 2020,positive,an awesome addition to the classic scifi saga     if you liked the 2014 godzilla but wanted to see more godzilla and more action this is the movie for you this was a fun ride from start to finish
Jan 18 2020,positive,although this movie got some people confused it was still a great monster movie as a godzilla fan this made me cry because it brought back great memories from the past
Jan 17 2020,positive,love the movie not into the sappy human story at all could care less rather see kaiju vs kaiju and that be the movie none the less still enjoyed it
Jan 15 2020,positive,stunning visual storytelling  the variety in colors textures and style between the monsters is a treat  the script is audacious where other godzilla movies spend the whole film teasing the monster only to disappoint in run time or wide perspectives kom is in full monster mode from the start  by the final battle the epic panoramas of ghidorah mothra and rodan are on full display  highlights include godzilla tackling monster zero through a skyscraper  the vfx are not hidden in dim lighting camera shake or quick cuts  the monsters strut in full view from the macro to the ultrawide  also there are some humans but i found the ejecting pilot getting gobbled by rodan more engaging than the leads
Jan 14 2020,positive,good film good i cant wait for godzilla vs kong 
Jan 14 2020,negative,i honestly thought this series couldnt get any worse luckily this is just as bad as its kongpredecessor these monsterverse films feature the action of transformers mixed with scripts that breathe the fast  the furious these characters have been onscreen since the 50s a shame cgi still cant change the goofiness of these wouldbe intimidating monsters onscreen speaking of monsters onscreen there should have been way more time with the other monsters than just the few minutes the camera decided to catch too much time with the alltoohuman cast that is the biggest issue with these big monster movies  that and the lack of grisly gore and the force fed family friendliness injected into almost every second that i always seem to find myself struggling to keep my eyes open on this is as cheesy as the original film but for a different reason other than the rubber suits king of the monsters is as fake as the cgi it replaces the rubber with everything about this film screams gmo  theres no organic hype for the sequel by the time the credits role  thats already spoonfed to viewers as well unlike the rest of this film which goes down like it was force ingested through a torture tube i should have turned it off as soon as i heard that fortune cookie line    and i actually liked the cast here except that annoying kid  yet again with these movies a common problem  i want less people  more monsters  that along with less family friendliness and more violence suitable for an adult audience is that really so hard to ask for another detriment to the legendary picture legacy
Jan 13 2020,negative,the lack of logic in each scene is just mindblowing my grandparents have better dialogues with me that the carecters in the film btw there dead
Jan 12 2020,positive,the sequel is much better than the first godzilla 2 is truly nice in some point and is true the film had imperfection but is great in all ways hope people will not continue to dislikes it
Jan 12 2020,neutral,its pacific rim all over just cgi giant monsters fighting thats about it
Jan 10 2020,negative,interesting how china wasnt attacked ccp say no no you cant put that in the movie hmm
Jan 9 2020,positive,loved this movie the human story line of it was a bit rushedconfusing at times but the monster battles made it absolutely worth it felt like the battles were classic battles only dislike was how little mothra was in this movie that felt like a missed opportunity but overall incredible movie
Jan 6 2020,positive,full of monster fighting awesome shots a kick ass villain and the perfect set up to kong vs godzilla would recommend it if you love godzilla fights
Jan 6 2020,positive,movie will make you feel like a kid again if you grew up with these movies then this will just fill you with joy this level of respect for the source material is honestly unparalleled in modern hollywood i mean who honestly goes to see a godzilla movie for human characters that we care about seriously this movie was made for fans of these types of movies not film critics who only want movies to shoot for getting oscar nominations
Jan 5 2020,positive,finally a faithful and tremendously entertaining tribute to the great legacy of these films and their important environmental message excellent
Jan 4 2020,positive,excellent cgi also some great story tellingworld building great standalone film even though it is actually a sequel it is hard to draw relations to the previous film
Jan 3 2020,positive,good i dont know why it got 42
Jan 2 2020,positive,a fun movie not good storytelling but great effects and probably one most hateable characters of the year in vera farmigas character by her acting and great moments in the film it makes me look forward in seeing kong vs godzilla
Jan 2 2020,positive,amazing action good reason for conflict
Jan 1 2020,positive,the best movie of 2019 honors the source material and brings back the good old days of the golden age 1954  1964 the heisei godzilla movies 1984 1996 the critics are just feminist cucks who dont know what theyre talking about better than all of disney star wars no feministcommunist garbage and honors the source material unlike the mcu which put a teenage peter without mary jane in civil war and carol danvers in the 1990s as captain marvel instead of being ms marvel in the 1990s the original male captain marvel was still alive
Jan 1 2020,negative,laughable with p poor acting totally inaccurate mechanics and extremely poor cgi this is a hollywood joke of a movie period
Jan 1 2020,negative,cheesy bad writing first one was tolerable kong was really good this is bad 
Jan 1 2020,positive,a real revival of the king fighting its arch nemesis
Dec 31 2019,positive,not a perfect movie the very cut and dry exposition machines that are the characters are the achilles heel but seeing godzilla mothra rodan and king ghidorah reborn in such magnificent splendor is exactly what i hoped for
Dec 30 2019,negative,long live the king    godzilla king of the monsters didnt work for me sorry guys im gonna be the odd one to say this but i thought this was incredibly boring    i rewatched the 2014 version back in may in preparation for this movie and after five years since ive seen it it still holds up the scale felt so grand and the overall experience is so epic its a shame the same cant be said for king of the monsters    people have complied about the characters in the 2014 version but nothing compares to these planks of wood holy sht they are so one note i honestly couldnt care for the whole family dilemma at least we had bryan cranston that brought an emotional hook in gareth edwards movie heck the characters in the original werent too bad     the comedy between other characters is painfully unfunny and out of place the writing is really bad and doesnt help any character development logical sense for these characters are nonexisting    the visual effects sound work and action scenes were all the main highlights of course i love the concepts of each monster and how visual effect wizardry brought it to life during the fights or whenever the monsters are about to clash was a lot of fun     everything elsenot so much    overall rating satisfying for some godzilla fans but doesnt live up to its predecessor
Dec 29 2019,negative,i felt like i was thrown into the movie midwayaction great effects great actorsand i am still trying to figure out the story oh wait there isnt a story     action shots strung together such a disappointment
Dec 28 2019,negative,plot is horrendous and its so boring
Dec 28 2019,positive,this movie had all the creatures we grew up with and expanded on tohos tokyo movies from the past nicely done and loved the way godzilla destroyed fenway park even though i am a red sox fan
Dec 28 2019,positive,amazing kaiju movie made by people who managed to show their love and respect for the original series
Dec 27 2019,negative,i couldnt write a good review for this movie if i tried the plot was just bad i felt my mind start to wander in the middle of the movie from the repetitious and stupidly accurate guesses on what godzilla is thinking all the good in the movie was in the throwbacks and references to old movies which rendered the movie a huge badly written fanfic  the writers didnt even give us the luxury of having a convenient plot device we just had characters standing around explaining their life motives and doing random things contrary to their personality the wanton destruction and the stereotypical score left the monster fights empty and forgettable dont waste your money on the movie
Dec 27 2019,positive,this movie was amazing i loved every moment it really reminded me of watching toho godzilla movies when i was a kid
Dec 27 2019,positive,another great godzilla movie though not as good as the first the visuals are stellar though it has its rough moments in between
Dec 26 2019,negative,i dont understand what feels so difficult for the directors of godzilla movies when it comes to recognizing that not a single soul is paying to see the movie for the purpose of watching a poorlywritten human melodrama with a backdrop of fighting monsters i dont understand the purpose of keeping the camera so close to the 400ft tall subjects that you cant tell whats going on i dont understand how it could be considered a positive effect to make the entire movie feel like youre catching fleeting glimpses of the main subjects i cant imagine how the same production company went from making mistakes in their first godzilla correcting nearly all of them in their first kong and then going right back to the terrible viewing experience that this movie was the heavy shades of blue tinting just made for less visibility theres a reason that kong got nominated for its special effects and this movie did not  you can actually freaking see them
Dec 26 2019,positive,this is my favorite movie of all time i didnt care about the story a lot but i loved all of the kaiju and they never disappoint
Dec 25 2019,negative,worst movie i have seen all year its so terrible that i couldnt stop watching it if godzilla did exist i would feed him the entire cast
Dec 25 2019,positive,they gotta stop repeating their key mistake thinking the human characters are what were here for the monsters are exquisite though
Dec 25 2019,positive,did not make me feel excited at all
Dec 25 2019,positive,glad i saw it on the flight from sydney to la for free  story had promise but as usual got stupid with the 13year old screen writers injecting their foolishness  glad i didnt have to pay to rent the blue ray
Dec 24 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters brings us everything it promised and nothing else it is a monster movie that works because it gloats in its own insubstantiality
Dec 23 2019,negative,this movies plot and reasoning are just like the last movie its a tangled mess with no logic and no reasoning the only reason why this movie gets two stars is because of visual effects and acting
Dec 22 2019,negative,not one of the godzilla movies produced in hollywood comes close to understanding the appeal of godzilla to the audience
Dec 22 2019,positive,i enjoyed it for the kaiju and the battles i felt like the human involvement couldve been dialed down a bit more but it was definitely better than the first the emotional connection wasnt entirely necessary and it seemed a bit forced overall i would watch it again
Dec 20 2019,negative,there were many moments that i genuneily cringed at the movie and there was even times that i was bored which is not what i expect from a godzilla movie the script is dumb and it barely requires anything from its great cast why spend so much money hiring high caliber actors if their skills are not going to be used properly the trailer was a 1010 but the movie was a 5 monsterverse has huge potential in hollywood but were not going to get much of it if the studio doesnt deliver in quality
Dec 20 2019,positive,amazing monster fights this is the godzilla film every kid in the 70s wished existed best film of its kind ever
Dec 20 2019,neutral,the first godzilla at least had solid human characters these ones are hardly tolerable c
Dec 19 2019,positive,criminally underrated and basically serves as the perfect introduction to 4dx cinema
Dec 19 2019,positive,beautiful movie with astounding cgi go go godzilla
Dec 19 2019,positive,to quote one of my favourites things said by another human ah yes godzilla king of oscars which was in response to people criticising the movie     end of the day its monsters beating the shit out of other monsters and that was exactly what i wanted from the movie     that and the musical score is enough to make me drown someones first born its that good
Dec 19 2019,positive,better than the critics say not as good as general audiences report weird story fun monsters ridiculous battle scenes
Dec 18 2019,negative,why do people like this move the characters are awful and the effects arent really that good its boring and overlong plus the plot is very convoluted a total waste of time
Dec 17 2019,negative,it has stunning eyepopping battle scenes but the franchise films still have human plot lines that do not generate sympathy for the viewer
Dec 17 2019,positive,a bit of a jumbled plot but great action and effects 
Dec 15 2019,positive,way better than uglydolls
Dec 14 2019,positive,fuck you if you hate this movie
Dec 13 2019,positive,i regret i didnt see this one at the movies perfect with popcorn
Dec 12 2019,positive,all hell breaks loose in godzilla king of the monsters a big budget monster movie  when a group of ecoterrorists free all of the creatures monarch has neutralized a wave of destruction heretofore unseen sweeps across the earth and its up to godzilla to restore order  the plot is pretty ridiculous and its politics couldnt be more heavyhanded  still the creature designs and special effects are extraordinary  and the monster fights are fun and exciting  it has its problem and goes off the rails a bit but godzilla king of the monsters is entertaining and delivers the carnage and destruction that it promises
Dec 11 2019,positive,they nailed the monsters in this movie home run with that the only hopes i have for the monsterverse in the future is that they get more compelling human characters
Dec 11 2019,positive,the movie was eye catching especially for a childhood godzilla fan like me i loved how they incorporated the kanji more and had immersive
Dec 10 2019,positive,i am a classic godzilla fan and this movie absolutely pays homage to those classics and keeping true to the design of the characters but also improving upon them this is an absolute must see theres plenty of monster action mixed with people so you never get bored constant thrill ride the lighting is such that you can actually see the monsters where in 2014s godzilla they kept the dark to build suspense i recommend this to any classic godzilla fans
Dec 9 2019,positive,it feels like the creatures are smarter than the humans but if youre in the mood to watch cgi carnage this one gets the job done pretty well
Dec 8 2019,positive,its story isnt as intense as the first but at the same time its more fun because it makes up for the lack of kaiju action in edwards movie even the human characters most of which are cliches are still more entertaining all i wanted was more giant monster battles in this sequel and thats what i got its a ton of fun
Dec 8 2019,positive,yeah the story isnt particularly good or plausible  who am i kidding its darn right silly  but thanks to some monstrously epic visuals that manages to capture the majesty of these legendary film creatures as they battle each other in destructive fight after destructive fight im not sure i really care in short if youre here for the story then man dont bother but if you just want to be entertained by a load of monsters tearing each others heads off quite literally occasionally then i think theres enough of that to do the trick
Dec 8 2019,positive,this is what a godzilla movie should be the human characters may still be boring but thats typical godzilla movie formula and they made up for it with a whole lot of awesome fan service im here for monsters and they delivered
Dec 6 2019,positive,its exactly what it promises to be a fun big and loud movie about giant monsters fighting and im a sucker for those
Dec 2 2019,neutral,i would totally pay to see godzilla against monsters only without forgettable characters a weak plot and lazy dialogue
Dec 1 2019,negative,this film is why i hate action films the same formula is used through the entire movie  theirs a talking scene then a monster fight scene its horrible the only redeeming thing is the great performance by vera farming    grade d
Nov 30 2019,negative,another sjw themed movie thanks for destroying a once great monster story with the typical hollywood pc garbage i made it until the meeting scene and off it went
Nov 29 2019,positive,a tribute to many godzilla films the best godzilla movie in my eyes had me on edge from beginning to end from the iconic roar through the monsters theme songs i cant wait for godzilla v kong
Nov 29 2019,neutral,a below average monster movie dimly lit and a dim story
Nov 29 2019,positive,the battles absolutely did not disappoint the humans can be forgiven if tho some of their actions are weird but it weirdly makes sense
Nov 27 2019,negative,quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen
Nov 26 2019,positive,lame characters but great monster fights
Nov 26 2019,neutral,the battles just droned on and on and the story what story
Nov 24 2019,negative,worst piece of shit ever
Nov 23 2019,positive,while the story flops slightly ken wantanabe flies high in this film while godzilla and ghidorah are a good distraction for the kids while the adults pay attention to the story
Nov 23 2019,positive,the big fella handled his business which is what i cane to see
Nov 21 2019,positive,fil with beautiful special effects and with fights between very effective and beautiful monsters to see but in addition to this the film offers little else because it commits to give a deep plot with family dramas and slow scenes in a film that does not need it and therefore comes unused slowed down the dramatic scenes then become unnecessarily slow and long without really involving because he always expects the action
Nov 20 2019,negative,that was soooo bad i registered myself on rottentomatoes to give my first ever review so i could warn people about how bad it was  kyle chandler is probably embarrassed and longing for his days of coaching football in texas  vera farmiga should be downright ashamed at her role in the worst take your kid to work day ever  tywin lannister probably thought dragons ok im in but if his agent suddenly takes a crossbow to the chest we now know why  a dumb plot terrible character development and now more radioactive than ever  just move on past this atrocity and thank yourself for trusting a random internet stranger and his advice
Nov 20 2019,negative,brief summary    group of people talk cgi monster shows up group of people talk japanese man asks  where is godzilla rooms shakes cgi monster shows up people run group of people talk japanese man asks  where is godzilla rooms shakes cgi monster shows up people run japanese man touches godzilla and dies cut to trailer of stranger things iv with eleven and some monsters  spoiler alert  she has not got her powers back  people run some destruction happens godzilla roars the end
Nov 19 2019,positive,very fun and exciting has some parts that are handled a bit poorly but if youre looking for a movie about giant monsters fighting youve definitely found a fantastic one
Nov 18 2019,positive,a big improvement after the 2014 movie more epic fights and good cgi the only reason why people dont give good ratings is just they dont like monsters fighting this is godzilla so adjust your mindset and watch this we dont go to an orchestra and expect edm right so same here if someone cant handle fighting scenes dont watch this and give bad reviews you are in the wrong train
Nov 18 2019,negative,it was bad enough to laugh at most of the time with mediocre acting and a few interesting scenes
Nov 17 2019,positive,godzilla hes king of the monsters but perfection
Nov 17 2019,positive,i like this movie its way better than the 2014 one   the monster actionthe plotthe character development  and the beauty of the effectsright now this is my favorite  monster movie
Nov 17 2019,neutral,could have been worse would have loved to have seen them go not so far fetched
Nov 17 2019,positive,with the complete package of exceptional action beautiful visual effects and although very little time the kaijus appear and humans have more prominence but still godzilla king of the monsters does not disappoint it is the most epic monster movie in incredible ive never seen  i look forward to the mega crossover godzilla vs kong
Nov 16 2019,positive,a true monster movie with the action that we deserved a movie that literally blew our minds after endgame godzilla delivered much battle sight of the other monsters and extraordinary scenes of epic proportions cant wait for his battle with king kong
Nov 14 2019,positive,better than i thought so the audience rating is about right its just an action movie with big monsters and a story to keep you interested worth a watch
Nov 12 2019,negative,this is one bad pseudomoneter movie  writing was atrocious common sense was completely absent with something idiotic happening almost every 5 minutes destroying any type of immersion completely like godzilla aiming for headshots against it opponent whose head is extremely hard target due to the fact that is located on top of long flexible neck  main villain was really bad nothing makes villain worse than being exceptionally stupidand ignorant her reasoning made zero sense and her actions contradicted her own motivation humans destroy planet monsters are natures way to restore balance  therefore lets interfere with natural natural way of things and mess with monsters and that is somehow supposed to restore balanceeven more meddling in natural way of things some god complex that woman had and her redemption arc made her look even more pathetic  movie was also full of political narratives and messages they added nothing of value and only further hindered extremely poor writing  many action scenes were quite boring as they felt lacking any creativity to them like rodan pursuit checking checkboxes it wasnt a fight it was just scene where all fighters blew up one by one there was zero tension   and then rodan was just defeated it all was completely pointless why was it needed  what it added to the movie  followed osprey scene was so cringe  there was just so much cheese in this movie barely any tension zero clever solutions or revelations they even managed to forcefully insert atlantis into this contraption  05 star for last monster fight and another 05 for if i had you two for parents joke rest was an absolute trash
Nov 12 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was fun not great but fun im not sure it was as good as its 2014 predecessor but fairly close looking forward to the next in the series im expecting a king kong encounter
Nov 11 2019,positive,its good  if you knew all of these monsters lore the human story is not too strong as well simular to the first one this film was not i was hoping for the sequel we are moving way too fast mothra lore in a sentence rodan one action scene and didnt even fight godzilla ghidorah is the only good thing about the film since  it was his movie i wished he wouldve been saved for a later film since hes a huge rival to godzilla if you have seen the previous godzilla film and all of the other introduction films for mothra rodan and ghidorah you might find some enjoyment this film is not casual friendly and has way too much information for them to catch up with  including all of the cameo name drops as well there are a lot
Nov 11 2019,positive,good scifi action storyline was good and characters good
Nov 10 2019,neutral,the story is not very memorable or interesting but you dont watch this film for a sophisticated plot this film delivers on what it advertises giant monsters battling godzilla it looks great and the giant titan battles are entertaining  overall an average film that worth the watch if you like watching giant monsters destroy everything
Nov 10 2019,positive,i like godzilla movies  the trailer made this to look like it might be the best one ever  sadly it wasnt  but still a good godzilla movie  i like final wars more
Nov 9 2019,positive,i really liked it great special effects
Nov 8 2019,positive,very nice special effects boring story
Nov 8 2019,negative,garbage not once this movie made me care about any of the characters the story and execution were despicable and the main character made me want to vomit not godzilla 
Nov 7 2019,negative,i kind of like the godzilla thing i know that theres loads of old japanese films but i have only seen the first one of those i have seen pretty much every american version after 2000 so i guess i keep it up with this one the plot is as always the big thing scarying people destroying stuff other massive creatures arrives and eventually they figure that godzilla is the rescue  fight monsters with monsters kind of i like that theres other cool creatures here rodan and king ghidorah among others they look kind of cool and the effects are looking great but way overdone    the film is bad its pace is very fast things happen in a rush our people are on planes cars in techy houses in antartica underground in submarines  you name it no focus on making it believeable so we never see them move around  they are just in a new place all of a sudden ok cast and a few cool fights but always too much and messy    35 out of 10 godzillas
Nov 7 2019,positive,exciting movie with plenty of action and monsters i havent felt this excited about the genre since the first pacific rim
Nov 7 2019,positive,king of the monsters godzilla is the best
Nov 7 2019,negative,what an utter piece of garbage how can they even make this shit
Nov 7 2019,positive,a fun and over the top g flick the japanese edit of the original 54 film or godzilla mothra and king ghidorah giant monsters allout attack aka godzilla gmk are the best so i would recommend them before this one but this is among the more entertaining godzilla films although not for every one most will probably enjoy this film
Nov 6 2019,positive,so much better in comparison to the first movie
Nov 6 2019,positive,this is a love letter to all people that love monster movies amazing
Nov 4 2019,positive,great action sequences cinematography soundtrack and visual effects and faithfullness to the material source is respectful delivers the movie not be an oscar movie and a well done beautifully crafted movie the titans give better performances than the actual actors and thats a problem but for those who come to only monsters will a have a blast
Nov 3 2019,neutral,good but not believable 
Nov 1 2019,positive,to me a godzilla movie doesnt need to have a good story all i care about is watching giant monsters fighting  just like i use to do with toys as a kid i got exactly what i wanted in this movie people who say its a bad movie because the story is weak and characters are boring dont know how to watch a monster movie or dont know who is it for your not thete for the story or human characters my problem with this movie is that i cant stop re watching it
Oct 31 2019,positive,a lot of people have been criticizing this movie for not focusing on humans or character development as much as the first movie had but thats what you should expect from a godzilla film you dont go to a godzilla film expecting to see people talk and analyze the destructive capabilities of these monsters but to see the monsters fight in my opinion the problem i had with the first film was that we did not get enough godzilla scenes or even fights with godzilla this movie is packed with godzilla fights and huge monsters which was a huge improvement from the first movie if you enjoy watching these iconic monster clash and fight on the big screen then you will love this movie
Oct 31 2019,positive,guns in this movie though cinematography is the only thing in this movie
Oct 30 2019,positive,one of the best movies of 2019
Oct 29 2019,positive,the best kaiju battle movie of all time
Oct 29 2019,positive,i found godzilla ii king of the monsters in comparison with its predecessor godzilla 2014 to be an amazing film also the massive difference yet enormous share in quality between the two produces a parallel to batman 1989 and batman returns it has much more insanity much more colour and life fun its free to go crazy and it has but it really truly works just like in batman returns you have batman and catwoman against the penguin and evil tycoon max shreck in king of the monsters you have gojira and mothra against ghidorah and rodan its a truly hectic amazing film and i do see 2014 as being the batman 1989 equivalent though with two jokers because of the two mutos
Oct 29 2019,positive,delivers what it promises if you want to see giant monsters have epic battlesthis is your movie if you love godzilla movies from the pastsee this movie because it is all your wildest godzilla movie fantasies from childhood manifest as present day mature fantasies depicted in a movie awesome one of the few movies i wanted to immediately watch again after the movie ended thats rare and awesome
Oct 28 2019,positive,best monster movie the kaiju are back  
Oct 27 2019,negative,too dark did not add to the movie the actors spent the movie cowling in fear to a blank screen totally unbelievable
Oct 27 2019,negative,it was a visual disaster the fight scenes were closeups in darkness hard to follow anything just very underwhelming as a whole just noise and nonsensical cinematography 
Oct 26 2019,negative,godzillaking of monsters    taking a different approach in the sequel i would say king of mosters possesses big monsters but small execution in characters similar elements that hurt kong skull island the movie has great actors but poorly written dialogue that at times feels desperate to be humorous and just makes you cringe in some scenes positive aspects was the special effects are nearly flawless and if your looking for more monster battles in the sequel you definitely get it the storyline aggravated me because everytime you get information to the ancient history to the titans they speed past it making the film editing seem choppy overall godzilla is a monster action movie and nothing more 
Oct 26 2019,positive,great movie with a lot of epic battles between the monsters honestly it gave me a better idea of what is going on in the godzilla universe i always heard about it but didnt know much so knowing the name and purpose of the monsters was very enlightening i know understand why the japanese were furious for the first adaptation decades ago since it doesnt portray the true essence of godzilla i think this movie was better than the first one and i regret not seeing it in theatres
Oct 26 2019,positive,this movie provides a great continuation to warner bros monsterverse through exploring the idea of what really is considered a monster  
Oct 25 2019,positive,this is every godzilla fans dream movie just a bunch of monsters duking it out it was a really fun movie and one where you can turn off your brain and have a good time were the human sub plots boring kinda the human elements of a godzilla movie are never really important to me i cant wait to see what they do in the future with godzilla in his new cinematic universe
Oct 25 2019,positive,this movie has everything a godzilla fan wants in a godzilla film
Oct 24 2019,positive,powerful movie that deserves more credit and acknowledgement
Oct 23 2019,positive,best movie of the series so far
Oct 23 2019,positive,great entertainment there have been so many of these i missed this one and saw by accident worth it
Oct 22 2019,negative,rewatched it on my big screen at home what a joke of a movie it wasnt even that enjoyable just for its cgi work which is questionable at best in what are supposed to be the most exiting parts of the movie every time serizawa says gojira is absolutely cringey not that most of the dialogue isnt any better theres no depth theres no passion for what godzilla is for the movie screen it doesnt blow me away like it should which is a shame
Oct 21 2019,negative,friend kept going on and on about how great this movie was and i finally bit the bullet let me tell you that bullet was pretty painful godzilla is overrated
Oct 21 2019,negative,this movie is boring as fuck
Oct 20 2019,positive,it is great movie one of the best i have ever seen
Oct 20 2019,neutral,i understand the criticisms of the previous film and agree with most of them but this was not the answer was anything real in this movie it was a whole lot of awful cg and early 2000s stargate sg1esque quasimilitary sets with a totally inane plot and virtually unlikable characters i thought the whole point of these new big g films was to do him right in the 21st century with the best effects money can buy and stories modern audiences wont roll their eyes at jeez give me guys in rubber suits on wires destroying lovingly crafted miniature cities any day of the week over this trash ghidorah and mothra deserved better
Oct 19 2019,positive,nothing but badass monster fight scenes 1010
Oct 19 2019,positive,the story was too simple and boring but the fights and characters are worth seeing as the ending will give fans a part that they wouldnt forget
Oct 19 2019,positive,this movie has a bad storyline and terrible acting but makes up for some of it with its stunning graphics  
Oct 18 2019,positive,i loved the movie it reminded me of the japanese movies
Oct 18 2019,positive,this is one of the best movies i have seen after a long time  such a relieve from mcu obsessed industry
Oct 16 2019,positive,good times for in the summer blockbuster style  lots of good action  the human storyline with the family is a bit predicable but with the roles reversed from the typical  it gives you what it advertised  lots of fighting monsters
Oct 15 2019,neutral,the incredible special effects and sound design doesnt make up for the convoluted and useless main story 
Oct 15 2019,positive,another successful ushollywood version of godzilla movie the plot was there the effects was there the human drama was there and the subtle message about environmental care and awareness is there this is a complete package monster film i personally liked the allstar casts and an inclusion of asian actors ken watanabe and zhang ziyi  for me this is a tribute to asian origin of godzilla story which is japan i think the rests of the casts justified their assigned characters plus the family drama in the plot was intensified by the act of farmiga and chandler the whole story of the film draws you various emotions  thanks to the casts who delivered well in their characters while the monster effects and epic battle scenes were amazing and consistent you cant also deny the social commentary and message about taking care of our planet earth  actually the message is allover the course of the movie but the it was conveyed in a subtle way i actually get the message halfway through the movie and its a good lesson to pick up from godzilla while enjoying its special effects monster battle scenes and entertaining drama  
Oct 15 2019,positive,what few fights senes we were given were the most spectacular moments literally no one cared about the human characters at all so 70 of the movie was god awful but the kaiju on kaiju fighting was breathtaking as a long time g fan it was an emotional sight to see rodan mothra and king ghidora redesigned in beautiful cg and fighting eachother borderline awesome any og godzilla fan owes it to themselves to see this love letter to original haise and 54
Oct 14 2019,negative,lol no this aint it this might have been a successful paintbynumbers 90s summer blockbuster with all the latest technology but i was never a fan of those anyhow acting and dialogue was melo and syrupy i didnt develop any feelings for the family at the center of the drama the motive for the villainy has been used too many times avengers kingsman star trek conscience of the king and now this culling life to save it thats been done and the action choreography was terrible you can tell when a movie does not spend the proper resources on action choreo because they zoom in too close or too far out use a lot of dark nighttime scenes or hazycloudy scenes and the action either moves too fast or too slow to actually follow the sequence of events all of this happened here trash 
Oct 14 2019,neutral,mediocre storyline special effects are average suitable for this movie since godzilla is kind of tongue in cheek anyway but the content looses interest after about 1 hour 20 minutes at an hour and a half i had to pull out my cell phone to make this review in order to avoid falling asleep and disturbing those around me that are watching it with my loud snoring if youre a hardcore godzilla fan then then you may be as happy as a pig in sht with this movie but im just not that much of a fan
Oct 13 2019,positive,this is movie is far better than the first for one thing it has more scenes with godzilla unlike the last one which had about three to five minutes in it this movie actually focuses on godzilla unlike the last one which focused on the people more than the monsters themselves        
Oct 13 2019,positive,this is a movie made for the godzilla fans by a godzilla fan the critics reviews are practically irrelevant as usual in this case
Oct 13 2019,negative,good godzilla vs ghidorah movie but the way they went about setting up the plot was bleh why are the human characters so dumb
Oct 13 2019,neutral,plain and predictable i just loved the monsters fights 
Oct 13 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic and give it five stars because you got to see godzilla more i wish it wasnt as dark and stormy though
Oct 12 2019,positive,special effects overwhelm the viewer without providing a good plot line i had really looked forward to this new version but was really disappointed
Oct 12 2019,positive,i think its better than the previous movie its a lot more action and more screen time with godzilla and other monsters and i love the cgi i dont really care much about the human charachters or the plot as long as there are monsters and great monster fights i cant ask more because in my eye of view this is how a kaiju movie should be
Oct 12 2019,positive,pretty good popcorn flick the monster fights were good fun to watch  wasnt great but entertaining enough
Oct 12 2019,negative,absolutely ridiculous disjointed horrendous acting no real plot and what there is is very predictable monster fights are too dark meh
Oct 12 2019,negative,its a movie for 8year olds so  the plot is ridiculous and people draw great conclusions like we have 12 minutes until the monster explodes from too much radiation or when they simply know that whatever they found is much older than the egyptians or basically everything they ever guess or develop
Oct 12 2019,positive,i will sayi walked into this with very low expectations considering how many times they have tried to revive this this surprised me and exceeded my expectations definitely worth a watch
Oct 11 2019,positive,still the best of 2019 we are here to see monsters not humans
Oct 9 2019,positive,it pays tribute to the original movies in a lot of ways the magnificence shown in this movie really shows the true beauty and dread of these giant creatures the plot could have been better sure but with the original soundtrack the fights and the emotional feelings behind both the human characters and the kaiju do in fact make up for it i gotta say the key to coexistence with the kaiju genre is to accept that these movies may not reach absolute perfection but they do give us a good time
Oct 8 2019,positive,not as good as the 2014 one  im getting annoyed at all the monster movies that never show the monsters in sunlight and cant hold a camera steady  we go to see a monster fight now a monochromatic blurry motion simulating a monster fight  they touted what 17 monsters in it  yet that was a lie since most of them werent doing anything onscreen  a weird thing to say but id like a bit more realism in my monster movie and less hollywood sensationalism  for example every possible thing airplane or other falling object having to fall real close to the actors  its like they are danger magnets  just gets laughable after the 18th near miss ya know  when i see a movie like this im not expecting high art but i would like less blatant stupidity from the characters
Oct 8 2019,positive,critics are very confused this movie was amazing and delivered alot of things a g fan wants in a modern day godzilla movie
Oct 8 2019,negative,fails to live up to its hyp
Oct 8 2019,positive,havent even watched it but im about to
Oct 7 2019,negative,this was a really bad movie it felt like so many other bad movies before it it was worse than the last one by a significant almost impressive amount and i have no hopes for godzilla king kong based off how bland generic and poor this movie was
Oct 7 2019,positive,sorry for late response but this movie awesome been a godzilla fan since a kid what we fans want to see is a good kaiju battle nothing else 
Oct 6 2019,negative,july 2019 awful jokes super slow paced everything was so predictable i almost fell asleep even eleven couldnt save this one
Oct 6 2019,positive,great movie great action great monsters great fights do t know why everybody gotta hate on king of monsters
Oct 6 2019,positive,this movie has one of the epic monster battles of this decade
Oct 6 2019,negative,i watched this on my phone during a flight and couldnt help but wish i had made it to the imax just to watch the battles the monsters are the best part of this movie the rest is a mess
Oct 6 2019,positive,the storyline and acting was not the greatest it was mostly the visual effects and showoff of the monsters that brought this movie to an okay level
Oct 6 2019,negative,this is the worst movie ive sat through i mean it wasnt bad enough to turn off but i thought about it multiple times 
Oct 5 2019,neutral,as a huge godzilla fan i was sorely disappointed while the soundtrack and sound design were absolutely amazing it cant save this movie from the horrible screenplay and poor directing by michael dougherty if you were expecting to see godzilla through it down with mothra rodan and king ghidorah well then go watch the trailers and you will have basically seen all that there is to see there are way too many cuts back to the human characters during the fights also god forbid we see some monster action without any rain snow or darkness constantly obscuring everything 510
Oct 5 2019,neutral,great special effects but the story was not as interesting as i had hoped
Oct 5 2019,positive,better than 1st one due to the fact you actually see godzilla this time but it is somewhat slow paced and the humans side of the story really detracted from the whole experience that said if you have some time with you this movie will still keep you enjoyed if you dont pay too much attention to the humans
Oct 5 2019,positive,when i watched the 2014 godzilla movie i was less than impressed as can be seen from my review here    when watching this one i felt it was marginally better    true to the hollywood standards today or perhaps lack thereof the script writers just had to try and squeeze in a lot of green bullshit about how we destroy the planet and something has to be done bla bla bla    interesting enough though the way it was done actually made the green fanatics the bad guys in the movie whether that was intentional or the writers was too stupid to realize it i do not know    the story is essentially about how one green fanatic in particular releases the titans as they are called in the movie and uses them to wreak havoc killing millions to balance things and start a new world that is your typical green fanatic although with a bit more means than usual to implement his deluded fantasies of course godzilla with the help of a few clear minded humans comes to the rescue thats pretty much it as i wrote a typical substandard hollywood script    what makes this movie better though is that the implementation is not so shit full of absolutely stupid and unintelligent sequences as the 2014 movie the implementation is actually not that bad the action sequences are really quite good and theres plenty of big ass monsters in this movie    i also quite liked that cool supercarrier airplane that the monarch crew flew around in    as despicable as the previously mentioned green fanatic is the role was nicely implemented as well as the main protagonist and most people around him    the part about kickstarting godzilla after he was wounded by detonating a nuke in front of his nose was a bit silly though so was the hole its to hot and radioactive for drones as well as for a nuclear submarine so lets send in a guy on foot seriously    also the after scenes where life magically sprouted everywhere the titans had wrecked havoc was more than a little stupid    if this hadnt been a cool giant monster movie with a lot of special effects i would have scored it a lot lower however i am a sucker for these kinds of movies and i really like godzilla i even watched some of the old black and white movies when i was a kid    of course the useless critics at rt calls it rotten maybe because the realized that the greens where the bad guys and that doesnt fit their agenda
Oct 5 2019,positive,this movie was totally epic
Oct 5 2019,negative,beyond one deserved scene of sacrifice everything else is filled with annoying quarreling humans chasing oversized pokemons by having radar staring contest disappointingly not fun
Oct 5 2019,neutral,dumb premise but it was still better than the last jedi turn your brain off and enjoy the monster fights then laugh at the rest of the ridiculous story i dont regret watching it
Oct 4 2019,negative,terrible watered down hollywood mainstream crp the fighting scenes and the mediocre special effects that shine here and there are the only things that made me cringe through it
Oct 4 2019,negative,a truly terrible movie
Oct 4 2019,negative,too much exposition not enough monsters
Oct 4 2019,positive,giant monsters battling it out  check thats exactly what i went in looking for and exactly what it delivered totally entertaining 
Oct 3 2019,positive,again very dark scenes with godzilla not like we had with skull island which i was hoping for
Oct 3 2019,positive,i could fall asleep cool new version but raises some questions about the importance of filling in plot holes
Oct 2 2019,positive,good special effects   pretty predictable   
Oct 2 2019,positive,mothers rules fenway park makes it to a monster movie
Oct 1 2019,negative,this is what happens when a studio overcorrects     the original had a major flaw it was 2 movies meshed together a human story of a families struggle with powerlessness against a monstrous disaster and a monster flick about 25 giants brawling between skyscrapers with bad lighting seriously why do these monsters only fight at night    and thats where this picks up trying to give you a lot more of second one but then still trying to shove the human story in there the final product is a mess of a convoluted plot which has more holes than swiss cheese     the humans story is a mess and there are way too many monsters fighting in dark cities  from aliens and monster mind control to divorce battles and anarchist philosophical ideals the movie is just a dark loud mess
Oct 1 2019,positive,this was a cool movie i mean first have you seen the originals  we have an interesting plot that is easy to follow and some fun watching godzilla fight his way thru monsters  this is a perfect set up to the clash of titans with kong vs godzilla coming soon
Oct 1 2019,negative,big monster roarsbig monster stomps and faces down enemieswow enemies can shoot lightningi already know for a fact that big monster is going to beat his enemiessome humans carry big gun and try to dominate big monsterother humans are caring and try to love big monster this entire movie could have been written by a 5 year old couldnt watch ittired tovery predictable very cheesy 
Oct 1 2019,negative,no godzilla film should be this boring  muddy ugly visual effects
Sep 30 2019,negative,epic monster battle going on and were continually forced to watch some family dispute unfold ruined the whole film with personal drama  
Sep 30 2019,positive,the story was there the cgi was off overall it was fun too see visuals of beloved monsters
Sep 29 2019,negative,formulated plot generic character development youre following one story and before you know it youre following the story of a family torn apart and trying to reconnect over the death of a child the monsters were cool though
Sep 29 2019,positive,not that complicated big monsters fight we watch this isnt a drama where the story needs to be 100 perfect hell the entire point of the movie is about a three headed dragon from space fighting an overgrown lizard if you somehow were still expecting anything different then you have a problem
Sep 29 2019,neutral,while a certain improvement over the previous godzilla with more satisfying monster action even there its a tad hard to even see it under the heavily destructive cg layers flying in front of our eyes and the socalled plot isnt even close to intelligent all that said youd be forgiven in calling this a good oldfashioned monster flick
Sep 28 2019,positive,great visuals epic monsters action junkies will enjoy
Sep 28 2019,neutral,i have never really been a fan of the godzilla franchise the 30 or so japanese films including the original i have yet to watch i dont really see that happening so soon as they arent the easiest films to track down still i have really liked the previous films that came out of legendarys so called monsterverse godzilla and kong skull island especially work really well as pure fun entertainment and this one doesnt try a different route but unfortunately there just isnt enough fun to compensate for a whole lot of flaws the story is very cliched and predictable with the characters being probably the main drawback of the film theres very little care put to establishing these main heroes  almost no backstory rote dialogue and they even barely move the plot along the supposed villainof the movie is played by charles dance but to me it seems like they just forgot about him halfway through the film kyle chandler plays the human protagonist that id say just serves the audience character he just stands around and marvels at huge monsters throughout most of the runtime and i actually really like chandler as an actor he has some of that tom cruiseharrison ford charisma to him that isnt utilised at all here really all of the cast is really talented and they try to give their all here but the writing is completely throwing them off however beside the incompetent writing the rest is actually pretty watchable the monster fight sequences are dazzling with great cgi and lighting that creates an almost mythical atmosphere godzilla is featured here a lot more than in his previous outing and that is definetly a win as you can guess from the title the film is full of classic godzilla monsters such as ghidorah rhodan and mothra and a few more they are all very well realised the pacing could have been better though i have to say there is a chunk of time about near the middle that is packed with exposition and human drama that isnt compelling at all there is fun to be had here especially for fans of the franchise but for the rest this is a disappointing effort that should have been better its a 25 for me
Sep 28 2019,positive,a lot of action it was one thing after another
Sep 27 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie the action was epic the characters were cool and interesting the human characters were bland but thats because the human characters are unimportant in kaiju movies like this honestly and i rather liked the plotline the idea of a king kaiju being able to redirect the actions of the other kaiju is a really cool one ultimately this movie got me interested in kaiju as a whole and in ghidorahs storyline especially however id make a point that most of the people complaining about the plot didnt really gp into this movie with the right mindset its not meant to be like a superhero movie and here the kaiju were far more the focus of where your emotion should be i thought the final face off was exceptionally emotional because i wanted ghidorah to win and godzilla beat him up yet i see reviews saying it was flat and had no emotion tied up in it which i could only understand if you were ignoring the kaiju as plot devices instead of looking at them as characters in their own right 
Sep 26 2019,neutral,great movie better than the first really thought the first one was lacking in the amount of cgi buildings that got destroyed 
Sep 26 2019,positive,great action gorgeous visuals its a shame about the plot
Sep 26 2019,negative,mommydaddy issues were a distraction  fuzzyheaded tree hugging was annoying  flashy effects are no substitute for character development or a plot  and finally show the damn monsters in daylight not just darkness or fog
Sep 25 2019,neutral,king of the monsters does an adequate job of being a mediocre blockbuster thats fine enough for anyone to watch for kaiju fans however its a must see to view these classic monsters realized on a mega budget its highs arent as high as the 2014 godzilla but its lows are in the same ballpark with some weak character work and major deaths that should elicit more feeling i still was never anywhere near as bored as i was during the middle section of godzilla 2014 even if nothing here compares to that final smackdown as the direction lacks that same understanding of staging the action beats for maximum effect still many fans will get what they paid for 
Sep 25 2019,negative,compared to the last tojo outing this was crap  i love godzilla but this was yet another agenda driven snore fest with too much going on and not enough substance  
Sep 24 2019,positive,amazing cgi with a strong storyline that included amazing actors and actresses like millie bobby brown  it is also a good way to lead into king kong vs godzilla in 2020  i would have given it a better rating if the storyline wasnt as rushed  
Sep 24 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie way more than i thought i thought the characters were very underdone but i liked the visual and overall movie could have been a bit shorter but it was good
Sep 24 2019,negative,i have never seen so much light and noise be so boring transformers im looking at you and i wanted to love it so much
Sep 24 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters elevates on its predecessor with current thoughtprovoking themes and more monster action eye candy
Sep 24 2019,positive,i got everything i asked for an ok storyline monsters fighting and godzilla acting as the hero this fit the bill and besides the dark scenes at points i thought the cgi was on point 
Sep 24 2019,positive,thin plot but who cares  awesome monster vs monster mayhem
Sep 23 2019,positive,that movie is just amazing i love it 
Sep 23 2019,positive,i didnt like when the monsters bowed at the end
Sep 23 2019,positive,honestly this should have been at least 2 movies  they basically introduced every godzilla monster plus some more i didnt recognize  felt rushed and a little confused 
Sep 22 2019,negative,lets focus on boring people instead of the cool monsters good idea  also written like a b movie from the 90s so many cliches
Sep 22 2019,positive,its a cool movie ridiculous but cool 
Sep 22 2019,negative,just a mess of a movie poorly written crap action scenes cliched acting and plot line a shameful waste of a 200m budget 
Sep 22 2019,negative,as cliche as it gets totally reductive story telling incredibly predictable perfect example of a film built on special effects and not good writing
Sep 22 2019,negative,terrible plot lazy writing and cheap special affect
Sep 21 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monster is a kaiju movie and this classic movies only has recognizement by the especial effects but in this case the history is no winner for a oscar but is a justification for the movie
Sep 21 2019,negative,the politics here are as confused as the plot oh of course the real monsters are the characters who recognize the necessity of confronting climate changedont they know nature will just take care of itself if we just return to worshipping the resurgent old gods 
Sep 21 2019,positive,the story was barely passable the actors seemed to be disinterested working together and did not elevate each others performance 
Sep 21 2019,positive,for any godzilla fan you will love this movie so many classic elements does tend to get muddled but that doesnt hurt what truly matters
Sep 21 2019,positive,this movie is definitely my favorite godzilla movie it has stunning cgi and amazing fight scenes this is now one of my favorite movies
Sep 21 2019,negative,suspension of disbelief does not work for this movie the dad is useless the mom is a psycho and the daughter is supposed to be 12 when clearly she is older
Sep 21 2019,positive,just well done a little sad mothra died so fast 
Sep 21 2019,positive,pretty okay not the best or anything
Sep 20 2019,positive,an absolute blast this movie was one giant love letter to toho and their fans highly recommended
Sep 20 2019,positive,just want i want to see in a monster movie more monsters fighting and less human drama huge improvement over the first one
Sep 20 2019,positive,amazing movie plase give us more and bigger monster fights in the next one im begging you hollywood the only reason i didnt see this in the cinema was because i though it was going to be like the last one and barley have godzilla in it you guys are on the right track for godzilla lovers but we want even less humans and more monsters thank you for the amazing movie
Sep 20 2019,negative,not compelling enough to suspend my belief in human nature
Sep 20 2019,positive,great but i was hopping that all kaiju will fight together in 2 side
Sep 19 2019,negative,i need to stop wasting money on formulaic blockbusters i literally fell asleep
Sep 19 2019,positive,great movie loved every moment 
Sep 18 2019,negative,weeks later and i cant even remember any memorable scenes it must have been boring
Sep 18 2019,positive,review   godzilla king of the monsters is an american monster film directed by michael dougherty it is a sequel to godzilla 2014 and is the third film in legendary pictures monsterverse now those who know me well know that i am a big godzilla fan i think all the movies based on the character are entertaining so i am going to try and be as unbiased as possible during this review having said that the movie is entertaining but very flawed not totally sure why people are coming out of seeing the film with an its not what i expected attitude its a godzilla movie  you cant go in expecting an oscar worthy film just a fun blockbuster  the movie centers around a group of scientists trying to awaken these titans that have been frozen or hibernating for thousands of years and a group of military professionals that are trying to stop them thats is the plot of this movie and obviously the titans get released and godzilla must fight and stop them before they destroy the world  kyle chandler and vera farmiga play exhusband and wife which i guess is a good thing because they have zero chemistry together im not a big fan of kyle chandler and he didnt win any points for me with this film either he was pretty one note and i didnt like the character i adore vera farmigas dramatic work bates motel and running scared are me two favorites and i was excited to see what she could do in this movie sadly nothing her character does makes any logical sense she is working with the scientists trying to release the titans while kyle chandler is trying to stop them she has no reason for doing this besides she is told to i never bought into it millie bobby brown plays their daughter in the movie and she is amazing unfortunately under utilized only having minimal screen time  the flaw in this movie was the same as the other two before it bad human characters i mean i get why theyre there but a lot of the decisions that are made are stupid and pointless no sane person would think that it is a good idea to set all of these monsters free that was a dumb premise that i think could have done with a rewrite ort two but i dont write for the movies i write the reviews  overall this movie was very entertaining while godzilla and other monsters were on the screen i was glad that they gave the monsters more screen time in this film too  if youre a fan of monster movie this will be right up your alley   35
Sep 18 2019,negative,i really tried to like this movie i really tried the cgi and battle scenes were admittedly amazing so it has that it also has a couple highprofile actors and actresses from the got and stranger things realms which can easily be appreciated but everything else is an ungodly mess first off many of the characters are flat in a very boring and dull kind of way what backstory they did show was just not that compelling to me personally and didnt help to keep me invested in the characters at all secondly this movie repeatedly violated the rules it created in the first place which kept my head spinning just trying to figure out how some of the things i was seeing made any sense at all in this scifi universe and lastly these creators misunderstood or violated so many rules of biology and science it made my head spin i get it its just a movie but good grief lets not use scientific terms just to sound smart if you dont actually know what they mean its so bad it honestly felt like someone took a bet to see how much from their old high school bio textbook they could butcher in one go and as someone with a wildlife biology degree this really gets under my skin    science sins  alpha and apex predator are not the same but were used interchangeably  you cant eat radiation its not food at one point they insinuated this  you need 3 satellites to triangulate gps position they didnt seem to realize one satellite isnt enough  they disregard things like ecological niches conditioning and adaptations to stimuli ex eventually noises played over and over again constantly will lose meaning as a deterrent and animals will become used to it  freefall physics flying dragon vs fighter jet  no difference in sensory perception between species in real life some will see better some may hear better etc  limb regeneration doesnt really work like you see in the movie  encasing a supposedly cold blooded reptile in ice will in most incidents probably kill it  they confuse home range with migration pattern at one point and they screw up what a home range looks like  they made ethical issues out of some things that would not be controversial in real life at one point but glossed over what scientists might have real concerns about    we deserve better
Sep 18 2019,negative,im afraid that i found this to me a pretty weak film excellent effects but still not a good overall film
Sep 18 2019,neutral,a disappointment so much potential but the bloated and campy human story didnt allow the monsters to breath sucking the oxygen out of the film
Sep 18 2019,positive,hey what did you expect this is not high art it is fun though with lots of monsters fighting
Sep 18 2019,positive,way better than the first one 
Sep 18 2019,negative,they wheeled out every trope for this one and still it wheezed and puffed after the first 30 minutes  for a film with so much going on its crazy that nothing really happened
Sep 18 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ever made scifi or not it sucked
Sep 17 2019,negative,one of the crappiest movies i have ever seen
Sep 17 2019,positive,literally godzilla king of the monsters
Sep 17 2019,positive,godzilla keeps titans in check truly an amazing movie
Sep 16 2019,positive,ignore the critic score its an awesome movie critics these days are biased and ruin everything from restaurants to movies with their so called professional reviews stick to the real people reviews
Sep 16 2019,negative,ive seen a few godzilla movies now and i have to say that none of them have impressed me that much godzilla king of monsters is no exception the story doesnt make any sense despite the actors trying their hardest to make it make sense the giant monster fights really should have been the saving grace of this action movie but they are mostly obscured and its hard to tell whats going on maybe fans will like this titan showdown but i remain unimpressed
Sep 16 2019,negative,godzilla deserves so much more  for the love of god stop having them fight in the dark 
Sep 16 2019,positive,really enjoyed the film a lot of action and kept me interested all 2 hrs
Sep 16 2019,positive,why was his head sooooo small  who did the graphics on this it was terrible  poor godzilla looks like an overweight wrestler with a pea head   the blurred graphics on mothra too were terrible   want real sad  the original japanese versions were clearer and more realistic then the computer generated mess of this movie   dont even know what that slothlike creature was suppose to be  did they not know how to make gamera so they dropped in the sloth with mathis legs  then they made rodan a trained parrot of some sort that bowed down to defeat   if you going to try to remake a classic b movie you need to do a lot more homework   note to producers  computer graphic designs should have made the characters and the movie crisper and clearer not blurred and all out of shape
Sep 16 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie loved the storyline 
Sep 16 2019,positive,best movie in the franchise mothra left me wanting more i hope they put her in the next one
Sep 15 2019,positive,monsters and mayhem loved it just a fun film
Sep 15 2019,positive,this movie was pretty cool yeah the humans characters were all pretty boring and dull and they kinda sucked but thats pretty much what all of the godzilla movies are like most of them go like this a monster shows up military and scientist people talk a monster shows up military and scientist people talk a monster shows up and maybe fights another monster repeat godzilla king of the monsters was pretty much a modern bigbudget version of a classic godzilla movie godzilla movies dont appeal to everyone so this movie isnt for everyone but as a godzilla fan i got my fix it was so cool to see all the things i saw these monsters do in the old movies with modern effects there were a ton of really cool references to the older movies references to king kong which im so happy is just a part of the godzilla universe now and new monsters not just the big four that were advertised the story also had some pretty interesting themes and ideas having to do with environmental disasters which is a fitting update for these movies the age of the atomic bomb is over what do these monsters represent today the monsters were also surprisingly expressive you could tell what they were thinking and feeling and they showed a lot of personality there were some issues i had with the movie it cuts away during the monster fights a bit too much sometimes it focuses on the human characters for a little too long the old movies rarely exceeded 100 minutes this movie is over 2 hours and some of the fights were hard to see but overall i think this is a solid kaiju flick if you arent a fan of godzilla i dont recommend this movie it technically isnt a great movie however if you are a fan of godzilla and love all the classics i think youll get a kick out of it i sure did and i cant wait until godzilla vs kong
Sep 15 2019,positive,great score with nods to the original music of the various monsters mothra twins effects were masterful scale was obvious 
Sep 15 2019,positive,a true spectacle a film like this only comes along once in a while and when it does we should stop and appreciate that the creators dared to dream and let this be a larger than life experience rather than some trivial and attempted poetic pseudo philosohical diatribe  sometimes the drippy melo drama needs to just take a back seat and let the visuals take charge and this movie did exactly that
Sep 15 2019,negative,wow this was bad i really enjoyed the first film but this script was awful they had an outstanding cast but not even the best of actors could have carried this piece of garbage 
Sep 15 2019,positive,amazing movie if you are a godzilla fan go see it its great i created an account here just to write this
Sep 15 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a monster beat em up that doesnt disappoint visually what it lacks in story it makes up for with a fun ride
Sep 15 2019,positive,this movie was honestly the best movie ive seen this yearcant wait for godzilla vs kong
Sep 15 2019,positive,a godzilla movie in the truest sense
Sep 14 2019,positive,the best movie i saw in 2019 endgame who 
Sep 14 2019,negative,the dialog was poorly written and the story was plain too much bad cgi
Sep 14 2019,positive,spectacular movie just awesome
Sep 14 2019,negative,the spectacular vfx and monster battles couldnt save this movie from incredibly bad story and characters
Sep 14 2019,positive,i guess the ruins being ruined fuqing disappointed me
Sep 14 2019,negative,follows the neverending hollywood trend of special effects movies without a worthwhile story  can someone please match a well plausible and exciting storyline with the deep pockets that produce this garbage 
Sep 14 2019,negative,good effects but a storyline that is a bunch of hollywood left wing self aggrandizing crap titans are the earths own green new deal where one woman gets to decide the fate of billions could have been spectacular instead it was a waste of time and money too bad 
Sep 14 2019,positive,wow  after watching this a second time im even more floored  its just spectacular  all my life i have wanted to see what modern technology could do for godzilla and let me tell you i am not disappointed  the audience score is proof of that
Sep 14 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic  i signed up for rotten tomatoes so i could rate this movie  very well done  
Sep 14 2019,negative,poor writing disappointed with directing and visual efects
Sep 13 2019,positive,wheres the characters from the first godzilla    an ok remake of destroy all monsters 
Sep 13 2019,positive,after a 2nd viewing it wasnt suspenseful and epic as gareth edwards 2014 godzillabut king geedorah was pretty dope and great lookingthe movie had too much sci ficgi stealth bomber glass tablets to completely enjoy itits not perfect but it does succeed at bringing out the monsterssure the story wont be a die hard movie critics fave it still was fun at one point i thought i was watching the avengers or jurassic world fallen kingdom loltry squeezing so many creatures within 2 hours this is what we get tho it had a epic ken watanabe solo scenegodzilla has a scene or two that stole the showactually every scene with the monsters was on point the story was not the greatest or the strong point and the movie was at times hard to see what was going on very dark lookingspoiler alert what happens to the villains at the end and whats up with the new godzilla attack moves some things were left unexplainedif only it would of been directed by gareth edwardshopefully godzilla 3 or kong vs godzilla will be better directed by a better directori give this a overall b or b59 borderline 60 on rtbring on kong vs gojira
Sep 13 2019,positive,well its not what you could call a good movie its a spectacular movie but its let down by its human cast kyle chandler is just awful wooden doesnt even begin to cover it hes either playing it deadpan and im talking dead and buried pan or chewing the scenary hes not alone in his dreadful acting but hes by far the worst offender if theyd have cut every scene with him in it id have rated it 4 stars thats how bad he is  ken watanabe and zhang ziyi are fantastic and manage to save the movie between them    if you want a fun brainless over the top throwaway adventure then this is the movie for you but if you were expecting anything with the depth and messaging of the oiginals youll be sorely disappointed
Sep 13 2019,neutral,not awful but a step down from the 2014 which itself wasnt amazing but good it seems they took the criticism thrown at that film of having not enough godzilla how dare they focus on character lol and ran with itin the wrong way they basically turned this film into transformers with godzilla characters the cgi is mostly subpar and the action sequences are poorly framed and poorly edited the human characters are no more interesting than they have been in any other godzilla film to its credit there are a few cool shots the shot of ghidorah on the mountain towering over the city is beautiful but its too bad they didnt apply the same artistry to the mostly incomprehensible action sequences this movies rt score and audience score difference reminds me why i never listen to audiences 
Sep 12 2019,neutral,having arrived on the scene and dealt with a relatively nondescript giant space bug in his latest american reboot the big green goliath now faces a few tasty morsels from his rogues gallery mothra rodan and king ghidorah to be specific with a whole slew of freshlyconcocted secondary beasts stomping around in the backdrop    these fresh takes on a familiar trio are bold and beautiful magnificent updates on a classic set of character designs matched with an impressive elemental tonesetter or two  ghidorah enveloped by a swirling thunderstorm rodan birthed from the belly of a volcano mothra hibernating beneath the veil of a misty waterfall  the monster effects are breathtaking forboding painterly and mythical in their execution those expertlydirected promo posters that preceded the films release were no ruse the entire movie looks that good a shame then that the story couldnt have been better    even by oldschool godzilla standards this ones a stinker it shouldnt take much effort to shift the scene from one preposterous slice of movie mayhem to another but king of the monsters makes the job look awfully tough from flimsy talking points to onedimensional characters plot cartwheels to scientific handwaves its a universal phonein if the assumption is that nobodys come to watch the little people run around and stress over the monsters thats correct that doesnt mean we wont notice when their motivations stop making sense and their master plan is strung together with scotch tape and twine i wanted to love it and when i managed to stop thinking and gape at the big guys i did but that was only true about fifty percent of the time hence halfcredit
Sep 12 2019,positive,its so good loved every second of it
Sep 12 2019,positive,why arent  malco theaters  listed anyway while i enjoyed seeing my personal hero godzilla again on the american  bigscreen i was disappointed  in most of the human characters dr sarizawa was great as usual but farminga  millie brown were lackluster at best brown particularly did not work well as a pov character in an action movie farmingas character as written had an unrealistic motivation and no real redemptive arc were supposed to feel her fate redeems her as a mass murderer really anyway im on board for godzilla vs kong but i hope we see more of those two than mediocre human characters
Sep 11 2019,positive,ive always loved the godzilla movies even at their worst the main reason for this is that its all about cool monster fights  with a little human side story this movie definitely delivers on the amazing fights and set pieces while yes the human story is a bit lacking its better then past stories which could feel to slow and take people out of the action
Sep 11 2019,positive,is every person in this movie completely suicidal 
Sep 11 2019,positive,sequel didnt come short of godzilla in action  unlike the first pretty decent yet the story of the anime movie planet of monsters  is better 
Sep 11 2019,positive,loved it intense and fun 
Sep 10 2019,positive,all i have to say is that mothra is absolutely baby 
Sep 10 2019,positive,for me the reviews are shocking this is by far one of the best movies ive seen this year 1010 100100 i would go as far to say that i enjoyed this film more than endgame
Sep 10 2019,negative,i have to say this movie was really really bad    i didnt go in with high expectations and after about 20 minutes i was already feeling bored and annoyed and i continued to feel that exact same way all throughout the movie until the end     i even distinctly remember thinking at one point that i had absolutely zero interest in what happened to any of the characters giant monsters included and i felt like i was punishing myself for renting it by making myself sit through it until the end    i am not a movie snob i love a wide range of films i love movies that are just fun for funs sake    if this movie had laughed at itself a bit given its ridiculous origin it may have been ok but it didnt it took itself way too seriously for a movie about a bunch of giant monsters fighting each other on earth     0 out of 10 stars i strongly recommend saving your money
Sep 9 2019,positive,1010 recommend if you want a movie filled with dope monster fights as all godzilla movies should be 
Sep 9 2019,positive,i enjoyed it  there were some cool scenes that made me grin
Sep 9 2019,positive,its the movie what i wanted from monsterverse  
Sep 9 2019,positive,better than the previous godzilla movies i enjoyed it 
Sep 9 2019,neutral,the kids liked it i guess thats enough
Sep 8 2019,positive,the plot is awfull the girl and the woman the worst part of the plot although the monster in other hand are amazing the fight i want to see more of that
Sep 8 2019,positive,the story line is weak omg you have to kidding me its a godzilla movie not gone with the wind the story line was fine and easy to follow no it didnt change me on the inside and yes godzilla still rocks
Sep 8 2019,positive,an interesting installment interesting in the sense that it can be fun depending on the stage that you are in watching it or entertaining theres enough twists to make you stay until the end but the emotional payoff is not as worth it as the monster showdown speaking of monsters could they not hire better people to handle the special effects department you cant always but a blue filter have blizzards or debris bright lights hazy weather to compensate the lack of clear effects i feel like these are the same gripes i had for the first film its 2019 
Sep 8 2019,negative,the action and visual effects are amazing but the story doesnt hold up the only parts that were interesting to me was the action sequences i only recommend this to godzilla fans
Sep 8 2019,positive,i got exactly what i wanted in terms of monster action godzilla mothra rodan and king ghidorah are the true stars of this film and they deserve all the praise in the world for their performances the soundtrack is superb as well  the human elements suck though and make the film seem a lot longer than it actually is
Sep 8 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Sep 8 2019,positive,lots of fun carnage  
Sep 8 2019,positive,i feel voters here did not appreciate this for what it wasan homage to the classic monster movie and honestly it paid that tribute well
Sep 8 2019,neutral,was not ready for a movie that day dozed off in the comfy theater seat have not rented the dvd maybe will use a free night pass to see this again on dvd but probably not
Sep 7 2019,positive,big monsters fight what more could you ask for
Sep 7 2019,neutral,humans are evil creatures destroying the world and need to die so we can save it kind of movie
Sep 7 2019,neutral,great cgi and action but there was bad acting and stupid decisions also really cheesy and too long
Sep 7 2019,positive,i dont know who this franchise made mad but its getting a bad wrap for nothing its a great flick for the monster fight alone and a giant improvement from the first one the actors are used to talk for the monsters true to the source material the plot is a big shot at sjws so what a treat
Sep 7 2019,negative,this is one of the worst movies of all time
Sep 6 2019,negative,worst movie ive ever seen in a theater fastest monsters in the galaxy
Sep 6 2019,negative,dismal id heard it was bad but it was about five times worse than i had imagined what must they have been thinking the story was not just lacking but pretty much absent the special effects are just plain boring by this time cgi has ruined everyones appetite i just do not get how they didnt make a halfway decent movie hire an actual 1954 godzilla fan to make a godzilla movie and leave millie bobbie brown in junior high school where she belongs wretched disappointment overall
Sep 6 2019,positive,the critics have no idea what theyre doing this is easily the best american godzilla movie to date
Sep 6 2019,negative,pretty waist of time   too long full of clichés confusing   finally the actors seem to have forgotten how to act
Sep 6 2019,positive,a prime example of when typical movie critics hide behind the guise of intellect to bash a solid good time king of monsters is by no means an oscarworthy film but its a damn good time the plot was somewhat underwhelming but for a movie about a giant lizard i thought it was pretty well developed every actor was fantastic and the sfx were amazing a very fun movie for kaiju lovers
Sep 6 2019,positive,i believe most reviews are missing the point of what makes these movies awesome because of this film my son has fallen in love with godzilla and wants so much merch and has watched almost all the films not to mention reignited my love for the kaiju genre simply awesome  
Sep 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters wasnt a great film it was an awesome one talk about great action and epic battles its sad that the critics clearly didnt read the movie description the movie is about giant fighting monsters not complicated human storys to summarize the plot spoilers ahead the main character madison russel and her mom along with ecoterrorist jonah alan release multiple titans to return man kind the the proper way they should be they wake up king gidorah aka monster zero who takes control of the other titans ordering them to destroy the world godzilla along with mothra and the pitiful human characters attempt to kill ghidorah and save the world the titan action in this movie is defiantly the best parts ghidorah is really is the golden demise in the movie he is plain evil  as for godzilla he is no less amazing in this movie as in 2014 mothra is just beautiful and rodan is awesome the humans are as plain as bread but they arent exactly boring the main problem with them is that there are too many humans to well develop them as a huge g fan i can look past that however and thats why i love this movie so much godzilla vs kong promises to be a great movie so long as it follows this one in terms of kaiju action long live the king
Sep 6 2019,positive,film is not badit could entertain but it is not so original and of course there are many stupid moment   
Sep 5 2019,negative,an over long mishmash of better godzilla film spliced with elements that would have been more at home in a marvel superhero film 200 million dollar budget gives us a lot of monster battles mostly obscured by snow or rain or smoke or darkness with characters that are utterly disposable totally forgettable and badly written
Sep 5 2019,negative,more kaiju fighting less humans on the screen
Sep 5 2019,negative,this movie brings some baggage from the first one an issue with the lack of interest of people is well deserved because the original film decided to not show godzilla too much and these made people scheptical and therefore they did not want to see it i blame the original script writer and director for this problem and it was difficult to win people back  as to this film it jumped the shark too fast it looks that for the problems with the first one they decided to triple down to bring people back and failed this film has technically two decades of japanese godzilla films lore in it and trying to stick to that lore it failed this movie needed to cut down on monsters and characters and just concentrate on the monster forget human stories especially with kids the worst godzilla films are the ones headlined by kids and hollywood did not understood that  kong island was a good film since it was original but this franchise is dead godzilla vs kong will not reinvigorate this franchise or peoples interest
Sep 5 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this old classic brought back to life 
Sep 5 2019,positive,view it for what it is  a monster movie  and it is a lot of fun  ignore the stuffed shirts and get ready to watch godzilla the way youve always wanted to see him
Sep 4 2019,positive,great animation and special effects very true to the original godzilla moves of old
Sep 4 2019,positive,visually stunning and non stop actions
Sep 4 2019,positive,its another godzilla story meh acting meh graphics pretty good 
Sep 4 2019,positive,didnt care for the human story but seeing giant monsters brawl yeah
Sep 4 2019,negative,visually this movie is awesome sound editing this movie is awesome everything else is a no a big no the story isnt good its cliché stupid and rushed the story isnt as bad as the characters though they were awful the characters were annoying and even more stupid than the story the motives for their actions werent justified and that meant that the interactions with the titans were meaningless they promised more godzilla and we did get that but it came with shaky camera fights that made it hard to follow and just dizzying im very sad with this the first trailer last year got me so excited but it just ended up being too much 
Sep 4 2019,positive,one of the best monsters movie rodan is just a bad ass
Sep 4 2019,positive,great fights cant wait for the next installment 
Sep 4 2019,positive,one of the biggest disappointments of the year the monster fighting is fantastic if you can cut this movie to only contain that youll dig it the human drama drags this thing down like a heavy anchor still theres enough of the former to have made this enjoyable 
Sep 4 2019,positive,absolutely loved it may possibly be the best godzilla movie next to the 1954 original crazy kaiju action a ton of throwbacks and fan service what more could you ask for the king is truly back
Sep 4 2019,positive,this movie proves you never trust eco lefties
Sep 4 2019,positive,much better than the 2014 film and i liked the 2014 film also gotta love all the godzilla music throwbacks
Sep 3 2019,positive,freaking loved this movie watched it 2 times on the big screen and bought it on youtube this movie doesnt deserve the sy scores its been given at all people wanted a flawless perfect story in a monster movie     they never consider the time and money it costs to create the cgi effects for creatures of that scale not to mention many creatures or the budget that michael dougherty had to work with he didnt have disneys fundsliteral billions of dollars but still managed to do the best he could to craft something he loved and wanted to share with fellow fans of the godzilla franchise the plot wasnt nearly as bad as these critics make it out to be it isnt perfect no plot is but it fit for what it was supposed to represent and the monsters especially godzilla were always a joy to see on the screen plenty of screen time and their presence was overwhelming so i say go see it for yourself and enjoy this amazing movie 
Sep 3 2019,positive,i think it was amazing the whole thing was just kaiju battles what a great idea there was story mostly just so the monsters can fight and it was good just not that much of it
Sep 3 2019,positive,great movie it has its faults but overall an entertaining watch
Sep 3 2019,neutral,the action parts were great but the movie was not it has a very poor story and is so much worse than the first one im sure thry will make another one and i really hope it is better than this one
Sep 3 2019,positive,the story was not that compelling to be honest but we got what we asked for from the last one more godzilla more creature feature more action
Sep 3 2019,negative,disappointed only good thing is the cg 
Sep 3 2019,negative,put random chinese into a movie so they can show it in china typical american think they are on top of food chain and rule the whole world some stupid main character think they are so special to put everyone else life under them this kind of movie is just stupid waste time and money to watch
Sep 3 2019,positive,overall enjoyed the movie and story line cgi was pretty impressive as well 
Sep 3 2019,negative,so boring it was like watching a giant lizard walk around for a half an hour even though it didnt even come on to land for 40 minutes into the movie and also it is two and a half hours
Sep 2 2019,positive,rotten tomatoes is cancer  long live the king 
Sep 2 2019,positive,fantastic the fact that the last jedi has over a 90 shows how far this site is out of balance 
Sep 2 2019,positive,an absolute must see for all monster movie fans
Sep 2 2019,positive,was ok nice graphics but overall meh
Sep 2 2019,positive, i think this movie has lessons  take care of your planet dont take your daughter down a dangerous path make smart decisions 
Sep 2 2019,negative,story was weak and action scenes were too dark or too close to enjoy 
Sep 2 2019,positive,the actors and actresses did an amazing job and the plot was very good but somethings didnt always make sense
Sep 2 2019,negative,this movie was incomprehensible and stupid it  was incompetently written and directed the action and destruction scenes were fun and aweinspiring  and definitely expensive  but it would have been better if more time and talent was spent on the story and characters    update this movie is garbage 
Sep 2 2019,positive,absolutely amazing loved every second of it 
Sep 2 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time  its like some moron said giant monsters fighting is cool but what if we added a bunch of crap on screen and shook the camera so people will hate it
Sep 2 2019,negative,how this got a single positive review is beyond me i went in hoping it would be a terrible but enjoyable movie but this thing was just awful im honestly shocked it got 41
Sep 2 2019,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen 
Sep 1 2019,positive,great film that made me feel like a kid again as someone who grew up on godzilla its a great adaptation that pays great tribute to the godzilla franchise with a great cast and great director we are given a film that is amazing to watch for all ages as this film can work as an introduction to the godzilla universe for newcomers 
Sep 1 2019,positive,not even the shitty human characters can take away from the epic fights
Sep 1 2019,positive,ive been so excited for this movie to come out at the box and  disappointed with the known actors in this movie i would have expected better acting 
Sep 1 2019,positive,i loved this myself  im surprised by the mixed reaction it got to me this is the first nonjapanese attempt at a godzilla film that got everything right i watched it again on blu ray this week and thoroughly enjoyed it again long live the king indeed
Sep 1 2019,neutral,dull and repetitive i missed about half the movie and still managed to grok the simplistic plot quite well
Sep 1 2019,positive,amazing special effects 
Sep 1 2019,positive,the characters are not explained enough and there wouldve been more epic monster fights which make the movie experience slightly weird it is not good but not bad just an average movie it is what i expected epic monster fights intense scenes and amazing cgi in general not a scam
Sep 1 2019,positive,the cast is great the movie actually has a more advanced godzilla story and the cgi is so cool from the monsters to the background of destroyed cities godzilla king of monsters is one of the better godzilla movies  93
Sep 1 2019,neutral,absolutely horrible plot i mean one of the worst ever for the godzilla franchise countless times in the movie where instead of running away from the monsters death and destruction the actors would just stand there and actually move closer to watch and stare lol the cgi was pretty amazing however and it didnt explain how the world would survive with all of the monsters now awoken this movie probably would have been cool to watch in imax but i would have been pissed about spending 17 on such a crap movie bluray is fine 
Sep 1 2019,positive,awesome great monster action
Sep 1 2019,positive,amazing movie even better than godzilla 2014 and kong skull island long live the monsterverse
Sep 1 2019,negative,i went into this movie with high anticipation for it and was very excited however it let me down greatly the plot was terrible and made next to no sense the only good thing about this movie was the cgi which wasnt the best almost like the detective pikachu movie
Aug 31 2019,neutral,decent last fight but the story wasnt special actors did their best with what they had imho
Aug 31 2019,positive,i loved it super fun movie as long as you dont take it seriously you will definitely enjoy just remember that it is a godzilla movie 
Aug 31 2019,positive,best monster movie ever can wait for the god to put it to the king
Aug 31 2019,positive,movie was amazing it was truly for the fans the visuals were spectacular sure it couldve had better human development but it overall compensated from the 2014s lack of titan fights
Aug 31 2019,positive,so is this a good movie yes is this a worthy movie to watch yes if you want to see godzilla this is the movie godzilla king of the monsters is really not a masterpiece or generic but there are so many spectacular scenes in the form of giant monsters and natural disasters exposition performance there is a potential but they all throw it away ive also watched kong skull island and sure enough we just cant wait godzilla vs kong 
Aug 31 2019,negative,for this sequel to godzilla the storyline shines through a clap back to how we have treated the environment however this alone cannot carry a movie all by itself the emotion is forced by the writers and the characters struggle to make it work if you enjoy seeing creatures that are beyond imagination and action then this is the movie for you although that is all you can expect from this film 
Aug 31 2019,negative,dumb crap i stopped watching about 23 of the way through to give this 1 star  tywin lannister was pretty cool though
Aug 30 2019,positive,weirdinconsistent character motivations aside therere lots of bombastic monster battles in this movie and thats what were here for not as solid as the previous two films in this franchise but doesnt ruin it either
Aug 30 2019,positive,it served its purpose as a dumb fun monster movie the human parts could be a bit bland but the monster action and fanservice were absolutely amazing 
Aug 30 2019,negative,one star for the monsters and one star for millie bobby brown boring and predictable i enjoy good crap but this movie is just crap disappointed 
Aug 30 2019,positive,great monster fighting fun once the monsters start going at eachother the movie really kicks off
Aug 30 2019,positive,i thought it was really good they did cram a little too many of the different titans in it but other than that it was good reading through a lot of the bad reviews on here are from people who should not even be posting on this movie some of them sound like idiots who apparently do not really know the story of godzillaone reviewer said i dont know why they chose this character as the main them speaking of godzillaits like seriously they chose him as the main cause in that universe he is the main character people like that give great movies like this bad scores cause they think they are movie buffs but they dont read up or even study a character of a movie before or after watching all in all its a great movie it paid a lot of the main titans good respect of what they were 
Aug 30 2019,negative,one word review ludicrous not the monsters just everything else especially the unbearable story and the dialogs its not that i wasnt expecting exactly that i just need to use the one star button once and again 
Aug 30 2019,positive,the third movie in the american monarch godzilla series this movie stands out as it defines the the godzilla creatures renamed titans  rodan mothra and king ghidora are by far the best iterations of these original iconic toho monsters  while the socalled experts may have not rated this movie well it is obvious they are not true fans  this movie returns to the original intent of toho to have each movie both a continuation of the storyline while each a successful standalone story in its own right  this movie delivers not only continues of the of the monarch story line but furthers the overall toho legend  as a standalone story it delivers action monsters and everything else we have come to expect from a great toho movie without benefit of a rubber suit  i look forward to the next movie in the franchise
Aug 29 2019,positive,great godzilla flick though im not entirely sold on the whole ecoterrorist plot though at least they arent from planet x
Aug 29 2019,negative,lousy noisy big mess poor acting poor script messy effects
Aug 29 2019,positive,it is cool amazing nice this is gonna be my favorite movie
Aug 29 2019,neutral,despite a good cast and impressive cgi the bad writing and all the nonsense make it hard to enjoy
Aug 28 2019,negative,reaffirms that cuttingedge effects are still no substitute for a good story did they watch the same movie i did because i had a completely different experience it relies on special effects for substance and even those were meh i went into it knowing it would be two hours of big cgi monsters fighting duh but what really got to me was the eyerollingly stupid dialogue and forced plot devices all of the characters should have sacrificed themselves in order to save the movie going public from a sequel which unfortunately is on the table if you stayed long enough to watch the postcredits scene look i know this is just a movie but for me it was a tipping point almost every movie that ive seen over the last year or two has been terrible i love movies but i feel like im constantly disappointed with these soulless lifeless cash grabs and you know what hollywood knows that ill always come back for more ugh
Aug 28 2019,positive,enjoyed it looking forward for the next one
Aug 28 2019,positive,amazing fight scenes badass
Aug 28 2019,positive,a true cheesy movie on the human side and an utter joy when the monsters do battle which was far more violent than i expected well worth checking out 95 10 drunkstoned score 710 sober score
Aug 28 2019,positive,wow what a fun freaking movie non stop joyride i loved the direction this movie took the monsterverse cant wait for kong vs godzilla 
Aug 28 2019,positive,cool monsters battling it out muddled by bad writing and murky cinematography    michael doughertys monster action thriller godzilla king of the monsters 2019 is a mixed bag of killer monster combat of a massive scale muddled by embarrassing writing and muddy cinematography the plot is barebone setup for the later monster battles with a nauseating family drama shoved in there for some melodrama you lose all sympathy for the family after its revealed the mother is trying to end all human life and let the monsters take over audiences tend to zone out if one of the heroes desires genocide if only they had focused in on a story involving the people that gave some kind of weight to the fisticuffs with godzilla doughertys direction is apt for the most part but could have been reigned in to focus the human plot into something more clever and coherent while streamlining the monster fights into less of a cluster of random encounters    first of all the lighting is often so dark that you cannot see any of the action for the amount of money they invested in godzillas cgi youd think theyd want you to actually see all the monsters at least its better than godzilla 2014 teasing monster battles then cutting before any action when you can see whats happening the battles are a brawl of all godzillas most legendary foes its a fun movie marred by strange choices like the dark lighting ash cgi everywhere and cinematography that shoves the camera too close to the action to clearly witness to main event    aside from all the baffling visual decisions the music is triumphant i really like bear mccrearys remixes to classic godzilla themes and melodies when godzilla rises out of the ocean after his resurrection all in blue electric light regalia and mccrearys pounding theme you are sincerely astonished by how cool this all is in reality godzillas swimming is fun his laser is dope his punches powerful and his walking iconic king ghidorah gets a bit of personality with his expressive triple heads devastating lightning breath and tremendous wingspan his presence is engaging whether he sweeps in with his titanic wings similar to rodans wind causing wing flaps youll just have to see the monster combat for yourself as its the whole reason for watching godzilla king of the monsters    i am seriously impressed by how eclectic the casting for godzilla king of the monsters is in totality  kyle chandler is the real hero here he is believable as a grieving father doting father skeptical researcher and creative leader vera farmiga does her best to create an emotional mother grief stricken by the loss of her son turned into a mad scientist she displays genuine sorrow even in godzillas most ridiculous scenes millie bobby brown is pretty realistic despite not getting nearly anything to do    ken watanabe brings the spirit of classic japanese godzilla films with themes like environmental protection climate change respecting nature and appreciating animals all home he delivers a rather touching tribute to the franchise as his genuinely thoughtful scientist zhang ziyi similarly declares herself still a brilliant actress of empathy and intrigue with her historical and mythological researcher reminding the audience of godzillas lore sally hawkins is loving and empathetic as usual as her doctor character she finds a way to sympathize whether its with chandlers hurting father or godzillas existential perspective sally hawkins is just a wonderful actress who makes a nice impression with her little screen time    bradley whitford is wasted on awkward punchlines just like the talented thomas middleditch relegated to weird background guy charles dance does nothing but be dumb and say odd catchphrases he is completely wasted maybe more than anyone also he somehow survives despite starting out as the main villain that it unless i literally forgot what happened oshea jackson jr gets several funny lines i think they just shove david straithairn in there as a general for maybe three lines so i hope he got paid big at least    if you can stomach bland writing mediocre storytelling dim lighting awkward cinematography then are treated to some serious performances radiant scoring and intense duels with godzilla himself i genuinely loved seeing godzilla blast king ghidorah with his blue laser or mothra taking on rodan
Aug 28 2019,negative,what a horrible movie and thats coming from someone who mostly liked godzilla 1998 godzilla 2014 was so thoughtful so well constructed written and really respected the source material kotm just turns it right back into a joke with badly written story dialogue and tons of patronizing from the director i mean god they spend like 10 minutes on a scene trying to get the bay doors open on an airplane thats what i paid to see in a godzilla movie it had absolutely nothing to say no substance and even the monster fight scenes so well choreographed in 2014 they took my breath away are nothing but quick collisions then rapid cutaways to the same twohundred slow pan gasping reactions that somehow dont differ even slightly from every single actor in the production the only good one was that one in the rain from millie bobby brown i love monster movies and this just is not it totally ruins the series while delivering every boring box office trope with no substance and no respect for the audience or for filmmaking the people who made this should never be allowed to make films again
Aug 27 2019,positive,i liked the monster bits
Aug 27 2019,positive,the talking to the monsters bit is a little dumb but if you came to watch kaiju fight each other this is your movie
Aug 27 2019,positive,do not listen to the critics this movie is a true masterpiece of epic proportions the plot makes perfect sense and the monsters are on the screen for just the right amount of time to please any viewer 
Aug 27 2019,negative,bad writing bad acting bad monster battles bad 
Aug 26 2019,positive,really really wanted to like this more  vera is a favoritebut something about making the survival of the earth the crux of the story takes all godzillas shine away
Aug 26 2019,negative,this movie was hugely disappointing its dialogue was cliched and its buildup was terrible it had cliche jump scares and it was simply terrible sorry
Aug 26 2019,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters is filled with godzilla action and fight scenes are very well shot but the problem is the acting which is decent and the story is simple and can sometimes have things happen out of nowhere but overall its a fun time at the movies and a watch if youre interested but ill go with a 710
Aug 26 2019,positive,i like rodan vs jets scene very much and have watched the scene again and again when i first watched the movie i was so excited and rushed into the ticket office soon after watching the movie to buy the ticket for the movie which starts within 30 minutes
Aug 26 2019,negative,pardon my french but this movie was pretty shit the characters were bland and horribly written as well as there being a terrible story the production and acting was decent but this movie really suffers from its characters i cant believe the audience score is at 83    edited
Aug 26 2019,positive,absolutely amazing follows the original story so much 
Aug 26 2019,positive,i loved all of the great monster action in this amazing film while the story was mediocre at best the rest if the movie was amazing
Aug 25 2019,positive,its perfect 50 human drama and 50 monsters titans
Aug 25 2019,positive,i thought this was a good movie as opposed to 2014s version im surprised the critics gave it such a low rating godzilla looked amazing and the fight scenes were great i personally think that they did a pretty good job cant wait to see what they do with king kong
Aug 25 2019,negative,horrible lines and plot were just terrible
Aug 25 2019,positive,all hail the king godzilla
Aug 24 2019,positive,its a great movie and its some of the best female characters ive seen in years and some of the stupidest people the movie is pretty great all the way through but it is impossible to feel anything for the biggest mass murderer in all of history
Aug 24 2019,positive,it has improved a lot on the first installment and i absolutely enjoyed it full of surprises awe and little non sense no time is wasted in pointless fillers we dont care about and you can feel the race against time let them fight
Aug 24 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is the second installment of godzilla series starring vera farmiga dr emma russell millie bobby brownmadison russell kyle chandlermark russell and ken watanabedr serizawa the film is also the third installment in  legendary pictures monster verse the movie is set 5 years after the events of the first film the government wants to terminate the godzilla the monarch is held responsible for the destruction caused in the first film but when a rogue organization starts to wake up monsters throughout the world the only hope to save humanity is godzilla  the film is visually stunning the film is enriched with the best cgi and vfx ever used in any previous installments the fight scenes between godzilla and ghidorah are the best part of the film  but unlike the first part there are many plot holes in this part the film seems illogical at some points the main characters are very lucky death cannot touch them even ghidorah despite being so strong is not able to kill a single main character of the film  also the character development was very poor  the film also beautifully depicts the relationship between godzilla and humans millie bobby brown and ken watanabes acting is impressive other characters are forgettable  overall godzilla king of monsters is an average but visually stunning movie if you are a fan of monster movies and want to enjoy good vfx this movie is for you do not expect much from the movie and you will enjoy it
Aug 24 2019,positive,it is a great movie  although it kinda missess that oof  although i hope they do a kind of more btter job at godzilla vs kong next year  and i bet we will se mecha ghidorah soon due to the teaser at the end credits
Aug 24 2019,negative,the strory is corny af  hate madison she shouldnt had many scenes in this film
Aug 24 2019,positive,all hail the king long live the king
Aug 23 2019,positive,really enjoyed this movie ignore the critics if they were so special amongst humanity they would be making movies themselves since they have no talent they sit in judgement of those who do why does their opinion matter
Aug 23 2019,positive,i want this movie to be a 100
Aug 23 2019,positive,let me just say this this film is not flawless ive seen some of the deleted scenes and if they let them stay this movie couldve shown more character development which is what makes this movie suffer the most but let me just say that no other film this year so far made me want to keep going to the movies to see it ive loved godzilla ever since i was a kid this movie was made for people who love godzilla the cinematography and cgi is almost flawless i can watch the action scenes in this movie alone all day long i still get goosebumps when i see the fan service moments if you love godzilla this movie is for you
Aug 23 2019,negative,boring  they tried to shoehorn a really bad story about some guy trying to reconnect with his family  if they focused on the monsters it might have been watchable  i fell asleep twice trying to get through this
Aug 23 2019,positive,amazing actors especially vera 
Aug 22 2019,positive,im a huge godzilla fan and i honestly loved this movie i could just feel the love that the director and writers have for this franchise the action the effects the music gold stars to bear mccreary for incorporating the original japanese themes of both godzilla and mothra into the score the designs of the monsters especially mothra  rodan are beautifully brought into this universe king ghidorah looks quite terrifying in some shots  i honestly hope that we get to see more of the original monsters that appeared in this installment of the monsterverse are all just phenomenal yeah the human characters arent perfect but thats to be expected in a kaiju movie even as a huge fan of the character i openly admit that this is not a perfect movie but it is within arms reach of being a perfect godzilla movie and that is more than enough for me if youre a fan of giant monster movies or even just monster movies in general i highly recommend that you check out this magnificent movie
Aug 22 2019,neutral,visually pleasing but you feel like punching the female lead in the face every 3 seconds 
Aug 22 2019,positive,loved everything about this movie cant wait for dvd release so hyped for it 100 percent kaiju film
Aug 22 2019,positive,it was amazing  great as a godzilla fan i really enjoy the movie worth to watch it 
Aug 22 2019,positive,making a big scifi movie comes with lots of responsibilities and risks that you cant really imagine when the films like alien jurassic park original one set the examples  its understandable to be under immense pressure as a filmmaker    the previous godzilla installment was an asthetically beautiful hauntingly shot movie but lack of monster time created huge fuss between the fans many of them were disappointed to see their favorite godzilla having a very short screen time    this time it seems like the makers took the criticism well and made this a fan favourite flick but in the process  they ignored all the other important aspects as well    graphically it was intense the cgi felt breathtaking sound design and background score were brilliant too but its the human part that bothered me a lot    poorly written story where the motives and the actions dont make sense the dialogues are not engaging enough it didnt help building the connection with the on screen actors at all the human characters had shown less personality than the monster counterparts the titans had much depth into their characteristics we actually care more about the titans here than the humans although millie bobbie brown was good in her role as maddison along with dr serizawa except them every other character seemed bland and unlikable i couldnt have care less    in the end if you are a true godzilla fan then dont worry  it knows what you want it delivered on the fan service pretty well but if you are looking for a story or more indepth approach into other things then you will surely be disappointed    but as an avid godzilla fan i enjoyed it
Aug 22 2019,positive,good drama  who cares  monsters fighting all the movie the only thing i wanted to see  tho it would have been better if they added more monsters plz  
Aug 22 2019,positive,liked it for what wasthe 10 year old in me was very pleased
Aug 22 2019,positive,a highly recommendable movie for any godzilla fan past or present ghidorah is represented beautifully in this film however the character development was lacking
Aug 22 2019,positive,not a masterpiece but absolutely great fun i had a smile the whole movie best monster movie ever give me more please
Aug 21 2019,positive,thought it was a great followup to the 2014 outing filled with strong characters and story i loved it
Aug 21 2019,positive,if youre a kaiju fan youre going to love this movie    you know what youre getting into when you go and see a godzilla movie dont give me that oh but the human actors were bad garbage yeah its true  they were not great but you go to see the monsters and the monster parts were amazing
Aug 21 2019,negative,they where not sure if the would get promission to make a third movie so they cramped everything and then some into this movie wich probably made it true this was a mess it did not hold up to the prequel 
Aug 21 2019,negative,glad that movie is over with actors did a good job special effects folks did a good job the story was just flat out terrible hard to watch 
Aug 21 2019,positive,a scattered yet somewhat visually engaging sequel that shouldve been executed way better than the first film but wasnt
Aug 21 2019,positive,a cinematic masterpiece  dont listen to all the other brainless idiots on this website this movie was an absolute thrill its perfect for godzilla fans and is stuffed full of action sure it lacked in the human acting department but who gives a shit its a fucking monster movie no one cares about the humans  
Aug 21 2019,negative,its not even the plot that doesnt make sense the character decisions made no sense the rules of power shift depend on convenience     sfx is great just wished they would cut out all the nonsense and stick to the action
Aug 21 2019,positive,the critics can shove it this was a fantastic movie top of the line    
Aug 21 2019,positive,was expecting the movie would be horrible but it changed my mind 
Aug 20 2019,positive,you wanted more time with monsters and you got it
Aug 20 2019,negative,pretty boring wasnt really interesting and had predictable plot
Aug 20 2019,neutral,was expecting it to be bad and yes it was but the lead kid made it ok plus im a sucker for crazy big proportions fx
Aug 20 2019,positive,great critics are full of it
Aug 19 2019,positive, well the sense of scale and build up werent quite on par with the 2014 reboot    the cast overall was more entertaining then the 2014 film though most of them lack development the worst offender for me was charles dances character great actor no doubt about it but if they go through the trouble of adding a human antagonist they could have atleast spent some time on him    that being said now dmmit maybe its the godzilla fanboy in me but this movie was awesome the monsters were glorious both in design and in portrayal    rodan may disappoint some people he looks awesome but hes pretty much just there to get beaten up by ghidorah and mothra and then just bow down to godzilla    mothra like godzilla is all about maintaining balance and while the other monsters submit to ghidorah she is the one that remains loyal to godzilla and aids him in the end    ghidorah has never been more terrifying and im glad they kept him an alien like in most incarnations its like godzillas the true ruler of the planet and ghidorahs an invader whos come to usurp him as king of the monsters and claim the earth for himself it was interesting that they gave each head a mind of its own and somewhat different personalities    godzillas the alpha predator that keeps the other monsters inline and as i said above ghidorahs the attempted usurper that godzilla sees as a threat to himself and the worldatlarge    the action visuals and music were absolutely stunning not only does this movie have significantly more action scenes then the previous films but godzillas design is slightly revamped hes even taller then he was in the 2014 film standing 393 feet compared to his previous 355 feet his dorsal plates are closer to their traditional maple leaf shape they added some of the classic godzillas roars to the 2014 version they added a new cover of the classic godzilla theme from tohos films along with a cover of blue oyster cults classic godzilla song that plays during the credits     overall i wouldnt call it better then the 2014 film inspite of its fan service but i like it about the same  
Aug 19 2019,positive,criticbig monsters they scarer me no like movie 
Aug 19 2019,positive,this film definitely makes up for the lack of monster action in the previous installment the story isnt perfect not by a long shot but if you want major kaiju action then this film delivers
Aug 19 2019,positive,some dialogs sound like they were made by japanese and then translated to english    overall quite good movie in godzilla lore world 
Aug 19 2019,positive,perfect godzilla movie if you didnt like the movies then you shouldnt be rating a godzilla movie
Aug 19 2019,positive,it was a really good godzilla movie for fans 
Aug 19 2019,positive,awesome movie i think it was way better than the first one but couldve had more believable seens
Aug 18 2019,positive,it is so amazing it is my favorite movie such good action goes straight into the action i love that about it
Aug 18 2019,positive,fun monster movie with lots of thrills and action 
Aug 18 2019,positive,has some good moments but for a movie thats primarily about giant monsters fighting and smashing things its ultimately dragged down by way too much melodrama between the mediocre human characters
Aug 18 2019,positive,by far the best movie of 2019
Aug 18 2019,positive,mama mia what is this
Aug 18 2019,positive,this is one of the best kaiju movies ever the movie doesnt need a story to tell just a good monster fight for the fans everywhere in the world 
Aug 18 2019,positive,i finally watched godzilla kotm  and as expected it was a godzilla movie  big monsters doing big monster things  and as monster movies go the humans were awful  for me bradley whitfords character was annoying af   charles dance didnt work for me either  but overall it was an entertaining movie
Aug 18 2019,positive,amazing favorite movie from the monster verse loved everything especially the battles beautiful cine
Aug 18 2019,positive,this movie was exactly what you want from a godzilla movie the characters were not the best but they were certainly good enough to move the plot and i quite enjoyed many of them but by far the monsters action and music stand out this thing is the best american monster movie ever put to film dont listen to those critics they hate godzilla by definition and sit around with their thumbs up their butt besides most of them are probably paid out by disney anyways
Aug 18 2019,positive,freaking amazing some parts seem unrealistic like there is no  blood where there  should be but still good
Aug 18 2019,positive,what pisses me off about people hating on this movie is that they fail to realize that godzilla movies while most of the time are about the kaiju fights its also about the human characters and what part they play in it if you hate this movie you can kiss my fat white and hairy buttocks 
Aug 17 2019,positive,an action packed and adventurous sequel combined with doughertys direction the script he cowrote with borenstein and shields the performances of the cast mccrearys score shers cinematography the editing by ducsay barton and pearson chamblisss production design serinos set decoration mingenbachs costume design action sequences sound design and visual effects godzilla king of the monsters is a worthy followup to gareth edwards monster hit
Aug 17 2019,positive,just plain amazing and glorious
Aug 17 2019,positive,according to many critics the film is bad because of its scenario but as a fan of kaijus and the monsterverse i can only recommend it the film is impressive beautiful the music are  beautiful and impressive although humans are too often put forward this film is a real gift for people like me
Aug 17 2019,negative,worst movie ive ever watched
Aug 17 2019,positive,spectacular critics honestly need to rewatch the older movies and learn what a proper godzilla movie is i mean come on some are even saying that the infamous 98 movie was better i feel sick
Aug 17 2019,positive,monsters monsters monsters shitty human stuff more monsters epic music and action scenes its perfect 
Aug 17 2019,positive,really awesome movie if you dont care about story there is literally no plot the actors are robots with the worst dialog i am not joking its really bad i grew up with godzilla so i am a huge fan i went into this movie hoping to just see godzilla fight monsters and the movie did not disappoint the monster fights scenes are awesome truly beautiful and really shows the massive scale of the creatures but just dont go into this movie thinking you will have a interesting story or character development or plot twists nope none just skip over the humans talking and watch the monsters 
Aug 17 2019,positive,sure the story lacks and the human actors tend to be lame but man are the monster mash fights awesome seeing godzilla and ghidorah go at its just too much fun if that works for you of course 
Aug 16 2019,neutral,for the most part the action sequences are lost in shaky cameras and jittery editing constantly hidden by storm and night king of the monsters completely fails to conjure any sense of awe about its creatures except the threeheaded dragon ghidorah the roars of creatures are more convinced than the plot the movie is built around something called the orca a biosonar machine that can talk to the animals the specialist vera farmiga who developed orca and used it she had a lot of turns in her character in the film which was so silly also her daughter still underage who surprised all the audience by using orca at some moments of the film anyone can tell me how she knew how to use this hightech machine its never made sense    the final fight between godzilla  ghidorah is same as the final fight in the previous part of godzilla in 2014 it looks like repetitive scene besides the other creatures that pop up less than a minute without any information about what theyre capable to do    godzilla king of the monsters is unsatisfying you can find some exciting moments but mostly is disappointing the previous part godzilla in 2014 is completely better than this one especially with the legend of acting bryan cranston
Aug 16 2019,positive,good movie exciting good action and monsters fighting  what else do you want from a movie  plot development is week still enjoyed the action  
Aug 16 2019,positive,yeah the human characters and plot are bad and the movie seems to focus on them a tad bit more then monsters but this isnt the first godzilla film that has had that flaw not to mention the monster action definitely makes up for it you must be pretty pretentious if you watch a giant monster movie for the human characters anyway
Aug 16 2019,positive,honestly sometimes it doesnt matter what movie critics think the fights were so awesome and thats exactly what the audience ate up excitedly
Aug 16 2019,positive,as a kid i really think that this movie is awesome despite some animation flaws like the cringy run and the dead right arm swing but overall its entertaining and fun to watch
Aug 16 2019,negative,what a terrible movie too much sfx and human story soo got season 8
Aug 16 2019,positive,visually fantastic exactly what a monster movie should be lacks human connection but cool easter eggs and monster origin explanations makes up for it
Aug 16 2019,negative,nothing to care about  no investment in any of the characters  cgi nonsense   if you enjoyed pacific rim you probably might not entirely hate this
Aug 16 2019,negative,uneven match of really outstanding visual artistry and effects with a ludicrously bad story  made me appreciate what gareth edwards did with 2014 godzilla even more that was a really cohesive movie that consciously struck a particular tone very well and used its monster moments to much much greater effect
Aug 15 2019,positive,decent movie effects and plot were above the norm and it kept me awake lol i would recommend going to see this movie by the way my son thought it was great
Aug 15 2019,positive,having grown up alongside the toho movies as a weekend treat king of the monsters delivered the same rush of excitement and anticipation on top of some fantastic visuals and epic fight scenes sure the human story falls flat at times but as someone who watched this movie to see old favorites like mothra rodan ghidorah and the big g himself fight it out with the world at stake i was both immensely satisfied and thoroughly entertained a must watch for any old school toho and monsterkaiju fans alike 
Aug 15 2019,positive,the best movie of 2019 summer by far 
Aug 15 2019,positive,it was absolutely amazing a must see
Aug 15 2019,negative,please dont make more movies like this total wastage of time 
Aug 15 2019,positive,i enjoyed it  it was fun  
Aug 15 2019,negative,terrible very poor screenplay
Aug 15 2019,neutral,as the 3rd installment of the monsterverse godzilla king of the monsters delivers a loud citywrecking monster madness with human characters just doing human things the cryptozoological agency monarch faces off against a battery of godsized monsters including the mighty godzilla who collides with mothra rodan and his ultimate nemesis the threeheaded king ghidorah as soon as the movie fades in things just started happening very quickly i thought action sequences were very solidly executed  especially this huge aerial chase sequence in mexico the first act had a decent build up but godzilla only showed up halfway through the movie as usual for disaster movies like this i was not invested in the human characters at all we usually get a cliched military dialogue after the movie ended i was thinking to myself that this felt a first draft of the screenplay they had five years to make this movie and theres no way they only had one of the draft of the films screenplay the second act was so damn slow and boring and there wasnt enough monster action until the very end of the movie i almost fell asleep i wished the action sequences had more wide shots to make them more comprehensible i didnt enjoy it a lot still excited for godzilla vs kong 59810
Aug 14 2019,negative,stupid stupid movie how much money and talent wasted
Aug 14 2019,positive,a few things really bothered me about this movie firstly this movie made little no use of the incredible array of actors they had cast zhang ziyi and charles dance most notably the animation and special effects were stunning but it was such a huge focus that i couldnt get a feel for the characters then weve got vera farmiga sparking the conflict by going ecoterrorist and you expect me to buy that remarkable animation lousy writing and use of actors 
Aug 14 2019,negative,the movie touches on the cliché subject that humans are the disease of our world this idea is the whole driving force behind a womanmom that lost her son a few years ago to simply murder billions of people and animals     this idea itself is ofcourse not totally undoable for example avengers infinity war was able to pull it off perfectly the problem lies within the character development of that woman you could compare it with albert einstein trying to prove the earth is flat it would just never happen    this made the movie totally unrealistic and that fact alone was enough to pull me completely out of the movie without ever getting back into it all i could do was wonder who came up with such a sloppy excuse 
Aug 14 2019,positive,this is a monster movie plain and simple the characters are one note or are simply cardboard cutouts of characters even if the performances are fine the actors in this movie all do well enough with what they are given with in the end though its about godzilla and the other kaijuu and this movie brings great action with truly epic fights and moments i walked out of the theater happy although i have my questions about the future of this monsterverse 
Aug 14 2019,negative,for me personally no amount of monster action could compensate for a weak story its a soulless no brains monster movie one that i couldnt wait to finish 25 
Aug 14 2019,positive,this movie is epic love the new monsterverse 
Aug 14 2019,neutral,if you like monster movies and great special effects this movie has it multiple monsters besides our favorite monster godzilla we have mothra rodan monster zero and more monsters destroying world cities fighting each other and causing mayhem around the world   as far as actors vera farmiga headlines this latest adaptation we also have kyle chandler bradley whitford charles dance aisha hinds and more   the movie is 2 hrs 11 minutes i will admit there is action early and in the middle but the last 30 minutes is actionpacked   stephen colbert every couple of months does a feature where he goes to a 1st or 2ndgrade classroom and gets a dozen or so 6yearold kids to come up with a movie plot they discuss the storyline and various scenes in the movie and stephen gets some of his friends to actually make a 3 minute or so movie based on the story as put together by the kids   i think stephen and his kids are behind the screenplay and storyline of this movie the plot and screenplay are juvenile ridiculous and silly senseless some of the actions by the characters are so idiotic it reminded me of scenes from a slasher movie where the soon to be victim does what has been done 187 times in previous movies and that is goes downstairs into a dark room hears a noise knowing there is a killer on the loose and asks is anybody there weve seen this stupid behavior before while this scene isnt in the movie there are dozens of scenes just as stupid  if you can manage to ignore the idiocy and just enjoy seeing tall buildings crumble as monsters duke it out then maybe youll like this movie but dont expect anything interesting other than good special effects 
Aug 14 2019,negative,im sorry but this movie was terrible horrible plot it was like warching a cartoon avoid this movie at all cost
Aug 14 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters delivers with beautiful visual effects striking action and nonstop kaiju entertainment while the main story characters arent the most compelling they planted enough good actors together to get to the finish line with class 
Aug 13 2019,positive,seen this move a ton of times and today just got my preorder copy on google moves cant wait for the next movie
Aug 13 2019,positive,this movie are epic n for the true godzilla fans we come to the theater for monster not for human n the director give that to us
Aug 13 2019,positive,this movie is a mustsee for any childhood kaiju film lover seriously i wont give any spoilers but the movie amends all of the mistakes of the dreadful 2014 rendition of godzilla this film allows plenty of monster scenes amazing fights interesting takes on the monsters origins as well as paying homage to the toho franchise through the music scores and hidden easter eggs the human plot is lacking and there are some moments that rub you wrong any moments with bradley whitfords character but remember that you came here to see kaiju not human plot if you watch this movie with no expectations which i did after 2014 you should be very pleasantly surprised when you see your childhood strike to life again i bought the dvd and hope you will too
Aug 13 2019,positive,i bacame a child again with this movie remembering the all movies but this time with the actual cgi  
Aug 13 2019,negative,one of the protagonists pulls a thanos and inevitably kills about just as many people thatd be fine for a clear antagonist for someone whos conviction can bear the weight of such a choice this is not the case here at no point are we ever asked to much less expected to empathizeto sympathizewith thanos its clear that his goal in all its rationality is devoid of all humanityand thats why it works godzilla king of the monsters doesnt quite understand this relationship doesnt understand that saving a billion people doesnt just mean sacrificing a billion more but a billion and one the protagonist loses nothing while throwing millions into the pit and somehow the directors still give us loveydovey scenes of ecohitler and her family as if there could be any redemption for her after such an inhumane act throw on that over an hour of the movie is centered on this character and her relationships and were left with the equivalent of two hours of concentrationcamp footage with brief interludes trying to explain how hitler had the very best of intentions to which i say uh no thanks
Aug 13 2019,positive,it was pretty good i like they fight scenes although they could be longer i love the designs for the new creatures id love to see it again
Aug 13 2019,positive,it helps if you remember the monsters from the movies decades ago but if not you can figure out most of them and which are good or bad exciting though 
Aug 12 2019,positive,great move like the old school shows
Aug 12 2019,positive,my brother likes this movie so if you think this movie is bad than fuck you bitch
Aug 12 2019,positive,didnt care for the plot but goddam the monster are absolutely amazing
Aug 11 2019,positive,this movie was great i loved it so much i definitely recommend it better than the first it had its flaws but this godzilla gets a b
Aug 11 2019,positive,i like it so much cause they finally gave us a movie that features more monster action than human drama and alsoit proves that some people are dumb or more cause of the i need human dramalike my frikin god it a monster movieit fits perfectlyits just that people are mostly to drama without any action and it has its own monsterverse which is like the marvel universe and its coolalso for the criticsthis movie is for godzilla fansnot for journalists and critic reviewers who dont understand it genre and concept
Aug 11 2019,positive,its godzilla nothing else needs to be said  good movie as well
Aug 11 2019,positive,rotten tomatoes got this one wrong loved godzilla
Aug 11 2019,positive,i hate critics who say 2014 was better then this this is great
Aug 10 2019,positive,really good its a must see especially in theaters better than endgame not that endgame was bad
Aug 9 2019,positive,this film was clearly made by godzilla fans for godzilla fans so it obviously isnt for everyone still this was a thrill to watch from beginning to end rather than opting for the slow build  to an epic conclusion which edwards tried dougherty decided to put kaiju fights throughout the film the classic monsters look better than ever and the special effects are spectacular making for a visually stunning movie i do wish they could have focused a little more on the story but the story itself is passable as are the characters who have a lot more life and depth to them than the protagonist of the 2014 film thats not to say that they characters are really deep there just better than those of the previous movie in any case no one goes to these movies to see the people they go to see the monsters and this film delivers the fights are som of the most intense the franchise has seen and there are fewer cutaways to human action to interrupt the action on top of that there are numerous easter eggs throughout the film that reference the classic films from the use of the oxygen destroyer to the subtle reference to mechagodzilla in the credits godzilla fans will love the references to the old movies there are too many to count ive seen the movie twice and i still dont think ive found them all theres also the music which is incredible they faithfully recreated the original theme song for godzilla and you will hear it at multiple points in the movie even mothras theme is used at one point if you are a godzilla fan or just a fan of giant monster movies in general i highly recommend watching this movie you wont be disappointed
Aug 9 2019,positive,absolutely stunning visually wise definitely recommend it 
Aug 9 2019,positive,this has everything that you would want in a godzilla and it is glorious
Aug 9 2019,positive,the amount of monsters needed is perfect for its title  im clapping hands for the background score hatsoff
Aug 9 2019,positive,one of the most spectacular displays sound and visual scapes ive seen 
Aug 9 2019,positive,what more can you want than giant monsters screeching and smashing stuff i even liked the humanclimate change elements this time
Aug 9 2019,positive,i wanted this movie to be perfect in keeping with my 60year love of godzilla filmswhen i saw the trailer still the best movie trailer ive ever seen with clair de lune i thought this is it the godzilla movie i always wanted i went and took my grandson in whom i am fomenting some kaiju love well just like everyone else i loved the monsters and could have done without the human story ken watanabe and charles dance were the only humans who were even vaguely interesting the rest barely register against the primal force of the beasts but man is this movie beautiful the monsters are beautifully rendered and riveting please just have more monsters if a sequel is still in the works i want to experience the wonder of that trailer when godzilla nuclearbreaths the sky just because he can
Aug 9 2019,negative,its a gorgeous visual performance period other than that actors script and music are terrible couldnt but catch myself on a thought of killing main characters myself for being selfish stupid and irritating motivation for their actions lacking on every step there is no consequences of their actions  for example i released apocalyptic monster from the cradle of ice killing hundreds of employees  reaction  she was ideologically mistaken characters and acting in this movie is illogical irritating and blunt it would be nice trashy indie movie if they would add some style to all that bs the saving grave of  this movie from 0 stars is    cgi it is epic and believable but music is blunt and doesnt match the action most of the time lets say its just unimpressive whoever did sound editing just saw what crap they had and had no desire to stand out verdict  dont pay those lazy ass actors and directors money with cinema money i believe cgi editors already got their fair share and they will head on for decent movies
Aug 9 2019,positive,absolutely love this movie dont pay attention to any of the critics that hate this movie it is outstanding  totally worth watching this movies has an excellent cast as well  finally got the godzilla i always dreamed of 
Aug 9 2019,negative,its such a step down from how amazing kong skull island was with that being a setup for this movie its just so disappointing to me the acting was not great except for a few characters its pacing is way too fast i dont know about anyone else but i want to know more about the monsters than what they gave us if you just like fight scenes this movie is great for you because i feel like thats all it was and even some of those werent even that great i had high expectations because of kong and hoped they would at least incorporate some of the characters from kong they completely butchered this new movie 
Aug 9 2019,negative,worst movie seen for a long timeformulaic drivel and waste of timehalf a star because at least someone knew how to turn a pc on and do some graphics
Aug 8 2019,positive,felt like i was watching a toho film but instead it was better because of hollywood resources and actors 810 or 45 on here
Aug 8 2019,positive,we finally got to see this at the theater and we all enjoyed it very much   my youngest son who is 7 was the most excited about the movie
Aug 8 2019,negative,this is supposed to be a monster battle movie instead its more of a custody battle over the daughter i didnt watch the first movie but i get the gist of its effect that carries on to the sequel
Aug 8 2019,positive,this movie is made by godzilla fans for godzilla fans its not for your average movie goer but it was a ton of fun and i look forward to see the other movies in this monsterverse
Aug 8 2019,positive,my wife and i took our two boys finally my wife and i were not really thrilled about watching but wow it was a great movie a lot of action and personally kept me interested throughout the entire movie i will see again
Aug 7 2019,positive,i found it really well done
Aug 7 2019,negative,i wanted to watch a movie with giant monsters battling but instead i got a poorly written custody battle with monsters in the background terrible movie 
Aug 7 2019,positive,pretty good movie but you dont have to cut the fight scenes
Aug 7 2019,positive,the monster effects were very impressive and the backstory on some of the monsters was new to me excited for the sequel
Aug 7 2019,positive,godzilla is the king of the monsters if you like monster movies this one does not disappoint
Aug 7 2019,positive,great movie full of action the issues of 2014 are almost gone entirlt
Aug 7 2019,positive,you should see this if your a godzilla fan
Aug 7 2019,negative,three headed dragon that breathes electricity and just when you think it couldnt get any dumber the plot of the villain is the classic oh my son died so the world deserves to die now too abssssssolutely horribly boring 
Aug 6 2019,positive,this movie made me cry two times  
Aug 6 2019,positive,this a a godzilla movie yes it may have its flaws but it doesnt matter because it delivers by being a great godzilla movie by giving us more monster fighting action and the pace gets going so theres no getting lost in the plot
Aug 6 2019,neutral,visuals are spectacular but the story is horrendous i mean really dumb
Aug 6 2019,positive,the monster visuals are gorgeous and thats certainly where they put their money unfortunately the plot is very dumb and overly complicated to the point that we dont get to see monster stuff until about 50 minutes into the movie the upshot is that the parts with humans fall back into the so bad its good category so if you like imitating mystery science theater 3000 youll have something to do while you wait for the monster fights to start once the fighting starts its exciting and very entertaining well worth the price of the ticket on its own though it seems overly focused on giving the audience good pc desktop wallpapers    closest comparison its better than godzilla 2014 but not as good as kong skull island    setting kaiju monster  plot adventure  tone actiondrama
Aug 6 2019,positive,godzilla review     i was mostly meh on the first godzilla movie thinking it lacked a whole lot of monster battles it personally felt like blue balls the movie always cutting away from the cool action and teasing us    this new godzilla movie though felt like a goddamn monster orgy  if you go into this movie just wanting the spectacle and monsters youll definitely get all the action    but yeah these humans aint shit  the characters arent terrible but the dialogue is so overdramatic lines like godzilla gonna go nuclear or the city will explode in 10 minutes everythings so over the top it felt like everyone was just saying trailer lines   with that said while i can see audiences not caring for this the plot is frankly absurd id still highly recommend this   the scale here with godzilla and the monsters are so impressive and gorgeous to look at its worth seeing just for the spectacle alone  monster fans will like this film more than others but nonfans are likely to still have a very stupidly entertaining time 
Aug 6 2019,positive,great film action and cgi is superb cant wait to see godzilla vs king kong
Aug 6 2019,positive,this movie was a masterpiece the critics must be high or something  
Aug 6 2019,positive,great fucking movie it might not have had a good story line to it but it was just fighting the whole time what do you guys expect come on forget you guys giving it a shit rating youre noting but haters fake fans
Aug 6 2019,negative,this was the biggest pack of shit i have ever seen in a long time im glad that godzilla wiped out my country so i didnt have to see it in theatres  
Aug 5 2019,positive,each monster reveal is amazing but they spend too much time on the human aspect of the film even though its a monster film the fights are spectacular but feel short for godzilla vs kong which is coming up in 2020 they should really stop with the human character development and just make it all about the monsters or at least make the stories that have the human parts interesting the action overall in this movie was an 810
Aug 5 2019,positive,i liked it dad hates godzilla king of the monsters
Aug 5 2019,negative,yo why is this bitch millie in ever
Aug 5 2019,positive,it is absolutely great to watch the movie  u guz totally need to watch this who like the fantasy amoung the all titansi like mothra queen of the titansthe movie is so good the i watch it over and over againfuck the guz who dont like it  sorry about the bad word  
Aug 5 2019,positive,one of the most visually epic movies ive seen  makes up for any other errors in the film if you watch it at home do yourself a favor and make sure its on a large screen with a surround sound system  
Aug 5 2019,positive,i really didnt think id like this because of millie bobby brown cant stand her as an actress but okay shes better than brie larson but thats not really saying a whole lot but in the end i loved this film cant wait to see godzilla face off against kong in the next one
Aug 5 2019,positive,this is my all time favorite movie and im a huge fan of the godzilla franchise this movie capitalizes on everything wrong with the 2014 movie the fight scenes are amazing to watch and the soundtrack and visual design are stunning i love the way each of the kaiju sounds looks and acts while the plot with the human characters is mediocre its not horrendous and it doesnt take away from the action i love this movie to bits and cant wait for the next movie overall great movie and in my opinion a must see
Aug 5 2019,positive,a monsterfest from beginning to end sure the human characters might not be your thing but they delivered more titans in this film including mothra rodan and ghidorah alongside the big g and is dope for more monster mayhem and destruction
Aug 4 2019,positive,good story and great acting i feel that there should have been more time to see the story instead of the entire movie feeling like it was a big fight sequence 
Aug 4 2019,positive,monsters a why is there always a stupid kid involved in these movies over acting by the mom dad and kid they should release a cut of movie with the family removed 
Aug 4 2019,negative,the only thing good about the movie was a special fix even though this movie had some very talented this script did not let them live up to their full potential an actor is only as good as the stripper ther given very weak storyline made no sense i believe the fair this movie lays at the  feet of directors in the screenwriters if you want to see this movie wait and watch it online isnt worth your money at the box office
Aug 4 2019,positive,this is a true godzilla movie if you dont like it then you must have the wrong expectations for this genre the only downside imo is that they cast ted cruz as a main character
Aug 4 2019,positive,just for the action 
Aug 4 2019,positive,this movie was incredible not only was the cgi flawless but the action was phenomenal  i saw a lot of people complaining about the human aspect and drama but people are forgetting that their was a lot of that all the way back in the first godzilla movie ever made  the human stuff is just par for the course just like the stuff with the kaiju titans monsters or whatever you call them
Aug 4 2019,negative,worst movie in a while almost as bad as the last air bender honestly shocked at the positive reviews because it was absolute garbage and i generally like most movies
Aug 4 2019,negative,plot and characters and everything else  bad just bad like i cant even begin to describe bad    the cg  the only reason this has a star
Aug 4 2019,positive,decent and watchable
Aug 3 2019,negative,its dumb really dumb close to unwatchable  
Aug 3 2019,positive,honestly who cares that the story sucks the characters suck and the writing sucks i came to see the cgi monster fights and this totally delivers on the monster screentime  it was quite the spectacle on the big screen and it was so much fun to watch and that made the rest of the sophomoric dialogue fun to watch instead of being annoying overall a very enjoyable summer watch incredible special effects
Aug 3 2019,positive,nice movie i love this movie cause there are so many monsters 
Aug 3 2019,positive,an emotional rollercoaster for a long term g fan this movie is a spectacle worth seeing the movies score adds to a great atmosphere and delivers a thrilling story
Aug 3 2019,positive,cmon it was great and highly entertaining if you are a fan of godzilla and the monster flicks youre gonna love it love how they tied in the mythology of our past civilizations with it and made a new and unique story
Aug 3 2019,neutral,it was good until the end
Aug 3 2019,positive,nice dumb fun plenty going on but pace isnt too slow and the heart is there for both the humans and monsters excited to see whats next
Aug 2 2019,positive,exactly what youd expect 
Aug 2 2019,negative,this movie was just stupid the cgi was masterfully done but the story was one of  the dumbest stories ive ever watched in a movie i love vera farmiga but in this movie she was an idiotic naive egotistical basic bitch i was glad of what happened to her at the end     ppl are commenting on individuals acting but because the story was so stupid and like the first movie there were moments of nothingness that went on too long all of the acting seemed overacting to me vera the dad and that millie bobby brown girl were all overly dramatic throughout the movie and there were a ton of cast members including quite a few black pioneers of the industry so to say that only the main characters and ken watanabe acted well is just plain stupid ppl are just stupid when they get on the internet     too much ppl standing with their mouths open while things are blowing up around them and the dad shouldve have been killed early in the movie with all the shit he was apart of     best part of the movie were indeed the monsters and the fight but the story still didnt have to be so damn stupid and it was downright human egotistical pretentious bullshit to write in that godzilla would need useless ass humans to help him fight which ironically means that the writers didnt even get the point of their own fuckin movie  i absolutely hated this movie
Aug 2 2019,negative,this movie starts and ends very slowly half the time youre trying to figure out how the characters are getting to these remote places so quickly without explanation the cuts are poor and organized similarly the overall premise eh soso is it weird that id rather still watch the matthew broderick godzilla than this 
Aug 2 2019,positive,i loved this movie too many of the recent godzilla movies didnt have enough epic fights its really what i care about this movie has no shortage of kaiju fights and destruction and it was glorious its one of the rare times youll find me cheering in the theatres
Aug 2 2019,positive,i went for the monsters not the plot i was not disappointed
Aug 2 2019,positive,i love godzilla spent many evenings glued to the tv as a kid watching him and his friends wreck havoc on tokyomy grown son is an even bigger fan its part of our family legacy i thought the film was ok didnt wow me or make me want to see it again very silly and convoluted plot my son loved it tho 
Aug 2 2019,positive,great storyline and full of action
Aug 1 2019,positive,ken watanabe was the only good actor  everyone else sucked  the movie production itself was good but the actors sucked 
Aug 1 2019,positive,great godzilla action throughout not a tease like the first movie in this new american godzilla franchise from legendary pictures infact this movie is loaded with both monsters and huge monster fights a must see for godzilla and kaiju movie fans
Aug 1 2019,positive,this is one of my favorite movies of 2019 but it was not as good as godzilla and kong skull island the visual effects were phenomenal and awesome especially mothra who was also beautiful king ghidorah godzilla behemoth rodan and scylla the action sequences were magnificent and awesome especially when king ghidorah came out of the ground and the final battle the cinematography was excellent the acting from millie bobby brown bradley whitford vera farmiga and kyle chandler was fantastic the musical score was superb the writing was not great and the pacing was a little slow but overall it was a really entertaining movie
Aug 1 2019,negative,wife trying to destroy the world daughter in between and husband trying to save it  all come together who are the real monsters get rid of that in the script and the film may have been enjoyable 
Aug 1 2019,positive,i love it great story and cinema effects a lot of work was really put into this franchise cant wait for godzilla vs king kong 
Jul 31 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie ive seen so far
Jul 31 2019,positive,exactly what i wanted from this movie much better than the first
Jul 31 2019,positive, bow to the king monster fight scenes were fantastic loved the movie action from the opening scenes to the credits
Jul 31 2019,positive,i like more than the 2014 godzilla it has more fight which is better because the first movie lack fight scene an dmost of the battle seem to have more impact to the world and people
Jul 31 2019,positive,cool ass monster foghts
Jul 31 2019,positive,if you liked the first movie this ones even better
Jul 30 2019,positive,it was better than i expected
Jul 30 2019,positive,if you dont care for bombastic action dont watch it if you do forgive the human plot and go on for monster action large edition
Jul 30 2019,negative,wtf how is it possible to make such a bad movie
Jul 30 2019,positive,all i wanted were some amazing monster sequences i knew everything between monster moments would be a mess and they were more monsters less humans would make these movies better normally i dont mention sound but this movie is worthy of a oscar nod in the sound categories
Jul 30 2019,positive,its a kaiju movie you dont go to a kaiju movie to enjoy the storyline you go for the visuals and sound effects this was where king of the monsters was strong legendary has been doing a consistently good job on this front at least
Jul 29 2019,positive,this was a pretty decent flick but i have to say i was a little disappointed in how godzilla looked  he seemed a little swollen and not his muscular self  perhaps im mistaken but i thought hed look more buffed than the version we came away with  overall it was a good movie  my wife and i enjoyed it
Jul 29 2019,positive,we loved it  we really appreciated that the female lead had depth  was a conflicted character and of course we loved millie bobby brown very entertaining
Jul 29 2019,positive,just a good movie overall
Jul 29 2019,positive,the action was 1010 but the characters were not that interesting and could use alot of help but i still cant wait for the next movie
Jul 29 2019,negative,this movie could have been much better if it wasnt such a big mess the plot is incoherent and the acting is bad for some of the cast kyle chandler should stick to tv and ziyi zhangs accent is distracting the cgi is unpolished for some of the nongodzilla monsters in some scenes
Jul 29 2019,negative,the script was so bad while the visuals were incredible i didnt care about any of the human characters and so the intensity of the action was incredibly lacking     i was excited about this movie after the most recent godzilla movie but left this movie very disappointed did i mention the script oh yeah it was so bad that i was laughing out loud and cringing in moments that were supposed to be serious
Jul 29 2019,positive,decent movieworth watching actors were good 
Jul 29 2019,neutral,it was a rubble of clash of monsters it was not too bad but not something to write home about either
Jul 29 2019,positive,i loved the movie especially the action sequences involving godzilla probably less human drama in the next movie
Jul 29 2019,positive,i think they did a good job cant wait for the sequel i love it that theyre tying all three of them movies in together
Jul 29 2019,negative,that was like chinese movies  
Jul 29 2019,positive,a complete success although i wish mothra didnt die and i have question hows there another muto  but ghidora and rodan were bad ass and it was cool to create new monsters that werent in the original japanese godzilla movies i cant wait to see  godzilla and king kong fight each other in the sequel
Jul 29 2019,positive,im not mad at it it was entertaining for sure the fricken monsters just kept coming
Jul 29 2019,positive,totally a godzilla movie i have been waiting to watch finally saw it for the tenth time still love it 
Jul 29 2019,positive,great movie overall some of the plot points are weird and illogical but the movie is very entertaining
Jul 28 2019,positive,everything i ever wanted in a godzilla movie cant wait til he takes on kong
Jul 28 2019,positive,i was godzilla fan as a child  this is not a great movie unless youre a godzilla fan expect bad acting terrible special effects  but that is why you go see godzilla
Jul 28 2019,positive,this movie was a fun summer blockbuster with some interesting elements involving the mother and the daughter the performances were strong and the visuals were amazing the scale of this movie is massive its a must see
Jul 28 2019,positive,alright this movie is awesome and you should see it that being said this movie is far from being perfect the characters arent very interesting too much fanservice you can tell that this movie is made by a fan for the fans that doesnt necessarily mean that it instantly makes for a good movie yes i do believe that michael dougherty is a good filmmaker but not on the same level as gareth edwards who made the 2014 movie which i still believe to be a masterpiece if you want to critique something the most it should be the writing which is just not good the story it just didnt feel organic but forces in some moments and the villain the villain in this movie is played by charles dance who delivers a great perfomance but thats it his character is nothing but a villain and a bad one at that no backstory or motivation or reaction the soundtrack is good really good still i feel like it could have used some more of the 2014 soundtrack to give a little of the same feeling i had in the previous one this movie didnt take itself serious enough in my opinion the 2014 masterpiece felt real and dangerous and huge this one not so much i kidd you not osprey helicpoters launched out of a huge flying ship this broke my immersion from what could have been a really thrilling ride overal it is more enjoyable if you turn your brain of for some sections of it
Jul 28 2019,positive,i love godzilla moviesbut as usual a lot of unnecessary people
Jul 28 2019,positive,my most favorite movie of all time
Jul 28 2019,positive,did the critics and i see the same movie this film was incredible
Jul 27 2019,negative,the worst godzilla movie ever made just horrible to watch low budget script feelst like a 9 year old kid wrote the story while playing with all his toys but the effects where high budget thats the only good thing other than that i give it half star fajing awful movie if you havent watched it yet just watch godzilla one again dont wast your money or time on this crap and who ever produced this movie go to hall 
Jul 27 2019,positive,simply fantastic i dont care about what haters said this and that if i like the movie the  its super great giving this 1110
Jul 27 2019,positive,battle scenes were great  overall story was ok
Jul 27 2019,positive,i really loved this movie kept me entertained for the whole 2 hours which is rare to do
Jul 27 2019,positive,the creature feature or largely seen and pointed as a monster flick has seriously evolved to the point of proving that size does matter if want to deliver thrills for seeking attendees the nuclear chemical known as the hollywood cheese enables todays filmmakers to be allowed to imagine big at increasing height that masks further manipulation of the captured reality while gareth edwards formally demonstrated the procedure that involves those expectations five years ago michael dougherty visually updates the sense of control and rivalry that had accompanied the gojira across the longrunning foreign franchises carriage to put the alias name to the test with unnatural results    going third in a linear equations near completion the latest godzilla king of the monsters awakens the dormant titans to enter a brawl against the shaking might of godzilla this statically disturbed awakening challenges the cryptozoological agency monarch in identifying the sides whilst stabilizing the trigger in the events center but that is not the biggest problem theyre facing it is the collision between their notsofriendly neighbor and his ultimate nemesis the threeheaded ghidorah who seeks the alpha dominance in ending the rivalry once and for all all myths been shattered along with the rest of the world with these ancient superspecies going at it with the only thing standing beside hope is questioning the beings purposed existence when leaving the flawed others hanging in the balance    as seen and then complained in most of the later transformers films there is now an elaborate irony conflictingly unveiling both a flawed weak spot and a surprisingly subtextual strength as a reasonable turn in both triggering the unnatural cinematic monstrous brawl spectacle in a uniquely defensive though still problematic case the writing is genuinely thin when deciding to control the monstrous titans via a given weak spot that demines their godlike stature with a puny device that becomes a plot motivation in form of a reversal macguffin it also demined the expectation of the brawl being solely monsters but godzilla accepted humane assistance rather than taking it headon after the said device being humancontrolled so that is one part of the elaborate irony the other part is praiseworthy    there is a reason behind the trigger object and it surprisingly coincides in a timely topical matter  which is the thematic layer that the stomping franchise subtly expresses the verballydemonstrated ideology is a subtextual vein that references to human error that is affecting earth as we speak or for you read or ignore out of arrogant ignorance towards climate change and industrial endangerment all part of the environmental injustice that shows we are not utterly taking care our home thoughtprovoking viewpoint with valid argument and bold communication minus the circumstantial spectacle supports as well justify the written direction over impressiveness next to the emotional effecting human drama that again tips the balance to its favor away from the main event    in addition to the writing the establishment of the human drama is still praiseworthy like how the predecessor was manageably packed but the pleasantly wellcasted performances made it all more affecting as well more emotionally engaging particularly the cinematically formal introduction of millie bobby brown  if you are not into stranger things    finally with the writing discussed what makes this film a uniquely defensive case with the problematic aspect of it in the thinness is the turnaround for the spectacle over the writing that tend to get criticized if storytelling is not functionally balanced with the effects the main event that serves the story its purpose is the brawl despite the handicapped assistance that provoked the thinness if the transformers films are criticized for being too human focused godzilla deconstructed that very notion in terms of focus to the effectsheavy spectacle that expresses the mythological narration surrounding the monsterverse and the human characters struggled to get the spotlight on them with a soso attention span so if you look at this film consider it a favor for the effects over the storytelling when the latter only brought the unnatural intervening element    godzilla king of the monster is thinly flawed because of the unnaturalness but without regret as it still serves with affecting impacts to vividly remind us the stakes while arguing from side to side over the discussed timely ideological subtext for justified strength the main attraction turned out amazing and quite thrilling and going a little further to be more exciting than how the predecessor resulted especially when standing strong and mighty with the flaw as an overweight anchor the king of the monster reigns and sets us up in anticipation for the next brawl coming in march with an already certain king b
Jul 26 2019,negative,i was totally bored if you know nothing about this franchise dont bother 
Jul 26 2019,positive,pros monsters fighting each other  cons too much human screentime
Jul 26 2019,negative,the characters that populate this film are incredibly boring and uninteresting the scenes when monsters arent fighting drag and the film starts to feel longer than it actually is even when the monsters are fighting the direction is poor and always takes place in hard to see environments 
Jul 25 2019,positive,totally awesome godzilla monster movie i love it  ignore the critics because they wouldnt know a good movie if it hit them in the head
Jul 25 2019,positive,to hell with these critics this movie was absolutely the most epic thing i saw awesome
Jul 25 2019,positive,if you like old fashioned monster movies you wont be disappointed 
Jul 25 2019,positive,what can i say its a godzilla movie where giant monsters fight yeah the human aspect is lacking in areas but thats not why you watch a godzilla film 
Jul 24 2019,positive,if you love giant monsters or are a fan of godzilla youll enjoy this it fixes a lot of the problems seen in 2014 mainly the lack of monster action the designs and score are faithful to the originals while remaining unique in their own way the action is amazing though lacks a bit of the realism and weight seen in 2014 with the way they move this isnt often though the humans while not perfect are much more enjoyable to follow than ford
Jul 24 2019,positive,oh my godzilla this movie was so fun and when i saw it at g fest during the credits everyone was singing along including 
Jul 24 2019,positive,i know godzilla had some ups and downs in the past but for being a huge godzilla fan im not gonna jump on the ban wagon and hate on it like the critics for the sake of the franchise im cutting this one some slack this deserves an a
Jul 24 2019,negative,this movie was so bad  it was too long had boring characters bad action that wasnt actually shown and the worst fbomb in any movie ive ever seen  would not recommend
Jul 24 2019,positive,you know what youre going in for destruction action good and evil long live the king     king ghidorah is a freaking badass
Jul 24 2019,positive,if your wanting a deep film with good characters and a very thought provoking plot then why did you go to a godzilla movie this film is just flat out entertainment and there is nothing wrong with that
Jul 24 2019,positive,awesome the story could have been better and the movie should have been longer but still the movie was amazing stand out character is definitely mothra dont listen to the critics 
Jul 24 2019,positive,i mean what more do you want in a monster movie
Jul 23 2019,positive,grear summer entertainment perfect escape but the message is still there dont mess with nature i really enjoyed it
Jul 23 2019,positive,pretty good i wouldnt see it twice
Jul 23 2019,positive,while the human storyline is sometimes weak the movie makes up for it with kiaju battles complete with breathtaking music and visuals overall this film will greatly please hardcore kaiju fans
Jul 23 2019,positive,superfun allout monster fightgest featuring big g and friends  it heads more into the scifi aspects of godzilla  with giant underground bases and secret weapons  which is great the human characters are a bit sketchy  but the film knows this and also knows that that is how it should be in a godzilla movie  roooooarrrrrrr
Jul 23 2019,negative,horrible one of the worst movies ive ever seen ugh
Jul 23 2019,positive,has supernatural significance strong fight scenes
Jul 23 2019,positive,good visuals reasonable villain motive and full of emotion 
Jul 23 2019,negative,this movie is such a dissapointment
Jul 23 2019,negative,as much as i wanted to love the movie all i can praise is its practical effects the only apparent purpose of the movie was to make money
Jul 22 2019,positive,it had that old school feel loved it
Jul 22 2019,negative,too much time too much effects too much godzilla it was fun and exhilarating but also boring and overpowered 
Jul 22 2019,negative,i had such high hopes for this and was bitterly disappointed i love godzilla movies have done since i was a kid and first saw the lumbering japanese lizard on tv in the 1970s when he popped up from time to time in teatime films id been buoyed up by the last incarnation which was amazing and had been followed up by the decent kong skull island which had laid the foundations for a fresh crop of big monster flicks however godzilla king of monsters had me feeling decidedly let down and increasingly uncomfortable as i was aware of the growing impatience of my partner staring daggers at me for making him sit through it you dont go to such movies expecting a challenging narrative or dialogue but neither does the viewer expect to be insulted by the sheer stupidity of what is on the screen the plot simply doesnt make sense and is so ludicrous that i found it impossible to suspend my belief and engage with what was going on further i felt cheated in terms of the expected big screen action as all the confrontations between the gigantic beasts seem to take place through impenetrable smoke and clouds the cast is woefully underused with charles dance having maybe a couple of dozen lines in the whole film theres simply nothing for him or many of the others to do i hope that this is a misstep in the relaunch of this perennial character and after a period of quiet where he can lick his wounds godzilla can return and smash up a few cities stamp on a few tanks and incinerate the odd monster like hes supposed to do
Jul 22 2019,positive,this might be the greatest movie ive ever seen being a diehard godzilla fan makes that slightly biased but true nonetheless it was everything id hoped to see on the big screen since i was a kid all the monsters look and sound amazing the acting is solid the score is remarkable 1110 cant wait for the next one
Jul 22 2019,positive,godzilla fans should love this but others maybe not so much its an action heavy epic and exactly what you would expect youll know by watching the trailer whether this movie is for you or not i am secretly looking forward to kong vs godzilla though
Jul 22 2019,positive,the best summary i can give for this movie is fun but vapid an epic spectacle with absolutely no take away for daily your life or plot to actually care about  if youre not a big goji fan then chances are you missed all of the best references or werent thinking to critically about the plot of this film it tries to insert some sort of religious message through its undertones that personally offends but likely means nothing to others so lets not count that in this review it harkens back to the showa era of gojira films but is too restrained in my opinion and doesnt show enough of the monsters effecting manmade structures and environments as they should its certainly an improvement over the last film and like i said its fun but the story is somehow just barely less ridiculous than what came out in the 70s show era  i love the redesigns and call backs to previous films visuals and sound design are fantastic until you compare them with shin godzilla and then a clear disparity emerges the dagon descendant called godzilla in the legendary films is not the gojira of the past the tone has been changed dramatically yet again to that of gamera as if americans cant handle the idea that gojira has always been nuclear war personified  the monsters used to be warnings to protect the environment and not seek after military dominance there was never an illogical attempt made to say that kaiju were good for the environment and with the release of the series chernobyl i feel as if this critical plot point just seems even more absurd even within its own context than ever the family that the plot is centered around is so dysfunctional that they literally cause destruction on a worldwide scale  all in all this movie is fun to watch especially if you can get excited by all the references to older films but dont try to read too much into the plot because this is not the well known terror and might of a serious gojira its a vapid 300 ft tall pro wrestling security guard with atomic breath and a beef with a threeheaded illegal immigrant of greater stature 
Jul 21 2019,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters delivers the kaiju monster mayhem that the franchise promises unfortunately most of the runtime is occupied with one dimensional characters and an incoherent plot  c
Jul 21 2019,positive,after seeing this film and looking at what the critics say about it i can agree with their opinion unlike godzilla 2014 and shin godzilla king of the monsters doesnt have that great of a human story to it apart from ken watanabe and that theres nothing but giant monsters beating the crap out of each other    however that doesnt change the fact that this is a great film to the audiences this film is like avengers endgame because endgame was a fan service to the fans of both marvel films and comics alike godzilla king of the monsters is the ultimate tribute and fan service to the fans of the godzilla franchise seeing four of tohos iconic monsters clash in an american godzilla film was spectacular watching serizawa sacrifice his life like in the 1954 gojira made me cry and hearing bear mccrearys cover of akira ifukubes iconic theme song of godzilla made me scream inside with excitement and joy    simply put godzilla king of the monsters isnt a film made to please critics but its a film to please the godzilla fans
Jul 21 2019,negative,first time in years i walked out of a movie monsters fighting monsters dumb 
Jul 20 2019,positive,i enjoyed this film more than expected too
Jul 20 2019,positive,action packed from beginning to end
Jul 20 2019,positive,for a big gman fan this movie is awesome and for all the critics theres this japanese franchise called gojira godzilla try to watch one of the movies 
Jul 20 2019,positive,its honesty the best movie ive seen this year with spiderman being the second watching this unexpectedly made me feel like a kid again which is a rare thing it gave me the larger than life feeling that i used to get when watching something at the movies it gave me the feeling i expected to get from end game go watch it and see what you think
Jul 20 2019,neutral,monsters thats all u need to know about this movie maybe godzilla vs king kong will have the same delivery as its predecessors 
Jul 19 2019,positive,better than i expected
Jul 19 2019,positive,a lot of fun and action 
Jul 19 2019,positive,this movie is by far and away the greatest godzilla flick way to go warnerlegendary with the vision of toho epic
Jul 19 2019,positive,it was ok  the men in my family loved it
Jul 19 2019,positive,godzilla was a great movie only those who arent real fans of this genre wouldnt like it
Jul 19 2019,positive,its a fun popcorn movie full of monstrous excitement and energy topped off with a wonderful performance by the talented young millie bobby brown
Jul 19 2019,positive,everything was great
Jul 19 2019,positive,it has beautiful special effects and breathtaking cinematography full of monster action and likeable human characters  everything a godzilla fan wants
Jul 19 2019,positive,this movie was so good because it was everything a good godzilla was but modernized everything about it was so much like the old godzilla movies it had a good story that came second to the monster action which is how those movies were it had insane cgi and and an equally as insane universe monsterverse  marvelverse
Jul 19 2019,positive,i liked the fact that godzilla had a lot of screen time on this movie compared to the past godzilla movie im the one person that was like oh man another godzilla movie its gonna be the same thing of course my son loves godzilla so i took him to watch it and no regrets the titans get lots of screen time as well there is a lot of talking but it is balanced out with the parts of the movie that have that action that you want from this type of movie
Jul 18 2019,positive,loved the movie the message and the monsters the lack of human drama was refreshing and focused on the true stars of the movie  the monsters all hail the king
Jul 18 2019,positive,this was a great godzilla movie reading the professional critics reviews wont do you any favors as they dont seem to understand the appeal of classic monsters like godzilla the film has a serviceable storyline its not some deep multilayered drama with painstaking continuity and master strokes of thought and implementation the story serves to drive the thrill ride that is godzilla and the other titans battling it out enjoy the movie for what it is and what it is supposed to be and you wont be disappointed the big g brings the boom
Jul 18 2019,positive,seen the movie and  i hear the criticism from the viewers and as a very big godzilla fan i really loved this one very much and i hope they continue with more monster movies like these
Jul 18 2019,positive,its gonna be hard to set my own bias aside for this review since ive been a fan of the tohos godzilla franchise since i was a kid but here i go  godzilla king of the monsters is a phenomenal movie and a huge step up from its 2014 predecessor while i loved gareth edwards take on the film i agree with the major consensus that there was not enough godzilla this movie corrects that problem tenfold as michael dougherty keeps the monsters onscreen consistently the designs for the monsters themselves have been updated for the new godzilla loving generation and are familiar and terrifying each honors their toho predecessor and dont feel generic as they give them their own personality such as ghidorah heads fighting each other to show the audience which head is in charge godzillas back spikes have been updated to look more like his toho design which also looks amazing  the fights between these titans left me in awe as they showed the true power and devastation of these monsters cities are leveled after their awakening and give audiences what they want by not cutting away from the action there are plenty of hell yeah moments throughout as the monsters tear into each other and there are plenty of easter eggs and references to their previous iterations to satisfy godzilla fans  while most believe the human plot in this movie is lacking i found it had depth and nuanced compared to previous films kyle chandlers mark russell and vera farmigas emma russell developed a device the orca designed to pacify the titans is used as a weapon to awaken ghidorah and restore the balance in nature the russell family suffered the loss of their son during the events of 2014s godzilla and is still trying to pick up the pieces with their daughter millie bobby browns madison russell while i dont wanna go into specifics about the plot they are relateable to those who are dealing with the loss of family member during a natural disaster or tragedy and how we all try to find meaning in why it happened something i believe was attempted in the 2014 godzilla but never really fully realized that is one of the main reasons why this godzilla movie sets its self apart from the rest of the monster movies   with cool monster designs and fights with a compelling humanside godzilla king of the monsters is an awesome addition to monsterverse and is definitely worth seeing for all audiences this summer  verdict must see  
Jul 17 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a one of kind slamfest despite some bland plot points and characters the excellent cinematography and special effects really immerse the audience into the ring all fans of summer monster movies or just summer blockbusters in general must check this out on the biggest screen possible  the film follows secret agency monarch as its members face off against a battalion of godsized monsters or kaiju including mothra rodan and the ultimate mastermind  the threeheaded ghidorah these threats leave humanitys very existence teetering towards impending apocalypse but sometimes one must fight fire with fire their only hope relies in the mighty kaiju godzilla who anyways intends to kill these monsters for dominance  the ensemble cast of monarch includes many alist actors from kyle chandler vera farmiga millie bobby brown ken watanabe ziyi zhang bradley whitford and sally hawkins all of them give their best but mediocre screenplay really gives the human scenes here a much more lethargic feel the family drama between kyle chandlers mark russell and vera farmigas emma russell felt out of place and it really just adds nothing to the overall plot thankfully milly bobby brown adds a complex perspective with expressive acting and a signature defiant attitude bradley whitford is the most memorable character here with his wit and welltimed comic relief charles dance as jonah alan was a great addition as the veteran actor gives his all in this menacing new threat its really all in the kaiju here with their unique designs and characteristics i quite enjoyed ghidorahs banter between each of his three heads  michael dougherty spectacularly directs with each roaring fight and exploration of lore he pays homage to the best of the old gojira movies however i do miss the more smallscale feel that godzilla 2014 gareth evans really added something new to the monster movie genre with that but there are tons more fights here which should alleviate fans complaints about the lack of fights and monster screentime in the previous movie the soundtrack helmed by bear mccreary roars paying much respect to the original themes that started it all my favorite scene is a climatic moment that i cant spoil it explains most of the surrounding lore and contains one truly chilling scene from ken watanabes excellent acting here mccrearys track elevates this to one of the best scenes this year overall  the message of this film is in the commitment to family whether from the russells or between fellow monarch crewmates i give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 due to intense monster fights and language the movie released in theaters on may 31st 2019 so check it out    reviewed by arjun n kids first film critic for more reviews by youth visit kidsfirst dot org 
Jul 17 2019,positive,this is by leaps and bounds the best godzilla move to date  some of these negative reviews are just asinine its a monster movie people  if you are a fan this movie is absolutely incredible i cannot wait for kong vs godzilla  
Jul 17 2019,positive,slow paced at some parts but the action and the monsters made up for that overall it was a pretty decent film
Jul 17 2019,positive,very action packed great storyline and drama
Jul 17 2019,negative,uninspired story writing even as a big monster movie rushedcluttered plot every scene seemed to redefine or contradict the current narrative they put that girl from stranger things in there not sure why she did fine but didnt fill an important role dont think there were any most characters had zero development or just seemed to suddenly switch prerogatives giant monsters were yet again a let down low resolution visually unappealing outside of the base wow giant monster sense i was nodding off halfway through the movie and slept through the final battle or whatever you wanna call it 
Jul 17 2019,negative,easily the worst film i have seen in a long time  terrible acting with a horrendous script that destroys the franchise with its preposterous lack of any coherent story  the action just cant undo the complete idiocy of the entire story line  id rather see the original godzilla japanese movies with its dated and somewhat amusing renderings with guys in plastic suits battling each other than watch this farce of effects  all of these mega titans fighting with people nearby that magically escape any harm to them is ridiculous the technology they claim to use such as a bomb that makes oxygen disappear within a 2 mile range to eliminate the titans is utterly stupid  the daughter running from boston away from the monsters happens to just be in walking distance of a secret military facility a boston ballpark where she summons the titans over the ball parks loud speakers and then without fail runs to her parents house all in event of many multiple titans fighting  they say godzilla is the king yet he gets his ass handed to him on many occasions by monster zero before he is finally defeated by a radioactive godzilla that again grows to unbelievable sizes during the last fight  i actually thought destroy all monsters 1969 as horrible as it is rated was a better movie than this one  nuclear bombs blowing up stupid reasons for releasing the socalled orcha signals that somehow speak to the titans is absurd yet prominently themed throughout the movie working on a damaged devise no bigger than a laptop that is repaired and used again during the rain out in the open oh boy what a joke  the last good godzilla movie was the one with mathew broderick everything else after has been a disaster 
Jul 17 2019,neutral,just ok  not great  to long
Jul 16 2019,positive,this movie was too good must see
Jul 16 2019,positive,great moive took me back to when i was a kid watching godzilla only in color and better
Jul 16 2019,positive,i loved the fight scenes in the movie the story on the other hand wasnt the greatest when you look at the original gojira movie in the 50s that had a true and connecting story to the world at that time now the godzilla a movie are made for the big city destroying battles as a huge godzilla fan i couldnt rate this movie poorly and i truly enjoyed how some of the cast showed there talents
Jul 16 2019,positive,the biggest spectacle ive seen this year the actors act really well i had fun with the kaiju fights and liked seeing the lore expand the way it did
Jul 16 2019,negative,too many quips  as someone who was anxiously awaiting the sequel this was a frustrating disappointment
Jul 16 2019,positive,i have been a big g super fan since 1973 so about 47 years  they got this right  this movie was amazing and ive seen them all over 30 times
Jul 15 2019,positive,action packed from the minute the movie started theres no falling asleep through this movie
Jul 15 2019,positive,didnt really understand the storyline but the action was superb and the monsters were awesome  just didnt get what the point was to the movie
Jul 15 2019,positive,loved it the best godzilla movie ever
Jul 15 2019,positive,i grew up with godzilla loved it then still like now id watch it again minus the noisy children that thought it was a playground instead of a movie theater
Jul 15 2019,negative,i think the script was written by a liberal leftwing 5th grader  the special effects were ok but they were mostly obscured within dark stormy rainy scenes  i cannot understand how this movie has 83 audience score
Jul 15 2019,positive,the action was pretty intense worth the wait for this kind of godzilla  long live the king
Jul 15 2019,positive,love the film theater was very clean
Jul 15 2019,positive,its dumb really dumb and i dont mean oh its a big noisy action movie and it doesnt engage you very much mentally so that means its stupid im talking like the rules contained within just this movie are frequently broken and a big chunk of the ideas make no sense by the end dumb but i still had a pretty good time with king of the monsters kind of a weird title to give godzilla when the tagline for the sequel is god vs king and godzilla is not the king in that matchup but i digress the quality of the cgi varies drastically but when its good its just enough to get me over the line to enjoying it to the point i can give the movie a positive review
Jul 15 2019,positive,my husband chose this movie hes been a fan of godzilla and really enjoyed it i enjoyed it also
Jul 15 2019,negative,horrible the acting was hard to watch the script was junk awful experience
Jul 14 2019,positive,awesome movie and the graphics are bad ass
Jul 14 2019,positive,millie bobby brown was  great addition to the cast
Jul 14 2019,positive,thought it was good
Jul 14 2019,positive,not sure why this movie is not being talked about more and isnt having the box office success they anticipated a very enjoyable summer blockbuster definitely more screen time for the monsters this time 
Jul 14 2019,positive,i have seen this a couple of times in the theater i catch more on the 2nd viewing than on the 1st time i throughly enjoy watching godzilla and this latest iteration chapter is outstanding i will purchasing the bluray when available

Jul 14 2019,positive,great storyline and actionpacked start to finish
Jul 14 2019,positive,this was an awesome movie  well worth seeing on the big screen
Jul 14 2019,negative,this is one of the dumbest movies ive ever seen put it up there with mary shelleys frankenstein with deniro if you get frustrated watching movies in which every single human being does everything they possibly can to get killed this is it it made zero sense there is no way any government or military in the world would act the way they did in this just the premise of the movie alone makes you say wtf kong skull island was a masterpiece compared to this disaster i liked kong very much and am not averse to seeing monster movies the plot in godzilla kotm is what really really stinks it starts out seeming interesting but within 30 minutes you just start thinking do i turn this off or hang in there to see where it goes i finished the movie but only because i was curious as to how much dumber it could get it got a lot dumber what a waste of time this movie was so bad that i dont think i will watch kong vs godzilla the only bright spot in the movie were a handful of good actors doing the best they could with a garbage script millie brown was excellent as were the actors playing her mother and father ken watanabe is always amazing the rest of the actors  meh
Jul 14 2019,positive,i was on the edge of my seat  the story was extremely well written and the graphics were amazing  i would definitely watch it again
Jul 14 2019,positive,great action all the way through
Jul 13 2019,neutral,if you like big monster battles than this is for you the story isnt really strong but the battles are cool if only they could balance both sides this would of been better cool facts sprinkle through the film though

Jul 12 2019,positive,interesting take on the godzilla story at least they sort of kept to the historical background of the monsters more or less that being said i would have liked to have seen more interaction between godzilla and the humans
Jul 12 2019,positive,its a good movie but there is just way too much human screen time the acting was okay but not the best
Jul 12 2019,negative,took grandson he liked it

Jul 12 2019,positive,awesome battle scenes and very realistic cgi some of the acting was a little lacking but overall a good movie experience
Jul 12 2019,neutral,not worth to spend money and watch in cinema i loved godzilla 2014 but this one godzilla turned good from bad guy saving the city is acceptable but honestly i dont expect to see monsters of the rest out of topic and inserted chinese ingredients in a wrong way ruined  the whole movie it gives me a headache when the last scene comes with taking a bow from the rest of the monster to the godzilla 
Jul 12 2019,positive,this movie was so fucking awesome so much awesome kaiju action perfect shit ive seen it five times and i go to see it again if it was still in theatres where i live
Jul 12 2019,positive,great monster battles meh plot could have used 30 fewer human screen time

Jul 11 2019,positive,entertaining it tied in all of the old story lines which i liked
Jul 11 2019,positive,objectively the best godzilla film to date the only thing stopping it from getting five stars is the fact that there was still too much human drama and not enough of the monsters beating the stuffing out of one another although charles dance is always a welcome addition and ken watanabe killed it again
Jul 11 2019,negative,the human story was terrible 
Jul 11 2019,positive,definitely the best monster movie yet

Jul 10 2019,positive,awesome and amazing
Jul 10 2019,positive,action upon action the film doesnt stop moving granted it sacrifices fighting and introducing monsters for a human narrative but the effects and scale of it all was worth anything the could have tried to work in
Jul 10 2019,negative,a thoroughly disappointing entry in the godzilla franchise annoying and poorly written characters draw too much attention to themselves in what should be a light hearted monster mash this movie suffers from taking itself too seriously and the monster battles that we do get did not live up to the hype generated by the trailers many of the action sequences are poorly lit and never feel real or like anything is at stake
Jul 10 2019,positive,it was literally a love letter to the og fans like me
Jul 10 2019,positive,i loved the monsters and how unique each of them looked and acted dialogue can be cheesy at times but it doesnt interfere with the interesting story and motives of the characters

Jul 9 2019,positive,absolutely loved it first godzilla movie that caught my attention and it was amazing
Jul 9 2019,positive,this was an absolutely badass and amazing movie there are so many reasons on what makes this a completely amazing addition not just for legendarys monster verse but for the entire franchise it self the action was great the characters and actors are well trained and great with their actings the special effects are amazing heck the entire ost collection of the movie is worth listening to it brings back all of the original soundtracks from other original movies just to make it even greater and more modern towards the movie the monsterskanjititans looked really unique and awesome we even get to see some of the original kaijus back in the movie like rodan mothra and most importantly king ghidorah the pasting was very well handled not to mention on how the director actually gave what everybody wants in a godzilla movie ands still a fantastic movie to others whos not familiar with the franchise theres just one problem i had about this movie and its about the support characters most of the time it seems like if they just put a bunch of characters in even if we dont even know them for a long period of time in the movie there are lots of them and most of them actually has tons of potential in the movie but most of the time its only if they have minimum screen times and was forced to put into one huge scene together just to fill everything up or they get to have these obscure lines from the script and most of them are very good actors im not talking about the entire cast of main characters of course they have enough for themselves as we can all see in the movie idk maybe im just a too overreacting but aside from all of that the movie is a complete banger and its worth watching every single second of the movie my last part here is to all of the critics seriously have you ever even watched or seen most of the original movies in the franchise the original ideal to the series is about the monsters we asked for the action we asked for all the monsters to return in this movie we dont want you people to blatter about how theres too many monster scenes and it needs more human scenes and also not seeing the characters working along with the monsters what do you think the human characters have been doing in the rest of the movie theyre actually following every move the kaijus make and sticks with them while also sticking with the premise of the movie to be about the monsters most importantly take a look back in the 2014 version for a normal movie it was actually kinda good is it good when you speak it to a godzilla movie point of view absolutely fucking not the movie was supposed to be about godzilla and giant monsters not a human movie and oh maybe lets just put godzilla in this with an 8 minutes of screen time the movie we wanted godzilla 2014 in the first place because we were excited and hyped for all the giant monster actions the human plot in 2014 has already been boring when its just already half of the movie the character in it was also poorly developed have us fans got what we want in 2014 after waiting for a decade no its a huge train wreck of a godzilla movie and somehow its doing better than godzilla kotm heres my tip for you get yourself some godzilla movies from maybe the showa or the heisei trilogy you pick the classics watch them then you should probably start to think about putting your fingers onto the keyboard to talk about how terrible the movie was and for all of you people out there who was able to stumbled onto my review listen closely do not listen to the what the critics saids it will only ruin the experience for you towards the movie and will just cover you away from the true greatness of a great godzilla movie
Jul 9 2019,negative,disappointing bored with movies that are all cliche and rely on special fx 
Jul 9 2019,positive,loved it because the team added the original godzilla sounds
Jul 9 2019,positive,if you like big monsters fighting boy howdy are you in for a treat
Jul 9 2019,positive,grew up with the old godzilla movies  the new ones are not disappointing
Jul 8 2019,positive,to dark  dont like ex husband and wife teams
Jul 8 2019,positive,its 2019 isnt there a way to install a die hard battery in godzilla  he runs down after every fight in this movie and someone has to give him a spoonful of radiation to get him up again todays lithium batteries are not going to cut it  if he runs into king kong and his battery dies godzilla is going to get his behind whipped
Jul 8 2019,positive,special effects were decent if it was not for the monsters fighting and being an old fan of godzilla movies this movie would just get star an a half at best not the best of story linesplots lots of interaction between charters that would not happen like that in a real situation need to make it a bit more believable on how the story unfolds
Jul 8 2019,positive,i love this movie this film is so amazing i will give this  5 star rating plies make godzilla vs gamera it will be so cool 
Jul 8 2019,neutral,monster fighting scenes  flashbacks made scenes to chopped confusing monster scenes were not very clear  couldnt see action   average movie
Jul 8 2019,neutral,fun time at the movies effects were bonkers must miss in imax
Jul 8 2019,positive,nephews and myself loved it
Jul 8 2019,positive,loved it the cgi was stunning and the monsters had more of a real feel and a connection to reality was made there was an actual plot which was pretty cool as well  cant wait for the next one kong vs godzilla should be awesome
Jul 8 2019,positive,excellent is good movie wow love it
Jul 8 2019,negative,good monster fight sequences but none of the main characters were worth caring about at all
Jul 8 2019,positive,always been a godzilla fan since i was a kid watching this prehistoric icon change through the years have been awesome  i now get to enjoy it with my kids
Jul 8 2019,positive,awesome film that pays homage to the old kaiju films even with the musical score  i came for the fantastic monster fights and wasnt disappointed  oh and the human story was good too
Jul 7 2019,negative,what a boring movie the screen time of godzilla is minimum
Jul 7 2019,positive,stick around after the credits
Jul 7 2019,positive,this movie is my favorite even though im not a godzilla fan but the trailer and the others monsters and i was sold and i love mothra and i wish i see more of her but i understand that the movies want to focus on the two king ghidorah and godzillabut holy crap rodan scene is awesome one of my faves and i just love it its not great but its awesome  
Jul 7 2019,positive,grew up watching the movies and playing with the toys gave the same toys to my 7 year old and enjoy the fact that he loves godzillaactually ghidorah and destroyah are our favorites as much as i do 
Jul 7 2019,positive,awesome  really well done thoroughly enjoyed my time my son is now a huge fan as im i    i love it
Jul 7 2019,positive,i like the story line and animation did not like how other monsters bowed to king kong at the end
Jul 7 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen
Jul 7 2019,positive,the suspense was amazing such a great movie i knew it was going to be good but not that good very enjoyable
Jul 7 2019,positive,too long and godzilla is awesome
Jul 7 2019,positive,it was fabulous i cant wait for the rest of the  godzilla franchise to come i just hope that they do as great as this one i love godzilla
Jul 7 2019,positive,loved the movie finally a godzilla movie with tons of monster fight scenes its all about the monsters fighting yes
Jul 7 2019,positive,lets get ready to rumble
Jul 7 2019,positive,it was good as a movie cant wait for the next one when he goes agains king kong
Jul 7 2019,positive,acting was subpar but your not looking for the greatest acting in this movie full of huge monster fights
Jul 7 2019,positive,the effects were amazing  and if you are a classic godzilla fan you understand the importance of the oxygen remover and love dr shira you know who i mean  like most godzilla movies the people are real pains and there is always an annoying kid but this movie was old school monster magic  could have used more fight scenes but had the feel of saturday afternoon godzilla  loved it
Jul 7 2019,positive,the music made everything more real and gave it so much more depth im super happy with how everything worked togeather
Jul 7 2019,positive,just like an adult film the story and acting nothing more than an afterthought that exists only as a mechanism to deliver what you really want to see  you dont expect any of it to be good  you just want to see the action  and that is exactly what this movie is  if you want a gripping plot wellwritten dialogue or impressive acting performances you wont find it here  if you want to see gargantuan monsters fighting each other with reckless disregard for their surroundings it delivers in a spectacular fashion  
Jul 7 2019,positive,this movie is a love letter for hardcore godzilla fans who know the history of godzilla the music the references everything does justice to the original toho movies as someone who has watched nearly all 35 godzilla movies that exist this perhaps the best one that has ever been produced it is an accumulation of everything toho has pushed for without the corny aspects that are inevitable in low budget films i have seen this movie 6 times in theaters and i cant wait to own this movie in 4k 
Jul 6 2019,positive,better than the first my opinion
Jul 6 2019,positive,action packed keeps you on the edge of your seat
Jul 6 2019,positive,fun movie great action scenes from the start enjoyed this new edition of the classic series
Jul 6 2019,positive,its godzilla been a fan of the big guy since i was a kid monsters were epic and so were the battles the only thing i didnt really like was the humans being right in the thick of it debris flying everywhere  total destruction  yet they somehow are able to come out of it alive other than that i really enjoyed the film
Jul 6 2019,neutral,gone is the built up and reveal of the monsters from its predecessor king of the monsters has cool to look at fights but no characters to drive or payoff to a script in need of a better narrative
Jul 6 2019,positive,tons of action awesome creatures and good story line the kids and i loved it
Jul 6 2019,positive,this movie was one of the best godzilla movies around 
Jul 6 2019,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters clearly loves its source material and kaiju stars way more than good characterization and solid storytelling
Jul 6 2019,positive,mothra catching you in all the feels
Jul 6 2019,positive,oh my godzilla thatll always handsdown be my reaction hope we get to see more of mothra and rodan in godzilla vs kong id like to see what else theyre capable of loads of kaiju action are what make this movie an absolute spectacle thanks mike dougherty for giving kaiju fans everywhere this absolute jewel of a kaiju flick
Jul 6 2019,neutral,i had unrealistically high expectations before seeing this movie  visually it was stunning yet at times lifeless  as a lifelong godzilla fan it was exhilarating when the monsters were on screen  but the plot holes thin script and waste of human actors deprived this of being anything more than a terrifically fun giant monster mashup
Jul 6 2019,positive,godzilla is truly king
Jul 6 2019,positive,fans of godzilla the titans or kaiju in general will be thrilled the plot may be a bit shaky but who the hell cares its a movie about giant monsters battling for supremacy winner winner chicken dinner
Jul 6 2019,positive,the movies really kept my interest
Jul 6 2019,negative,not a huge godzilla fan but this movie was okay 
Jul 6 2019,positive,the plot and cgi nice to see a woman create disaster kinda like eve getting adam to bite the apple from the tree of knowledge
Jul 6 2019,positive,if you watch godzilla king of the monsters looking for a good story you will be sorely disappointed as what little story there is here is incredibly weak and illogical basically a group of ecoterrorists are awakening kaiju to follow king ghidora in destroying humanity in order to prevent our destruction of the planet its stupid and defies logic that even the most zealous eco warrior would happily go along with this sort of plan but someone in the writing team thought this was a good idea as did someone who greenlit the script so what do i know this also falls foul of the common blockbuster curse in throwing in a pointless comic relief character in the form of dr stanton he doesnt bring anything to the story and isnt funny in the slightest    thankfully if your here for kaiju v kaiju action then youve come to the right place ditching the slow build of the previous film which i personally loved this film goes straight into the action pitting godzilla against ghidora early on in explosive encounter and it doesnt let up ending with a thrilling finale sadly there are a few cutaways im guessing due to budget restrictions that do take you out of the action a bit with great action and effects godzilla king of the monsters should prove a fun watch for anyone that can look past its flaws
Jul 6 2019,negative,but thats just because its not my kinda movie i fell asleep but i heard it was excellent
Jul 6 2019,positive,i overlooked whats really important of the motion picture i believe they attempt to cause individuals to be aware of the climate changes or something different slow action for a horrendous beasts
Jul 6 2019,positive,i love it cant wait for 2020 movie 
Jul 6 2019,positive,seriously this becomes my favorite movie its a total fanservice just perfect 3 
Jul 6 2019,negative,did not like the story for this creatures boring only the last fight was good which was last 15mins of a 2hr movie
Jul 6 2019,positive,as far as monster movies go this is king 
Jul 6 2019,positive,i really liked the movie 
Jul 6 2019,positive,everything the original fans asked for
Jul 6 2019,positive,i wish there was more kaiju like godzilla is a monster movie not human but i do like the plot not the best but not the worst when one of the main charactera died i didnt really notice it at first it took a sic for me to realized the person dies in all that chaos in winterfall it was hard to make out i wish one of technology characters would have said something but like they all kinda of ignore it or dont really mention that death like there is also some side characters to me that felt like they had to much screen time like they didnt contribute that much to the story honestly in my opinion i think you could have made them a background characters and it felt like there was a spark love between the main guy character and a main girl side character but nothing happened between them so that got me confused but back to the movie thats supposed to be about godzilla i love all the scenes that had him in it i love his design his roar his breath attack all of it i love and i kinda wish they explored more with the other kaiju like they metion kong bit never show him or they dont really show the other kaiju either like there is 4 main monsters godzilla mothra rodan and king ghidorah there was even a muto i wish we got to see the others in action more but thats fine the scene with the other main kaiju was amazing the fights in my opinion was beautifully done the fight with godzilla and ghidorah in the ocean was amazing it shows how dominant godzilla is in water  its what it looked like to me but on land it seems that ghidorah has the advantage but all the kaijus designs are beautiful or badass looking rodans design was amazing i love how it looks like he had firelave in him mothra at first i was iffy but then i loved how she looked goddess that can fight back and ghidorahs design as well his breath attack amazing i loved how it looked he is one of the most badass villains out there and i love how all three of his heads had there own mind overall this movie was amazing
Jul 6 2019,positive,not a fan of this movie
Jul 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was such a triumph of modernizing that which kaiju fans love so much about the earlier japanese movies monster fights interesting plot and motivations and amazingly rendered versions of our favorite monsters i cant wait to see where they take this monsterverse
Jul 6 2019,positive,compared to all the other godzilla movies it was probably one of the best ones they made
Jul 6 2019,positive,this movie isnt very character driven but its a ton of fun to watch
Jul 6 2019,positive,except she is a she lol always the best story no matter how its told 
Jul 5 2019,positive,good movie but human characters dragged it a bit down
Jul 5 2019,positive,i love godzilla movies  the japanese original is one of the greatest movies ever made the rest are consistently at least entertaining  this one yeah its fun  its not great but its godzilla and its fun  they go much bigger with the number of fan monsters and i enjoyed that and even throw in some new ones  there isnt anything cinematically notable like there was in the last american film this time around though  that one had such a sense of scale to it and this one its really just a monster movie  but as far as monster movies go its a pretty good one  i wish there was more light during the monster fights and for that matter i just wish there were more monster fights despite what people are saying i dont think this is the nonstop monster brawl thats been advertised but for what we got i enjoyed it  look im a simple man you give me two giant creatures punching each other im happy  this movie did that

Jul 5 2019,positive,old school greatness
Jul 5 2019,positive,i love it it reminds me the old times
Jul 5 2019,positive,i had a few issues with the movie first being that the story didnt make sense at times i frequently found myself questioning motivations of the characters and looking for logic or realism in writing where there wasnt more importantly was my disappointment in the lazy design of the monsters textures and colors blended together into a miasma that left all battle scenes a muddy mess the darkness of the shots left any hope of seeing anything to just that hope i mean this is a monster movie we came to see the monsters fight and that we did not get
Jul 5 2019,negative,godzilla doesnt attract fans because of plot this movie tried way too hard to make humans important and mostly showed humans shooting themselves in the foot the last 1520 minutes is solid
Jul 5 2019,positive,in anticipation of godzilla vs kong ive decided to rewatch all the previous monsterverse movies the second godzilla movie had an amazing trailer with the clair de lune orchestral song it still is one of the best trailers to come out in a long time the trailer was so good that i decided to watch this movie in the theatre on day one in imax however i came out of it with a mixed thought towards it the premise is members of the cryptozoological agency monarch face off against a battery of godsized monsters including the mighty godzilla who collides with mothra rodan and his ultimate nemesis the threeheaded king ghidorah when these ancient superspeciesthought to be mere myths rise again they all vie for supremacy leaving humanitys very existence hanging in the balance so has my feelings towards the movie changed or do i still have the same mixed thoughts    the biggest praise i have is that they used godzilla monsters from japanese movies the mutos from godzilla 2014 were fine but not memorable here the monsters are all different and unique mothra looks beautiful rodan looks scary and ghidorah looks grand they all have great monster designs that stick in your mind with ghidorah looking like he could take on the legendary godzilla the cgi visual effects and sound effects are all phenomenal too another big problem in godzilla 2014 was the lack of godzilla and that has been addressed godzilla appears way more and does a lot more fighting this time    on that note the action scenes are still exhilarating to watch it is also better choreographed than the previous monsterverse movies which mean more exciting titan action visually the movie is also gorgeous to look at thanks to the cinematography by lawrence sher some stunning wide shots illustrate the massive nature of these titans the director also uses brighter colours plus a lot of colour blue compared to godzilla 2014 which makes a lot of the scenes more visible including the action scenes i also really loved the score by bear mccreary who incorporates the classic themes in japanese godzilla into the movie it elevates a lot of the scenes and makes them feel grander    unfortunately the story is incredibly stupid and ridiculous previous monsterverse movies had simple plots that just revolve around getting from point a to b with the monster story happening concurrently with the humans however here the humans play a central part in what is happening with the monsters causing the focus to be on the humans rather than the titular godzilla the main plot shoved in our face is the human family the orca a magical plot device that affects the titans and some ecoterrorist the human family soap drama is genuinely dumb and the orca is constantly used to do whatever bs the plot requires there are also some ecoterrorist and their plan is evil yet the movie somehow wants to justify their plan when its dumb these stories hog a lot of screentime and it especially affects the pacing in the second act by spending too long on it that i was getting bored     its made worse by the fact that the characters are no longer just uninteresting but downright hateable dr mark russell kyle chandler is the main lead who lost his son because of these titans and hates them including godzilla he gets an arc where he likes them more now because the plot needed him to be i guess dr emma russell vera farmiga is marks exwife who believes letting all the titans wake up is going to be great for the world her plan is stupid and because of her a bunch of people died yet the movie still want the audience to feel for her madison russell millie bobby brown is mark and emmas daughter who sides with her mum but then changes her mind none of these 3 main characters sounds remotely interesting but youre going to spend the most time with all these 3 there are also some other onedimensional supporting characters including some from the original godzilla 2014 but they are all incredibly bland as well    on that note the tone of this movie is quite comedic and more farfetched compared to godzilla 2014 sadly none of the quips is very funny and it can even clash with the moments which are meant to be serious for example there is a scene where the human characters found something astonishing so a natural reaction is oh my god but then another character adds zilla to the end of it and i cringed from the stupidity of that line there are a couple of other moments that feel like that and it just doesnt work some death scenes occur which the movie attempts to make sad but it doesnt work as the human characters are forgettable and it then gets overshadowed by jokes or dumb dialogue    overall godzilla king of the monsters is very silly and tries to incorporate a serious human story in it but fails miserably nevertheless the visual effects and the monster battles are still great which in the end might be all that people want after watching this though i want a movie with better human characters though because the monsterverse so far still cant provide it
Jul 5 2019,positive,loved that it was kept based on the original 
Jul 5 2019,positive,the example for all monster movies   yes

Jul 4 2019,positive,popcorn fun nice visual and large monsters  it is fun  for what it intends to be otherwise storyline and performances are met with expectations given it is a monster movie
Jul 4 2019,positive,great movie would reccomend to watch
Jul 4 2019,negative,well i am a fan of godzilla and have been for many decades oh i did not like the movie at all it seemed to be muddled confusing and the original concept of godzilla lost seemed like nothing more than a monster movie
Jul 4 2019,negative,trash movie the writing ruined it
Jul 3 2019,positive,i loved the big fight scenes its a monster movie im glad there wasnt that much human emotion that appealed to the story it was just enough to include it in there for a story to form around

Jul 3 2019,positive,loved how it made sense to the old movies and the action was awesome
Jul 3 2019,positive,this movie was everything i wanted and then some  ghidora was a bad ass who was taking no prisoners and i love the control he placed on the other monsters  the godzillamothra relationship was unexpected but welcome  the monster fights were beautifully done and made you wanting more  the story was definitely well defined without it being humans trying to escape a giant jurassic park type situation like the last movie this was the best godzilla in the series rotten tomatoes needs better critics
Jul 3 2019,positive,monster battles were great story was ok
Jul 3 2019,negative,too long before the monster fight 
Jul 3 2019,positive,good special effects kinda dragged in setting up story line
Jul 3 2019,positive,grew up watching godzilla this was a modern day blast from the past the story and plot seamed a bit rushed but overall a must see for fans of the series
Jul 3 2019,negative,this is only because of the good cgi however the whole concept and story was horrible the characters werent developed to a likeable standard as i didnt care about them
Jul 3 2019,positive,fuck the human characters i need more monsters
Jul 3 2019,negative,plot sucked rotton cgi and was beyond dreadful
Jul 3 2019,positive,it is a godzilla movie if you want those big monsters fighting you wont be disappointed it has a good history with the monsters the human history is horrible but that does not matter
Jul 3 2019,positive,spectacular visual and audiolack of human character developinbut i watch godzilla to watch goddamn giant monster fight not some human bullshitso its 1010 for me
Jul 3 2019,positive,action completely from start to finish
Jul 3 2019,negative,i hated the fact that godzilla was beat up four times and that he wasnt seen as much as the other monster
Jul 3 2019,positive,hd good special effects
Jul 3 2019,positive,i really liked and enjoyed the movie i was excited to see that they followed most of the true godzilla powers but my only complaint is that we did not get to see more of the other monsters

Jul 2 2019,positive,loved the fight scenes
Jul 2 2019,negative,its a monster movie  its about monsters  you cant walk in expecting a phenomenal plot and compelling characters  the special effects were good but much was too dark to be able to tell what you were looking at the acting and the dialogue were substandard with the exceptions being millie bobbie brown ziya zhang and aisha hinds  the cool air conditioning was worth the price of admission
Jul 2 2019,positive,a classic touch to the plot if a fan of godzilla you will enjoy it  a must see
Jul 2 2019,negative,i really thought people were being just hateful in those 2 or three star reviews man were they fight the movie was just bad the story line was horrible and confusing i walked out after one hour the movie is 2hrs 12 mins i thought to myself im just sitting here wasting time  was not hard at all to walk out   bad bad movie
Jul 2 2019,positive,came to see some crazy cgi monsters fighting each other and was pleasantly surprised

Jul 2 2019,positive,everything a godzilla movie should be and a great homage
Jul 2 2019,positive,good cgi and good fights
Jul 2 2019,positive,so the story line was pretty crappy the acting was not exactly oscar worthy but oh man when my boy godzilla emerged with his theme music thundering it gave me a thrill i havent felt from a movie in a long time giant monster movies are pretty niche and most critics are not gonna sing praises about it unless they are paid by the movies to promote it i paid to watch monsters pound on each other and i was given it and more did i want to see some out of place romance bloom out of freaking no where heck no and if it did i probably would be more pissed the star attraction got the lime light and that is what mattered
Jul 2 2019,positive,better than i expected after reading some not so positive reviews  the titans fighting was pretty action packed i didnt realize there were so many  the movie had a good story line and back story as well involving family and coworkers with a surprise ending  good filming
Jul 2 2019,positive,entertaining fun to see the old classic monsters brought back to the screen
Jul 2 2019,positive,man fuck what the credits say this movie was the best hands down badass bro if its so bad why did i get a fuckin prescreening for free huh and how did the last jedi get a higher rating think about that for a minute
Jul 2 2019,positive,ive been watching godzilla movies since i was a kid so this was a must see for me honestly i really liked it if youre a fan of godzilla this is a film that you should go see 
Jul 2 2019,negative,i really wanted to like this movie  i loved the godzilla movies as a kid but hollywood just cant make em like they do in japan   too much focus and time spent on the human characters and not enough on the monsters in action
Jul 2 2019,positive,great movie  great theater like da upgrade
Jul 2 2019,positive,long live the king thats how you do godzilla

Jul 2 2019,positive,great action and special effects
Jul 2 2019,positive,too many explosives and the people were still alive  bombs always exploded by godzilla and not the other monsters   just no real story line kinda boring
Jul 2 2019,negative,they tried shoving too many things into this movie i couldnt develope a connection to the characters because they had no real development so when one diedi couldnt care less same with the monsters i had such high hopes for this movie i loved all the old japanese godzilla movies this was a let down
Jul 2 2019,positive,honestly i expected more monsters fight

Jul 2 2019,negative,godzilla weak and then stronger by nukes
Jul 1 2019,positive,it was goodnot great but itslretty much what i expected the special effects were amazing 
Jul 1 2019,negative,great monster action but stupid human drama
Jul 1 2019,positive,loved the parts with the monsters the only thing was the overly complicated human story again hollywood cant seem to understand that this kind of movie is about the audience wanting to see monster on monster action and monsters reeking havoc not complex human story on why the mother and father split up and how they feel about each other and blah blah blahleep it simple stupid
Jul 1 2019,positive,i got to be 10 years old again absolutely wonderful 
Jul 1 2019,positive,this is one of the best godzilla movies ever made
Jul 1 2019,positive,entertaining good action needed more monster fight action to much people action
Jul 1 2019,neutral,it was ok suuuuuuuper slow till the end story plot didnt make hardly any sense to me 
Jul 1 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was what i expected it to be  the monster fighting was visually fun but seemed to be trying too hard to follow the old tradition of godzilla appearing to have lost a couple of times before making a comeback for the big win  the overall storyplot and dialog was very hit and miss  several characters seemed to flipflop in their personality way too easily  the dialog would be going along ok but then someone would blurt out a statement which came out of nowhere and didnt add anything useful to the scene  on the other side of things the movie did touch on some interested ideas which should have been explored further i think and it had a number of fun cameo appearances for the truly nerdy scifi fans out there  overall it wasnt a great movie but it also wasnt nearly as bad as some of the previous attempts at modernizing godzilla
Jul 1 2019,negative,i wanted to love this movie so bad the special effects are amazing and the monsters look so great the story however is terrible and has the worst case of generic white guy saviour in any film of recent memory the worst part is hes set up to play a big part in kong vs godzilla see this movie for the amazing monster effects if nothing else but dont expect a good story
Jul 1 2019,positive,the best monster fighting movie and lore the human aspect is a little annoying  if u see this movie u will know why

Jul 1 2019,positive,while the actual plot is a bit thin the gorgeous cinematographycgi more than made up for it for me not sure how good itll be on the small screen but well worth a couple of hours on the big one
Jul 1 2019,positive,i liked that it continues from the end of the last godzilla movie
Jul 1 2019,negative,the movie was uncoordinated and confusing wasnt a good storyline hard to follow the movie ended up being boring and almost fell asleep during it wouldnt see it again and i wouldnt recommend to anyone was a waste of time and money shouldve just stayed home and watched something on netflix

Jun 30 2019,positive,great popcorn flick went in with low expectations of course thats the way to go
Jun 30 2019,positive,i liked the movie but wish there were better characters godzilla and the other monsters are great and they carry the movie when they are not on screen the movie drags   the characters that are interesting are not the lead characters so their dialogue and screen time is less which hurts the movie overall a good movie but could easily been much better

Jun 30 2019,positive,i liked everything omg the movies amazing i loved that the action starts right at the beginning of the movie
Jun 30 2019,positive,classic old style monster movie  i loved it   light on story but heavy on big monster action with a little bit of humor and drama thrown in to keep the humans interesting  the monsters are great and their actions speak for them   if you are a fan of the old godzilla and king kong monster flicks go see this one it wont disappoint
Jun 30 2019,positive,i liked the upgrade of the monsters  i was missing the sound that the original ghidorah made in the movies im looking forward to seeing more of the older monsters that godzilla would fight but very entertaining if you love godzilla movies
Jun 30 2019,positive,reminded me of the great saturday morning creature double feature with all the great monsters very enjoyable

Jun 30 2019,positive,best godzilla film i have seen in a long time
Jun 30 2019,negative,i actually fell asleep during this film it was terrible all to predictable and badly written
Jun 30 2019,positive,unbelievable special effects unreal and realism of monsters point on ive been a gojira fan for over 50 years and for the present day dipiction of the monsters is acurate to the t especially mothra cgi superb
Jun 30 2019,positive,great movie loved it 
Jun 30 2019,negative,im a fan of anything godzilla but this one was no way good if you want feel good rara cliche lines and predictable to a 8year old moments then go for it id almost want my money back and apology for this i didnt come with high hopes just wanted entertainment
Jun 30 2019,positive,the balance of action and nonoversaturation of all human scenes was perfect the cgi was captivating with how realistic the kijunot titan look millie b is a badass and i hope she gets more chances to show how to portray a strong woman
Jun 30 2019,positive,godzilla had his weakness but he also was strong and recognized evil for what it was he fought alongside humans to wipe out that evil im the end he remained king if the monsters
Jun 30 2019,positive,its a great godzilla movie nothing less hight value cast good story line great set up for the next film which could not get here soon enough ilovegodzilla
Jun 30 2019,positive,monsters cool  human story was weak
Jun 30 2019,positive,i went into this movie expecting big monster battles and thats exactly what i got incredible cgi and some of the best one shots ive seen in a movie although the plot is rather flat it makes up for it with aweinspiring special effects and action sequences
Jun 30 2019,positive,its a shame the critics cant see how satisfying this movie is it is as good as the 2014 with more monster action its better than the critics and box office would suggest hopefully box office improves and we get another sequel
Jun 30 2019,positive,storyline and effects
Jun 30 2019,positive,i grew up watching godzilla and i did it justice

Jun 30 2019,positive,great movie but i say go see it yourself to prove me wrong
Jun 29 2019,negative,too much liberal gobbledegook
Jun 29 2019,negative,godzilla is supposed to be main character and i felt we hardly saw godzilla then u have human characters running around through mass destruction during fight scene and not a scratch just ridiculous then the family dynamic was just stupid movie got boring
Jun 29 2019,positive,if there is one thing i am fing sick of it is hollywoods compulsion to wedge in the dysfunctional family dynamic  dads an ass moms an ass the kid is a messed up tool   i dont care    i want to see godzilla not some jackass family being jackasses    ruined some great kaiju action
Jun 29 2019,positive,i was never bored monster fights were awesome
Jun 29 2019,positive,best godzilla movie of all time
Jun 29 2019,positive,the studio took note that the audience wanted more godzilla and giant monster fights and less humans now we have a cinematic ride that will take you around the world and tremble before the titanic size of the creatures that came before godzilla definitely made his stance clear as the king too bad only a handful of the audience experienced his might on the big screen something about the kaiju genre just isnt clicking with the average american
Jun 29 2019,negative,ghidoras badass design is wasted in a terrible movie in addition to bad acting writing and dialogue even the monster scenes are so poorly shot shaky out of focus overcut and obscured by rain smoke fog and haze that i actually needed tylenol afterwards how hard it is to hold a camera still
Jun 29 2019,positive,love the fight scenes the cinematography in this movie was out of this world must see in theaters the story line had a bit of a twist and was ok no awards being won here but defitenly has to be watched on the big screen youll be happy you did
Jun 29 2019,positive,if you remove the family dynamic storylines that they always shove into these films you have a great monster movie
Jun 29 2019,positive,i just loved it didnt get bored even for a second
Jun 29 2019,positive,story was lacking good otherwise
Jun 29 2019,positive,this film brings in some godzilla lore which is appreciated but tries to smash in the organizationwithgoodintentions and familyfallingapartgettingbacktogether subplots that feel overused and tiring the action is decent but has too many they should be dead moments the cast is fantastic and do well with what they are given
Jun 29 2019,negative,meh it surpassed my expectations but thats not saying much
Jun 29 2019,positive,we loved it sure it has faults like being too dark to watch all the action but as far as action and seeing the powerful godzilla in all of its glory we have watched it twice already
Jun 29 2019,negative,perplexed by all of the positive fan reviews i have always felt as if the fan reviews are pretty accurate to how i rate a movie once ive seen it not this time i spent 52 for my family of four and wish i hadnt two dollars for a rental maybe not really but full movie theater price no way yes great monster fights and sounds but the storyline and acting was just plain dumb whats worse because hollywierd cannot help itself it has a scene with a 35 minute lecture about human reckless selfish and destructive behavior and what does the person do immediately after lecturing everyone else you ask do i even need to answer for the love of all mankind can hollywierd please stop pushing their propaganda down everybodys throats my family loves seeing movies but this movie was so stupid wait until it comes out on rental and you have absolutely nothing else to do
Jun 29 2019,positive,best of the godzilla movies dont be fooled by the poor online scores go see it for yourself
Jun 29 2019,positive,it was ok could have been better
Jun 29 2019,negative,i saw godzilla the other version i saw the previous one for me they are more interesting than to watch this version i literrally sleep when i watched this movies
Jun 29 2019,positive,ignore the critics on this one as a godzilla fani absolutely loved this film granted yes its not a perfect film but darn near close to being a perfect godzilla film 
Jun 29 2019,positive,i thought it was great to see all the old monsters
Jun 29 2019,positive,so cool i like that butterfly so much
Jun 29 2019,positive,if you like monsters fighting and loud roars this movie is for you
Jun 29 2019,positive,i went in to watch a epic monster giant fight spectacle  i left the theater extremely satisfied i was not disappointed at all
Jun 29 2019,positive,massive monster brawl in monster movie history  lack of drama and just a lazy writing
Jun 29 2019,positive,great movie loved when they used the old the song of the godzilla movies
Jun 29 2019,positive,cant get enough of godzilla watched his movies since the 1960s get back in the studio and create some more
Jun 29 2019,positive,great monster movie 
Jun 29 2019,negative,basically if you watched the trailer then you have seen 90 percent of the monsters fight the humans story is dull and heavily underwhelming to the point where its hard to sit through it all
Jun 29 2019,positive,as a kid i grew up watching cartoons professional wrestling kung fu theater and the monster hour on tv on  the weekends id be sprawled on the couch with mt dew beef jerky pillsbury cinnamon buns and my comics and writingart tablet and just enjoy the whole experience godzilla and all the kaiju films are just fun popcorn flicks theyre meant to be this film met what the kid i was enjoyed big monsters throwing each other into the ropes and coming flying off the top rope at each otherall to set up their finishing moves u had fun and enjoyed this movie it is what it should be and doesnt try to be anything else
Jun 29 2019,positive,it is what you would expect from a godzilla movie
Jun 29 2019,positive,awesome special effects
Jun 29 2019,negative,the fight scenes between the monsters was actually good but the family story in the middle of this was a complete generic cliche and frustrating story line it actually makes you angry watching how stupid the human plot line was here 
Jun 29 2019,negative,wasnt the point of the movie the monsters fighting  why didnt the monsters fight and the few times they did why didnt we get to see it
Jun 29 2019,positive,i went in with low expectations and got completely surprised with how good it was game of thrones monsters edition
Jun 29 2019,positive,its a monster battle royale what more do you want
Jun 29 2019,positive,i just saw godzilla king of monsters and unlike what critics say i thought it was a really good film this movies action sequences and visuals effects were one of the greatest that ive not only seen this year but of all time as well the designs of all the creatures were absolutely gorgeous including the lovelybeautiful queen of monsters herself mothra its about time we see a monster movie where we get to see even up close the awesome looking legendary monsters however even though the technical departments for this movie did a great job the literarydrama department i hate to say executed rather not as strong the acting was good at best only a couple of human characters were memorable the storywriting was weak and tbh the real award winners in this movie were the monsters overall even though it wasnt a critics favorite this still was a movie made for the dedicated godzilla fans out there in the world now i may not be one of them fans but i can assure yall that im not one of the 60 rotten tomato critics that thought the movie was terrible either its an 710 from me
Jun 29 2019,neutral,let the monsters fight 
Jun 29 2019,positive,absolutely what i was wanting to see goji is love
Jun 29 2019,positive,cgi is amazing overall a good movie which i would recommend to all of my friends
Jun 28 2019,positive,loved it dont see how the tomatometer isnt certified fresh here the story is good despite what the critics have to say besides people are more there for the monsters and action than for the little people we dont notice or care about as much
Jun 28 2019,positive,the movie was awesome just didnt like that the humans had to help godzilla
Jun 28 2019,positive,the ultimate fan tribute to any godzilla fan from godzillas iconic theme to movie easter eggs this is the film that all godzilla fans have been waiting for
Jun 28 2019,positive,an excellent monsterfight movie with just enough human drama to occasionally explain important plot points and crack a joke
Jun 28 2019,positive,the awakening of the monsters
Jun 28 2019,positive,all of the old time monsters were incorporated
Jun 28 2019,positive,best godzilla yet battle scenes were worth seeing alone on a big screen decent story as well worth the price of admission
Jun 28 2019,positive,ive been a fan of godzilla for a very long time this might be one of the best ones ever made
Jun 28 2019,positive,it was a godzilla movie done very well huge emphasis on the monster fights as it should be
Jun 28 2019,positive,its an a increidable movie and beautifull visual efects  its the best american godzilla movie
Jun 28 2019,positive,the action scenes were amazing but too much exposition in between loved the easter eggs calling back to the classic movies
Jun 28 2019,positive,u wanna see a good version check the lates japanese version wanna just pass soem time this is ok worth to watch on the big screen to see giant monsters
Jun 28 2019,positive,the movie is great the fights are awesome and the  characters  are good i went out of the movie speechless sure i have a bit of bias as a godzilla fan but it was awesome but its far from perfect for one most of the monster fights have cut a lot of cut aways one minute its the humans the next its the monsters it works for the first and final fight sense those fights last a long time but it doesnt work in between another small thing to criticize is that while the characters are good theirs a lot of them and its hard to keep track     as a hole its flawed but a great godzilla movie with lots of action id say give it a wat 
Jun 28 2019,negative,the movie was too loud and the story did not tied well together
Jun 28 2019,positive,would have liked to have seen more of the monsters and battles
Jun 28 2019,positive,fights and the visuals were spectacular
Jun 28 2019,positive,i loved it sure the story is a little weak but its monsters come on lol
Jun 28 2019,negative,i am an avid movie watcher and this was one of the worst movies i have ever  and i mean ever  seen the script was horrible from start to finish and without giving anything away i felt the plot had political overtones was extremely stupid and preachy the entire premise for godzilla  other monsters even being alive was sooooooo stupid that it pretty much ruined the entire movie outside of the cgi action scenes  fights with the monsters the movie sucked  and some of the closeup action sequences were a garbled mess where you could hardly see what was going on amongst all the explosions and such the more panoramic action scenes were much better as you could see what was going on and get a feel for the enormity of the cgi monsters and what was going on the 2014 movie was so much better this was a waste of money honestly at this point in time i consider the godzilla franchise pretty much dead no way am i even considering future garbage from the people who now sit behind the helm for making these movies i hear that their next endeavor if this loser of a title godzilla vs king kong wtf honestly one of the dumbest ideas in the history of dumb ideas i dont recall godzilla and king kong having even been mentioned as being in existence in one movie  until now  let alone having a rivalry with one another and an eventual fight just another stupid idea for a plot  movie line want to see godzilla king of the monsters wait for it to come to netflix youll be glad you didnt waste your money seeing it at the movie theatre
Jun 28 2019,neutral,great monster battles that wear thin the movie begins to feel long and overly cheesy 
Jun 28 2019,positive,it was a good action movie but too predictable
Jun 28 2019,positive,if you are a true godzilla fan then youll know why i gave it a 3 out of 5 if you go see it for any new godzilla movie fans out there you will probably think the movie is amazing bc of its all star cast
Jun 28 2019,positive,great visuals but for some reason the story fell flat it has all the elements to succeed but it doesnt the twist was ok it was entertaining enough great way to learn godzilla mythology b
Jun 28 2019,positive,its a nice move worth a one time watch not as much violence
Jun 28 2019,positive,i was engaged and in awe thruout  very impressed loved it
Jun 28 2019,positive,it was a great movie that i took my son to view we loved it
Jun 28 2019,negative,no story line bad acting it was pure crap
Jun 28 2019,positive,i had never seen any of the godzilla movies so ibwas hesitant about going to see this i was more than pleasantly surprised original story with great effects and action milly bobby  brown gave a great performance as well
Jun 28 2019,positive,great movie for all the godzilla lovers out there  looking forward to the next movie
Jun 28 2019,positive,good but  predictable  i would watch the again
Jun 28 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is the sequel to the 2014 hit godzilla this film wastes no time getting into where our main hero has been gojira has been missing for 5 years and once king ghidorah rodan and mothra awaken the throne is wide open i really was impressed with our human characters in madison millie bobby brown emma vera farmiga and mark kyle chandler as the russell family trying to rekindle their relationship while grieving the loss of andrew the film really picks up in the second act with gorgeous cinematography from lawrence sher and enthralling music by bear mccreary who also brings back the iconic 1954 theme spectacular action from start to finish that made me cry the titans all had their fair share to shine and seeing them once again but on the big screen just absolutely incredible long live the king
Jun 28 2019,positive,i liked this movie the monsters and ken watanabe were great    the only downside is the humans everything relating to them ranged from bad to tolerable    other than that solid movie
Jun 28 2019,negative,such bad acting n no storyline
Jun 28 2019,positive,it was a fun monster movie thats for sure but otherwise not great it seemed like they had all these one liners that they had to have in there and planned a lot of the dialog around that but i like that they kept a similar feel to the first movie of this generation where a lot of the monster fight scenes are from the human perspective so it feels really chaotic feels more like youre there
Jun 28 2019,positive,great action some very bad acting but the monsters were great
Jun 28 2019,positive,amazing movie  great action visual effects and acting as a true fan of the original godzilla franchise and current monsterverse this movie is out of this world dont listen to the critics listen to the fans 
Jun 28 2019,negative,i wanted to see the movie from the amazing trailers what i got was some human interest garbage with a dash of i guess we promised monsters huh    godzilla king of the monsters does not deliver on the promises made by the trailers it fails on nearly every level this is a definitively awful film i want my money back quite honestly  i didnt pay to see a lukewarm film about a broken family gone weird i paid to see godzilla and co wrecking the hell out of one another     when the human interest subplot  and it should have been a subplot  overshadows the main plot entirely and in all the worst ways  perhaps the studios should reconsider using it nevermind the casting choices and rampant racism  some of which calls back to godzillas origins    not godzilla starring the conjuring woman making pathos eyes 11 from stranger things and some evil british dude   with a dude that cant act but no one cares except that hes annoying and makes the im having a thought face racist asian tropes x3 the pervy tech guy black scientist and that dude that always plays bad news military dude in every movie  and ur lgbtq hook the hot bald military chick tm    oh and then some fsking monsters that you actually paid to see but even when theyre on screen for the epic battle time that we all paid to see movie gonna cut away to the human interest garbage we didnt care about    utter fail 010 would not recommend 
Jun 28 2019,positive,to put it simply this is the best godzilla movie yet
Jun 28 2019,positive,the special effects were great and hearing the original godzilla score was also great to listen too the story was a bit stretched
Jun 28 2019,positive,this movie is awesomethe monster is beautifuli loved the cgi its looked so realand the scoring is great
Jun 28 2019,positive,the monsters didnt feel present the plot was better then expected

Jun 27 2019,negative,not as impressed with it but was something to kill a few hours
Jun 27 2019,positive,i loved this movie i went through so many emotions i cried for a few scenes which i know you wouldnt think in action film but if youve always loved godzilla and been a fan of mothrayoull understand it wasnt cheesy it was perfect best summer movie for me at least i cant wait to go back and see it again worth 2 hours
Jun 27 2019,positive,this movie delivers on everything you loved about the old japanese godzilla movies and exceeds expectations the monster screen time has been greatly ramped up which was always the reason you watched a godzilla movie from the start the battles are visually glorious and the musical score paired with the fight scenes drives home how epic it really is     this movie sets the bar for the monsterverse and is without question an entertaining and enthralling movie to watch its going to be tough waiting months for it to release on 4k to bring home and watch over and over again
Jun 27 2019,positive,i grew up watching monster films with my dad so my opinion is heavily influenced by that but i really enjoyed the movie the monsters designs are gorgeous and even if i wasnt a gojira fan myself until now i was astonished with the fact that they put his classic iconic roar and also mothras theme   i mean lets be honest guys you dont buy a ticket for a godzilla movie hoping to watch a deep story you buy a ticket for this kind of movies when you want to see big monsters beating the sht out between themself  sooo taking that in consideration for me it was a cool movie it surpassed my expectations and im looking forward for 2020s godzilla vs king kong
Jun 27 2019,positive,special effects are awesome godzilla is human go to punch when all hell breaks loose
Jun 27 2019,positive,if you watch this movie only for the giant monters attacking each other you will love it

Jun 27 2019,negative,terrible the human characters are such unlivable unsympathetic idiots i was hoping they would die if i had a nickel for every time a character yelled hang on as the monsters created yet another shockwave of some sort i could buy this franchise and do better with it cool monsters though

Jun 27 2019,negative,horrible horrible story line movie takes itself way too seriously credit to the actors for doing their lines without laughing
Jun 27 2019,neutral,the plot is what hurt the film not the great monster sequences
Jun 27 2019,positive,its the kind of movie that you must see to believe 
Jun 27 2019,positive,the special effects and cgi were great the story line was hard to follow and the script wasnt polished there were one than one corny scene where characters are just standing there amid total chaos and destruction when they should have running their butts off to safety i would not recommend to a friend

Jun 27 2019,negative,i cannot believe that its still playing in the movie theater  please save your time and   i need my  back  i shouldve trusted the tomatometer on this one

Jun 26 2019,positive,is the best movie of kayjus 
Jun 26 2019,positive,contrary to the critical response i thought a bit less human story wouldve given the film a better pacing as it stood it often brought the film to a standstill instead of slowing it a bit which seemed to be the intent
Jun 26 2019,positive,plenty of fun monster on monster violence and overall a great popcorn flick  the biggest knock for me was the story seemed a little thin this time around  like i said though its a kaiju popcorn flick im not expecting ocscar caliber story from it
Jun 26 2019,positive,it was okay to me my son loved it declared it his new favorite movie
Jun 26 2019,negative,i was not great no plot line and had a weak story
Jun 26 2019,positive,the action scenes was great but the acting was terrible

Jun 26 2019,positive,loved it to the critics that disliked the human elements its a monster movie
Jun 26 2019,negative,it was too loud and to much killing
Jun 26 2019,positive,if youre looking for relatable characters or deep character building this is not the movie for you this is all monster action the human characters take a back seat in this film and though not terrible they do enough where it isnt bad if you want to see great monster action this is it this is a great movie if you have a great home sound system and a good quality tv 
Jun 26 2019,positive,we really enjoyed the movie it had us on the edge of our seats
Jun 26 2019,negative,kinda cheesy too many close up one liner sayings how many times is godzilla gonna save someone at the last second the plot is the guy finds his family daughter and saves her but at the cost of how many other people id give it 1 star but the cgi is good enough for 2
Jun 26 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsterss all over the place story is made up for with pure unbridled spectacle you have to appreciate how far weve come from old men in halloween costumes
Jun 26 2019,positive,i liked the modeling of the monsters but the plot was slowly paced
Jun 26 2019,positive,if wwe had an allmonster royal rumble this would be it
Jun 26 2019,positive,this movie gives you everything you want to see when it comes to a godzilla film limits the amount of boring dialog and gives you all the action you ask for the music is perfect for eaxh monster and gives tribute to the legacy of godzilla 
Jun 26 2019,positive,absolutely incredible for godzilla fans the filmmakers are obviously fans themselves and it shows tons of easter eggs and nods to the franchises past especially the score  great summer movie for anyone looking to enjoy a fun night out
Jun 26 2019,positive,big great fun but not enough monster screen time watanabi was brilliant tho
Jun 26 2019,positive,a sequel to the 2014 film this movie strays away from the core problem of the first movie making it about humans and their personal problems with the monsters being more an eye of the storm and instead tries and fails to play the profound route with the imbalance of nature and man only to toss that aside for awesome giant monster fights since thats what we all really came to see all while embellishing its clear cut political agenda down our throats like so many damn filmmakers have been doing these days we did not come to see that     to the movies credit and it deserves a lot of that hollywood expands on their godzilla lore in this film making nods to many of his old foesallies and even threw in a reference to king kong a few times the nod to mothras origins for example was wonderful it took the point of godzilla being king of the monsters too literally all while making him weaker than any of his japanese incarnations but worth a watch
Jun 26 2019,positive,good movie if you like godzilla movies at least their lips matched what they were saying i enjoyed it 
Jun 26 2019,positive,action from beginning to the end
Jun 26 2019,positive,i liked this movie a lot more than the other reboot they did a year or two ago less human drama more monster fights win in my book 
Jun 26 2019,positive,nothing new more monsters more noise
Jun 26 2019,positive,i loved godzilla kotm when the big g and mothra appear on the screen with their respective music themes was an emotional ride for me not that i mentioned the whole movie was like a ride pretty amazing
Jun 26 2019,positive,lots of monster fights this is exactly what i wanted focused a little less on the human story and more on the titans but still kept an elemental play from the human side but not too much to overshadow anything
Jun 26 2019,negative,this movie was fiendish zero plot terrible writing bad story actors were trash and i couldnt understand half of them millie was cool and finally you ears will lose their virginity to earape if you are currently heading to this movie turn around and go home place your money in the toilet then drop a humongous deuce on top of the money flush the toilet and watch it swirl around congratulations you have spent your money wisely and seen something better than godzilla
Jun 26 2019,positive,i loved the story line and the second half of the movie
Jun 26 2019,positive,loved the special effects and content

Jun 26 2019,positive,my 8 year old grandson loved this movie its not a classic but it is a pretty good godzilla movie
Jun 26 2019,positive,more true to form than the first very enjoyable
Jun 26 2019,positive,im an old school godzilla fan from back in the 70s i enjoyed this movie very much if you like monster fighting this movie is for you the tomatometer being 41 is misleading since the audience score is 83 believe the people not the critics 
Jun 26 2019,negative,usually dont agree with the tomatometer but do this time preachy and not much fun story is very weak didnt care about the characters and no security at the monster containment sites really the best line in the movie was with parent like you two i would run away from home too also really bugged by the number of v22 osprey used by monarch since there are only a couple hundred or so in service it looks neat but there is a reason lots of flaws it took nearly 20 years to get them accepted in the military the girl from stranger things is getting typedcast crying putting her hands over her ears and screaming seems to be her specialty according to the movie the likable monsters should just kill the human infestation and save the planet or at least the writers and producers of this movie maybe they will get back to the fun of monster movies with king kong like when he tried to checkout godzillas tonsils with a tree in the old movie glad we waited and went on the cheap day
Jun 26 2019,positive,great movie it was all i hoped to see monsters kicking ass
Jun 26 2019,positive,my inner 10 year old was truly happy to watch these iconic and amazing creatures come to life in this movie  it was a excellent popcorn movie and i had zero issues with the story  the battles were epic and now i want more
Jun 26 2019,positive,i loved the monsters
Jun 26 2019,negative,this was a waste of time and money the story was terrible the dialogue predictable and visuals not impressive too many stupid scenarios to even list avoid it or wait until it streams for free
Jun 26 2019,positive,i felt the movie was an excellent sequel and had more heart and a deep connection to the idea of humanity vs nature and the idea of coexisting that where up against in todays world freaking fascinating visual elements and story arc cant wait for  godzilla v kong
Jun 26 2019,positive,i loved it  i can understand dome people having issues with the family drama at the center of the himan element  however just about everything else works beautifully the world building with the monsters and monarch  the fights were clear and engaging  and the homages to the earlier films were immensely satisfying 
Jun 26 2019,positive,beyond my expectations
Jun 25 2019,positive,checks all of the boxes for a monster movie a lot more of the action we wanted that we didnt get in the first film king gives us plenty to feast our senses on and looking forward to the ultimate showdown with kong
Jun 25 2019,positive,the most fun ive had in the movies in a really long time check it out i say this as a normal guy who does not know much about godzilla
Jun 25 2019,positive,too much action not enough plot development
Jun 25 2019,positive,movie is fucking brilliant
Jun 25 2019,positive,it was alright there werent much character development
Jun 25 2019,negative,it was just ok  not very memorable

Jun 25 2019,positive,good monster battles with some send ups to the classic kaiju movies
Jun 25 2019,positive,it was about the monsters finally which is what all good godzilla movies focus on
Jun 25 2019,positive,great movie overall
Jun 25 2019,positive,the acting wasnt good the dialog was corny and there were lots of monsters fighting each other  in other words  this was a good godzilla movie    i didnt expect this  the previous godzilla movie from 2014 was a modern big budget action film version of the godzilla story  it wasnt very good because it focused mainly on the human characters and seldom showed the actual monsters  it took itself too seriously and lost the humor intended or not and chessiness of the classic monster movies  this new movie brought all that back but with good cg and lots of references to those classic stories    if youre a fan of the original movies i think youll like this one  dont expect the plot to make sense or the screenwriting to win any oscars  this is about huge monsters fighting each other and people and cities getting in the way
Jun 25 2019,positive,it was a great movie and would watch again
Jun 25 2019,positive,they did well wasnt as predictable as most films today new ideas were executed without ruining godzillas traditional characteristics action packed best for kids it was a lot to sit through the last showing as a middle aged guy
Jun 25 2019,positive,exactly what i wanted from a kaiju movie non stop amazing monster fights the cgi was amazing the sound design was top notch and the run time was adequate i remember watching the original godzilla movies while i was watching this new one the genre has improved so much and stayed true to itself this time way better than the reboot godzilla film beware little kids might be get too scared while watching this one 
Jun 25 2019,positive,this was a fun movie romp
Jun 25 2019,positive,loved special effects
Jun 25 2019,positive,i thought it was a great movie i enjoyed the references and easter eggs in the movie it was exciting and showed plenty monsters and fights there was no overload of characters or subplots to drown out the main plot there was only one subplot which was great for the most part the plots directly linked with the story and actually amounted to something i dont get why critics call the plot one dimensional many people i know who are not godzilla fans liked it the oxygen destroyer set up a certain mutated crustacean for godzilla vs kong i noticed some of the reviewers were going out of their way to call out mike dougherty do they just dislike him the plot was not a absolutely ludicrous thing like in the hesei godzilla vs king ghidorah where the time travel made no sense the way the monsters were introduce earlier rather than an hour late in the movie godzilla city on the edge of battle stop being contradictory and complaining when godzilla isnt in the film enough or if he is in it too much the humans were definitely not the main focus the focus was on mothra rodan ghidorah and godzilla himself to those who know little about godzilla dont complain about the random fact the ghidorah was a alien because it was not random ghidorah was originally introduced as an alien so i liked how they didnt forget thatthe death of serizawa was paying tribute to the original movie but enough about references one point i hear a lot is that the plot was awful and not exciting at all i was on the edge of my seat during the movie and any plot can be considered bad take endgame for example you could argue that the time travel plot is dumb because so many movies do that godzilla king of the monsters did not take forever to get to a steady and fun plot in endgame the plot took ages and i actually got bored during the time travel adventures im not saying endgame is a bad movie i am just saying i did not enjoy it as much as i enjoyed godzilla king of the monsters my sister who thinks godzilla is not interesting gave the movie a 71 out of 100 the other seventeen monsters were not the main focus either they were a subplot i wish we had seen more of them but i am satisfied i am not saying this movie is flawless because no movie is perfect this movie does not deserve such a horrible rating and it needs to be changed cant wait for godzilla vs kong in 2020
Jun 25 2019,positive,great action and length of movie
Jun 25 2019,positive,enjoyed watching godzilla i thought it was an action pack new version of the throwback  godzilla movies

Jun 25 2019,positive,it was good but it needed more monsters
Jun 25 2019,positive,great movie nice balance of human story and monster battles
Jun 25 2019,positive,awesome to see another godzilla movie that features multiple monsters keeps the power of godzilla present throughout the movie still explain some of the history and backstory of the monsters and of course godzilla still finishes the movie on top woo hes a beast
Jun 25 2019,positive,it was good i would like to see less about the people and more monster fighting

Jun 25 2019,positive,very entertaining  alot of action i enjoyed everything great movie i reccimmwnd it to everyone
Jun 25 2019,negative,pretty mediocre flick dealing mostly with human drama with some monster action in the background   follows predictable plotlines which weve seen before most recently in the first godzilla remake  goofy dialogue pseudo science and a too serious tone make this a tough pill to swallow the king has left the building
Jun 25 2019,positive,this movie was very entertaining i really enjoyed it for the action acting and cgi i was let down though by the story and characters seeming very unhumanlike and only there to progress the story
Jun 25 2019,positive,awesome popcorn film a must see

Jun 24 2019,positive,it was okay not as good as the past films

Jun 24 2019,positive,its a fun godzilla movie which is exactly what it needs to be there are some big problems with the human characters their motivations the plot and even a few things about the effects that dont work try and figure out how they think water displacement works but who cares youre here to watch monsters punch each other

Jun 24 2019,positive,its a godzilla movie so i didnt expect an oscar performance known thats said i thought it was great and happy i saw it on the big screen
Jun 24 2019,negative,disastrous inconsistent story telling terrible acting but i gotta think that is more of the directors doing amazing fight sequences and decent cgi nothing is at stake however no connection to any of the characters and the cliche predictability of the stories flow makes it even worse to watch 
Jun 24 2019,negative,one of the worst movies of the year they got absolutely nothing right 
Jun 24 2019,positive,four stars cause at the final fight they cockblocked the action by having the humans get in the way

Jun 24 2019,positive,great graphics and good acting
Jun 24 2019,negative,just a big jumbled mess of fighting creatures and buildings getting knocked down
Jun 24 2019,negative,every decision made by humans was the wrong one i get suspension of disbelief but things in this movie were so jarringly stupid that it kept interrupting my enjoyment of the movie this was a pretty stupid flick
Jun 24 2019,positive,there was nothing that i didnt like about it its just that it was corny because its godzilla but that was to be expected it could have been a little bit lighter some of these scenes were too dark that you cant see everything other than that i definitely recommend it
Jun 24 2019,positive,great introduction to new forms of the kaiju  looking forward to next one
Jun 24 2019,positive,the movie was great the theater sadly wouldnt turn on the ac until the movie was almost over several people complained and a few left this seems to happen alot at regal gateway  imax i doubt that ill return spoke to what seemed to be a manager on the way out he wasnt very concerned the movie was great just hard to enjoy when dripping with sweat
Jun 24 2019,negative,no storyline to follow and too much of the same thing over and over was difficult to sit through 2plus hours of this

Jun 24 2019,positive,thankfully these  new monster movies are capturing the essence of what theyre supposed to they are still not quite the blockbuster we all hope for but all in all  great entertainment
Jun 24 2019,positive,i thought all the creatures were really well done acting was ok but as it should be the stars are godzilla and the gang
Jun 24 2019,positive,i would say if you had a problem with the first movie not showing enough godzilla you will be satisfied if your looking for great character arcs like bryan cranstons character in the last film you will be disappointed if your going to see godzilla king of the monsters for human characters i ask you to read the title again you go to see godzilla the acting was alright nothing oscar worthy but they get you from battle to battle without anything bad all and all its a good action film with a decent story and great fight scenes
Jun 24 2019,positive,i loved movie as a life long godzilla fan and marvel fan the idea of a extended monsterverse is a dream come true i hope next time they spend more time on the monster fight and less on the human subplot but all and all a great fun movie
Jun 24 2019,positive,great movie kept you on the edge 
Jun 24 2019,positive,it was a great godzilla movie which doesnt make it coherent

Jun 24 2019,positive,it was a great monster movie with a valid theme they looked realistic the story was both heartwarming and sad
Jun 24 2019,positive,wildly entertaining  i liked the story line and how it played out once again the reviewers look at the artistic aspects of a movie but people just want to be entertained and have their attention captured

Jun 24 2019,negative,if i could i would give this film 0 stars cheesy dialogue sloppy plotline and low grade cgi made this one of the worst big budget movies ever made
Jun 24 2019,positive,very action packed and my 6 year old loved it
Jun 24 2019,neutral,another gzla movie nothing new
Jun 24 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie but it wasnt a super exciting movie  it was worth going to see though
Jun 24 2019,positive,great movie my family enjoy watching it
Jun 24 2019,positive,about what i expect from a movie like this so not disappointed
Jun 24 2019,positive,incredible action with each monster giving stunning visuals but everything with characters just seemed to happen without any explanation of what was going on 
Jun 24 2019,positive,brings back memories
Jun 24 2019,negative,i have never walked out of a movie in my life all i know is if i could get away with it i would punch the mot who made whis awful movie and stole my money
Jun 24 2019,negative,i was expecting more then the previous i took two naps during the movie because it was to boring
Jun 24 2019,positive,love the non stop action
Jun 24 2019,negative,its seen movie around computer graphics and loud noises
Jun 24 2019,positive,the movie was exciting
Jun 24 2019,positive,for those here who love kaiju or just any movie with giant monsters or dinosaurs who wreck it up you will love it  if you are a grump or a film snob who doesnt this isnt for you  eff box office mojo and rotten tomatoes  dont listen to the internet  needless to say waaayyyyy beter than godzilla 2014   i was disappointed with that movie though i didnt hate it like godzilla 1997 but it was just meh and king of the monsters more than makes up for it  it even ups the game from kong skull island a movie i loved the monster fights are absolutely awesome  king ghidorah was fantastic  so was rodan and mothra   godzilla was epic  unlike 2014 this movie has the heart and soul and easter eggs that captures the essence of the toho godzilla films especially the 1990searly 2000s era the human drama is stupid but that is the same for all godzilla films but it was much more toned down from the 2014 movie  stay to the end because they have a marvel style post credit scene and its not exactly what you expect  
Jun 23 2019,positive,the movie in all very entertaining the only thing that brings it down is when as usual the humans are on the screen the acting is over the top and the decision made by the humans mostly get in the way everybody thinks they are right i would give them about 22 on that only when the monsters are on screen does this movie really rocks so if you can get by the humans tripping over each other enjoy a fairly good godzilla movie
Jun 23 2019,positive,visually very stunning but needed to spend less time on the human drama
Jun 23 2019,positive,it was arom i like my big boy godzill staing up as the true king of the mosters  
Jun 23 2019,positive,it was a great movie
Jun 23 2019,positive,i have seen all the godzilla movies and at least this one look a lot more like it was real then the other  the movies plot was good but it looked like they cut a lot out of the file  it was good  but   next time dont cut it so much  we like long movies if they are good   this one could have been great
Jun 23 2019,negative,the movie was incredibly boring and honestly felt like it had been thrown together by a high school film class the fight scenes which shouldve been the best part of the film were far and in between and when they came up so poorly directed and lit that you could hardly pay attention to them vera farminga is quite possibly the only redeeming quality 
Jun 23 2019,positive,loved it it gave me exactly what i wanted liads of kaiju fun and mayhem id rather see a dozen godzilla movies than one smarmy critic approved snoozefest featuring boring twits siyting around talking about their feelings 
Jun 23 2019,positive,um if  gidirah had taken over what would humans have done
Jun 23 2019,positive,great movielots of great fight scenes
Jun 23 2019,positive,action from beginning to the end definitely cant wait for whats next
Jun 23 2019,positive,we got to see more than just destruction from godzilla and we learned about the other titans and several in particular there was a great story and i didnt have it all figured out right away there was good plot twists throughout thank you for entertainment with amazing cgi
Jun 23 2019,positive,awesome movie all around dont know why critics are bashing it for the lack of backstory behind the people i thought they all had plenty of backstory and guess what its not about the humans story its about the monsters
Jun 23 2019,negative,the writing and acting
Jun 23 2019,positive,it being a 2hr movie really allowed them to build out a suspenseful story line my apple watch kept telling me that my hear was racing lok
Jun 23 2019,positive,i liked that there was a story and it was enjoyable
Jun 23 2019,positive,its a godzilla movie expect that  youll enjoy it 
Jun 23 2019,positive,all the fun of the classics but with awesome visuals
Jun 23 2019,positive,ask yo mama what she liked about it and itll probably be all the asses sizzling
Jun 23 2019,positive,good monster action the fights between ghidorah rodan mothra and big g were awesome cant wait to see what kong v godzilla looks like  gojira
Jun 23 2019,positive,i loved the movie tons of action
Jun 23 2019,positive,fun monster movie exactly what i wanted sure there are some plot holes but see it anyway fun and cool youll love it when the giant monsters fight
Jun 23 2019,positive,couldnt give a shit less about the humans why would anyone watch a gojira movie for the human dumbasses who think its just a normal movie and not a god damn monster bash series based around the idea of a giant nuclear lizard fighting other giant ass monsters im lookin at you david edelstein and the rest of rotten tomatoes official crew yall stupid
Jun 23 2019,positive,movie was overall one of my favorite godzillas
Jun 23 2019,negative,godzilla was hard to see it was very dark the one in 2015 was a lot better story and monster cinematography was bad story line corny
Jun 23 2019,positive,you know the story and plot couldve been better but its godzilla cmon although it was very entertaining and the vfx was amazing so i personally enjoyed it very much
Jun 23 2019,positive,the movie doesnt have an overarching plot like many people look for sure it compensates for the meh story with monster fightsbut that doesnt always help people are giving an argument about how oh the story is bad but not a single second in the movie was i bored it was always fun to watch like a movie like the shining gets boring and this movie doesnt bore me with boring details about orca blah blah it shows an honest way of fan service for people to watch
Jun 23 2019,positive,king of the monsters delivers fun human characters with incredible vfx for the titans one of my favorite movies of 2019  long live the king
Jun 23 2019,positive,great monster action missing from the 1st one  a lot of kong reference setting up the next one for sure  really good movie
Jun 23 2019,positive,very confusing but good movie
Jun 23 2019,positive,a lot of fun obvious love for the series shown by the creators great fx
Jun 23 2019,positive,exactly what youre looking for monsters beating each other up and tearing apart cities good movie fun
Jun 23 2019,positive,good movie tied well to original
Jun 23 2019,negative,too dark too many characters introduced predictable worst of the series 
Jun 23 2019,negative,very cheesy but the monster fights were ok the cgi was underwhelming
Jun 23 2019,negative,visually stunning but get to the monsters fighting already so bored through most of the movie dialogue 
Jun 23 2019,positive,you have to be fan of godzilla to appreciate the movie  only disappointment was mothra but other than that great monsters served with appropriate amount of cheese   
Jun 23 2019,positive,really good cgi amazing probably the best movie in the monsterverse
Jun 23 2019,positive,amazing movie and an incredible end credits perfectly setting up the next movie godzilla vs king kong however i thought godzilla needed more screen time and the mum was the main reason why the all the tians destroyed the earth and the humans had to much screen time but as much as oh look at dragon shooting thunder at th is that a giant moth 
Jun 23 2019,negative,how can you turn such a fantastic franchise into a moralizing bs movie turn to todays hollywood  
Jun 23 2019,positive,good actors but the storyline was a bit boring and it dragged
Jun 23 2019,positive,expected it to be cheesy but it was too serious for as funny as it was
Jun 23 2019,negative,all talk from actors not enough action when there was finally action it was way too much sound effects to even enjoy the scenes
Jun 23 2019,positive,huge godzilla fan this was the best one since americans started producing them
Jun 23 2019,positive,brought back memories of childhood watching the creature double feature on saturday mornings they have have done a great job bringing back godzilla and the whole universe with these last three movies
Jun 23 2019,positive,overall it was actually boring the story became too complicated for me i think the previous movie was much much better
Jun 23 2019,neutral,im really surprised by the bad performances in this movie the plot was mediocre the 25 stars is for the action scenes which were pretty great the movie is also 45 minutes too long overall im disappointed i waited 5 years for this
Jun 23 2019,positive,i had a blast kotm was exactly what i wanted from a movie about giant monsters punching each other through buildings
Jun 23 2019,negative,idk i just didnt enjoy it and was bored an hour into it
Jun 23 2019,positive,i just saw this movie with the kids i thought it was pretty good some of the monster scenes were awesome especially almost any scene with with ghigorah the first fight scene when the air force tries to take him on was way too short i do agree with some of the audience critics  too much drama and not enough monsters thats why i only gave it a 9  i also understand why the critics are panning on it  the bad guys are ecoterrorists trying to use the monsters to cleans the earth of the human infection the head ecoterrorist is a white male so you get some socialjusticewarrior points but a tiein t environmental extremists will never play well in any press another part that is campy but minor is that the radiation given off by the monsters restores the environment it plays a very minor plot role mostly through newspaper headline flash scenes during the credit at the end so more ecotiein
Jun 23 2019,positive,its a good godzilla movie the people that complain need to watch the other 27 of them there are better and much worse 
Jun 23 2019,positive,action packed best us made godzilla so far
Jun 23 2019,positive,too long a 80 min plot stretched to 120 min    too much nonsense chatting and earth quake scene yet not enough actual visible fighting scenes 
Jun 23 2019,positive,not certain why movie not enjoy by critical elites because as a fan this was amaaazing wayy better than capt marvel and clearly better than dark phoenix so disappointed it hasnt translated into  because it was escapism fantasy epitomized with an sjw agenda being shoved down your gullet 
Jun 23 2019,positive,this one definitely felt like it was starting to really showcase godzilla like he should have been in the 2014 godzilla the universe theyre building with this and kong could have great potential but i hope they dont follow in the foot steps of the dc universe and rush the process overall though the movie is entertaining bigger than life monsters clashing from start to finish practically
Jun 23 2019,positive,monster fights were great human dialogue and script was garbage
Jun 23 2019,positive,i loved it the post credit scene is leading up to my must see of 2020 king kong vs godzilla i rate it 3 and a half
Jun 23 2019,positive,this one was definitely better than the first movie but it still has its problems the underlying plot with the humans makes no sense at all and there is one main character you will pray to die throughout the movie we do get to see more of the monster fights but they still keep cutting away to the humans too often the filmmakers need to understand we dont care about the humans just show us giant monsters    spoiler alert this part of the review contains major spoilers you have been warned  the mothers motivation for doing all this makes no sense whatsoever and you spend the whole film hoping she and her equally stupid daughter die too many cliches we get to see the person sacrificing themselves cliche twicefreakin two times and the only good part about the second one is that the annoying mother who caused all this dies there are too many last minute saves as well the kid character is useless until the last part but the movie would have been better without her making the monsters able to be controlled by sound was a poor decision the monsters are supposed to be thinking feeling titans and not a mindless herd the plot point of the government wanting to shut downtake over monarch is briefly addressed then swiftly forgotten about why does godzilla suddenly have a villain and the 2 scientists we actually like in both films die wtf the fathers character wasnt really needed either they could have just made it that the mothers betrayal is motivated by her losing her whole family and her former monarch coworkers try to track her down like they already are   heres a tip stop focusing so much on the human characters nobody cares about them i will give the makers points for starting the action in the first few minutes instead of making us wait i also praise their use of the original japanese themes for the monsters
Jun 23 2019,positive,this was such a great godzilla movie however it was so sad when mothra sacrificed herself
Jun 23 2019,positive,as godzilla fan i love every scene and action of this movie
Jun 23 2019,positive,great movie love it cant wait with king kong
Jun 23 2019,positive,best gojira ever the critics are retards
Jun 23 2019,positive,a much better than the first more action than the first and for sure more godzilla time special effects were wonderful and hope to see 3 
Jun 23 2019,neutral,fight scenes were half decent but seemed to focused not on godzilla
Jun 23 2019,positive,who cares about the critics they would say no to any movie they did not got the paid and yes to the movie like sw ep8     this movie is definitely worth your time and money if you are a fan just go to the theater when you still have chance to see it in the big screen 
Jun 23 2019,positive,nothing seemed to be based in reality but its a godzilla movie and it delivered in that aspect 100
Jun 23 2019,positive,if you like classic monster vs monster godzilla movies youll love it
Jun 23 2019,positive,loved it  i have fond memories of evenings infront of the tv watching monster movies enjoyed all the wonderful quirky parts of a monster movie including the wonderful ways the monsters emerge from earth loved that godzilla sounded like himself though he looked like he had been bulking up    cant wait until king kong vs godzilla thats going to be awesome
Jun 23 2019,neutral,as godzilla movies go this one is of better quality but as a overall film it was bad with a lazy script and horrible acting it was a pain to sit through when the titans entered on screen the movie began to be bearable although i would of liked more fighting with less cuts between the humans and monsters the visual effects were as stunning as ever the titans looked beautifully designed with clean crisp cgi and the sound would give you goosebumps from the roar of these monsters it will be interesting to see how the trilogy would end with kong vs godzilla releasing in 2020 it would be in your best interest to forget this movie and get ready for the fight of the century
Jun 23 2019,positive,good story line and awesome monsters
Jun 23 2019,positive,fantastic film some flaws but not to receive the critic rating it did however critics are morons lol 
Jun 23 2019,negative,i was fighting to stay awake and still didnt manage to
Jun 23 2019,neutral,way to ruin a film by the terrible performance of millie bobby brown and her annoying character that poorly tries to steal the show but only gets to prove that having a child actor or teenage actor in an apocaliptic movie is a huge mistake the movie contains a good premise and the acting by vera farmiga is great
Jun 23 2019,positive,good movie liked the effects
Jun 23 2019,positive,fun monster movie lots of treats excellent cast 
Jun 23 2019,positive,it was what it was supposed to be epic monster combat
Jun 23 2019,positive,for some reason people think they need to have a story in godzilla movies i like that they made the monsters the primary focus with some nonsense about eco blah blah and family neither of which anyone cares about we just want to see the big guys fight looked good will purchase on bluray upon release
Jun 23 2019,positive,monster fight yes please amazing cgi again yes please
Jun 23 2019,positive,movie is exactly what it promises epic monster fights the critics are clueless yet again
Jun 23 2019,positive,i thought it was well done i was entertained
Jun 23 2019,negative,good comedy 
Jun 23 2019,negative,it was total disappointment
Jun 23 2019,negative,too many human cutaways and they failed to create dramatic and intense fight scenes boring
Jun 23 2019,negative,godzilla is too fat looking he was weak infective and doesnt deserve the title king of monsters in this film he needs too much help to get the job done and the final fight is way over the top with cgi
Jun 23 2019,positive,this is a monster movie its title is godzilla he is the protagonist he is the hero he is the reason youre watching this movie not humans not actors not the army giant monsters fighting are the reason youre watching this movie godzilla is the reason youre watching this movie your inner child is the reason youre watching this movie if youre watching for any of the reasons above this movie will absolutely live up to your expectations and if youre watching it for anything else youre giving a big disservice to the genre this movie was easily one of my most favorite things to ever watch in the theater
Jun 23 2019,positive,movie had good pacing and character development ive heard some others say there were too many monster fights but i think they were well done and fitting to the story
Jun 23 2019,positive,critics seemed to sht on this movie for its human drama but honestly the humans werent that bad they had emotions unlike the first movie and explained what was occurring which was needed at some scenes but besides the humans the kaiju redeemed any minor problem this movie had if you came here to watch monsters kicking each others ases you will not be disappointed ill assure you that easily better than the first one this film gets 5 stars from me
Jun 23 2019,positive,enjoy this very much should  have shown more of motha would be awesome stil awesome
Jun 23 2019,positive,my first godziller movie was godzilla king of monsters 1956 with raymond burrperry mason fame all godzilla movies would measured against the 1956 movie never have seen the 1954 first run godzilla honda made his last godzilla film in 1978 but takao okawara the director of godzilla 2000 clearly knew something about the good old days that film is most notable for its lovingly inept and intentionally retrograde dialogue that is essential for good godziller good old fashion driveingrindhousemonstermovie where i always saw godzilla the change model seems to be whats up tiger sushi roll in 2000 was forgettable its esential to the movie to have garagesale special effects i hated and its return after roland emmerichs used hightech hollywood variation with a slender godzilla instead of guy in the rubbersuited godzilla of yore that was 23rd installment in the apparently unkillable franchise that honda inaugurated nearly 50 years ago g2k is just the sort of godziller gomer pyle would have not adored not dumb enough not fun not out of this world i hate destroying us cities i enjoyed japan being wrecked since dad was pow slave laborer in osaka dad would have prefer those old movies too he loved perry mason
Jun 23 2019,positive,great fights a little slow at points but damn worth it go see the king in action
Jun 23 2019,positive,epic with great visual effects and fantastic photography i do believe that the human story was a bit forced and not as logic and simple as the plot of aaron taylorjohnson elizabeth olsen and bryan cranston in the firts one overall it is a great movie to watch at the teather and it makes the godzilla universe monsterverse grown and be at its best
Jun 22 2019,positive,an spectacular technical marvel enjoyed by both newcomers and fans of everything godzilla alike 
Jun 22 2019,positive,great movie i grew up watching godzilla films and this was a great film for a godzilla fan 
Jun 22 2019,positive,if you love giant monster movies this is great but it is a monster movie
Jun 22 2019,positive,this is exactly what we wanted the critics complain about a bad plot and bad characters but the movie is called godzilla so i dont know what they expected we came here for great kaiju battles and thats what we got the special effects are some of the best ive ever seen in any movie especially for a movie of mostly cgi there are so many references to the toho movies that it almost felt like one believe it or not i actually liked the characters in this movie especially madison russle ghidorah is an absolute beast in this movie and so are the other titans godzilla king of the monsters is the definitive kaiju movie and is truly the king
Jun 22 2019,positive,this is a movie entirely for japanese godzilla fans all those people critizing this movie for the human storyline or the sense of the plot which completely makes sense didnt watch a single godzilla movie outside hollywood adaptations    this is a perfect mix of western cinematography and effects with japanese story moments and life people want 2h of only monster vs monster action with no context which if it did they would complain about no storyline at all people have been way too spoiled with disneymarvel movies    binge watch some old godzilla movies then come back to this one with different eyes 
Jun 22 2019,positive,the action was what i liked
Jun 22 2019,positive,i thought that it was very entertaining and fun i love the surprise that came along and shocked me
Jun 22 2019,negative,godzilla the king of the monsters action is empty of content  three monsters sell booklets to godzilla in an attempt to provide viewers with what they have paid for apocalyptic battles between giant creatures that tear each other apart but with all due respect to the effects they can not compensate for the human aspect of the film which ranges from irrationality to absurdity
Jun 22 2019,negative,really long and drawn out
Jun 22 2019,negative,super disappointing very long sometimes boring mostly nonsensical 
Jun 22 2019,positive,godzilla is the king ill leave it at that and watch it to the very end  if you think what i think is going to happen next then great minds think alike
Jun 22 2019,positive,king of monsters lays bare the philosophical question how do you make a movie about giant creatures with semimagical powers fighting not seem ludicrous the answer of course is that you cant and it doesnt seem to matter how much money or talent you throw at it i was struck again and again watching this that while i can critique aspects of it i couldnt in the moment really discern how i could improve on it you think to yourself well that dialogue could be better but when you try to deconstruct how it sort of falls apart on you because that dialogue rests on an unstable foundation this is a long way of saying that while i dont think this is a good movie i actually do respect that everyone involved tried damn hard to make it so it is just weighed down by the inherent storytelling complications that is not to say you couldnt imagine a scifi horror verision that held up you could but then you lose the central tone of a godzilla movie this giant lizard is the hero and he has a quasi symbiotic relationship with humans those are the table stakes narratively you can solve a lot of issues by taking them away but then you are not making a godzilla movie you are making something else a grounded movie would start with all of humanity trying to murder the giant lizard because it is the only sane response millions of people are dying and yet pivoting back we get a scene where a bunch of scientists in an underground lair are talking about how to revive it to fight some other monster what can they say to each other given these constraints that is satisfying very little after that rant though the movie did throw a curveball near the end that piqued my interest godzilla is injured severely and retreats underwater the humans are trying to track him down and suddenly we find ourselves in the ruins of civilization under the ocean somewhere in the ruins is an intense radiation source that the lizard hybernates in to rejuvinate we get hints of some connection between that civilization and the monsters its a fairly short sequence but i was intrigued i started to think and wonder about the implications perhaps there is a way to tell this story after all
Jun 22 2019,positive,the monsters looked great
Jun 22 2019,positive,improves upon its predecessor in every possible way  exciting engaging fleshes put more of the monsters you want to see
Jun 22 2019,positive,if you want a giant monster movie this one isnt too bad
Jun 22 2019,negative,horrible of course the monsters were fantastic but the story and flow was terrible i couldnt get invested in one character it didnt have the comedic feel of the old movies and it didnt have a story to draw me in so disappointed and let down
Jun 22 2019,positive,loved this movie went in thinking it was going to be awful but to please my son we went and was i surprised great job on this movie
Jun 22 2019,positive,this movie was amazing definitely did the classics justice
Jun 22 2019,positive,excellent movie better than i thought it would be
Jun 22 2019,positive,great special effects
Jun 22 2019,positive,this movie is just what it advertised a big monster battling other monsters the characters were kind of dull but nobody came to the theaters to see that they came to see huge monsters duking it out with a passable subplot with humans i disagree with most critics on this movie it was a huge amount of fun and possibly the best godzilla movie
Jun 22 2019,positive,for us that have watched godzilla movies for decades this is truly innovative
Jun 22 2019,positive,enjoyed the film imagine stepping back in time as a boy with the original godzilla only with todays technology it was fun to watch the introduction of rodan and mothra and finally monster zero monsters from those earlier japanese films now shown through the current tech of cgi    despite the fun of experiencing the monsters of old with new technology the story line was however a cliche if not for one bright star millie bobby brown who stood out as a breath of fresh air from script
Jun 22 2019,positive,great special effects i grew up watching old godzilla movies and it was great to watch a modern version like this waaaaaay better than the other recent ones
Jun 22 2019,positive,i thought the action scenes were amazing and the designs of the monsters were awesome the music made the movie more exciting
Jun 22 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic no long build up and plenty of action plus monsters to feast your eyes on
Jun 22 2019,positive,godzilla was pretty awesome i actually really enjoyed it for going in expecting absolutely nothing from it the story was incredibly predictable but besides that it was a fun ride and my god the fight scenes were amazing i was in awe of the visual effects 
Jun 22 2019,positive,if youre a fan of monster movies and especially godzilla movies of the past youll enjoy this movie
Jun 22 2019,positive,yeah a lot of the human stuff wasnt very well done but i came to see godzilla kick ass and he did just that only reason this isnt 4 stars is because i remembered how well jurassic park did their human story and godzilla could have tried harder
Jun 22 2019,positive,entertaining not awesome good for munching popcorn on a hot summer day and better than no godzilla summer movie
Jun 22 2019,positive,as a monster fighting movie it was fun and entertaining once it drifted into family drama it got distracted and slow prompting my son to ask why is everyone trying to save her when the whole world is falling apart
Jun 22 2019,positive,great monster film if youre looking for some deep artistic lifealtering message this isnt your movie however if youre looking for great monster graphics and a wonderful nod to the originals then enjoy the ride 
Jun 22 2019,positive,great movie had everything a father wanted on fathers day destruction n monsters  perfect
Jun 22 2019,positive,absolute garbage story and characters cool monsters
Jun 22 2019,neutral,i did have to much action
Jun 22 2019,negative,noisy long boring nothing jumping from massive difference of parts to another    ridiculous
Jun 22 2019,negative,how did the script even make it into production i love a good bad monster movie but there were actual moments of laughing out loud in the theater
Jun 22 2019,negative,too chaotic for way too long it gave me a headache it was too unreal i couldnt connect
Jun 22 2019,positive,i did not expect to like this movie but i was very entertained as was my godzilla obsessed 8 year old 
Jun 22 2019,positive,if you are a true monster movie fan and a godzilla fan you would love it i remember watching these movies when i was a young kid back in the 70s with my father
Jun 22 2019,positive,great movie  highly recommended
Jun 22 2019,positive,i give this particular version of godzilla a c   taking the theme back to mans reckless treatment of mother earth was classic but i thought the implications of interbreeding amongst a overgrown lizard and a moth was stretching it a bit too far
Jun 22 2019,negative,weak human without enough monster fighting
Jun 22 2019,positive,great movie for the real and true fans this movie is a god send effect story and action are all top notch and will leave all real fans in awe and still thinking about the movie and its events long after seeing it i do questions these critics with false reviews 
Jun 22 2019,neutral,i grew up with the godzilla genre as a child that compelled me to see the movie it debuted in 1954 and even got a star in the hollywood walk of fame the movies were cheesy but likable    this years rendition was somewhat of a disappointment i found myself yawning more than several tines looked at my casio wave ceptor wristwatch 3 times and shifting in my comfortable reserved and reclinable chair several times    this action was entertaining yet a bit too dark to fully enjoy the character developments were somewhat adequate yet strained the subplots were confusing in a word the story was well muddled    they started out okay with developing mothras character but made things confusing about him later he needs to consult with his agent    unfortunately godzilla 2019 didnt show the magic of godzilla 1954 but then i was very young when i saw it this one is good for one showing i doubt we will see any sequels sorry
Jun 22 2019,positive,i love everything godzilla so its not difficult for these movies to please me but i absolutely loved this one and cant wait for the next 
Jun 22 2019,positive,longer fight scene rather than talking
Jun 22 2019,positive,great effects always loved the godzilla movies this one had great casting and was just great
Jun 22 2019,positive,very good and well made sequel to an already great movie  the graphics and action sequences do not disappoint
Jun 22 2019,positive,godzilla was the shit
Jun 22 2019,positive,the sound effects were awsome
Jun 22 2019,positive,amazing  long live the king
Jun 22 2019,positive,loved it perfect addition to the legacy
Jun 22 2019,positive,perfect godzilla movie exactly what i wanted from the series
Jun 22 2019,positive,the movie has its flaws but if youre a fan of the genre youll enjoy this i dont need much story structure or character development with these types of movies i just want to see action and destruction and this movie delivers on both really looking forward to godzilla vs kong dont know who to root for in that one
Jun 22 2019,positive,exciting one of the best action movie scores of the last 20 years there is a lot to love in this film if you give it a chance
Jun 22 2019,positive,i liked that they had a bunch off different titans like a pterodactyl and a giant mammoth
Jun 22 2019,positive,the monster fights are absolutely awesome especially as a fan of the series but the plot is by far the dumbest possible story written by a human being and the whole thing gives off a cynical corporateproduct type vibe
Jun 22 2019,positive,i saw this movie a second time this time with the wife just to make sure my first assessment was correct this movie is delightfully sciencefree and makes no emotional or intellectual demands of the audience except to have fun from the credit music to the homage to mothras two faries and the plot device from the original gojira movie from the 50s this movie is for the godzilla fan not a chick flick but for a person of a certain age it wraps nostalgia in a 21st century sheen long live the king
Jun 22 2019,positive,tons of fun beginning to end
Jun 22 2019,positive,lots of monsters and action which is exactly what i signed up for also set up the next movie nicely
Jun 22 2019,positive,i grew up with these films loved it so much hearing the classic music modernized was amazing
Jun 22 2019,positive,uhsurprisingly  good
Jun 22 2019,positive,the critics are objectively wrong i can 100 guarantee this they dont understand kaiju movies this looks fantastic and is fun and i will be going back to see it again for a third time  king ghidorah is my favorite
Jun 22 2019,positive,giant monsters fighting all i ever wanted
Jun 22 2019,positive,if you liked the 1st one 2014 youll like this one too and viceversa
Jun 22 2019,positive,summer film for the godzilla fans 
Jun 21 2019,negative,special effects were good which they always are now but the plot was nonsense and they used the tired gimmick of having everyone running from danger and a near miss every 30 seconds we are also supposed to care about the three protagonists who are unlikable and cliche while entire cities are destroyed with apparently no loss of life or injury also as usual the military is evil and heartless and it rains through the entire movie just like brodericks godzilla i was a huge godzilla and monster movie fan as a kid but its hard to like any of these movies no suspense or plotcharacter development just lots of explosions and special effects which get boring after five minutes 
Jun 21 2019,negative,dull and stupid plot is sooooooo stupid its hard to enjoy film limited monster fight scenes movie mostly about how stupid humans are there are a few cool cinimagraphic images showcasing monsters which should have been alot more  overall movie falls completly flat just watch the old japanese versions far more enjoyable 
Jun 21 2019,positive,loved the fight scenes
Jun 21 2019,positive,the human interactions werent really necessary but this film is amazing cant wait to see what they do next with the monsterverse
Jun 21 2019,positive,the creators of this movie were absolutely spot on with what they were trying to do and that was to see giant monsters fighting each other to the death if youre going to go see this movie and you are not going for that then you will probably be dissapointed dont expect a whole lot of plot or character development because thats not what this movie is meant to be about cutting edge effects may not be a substitute for a good story by themselves but when you apply them to giant monsters fighting each other they absolutely are
Jun 21 2019,positive,i liked the special effects and the story line thought it dragged on a little too long at the end
Jun 21 2019,positive,fight scenes were amazing
Jun 21 2019,positive,loved all the throwback to my favorite monsters  much better than prior movie
Jun 21 2019,positive,i went into this movie expecting little in the way of story and heavy on the entertainment found i was not disappointed in the slightest going in with those expectations the story is solid and about on par with your average godzilla films to be fair its loosely based on a godzilla film in which the four primary kaiju cake together and fought as well it isnt an extremely riveting story either although its been done it is difficult to make an above average monster flick with this kind of scale ultimately this movie is for godzilla fans and as i fan i vouch for it being just what a fan is looking for monster action 
Jun 21 2019,positive,a good time killer the plot was not the best or the writing or casting but it mostly made up for it with monster action far more than in the previous installment
Jun 21 2019,negative,its really horrible movie  casting is horrible history is horrible i want to forget it as soon as possible
Jun 21 2019,positive,i loved this movie as a classic godzilla fan this hit all the right boxes i felt like a kid again watching some showa era godzilla   some of the characters might as well be stick figures but that is a staple of godzilla films the real stars here are the monstersthe inclusion of akira fubukes themes for godzilla and mothra those who didnt like the movie are allergic to fun
Jun 21 2019,positive,outstanding monster development was great thats why you see a godzilla movie not for the human story
Jun 21 2019,positive,the only thing i didnt like was them trying to give him human emotions other than that a1
Jun 21 2019,positive,yes this is a a monster movie
Jun 21 2019,positive,its okay but i do not care about the characters at all and the final fight scene is nothing special
Jun 21 2019,positive,was like watching the old godzilla movies including the bad writing but with better cg
Jun 21 2019,positive,great movie with incredible visuals a must see if youre a godzilla fan
Jun 21 2019,positive,husband liked it so im happy  at least these monsters werent climbing all over me 
Jun 21 2019,positive,a bit convoluted a lot coming at you with not much character development therefore you dont really care if they get eaten or not lolol but lots of action
Jun 21 2019,positive,yes the original legend is back and he is awes
Jun 21 2019,positive,a fun movie with great characters music action and effects ive loved godzilla ever since i was a kid fuck critics 
Jun 21 2019,positive,its godzilla its an action packed brawl fest that makes any fab of the older kaiju movies proud the attention to detail put into the personalities of each titan is what makes this follow up  to the 2014 movie so special we finally see godzilla as a character rather than a prop the fight scenes especially the final fight are spectacular and nothing short of what youd expect from a godzilla moviethat being said godzilla king of the monsters is far from perfect as many other critics pointed out the biggest flaw comes from not the big green badass himself but from his human companions he seeks to save the fact that the human stories almost seemed rushed in order to get to the titan brawls seems like the right idea at first especially since the first installment focused too much in their stories but considering one of the points was to show the bond between the two species  it falls very short the acting while not bad  leaves you wondering why even bother the confusing plot had the right idea but was not given enough time to blossom i was almost bored whenever the humans were on screen thankfully the last fight of the movie saves it by delivering the perfect brawl the point is is your a godzilla fan or a fan of any sci fi special effects friven movie go see godzilla king of monsters keep in mind while the less interesting parts are on screen  that it is all worth it in the end
Jun 21 2019,positive,loved it  a true monster fight movie is godzilla fans have been waiting for
Jun 21 2019,positive,movie was awesome cant wait to see what happens next in the monsterverse
Jun 21 2019,positive,still too much in the human story and a lot of heavy handed allegory but the movie was still incredibly fun to watch you get everything you want in the moments with the monsters and if you can stomach the human story line youll enjoy this movie
Jun 21 2019,positive,it was great to see the monsters on the big screen and the movie gave so many nods to the classic godzilla movies of the past but the plot had holes you could drive a truck through i enjoyed it but mostly for nostalgia sake
Jun 21 2019,positive,im seeing a lot of critiques of character development in a godzilla movie the character that should have the most development is godzilla and that certainly happens this movie was great
Jun 21 2019,positive,it is what you want it to be monsters destroying things and fighting
Jun 21 2019,negative,it took way to long to get to the good parts
Jun 21 2019,positive,this is what we want from godzilla movies just the right amount of human drama to make the monster battles make sense and those battles were epic such an enjoyable movie i cant wait for the next one
Jun 21 2019,positive,i really enjoyed it wish it wa so much in the dark but i did enjoy it
Jun 21 2019,negative,just was a poorly made 3d movie
Jun 21 2019,positive,it was a fun monster movie not much more than that
Jun 21 2019,negative,as a kid i loved going to the moviesespecially monster movies  so i am always happy to get to see a new godzilla movie  the movie was good a little silly a little campy and a whole lot of destruction  although it made me sad that mothra was so expendable
Jun 21 2019,positive,touching and very heartfelt the scenes were all beautiful great movie
Jun 21 2019,positive,nice combination of old school monster movie and modern technology  looking forward to whats next
Jun 21 2019,positive,this was a great movie the fart sniffing critics are insane to say it was bad when it is exactly what the fans wanted dont change up the formula at all as this as close to perfection as youre gonna get big monsters cool fights whats not to love
Jun 21 2019,positive,worthwhile beyond my expectation
Jun 21 2019,positive,great movie it was great to see where things left off from 2014
Jun 21 2019,positive,my kids thought it was great
Jun 21 2019,positive,i loved it really brought me back to fond childhood memories
Jun 21 2019,negative,smothered in cgi bland performances and a lifeless story godzilla king of the monsters is the king of disappointments  3110 d
Jun 21 2019,neutral,the monster parts are fun as bolton rampages the known word with apocalypse they never show the fallout and aftermath very well only the initial devastation what will rural america do when the cell towers fail and the taco bell runs out of burrito coverings many parts of kentucky and virginia are already two steps away from going totally the hills have eyes as is as with all giant lizard movies this ones failing is that it has a storyline with a kid the voice of reason and emotional center of this film would have been eaten or should have perished under the circumstances in act one watch it on cable if that still exist in 6 months
Jun 21 2019,positive,bestgodzilla movie ever the critics are retarded go see it for yourself ive seen it twice now and hope to go for a third time 
Jun 21 2019,positive,the only thing i disliked was the kid screaming next to me
Jun 21 2019,positive,if youre only interested in seeing a well developed story and characters then this probably wont be the movie for you however if you just want to see giant monsters fighting and some cool action shots then this is the movie for you i had a blast watching this movie and the scores were awesome the movie is shot really nice too definitely cant wait for a sequel
Jun 21 2019,negative,it was the most boring monster movie ever absolutely nothing happens in this movie
Jun 21 2019,positive,its was a good movie
Jun 21 2019,positive,big monsters destroying cities and each other its exactly what youd expect and thats why its so good
Jun 21 2019,positive,loved it cgi was amazimg
Jun 21 2019,positive,thought it was good kinda the same hero falls and comes back to save everyone movie but loved the monster fights 
Jun 21 2019,neutral,king of the monsters kind of feels like an overcorrection to gareth edwards 2014 film there are more stunning kaiju fight scenes but the movie rushes to get to these scenes without bothering to develop any of its threadbare human characters 
Jun 21 2019,negative,what a disappointmentafter enjoying the gareth edwards film on which the monster was teased and showed only in the final third of the move and there was actually a narrative with a set of characters disposable but cohesive the movie was quite immersive when the monster appear you felt the height of it because it builds up to it by not over exposing it  some found it to be a flaw so the studio decided to correct that flaw by doing this sequel and overexposing and overstuffing it with monsters early on its a loud messy movie with thin paper characters some being killed off and you dont get a sense of mourning others swift their behaviour more than once during the movie its just a mess and in the end you just dont care for anyone or anything i actually fell asleep for a few minutes during the movie and woke up with a bang that is what i will remember from this experiemce in my opinion this should be avoided 
Jun 21 2019,positive,good monster fights family drama lame 
Jun 21 2019,positive,it was so much fun awesome effects taking one star off for all the humans who were a minor distraction
Jun 21 2019,positive,loved it   could have watched it for along time more
Jun 21 2019,neutral,despite the more onscreen time of the big dude godzilla than the first film this follow up really lacks the punch it needs a pretty pumping score gets things racing however some pretty disappointing visual fx let it down along with lacklustre performances most notably that of vera farmiga 
Jun 21 2019,positive,the film was awsome and stays true its origins of the original and has a lot of horror elements like the original and has a tone of metaphors such as us as humans are the real true monsters of this earth becuase we cause war we are killing our planet we kill we lie we betray each other all for what thats the question this film asks and its up to the viewer to decide for themselves after the film is over and how do we deal with loss and there are references to kong and actually show images of kong on news reports about skull island and there is a video of kong within the film he makes a camo via video footage and stay for the credits and end credits scene it leads up to mecha gorda  that kong and godzilla will have to fight in godzilla vs kong  i have no idea why critics are giving this amazing film that is part of the monsterverse give it a chance you will either like it or love it and critics gave the last jedi great reviews and that film made no sense logically for me and venom was awsome to and critics gave that bad reviews and it was a good film and i honestly think critics are getting paid  by the disney company and other studios to lower the score of amazing films like this and seriously check it out its not only amazing but epic and very edge of your seat and the film actually makes the audience care about the human characters and very emotional  this is why i have decided to give this film a 5 star rating     
Jun 21 2019,negative,sorry but i thought it was boring  just didnt do anything for me
Jun 21 2019,positive,liked lots of action good special effects much improvement over the original puppets used in the early godzilla movies disliked if i remember correctly there were suppose to be 17 titans on earth per quote in the movie but only a few were shown and in very limited roles mankind could never do much with the titans tanks fighter jets lasers missiles and bombs were not effective against the titans only if mothra or godzilla showed up could the bad titans be defeated yet somehow mankind was able to capture and contain all the bad titans the firelaser breath or whatever you want to call it looks and sounds more powerful than in the earlier movies but seems to have little effect on the other titans godzilla seems to fatigue out too quickly and almost dies in the later movies wimpy in a way near the end of the movie the remaining titans bowed down to godzilla a human trait which imho was kind of dumb overall good but not great i give it a 35 rating
Jun 21 2019,positive,if you remotely like giant monster smack downs youll love this as much as grandma likes telling stories
Jun 21 2019,positive,story not bad but action was amazing
Jun 21 2019,positive,awesome movie  dont listen to the critics this is a godzilla movie and its great
Jun 21 2019,positive,beautiful kaiju action sequences with some of the most majestic shots of the monsters themselves and in action the perfect godzilla movie and one of the greatest movies ive ever seen
Jun 21 2019,positive,love godzilla  my childhood favorite
Jun 21 2019,neutral,could have been a masterpiece opted for mediocre storytelling instead
Jun 21 2019,positive,an entertaining mister smackdown before the action of godzilla vs kong arrives next year and mothra steals the show
Jun 21 2019,neutral,was not as good as it looks in ads
Jun 21 2019,positive,i grew up watching these movies and it was refreshing not to see an agenda pushed while enjoying seeing my 80s hero bash through the screen godzilla and the cgi was on par acting was good and action was constant 910
Jun 21 2019,positive,the kaiju on kaiju action was spectacular and the cinematography was a sight to behold at times not to mention the music was true to the franchise the human storyline was a little better than the first take on godzilla in 2014 however the dialogue was rather annoying and corny almost none of the human characters are memorable except for dr serizawa they show a lot more dedication to the actual kaiju fights but still cut away at times to more boring dialogue and drama between the human characters overall the film is good and i hope legendary really hit their mark with godzilla v kong next year
Jun 21 2019,positive,love the monster fights like the old school godzilla movies when i was a kid
Jun 21 2019,positive,charles dance plays a menacing villain but the monsters are the real stars
Jun 21 2019,positive,awesome modern version of tge originals done right loved it
Jun 21 2019,positive,very enjoyable and exciting movie always something interesting in almost every scene
Jun 21 2019,positive,the thing i didnt like was how dr russell the momexwife who is clearly the bad guy in the movie is treated like a hero in the end
Jun 21 2019,positive,a fun actionfilled movie with some great looking cgi and the kaiju battles were the best part of the movie and were a blast to watch like any godzilla movie the plot is pretty meh but for the fights alone i would recommend this movie
Jun 20 2019,positive,fantastic amazing cgi and the monsters were amazing godzilla was perfection 
Jun 20 2019,positive,i have to disagree with the tomatometer here this movie was not written to win any oscar nominations it was an enjoyable monster flick if you like monsters your kids like monsters and you just want a good flick with a lot of destruction this was fun
Jun 20 2019,positive,coulda been better coulda been worse the humans were not as interesting as last time and the actors werent compelling  i saw this movie it will not be verified as i dont use fandango and use a different option amc
Jun 20 2019,negative,boring and somewhat confusing  my 12 yr old grandson said i didnt understand that movie at all  constant fights never had a climax at the end dont waste your money
Jun 20 2019,negative,it seemed a bit too blah
Jun 20 2019,positive,this movie is an absolute must see for any godzilla fan out their despite the few unnessecary characters and confusing story fillings it is a huge improvement over the 2014 prequel the characters have more development and emotional expressions the monster scenes are no longer too dark and most importantly we got to see more godzilla screentime maybe lay off the unnessesary human characters and the confusing story fillings but it really isnt enough for me to mark down on it be a longshot unlike the tomatometer highly recommend this movie for any fans of godzilla the monsterverse or just even giant monsters in general its a great movie
Jun 20 2019,positive,being an old school godzilla freak ive waited for this movie for decades are there problems with the story holes in the plot sub par exposition yes but its a monster movie and maybe the most epic one of all time if youve craved a toholike hollywood adaption of godzilla this is it the monster battles are amazing there were times i would just want to cheer out loud for godzilla plus the movie is just plain beautiful to look at the colors and effects are gorgeous also godzillas a beast in this film hes not playing around if youre a gfan then forget the critics and see this film in the biggest screen you can while you can all hail the king
Jun 20 2019,positive,better than expected godzilla is the man
Jun 20 2019,positive,loved it loved the monsters lived the story line im hooked long live the king
Jun 20 2019,positive,just a well rounded movie
Jun 20 2019,positive,good the rocky 3 of godzilla movies
Jun 20 2019,negative,disappointed somewhat boring
Jun 20 2019,positive,so parrs was to slow for me
Jun 20 2019,positive,not bad but could of been better more of monsters fighting less humans
Jun 20 2019,negative,wish i could give this movie a worst rating but this is the worst i could go the movie had an unappealing storyline and major plot holes im a christian and it made a lot of  unnecessary gd moments if some says to see this dont it was awful
Jun 20 2019,positive,i actually enjoyed it it was a great continuation of the 2014 flick and skull island however there should have been more monster interaction especially with godzilla rhodan and mothra i hope at done point there will be less human stories and more fighting   
Jun 20 2019,positive,more then just basic monster destroys stuff good plot
Jun 20 2019,positive,ken watanabes performance was excellent
Jun 20 2019,positive,not into godzilla but it was enjoyable 
Jun 20 2019,positive,honestly all these actors and terrible performance definitely a bobbie brown fan but what was the point of her in this movie i realize this is a godzilla movie but couldnt you try and come up with a decent plot that makes sense if it wasnt for the big guys this would have been unbearable 
Jun 20 2019,positive,it was a lot of fun action filled and badass monsters duking it out with shots panning up from human level great movie for theaters and surround sound
Jun 20 2019,positive,to dark not enough godzilla and repetitive action sequencing a bad ass monster with 3 heads getting ambushed multiple times is a bit lame
Jun 20 2019,positive,i really liked it great way to reinduce new fans to godzilla only criticism is i wish there was more interaction between godzilla and rodan
Jun 20 2019,positive,only the best godzilla movie since my childhood in the 70s the best looking godzilla to date top casting and im down with mbb looking forward to a new one soon with my old friend gammera
Jun 20 2019,positive,love how the movie is more like the original movies and i didnt care millie bobby brown
Jun 20 2019,negative,if you want to watch millie bobbi brown scream for 2 hours then this is the movie for you honestly could have done without all the dialogue zero character development and the fight scenes werent that great its a dud
Jun 20 2019,negative,nice visuals bad story line worse characters without giving anything away the premise may have worked if only theyd have tried to make it work instead everyone acted only slightly more sensibly than the victims of a slasher moviej
Jun 20 2019,positive,great visual effects   and i like the fact to put human in the back seat in the movie because its a godzilla movie after all 
Jun 20 2019,positive,great movie and good story line
Jun 20 2019,positive,it is a shame that this was 1 on my must see movies this season  it has so much promise for the genre but it did not deliver  i wanted the monster to lay waste to the entire cast  throw in the writers as well just terrible writing  godzilla and all around it pure awesome  but anytime there was a human on the screen it was unbearably bad  i wish i was able to give this 5 stars and rave how good this was  it just is not  why are they wasting their effort on this if they dont try to make a quality movie  so frustrating  
Jun 20 2019,positive,the special effects where fantasticaction right from the start cant wait for them to continue and do another godzilla just like the good old days made you want more
Jun 20 2019,positive,everything about the movie was simply breathtaking i couldnt stop gripping my seat for what i thought would be the climax of each scene just turned into an even more epic i have been a huge fan of the  entire godzilla franchise  and the inner child in me just got so excited after seeing 2 original actresses from the previous godzilla movies in the 90s  everything just fits so well i highly recommend this movie if you are intrested in giant monsters of nature vs destroyer
Jun 20 2019,negative,it was pretty bad  all i wanted to see was just the damn monsters distroying stuff  all we got was just bad shots of the monsters it was so dark it was like watching season 8 episode three of game of thrones  it was just trash 
Jun 20 2019,negative,this film was a colossal disappointment this should have been awesome but it disappointed me in many ways the action and acting was cool but otherwise everything else was pretty bad there should be a middle pint where there is monster action and human characters you can care about this movie proved we may never get that and by the end of this movie i was bored because the huge cgi fight has become bland i was cool with the visuals to some extent i wish this movie was better its got terrible editing an is brainless
Jun 20 2019,positive,nice tie in with multiple classic creatures but the story was seriously lacking they could have had more monsters and less story
Jun 20 2019,positive,great movie was action packed great plot
Jun 20 2019,positive,i am a fan of the original godzilla movies you had to use a lot of imagination back then when you could obviously see that it was a man in a suit toy models and strings flying the ships compare that to this movie now its like being a kid again watching it for the 1st time awesome
Jun 20 2019,positive,there were moments that was made to make you feel sad and emotional but it was awkward and unnecessary godzilla was good and didnt participate in any of it it was all the darn humans lol
Jun 20 2019,positive,loved it because its a movie starring monsters with monsters fighting monsters
Jun 20 2019,positive,awesome moviehave been a godzilla fan since the 70s  fantastic cgi and storyline
Jun 20 2019,negative,terrible we did not enjoy it at all too many things going on and not a good solid backstory to the movie did not keep me interested but a few special effects were interesting
Jun 20 2019,neutral,good visual effects regular acting bad story and dialogues
Jun 20 2019,positive,it was a good movie but had to much going on in some parts which made animation go down and it was heavily focused on the human characters a lot better then the last one though
Jun 20 2019,positive,crippled plot yet great visual
Jun 20 2019,positive,it was fun but not great
Jun 20 2019,positive,when i went into this movie i was expecting there to be less talking it had become a bit of a meme that this movie was lacking in human drama and while there was an acceptable ratio of monsters fighting to boring people talking there could have been less of the later    still im surprised with how little of the humans we got to see they were there for exposition to provide a sense of scale to tip the balance of power at crucial points and the occasional boring bits of family drama     but this is gozillas movie and it is magnificent a four way battle between prehistoric monsters king of the monsters pulls no punches when showing global destruction     most movie franchises try to maintain relatability the avengers fought off an alien invasion that canonically killed less people then the punisher  not kotm when i say global destruction i mean global destruction this is a world where giant monsters destroy cities and where human are no longer on top of the foo chain    i have never seen a movie from a major studio part of an expanded universe that was this uncompromising in its vision and for that reason alone i recommend this movie it is an almost biblical vision of the monster apocalypse 
Jun 20 2019,negative,decent special effects terrible writing which leads to so so acting  but then again i guess its supposed to be cheesy
Jun 20 2019,positive,one of the most underrated films ever visual effects are amazing a must see 
Jun 20 2019,positive,i went godzilla movie with my family and friends i like the movie because graphic work was so good and creative some scene was dis liked because only the kid operated the mission and in the stadium kid was walking in the middle of people no body observed  that was weird part for me overall the movie was good
Jun 20 2019,positive,full of action but it kept referencing scenes from previous film that i couldnt remember happening  ultimately a fun yet forgettable film
Jun 20 2019,positive,the monster fight scenes were good the movie itself was a bit too long and started to feel repetitive movie physics was so bad it broke my suspension of disbelief more than once
Jun 20 2019,positive,im a huge godzilla fan and legendary did not let me down king of monsters breathed new life into big g while still paying homage to the toho classics i cant wait for godzilla vs king
Jun 20 2019,positive,i wasnt a big fan of the story but the titans were always a favorite and no one really goes to these movies to have a great story they want mass destruction
Jun 20 2019,positive,king of the monster movies
Jun 20 2019,positive,the perfect transition film to g vs k  even if your not a fan you cant help but like it  and godzilla fans like myself  love it
Jun 20 2019,positive,its a great movie interesting and very exhilarating more then the first alot of mystery and action its a must see
Jun 20 2019,positive,it was entertaining  i usually buy a movie after ive seen it but i will probably pass on owning this one i think once was enough
Jun 20 2019,positive,im a lifelong godzilla fan  while the film had a few shortcomings cinematography was too jumpy in the fight scenes overall it was awesome  if youre a godzilla fan youll probably love this film  if youre not a godzilla fan what the fuck is wrong with you
Jun 20 2019,positive,it was an abselouty very good movie the only things that would ecxite you is the monster fights and the action scenes bear mc creary did a astonishing job using the old theme by akira ifukebe they delivered excitement and nostalgia to the audience micheal doughtery is a true godzilla fan and i hope he would still direct future monsterverse films
Jun 20 2019,positive,i loved how they really explained the point of godzilla and other titans very cool history
Jun 20 2019,positive,nothing more than a goofy monster movie dialogue is cringy but the action is fun
Jun 20 2019,positive,this movie is a must see  much better then any movie to come out in many years
Jun 20 2019,positive,i truly dont understand all the bad reviews for the movie i wanted to see a really good movie about kaiju and i got everything i wanted if you like this kind of movie you should definetely watch this godzilla 2
Jun 20 2019,positive,great action soundtrack plot was even interesting acting was good on the part of the teenage actress otherwise sighhhhh whyyy it couldve been so much more scripting fails or acting lacked what do yall think
Jun 20 2019,positive,action packed everything youd expect in a monsterverse and more
Jun 20 2019,positive,i dont know anymore
Jun 20 2019,positive,great storyline  better than expected action would have liked to see more godzilla himself action
Jun 20 2019,positive,loved it best godzilla flick by far 8000000000 times better than the first which i enjoyed but this is far superior stop listening to the tomatometer and critics listen to the audience score 
Jun 20 2019,negative,every opportunity it had to be good it was ruined by stupid humor for the last godzilla movie and this one think the difference between the first and second pacific rim movies
Jun 20 2019,positive,fun movie about what i expected
Jun 20 2019,positive,with some differences in the tone with the first movie its a great movie really funny and a great addition to this saga with so much potential the human drama fulfills givinin permission to the amazing fights of these so charismatic titans 
Jun 20 2019,positive,exactly what godzilla needed to be a knockdown dragout monster battle from start to finish such a fun movie
Jun 20 2019,negative,the previous movie had a storyline with character development this one was pretty basic and not very engaging the bigger theme was the monsters which would have been cooler if they werent smashing banging clashing thrashing destroying everything all of the time for pretty much the entire movie the camera and scene changes were so fast and sound was so loud it became reduntant and difficult to follow i would have really liked to see more engaging story development around the history of the monsters and maybe even some slower scenes that create a sense of empathy towards the creatures so as to create internal tension when the viewer watches our own humankind battle for survival
Jun 20 2019,negative,really bad jokes super slow paced everything was so predictable i almost fell asleep even eleven couldnt save this
Jun 20 2019,positive,i loved the movie and i will definitely buy a copy of the movie when it comes out
Jun 20 2019,positive,loved it more monsters please
Jun 20 2019,positive,i feel like anyone rating this film poorly may have never seen or is simply not a fan of kaiju films there were so many fun callbacks to classic godzilla films plenty of intentional corniness and the fight scenes were overall well done and very thrilling 
Jun 20 2019,positive,a lot of destructive and enjoyment action at hands of the kaijus every fight is an awesome audiovisual experience action never end  the familiar history and the human characters except serizawa arent interesting and boring but the way they movilize the plot  an amazing experience to live in   cinemas
Jun 20 2019,positive,i rather enjoyed it much better than the 2014 film nostalgia city
Jun 20 2019,positive,the story was ok but come one we all know why we go see a godzilla filmbig monster fights and citys being destroyed and this film delivers 
Jun 20 2019,positive,i has everything i want is godzilla mothra rodan and ghidorah and by im a massive godzilla fanboy we godzilla fans defend the king himself he doesnt your cry baby tears bullying him my prediction is godzilla vs kong will focus on the fight give payoffs good dialogue and awesome story  
Jun 20 2019,positive,it was entertaining had some good monster on monster fight scenes did not go with any expectations so was pleasantly surprised
Jun 20 2019,positive, wow on the monsters 
Jun 19 2019,positive,it had every aspect of a godzilla movie critics are just down right uncultured when it comes to films like these they expect everything to have a quality of an mcu movie which is just cliche humor and action king of the monsters was breathtaking and i enjoyed it way better than endgame endgame was a meh for me even with iconic character deaths you can already tell its going to happen kotm over endgame anytime dont  me uncultured critics
Jun 19 2019,positive,this is an updated version of the old japanese monster films the special effects are amazing but dont expect a great story or acting its just campy fun
Jun 19 2019,negative,basically the worst movie ever i couldnt wait for it to end utterly disappointed in the story telling so dumb almost walked out of the theater
Jun 19 2019,negative,this movie was nothing special in all honest sure it was fun and i would recommend this movie to someone who enjoys watching cool looking monsters fight on the big screen but thats all this movie really brings to the table i wouldnt recommend paying close attention to the characters or what they say because if you do the movie falls apart 
Jun 19 2019,negative,senseless violence mediocre cgi and bad cinematography
Jun 19 2019,positive,following original story line great movie
Jun 19 2019,positive,godzilla is amazing and mothra is a beautiful and fierce goddess
Jun 19 2019,positive,short of perfect because it doesnt have a good fight during the day
Jun 19 2019,positive,felt like i was there for like 6 hours but it was only 2 hours
Jun 19 2019,positive,the graphics in both the 2014 and king of monsters movie are awesome it will be interesting to see where this universe theyve created will go when they introduce kong in the mix i think there will be a lot of disappointment if the plan is to kill off godzilla im banking on watching them both take on something bigger in the next movie
Jun 19 2019,positive,great action with some comedy
Jun 19 2019,positive,this movie was so spectacular to be honest i truly dont know why this movie didnt do so well at the box office the trailer was epic as hell the grafics were in my opinion great the plot line was on par with everything else the actors and actresses i thought were great at there roles and delivered there lines very well the movie as a whole is in my opinion a must see for people
Jun 19 2019,negative,none of the characters was wellwritten millie bobby brown actually made her character less annoying that it should be bradley witfords oneliner jokes were the definition of cringe sally hawkins talent was utterly wasted in this garbage godzilla the monster was great though
Jun 19 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters delivers on what many fans wanted from the series while dropping the ball in other areas there is quite a bit more monster action but still plenty of dull human interactions to slog through before getting to the action cringeworthy scenes of expository dialogue and lame attempts at jokes litter the film theres one character who is particularly annoying and every time he delivered a line of dialogue i cringed in my seat the acting wasnt bad its mainly the dialogue and pacing thats the problem none of the human characters actually feel like real people although there were some attempts to humanize them the drama falls flat and feels like a terrible transformers sequel     the monsters on the other hand were quite cool my favorite sequence in the film was the awakening of rodan however many scenes with monsters are in the darkrain so its difficult to make out exactly whats going on we dont get to see much detail of the monsters fighting styles and strategies we only get quick glimpses of fights before cutting back to show human characters trying to escape situations near the monster fights     overall it improves on the action but due to a reduction in suspense and several lame scenes involving scientists and military personal exchanging expository dialogue this film fails to live up to godzilla 2014 
Jun 19 2019,negative,it if had lesser stars i would give it i was 15 mins in asked for a refund they were nice enough to give it and i left that was far by the worse movie ive ever seen
Jun 19 2019,positive,everything i want in a godzilla movie  interesting characters and lots of monsters fighting a fun summer adventure
Jun 19 2019,positive,everything i want from a godzilla movie
Jun 19 2019,positive,if youre looking for a damn good monster movie and fighting and just a thrill ride then this is what you want and it had some really good character development to and an interesting message on climate change it was really good its just supposed to be an exciting movie critics take stuff way too seriously sometimes 
Jun 19 2019,positive,completely and perfect thank you all
Jun 19 2019,positive,the special effects were good but plot was very predictable
Jun 19 2019,positive,when i see the overall critic review i wonder what did people expect i never watched a lot of godzilla movies growing up except by pure osmosis the plot is simple some humans want to awaken and control the titans while others want to work with them in a world that we all coexist i didnt have too many complaints on the action cgi scenes i have heard that at points it gets to be on the level of transformers confusion of what is really going on in any close up shots i didnt mind that too much the human family subplot while not horrible is also very forgettable but that is not what the emphasis of the movie is its godzilla fighting other giant monsters destroying cities while people run away in fear it will be interesting to see if this gets any sequels in the future with the box offices sales overall not a bad summer action movie with giant monsters fighting if that is something that sounds entertaining to you go see it in the theaters otherwise you can wait to watch it at home
Jun 19 2019,positive,loved this movie i dont know what the critics were looking for in this movie but its everything i have wanted to see as a true godzilla fan if your looking for person character development in a godzilla movie then your going in for the wrong reason i will admit the storyline was a bit off however i could really care less as long as i get to see giant monsters slamming each other around i will see it again
Jun 19 2019,positive,here comes godzilla
Jun 19 2019,positive,godzilla and the monsters were hands down the best part of the movie i found myself wanting to just get on with the monsters the acting was way over the top a little over dramatic the writing was too cheesy growing up watching the originals i knew what to expect but after watching skull island i expected way more
Jun 19 2019,positive,this movie is very good cause even though the human scenes are trash the monster scenes are good they gave godzillamothra ghidorah and rodan more screen time than the original
Jun 19 2019,positive,dont care what the critics say go see this movie
Jun 19 2019,positive,i thought it was a great story line considering that there is so many out now
Jun 19 2019,positive,love the way they still make him the good guy
Jun 19 2019,negative,bland characters terribly boring villains yeah thats about it cant care about the story if the characters on screen arent interesting at all
Jun 19 2019,positive,great effects fun movie with notable actors and very entertaining

Jun 19 2019,positive,king of the monsters for sure go go godzilla
Jun 19 2019,positive,this is different from other godzillas but it wasnt great the storyline was ok but not the best
Jun 19 2019,positive,this is the film all godzilla fans have been waiting for far better than americas first two attempts
Jun 19 2019,positive,i left halfway through
Jun 19 2019,positive,good reboot to a classic monster
Jun 19 2019,neutral,omg  this is so below last godzilla 2014 story is non existent and it feels like you folling in deep hole without knowing how you get there   its has so much problems that you can call this big black hole of movie  its not bed movie but its so messed up that you cant remember what do you watching   i was lost and not good way but lost like in pitch black    to bad   please beg gereth edwards to come back  
Jun 19 2019,positive,not bad not great the special effects were pretty good storyline not so much worth a dvd rental
Jun 19 2019,negative,godzilla king of the monsters is a simply bad movie looking for a good story not here looking for substance not here looking for good acting asides from farmiga and brown not here looking for big cgi battles and excessive mind shattering sound you can find that here    watch this only if you have nothing else to do  310
Jun 19 2019,positive,so my boys and i grew up loving godzilla  we tthought this movie was going to be fun but were shocked it was wonderful  we loved it  my oldest son said it was his new favorite movie  you have to go in knowing your watching a gidzilla monster movie but with that it is fantastic
Jun 19 2019,positive,loved it great entertainment
Jun 19 2019,positive,please dont listen to the critics godzilla king of the monsters is an amazing movie and you would be doing yourself a disservice by not watching it on the big screen
Jun 19 2019,positive,sure the human story is pretty lame but it was never about that great allegories for climate change exciting and exactly what it was supposed to be to be
Jun 19 2019,positive,good movie loved the cinematography wished they showed kong
Jun 19 2019,positive,we are big godzilla fans loved everything about it hated that it was over so soon
Jun 19 2019,positive,very nice adaptation of the story of the king of the monster
Jun 19 2019,positive,we love the movie we were actually at mexico city when they were filming those scenes in 2017  and we walk all those streets we wait for two years  it was excited
Jun 19 2019,neutral,its ok the monsters are cool the monsters fights are really cool i didnt care for the plot the writing or the acting it was too much drama the movie was too heavy take the human story line out and it would have been a good movie 
Jun 19 2019,positive,the monsters are a lot of fun but i do not know why the creators try so hard to add a deep human connection in a movie based on monster fights true fans are not going to see godzilla for a love story unless it has to do with miss godzilla
Jun 19 2019,negative,great visual effects and great monster fights but the story dialogue and jokes given to the human characters are atrocious ken watanabe is a standout since he has some semblance of history from the first film if you are a fan of godzilla in general and wanted to see this film once and only once it might be worth going to the theater to see those beautiful shots of the monsters on the big screen if you arent a godzilla fan i would not waste your time or money on this film
Jun 19 2019,positive,all of the previous negative reviews are wrong 40 my ass i entered the theatre under the impression that this movie sucked but boy was i proven wrong godfuckingzilla hit all marks i came only to see action packed massive monster fightscenes but i received so much more the movie hit all marks empowering females both humans and monsters with the main villain as a mother and also a heroine godsent moth the castagain both humans and monsters was extremely diverse and realistic those with diverse parents could connect while the younger audience could be empowered by the heroic independent teenager the plot included drama themes of redemption sacrifice and the human condition  with perfectly times comedic relief during moments of tragedy nothing can express my gratitude for the writers for this movie the movie toyed with philosophical topics such as humanitys purpose and power while also reminding the audience of religion if your not into religion the movie dialogue expressed accurate vocabulary that any environmental science student could recognize and appreciate aliens were additionally not strangers to the plot  the movie moved me some moments laughing some crying without giving too much of the plot away id like to point out the exquisite cinematography in the scene where the queen moth attacked the vile hydra against a skyscraper in the reflection you see the gorgeous godzilla approach and absolutely demolish the poor thing finally it was obvious to me that the writers knew their movie history there were scenes alluding to lord of the rings frodo ascending mt doom gandolf and his angelic eagles coming to save all much like the queen moths manner healing godzilla and our beloved goku in a similar fashion to his iconic dragon ball z kahmehyamehya  godzilla was juiced up with radiation and shoot a blue light from his mouth and put all demons to rest great movie long live the king 
Jun 19 2019,negative,sooooooooooooooooo boring  the character building was awful in the end i just wanted godzilla to eat everyone so the movie would be over 
Jun 19 2019,positive,tons of action from these so call monster hitters and how the blue one came back 
Jun 19 2019,positive,if you are a fan of the toho godzilla movies of the cold war era you are in for a treat its over the top bombastic monster brawls yet has subtle things like easter eggs that fans will appreciate and the source material is handled with real care  big g is back and did not disappoint
Jun 19 2019,positive,i loved the insane amount of monsters that were in the movie i disliked the ending of them suddenly bowing to the king it was cheesy but overall it was pretty good
Jun 19 2019,positive,after being disappointed with godzilla 2014 i was reluctant to see this but it exceeded all expectations and i would definitely watch it again highly recommended
Jun 19 2019,positive,i went to see this movie to see stranger things star millie bobbie brown in action millie does not disappoint she takes over the screen and seems to develop relationships with the monsters see this film if you enjoy millie who is a young meryl streep
Jun 19 2019,positive,full of action and suspense
Jun 19 2019,positive,it was bittersweet at moments and all round awesome at the end i loved it

Jun 19 2019,positive,best godzilla because they got it right this time
Jun 19 2019,positive,this movie was great just let the monsters fight not disappointed
Jun 19 2019,positive,enjoyed the non stop monster action even better the second time around
Jun 19 2019,positive,if you want to see godzilla fight other titans then its good enough but not an astounding movie by many stretches
Jun 19 2019,positive,delightfully campy exactly what i was hoping for when i walked in 
Jun 19 2019,positive,for fans of godzilla  big monsters this is it non stop monsters action  incredible cgi scenes i  really had a great time
Jun 19 2019,positive,its so awesome
Jun 19 2019,positive,awesome movie especially the special effects
Jun 19 2019,positive,i wish the 2014 godzilla had this much action
Jun 19 2019,negative,i expected a different movie
Jun 19 2019,positive,my only issue with the movie was the actors which was worth the sacrifice for the epic cgi that went into all the battle scenes  it was amazing 
Jun 19 2019,negative,disappointedhad the potential to a lot better but sadly did not hit the mark
Jun 19 2019,positive,this movie is a must for all kaiju fans
Jun 19 2019,positive,great fights with story line
Jun 19 2019,negative,not enough of what the movie is about aka godzillatitans was shown too much focus on a lacking storyline rather than the movies selling point
Jun 19 2019,positive,always love godzilla
Jun 19 2019,positive,kick ass monster movie as long as you know what youre in for you wont be disappointed
Jun 19 2019,positive,if you want to see a giant monster movie that cares mostly about the monsters and not about story or characters and says fuck it lets have a good time then this is for you
Jun 19 2019,positive,great with awesome throwbacks to the classic movies a movie for fans made by fans well worth the watch
Jun 19 2019,positive,i loved the movie would want to go see it again
Jun 19 2019,positive,excellent very action packed kept you on the edge of your seat highly recommended
Jun 19 2019,positive,it was the best godzilla modern that i have watched in years looking forwards to the next installment
Jun 19 2019,negative,like many others i was excited to see this movie the previous godzilla movie was passable kong skull island was enjoyable king of the monsters was neither passable or enjoyable the movie starts off slowly very slowly it eventually picks up pace and explains the main gist of the plot which isnt a bad plot the way the characters go about their actions is another story    it appears that toho studios had a hand in this flick as the plot was goofy and the japanese characters had absolutely inane dialogue yeah it was nearly as bad as the old toho movies the united states armed forces allow main characters to give them orders characters run around jumping from v22 osprey aircraft to aircraft carriers to nuclear submarines and to a giant flying fortress that never runs out of fuel despite being the size of the state of delaware     all of the glorious monster action is parsed between wooden acting poor dialogue and nonsensical actions by the characters at one point the daughter character walks from a secluded base in massachusetts to red sox field in what we imagine is a matter of minutes her mother drives a humvee there which seems to take forever sighi could go on but you get the idea    if youre a godzilla fan i suggest renting the movie as a dvr download or redbox rental its not worth sitting a theater for 2 hours kong skull island was entertaining paced well and well acted godziall king of the monsters wasnt like that in any way prepare to be let down
Jun 19 2019,positive,godzilla was great you should expect amazing titans and many amazing action scenes but not a great story
Jun 19 2019,positive,good for all you godzilla fans out there found one of  the main charactes annoyinghis voice grating to my ears
Jun 19 2019,positive,i took my son to see this movie   we both loved it im come bake next week with my older he loves movies like thisawesome
Jun 19 2019,positive,full of nonstop action and the production was great
Jun 19 2019,positive,good monster movie i wish the people had less of a role though
Jun 19 2019,positive,loved the cgi of all the monsters godzilla has always been a family favorite and now i can enjoy the action with my 4 year old son cant wait for the next installment godzilla vs kong 2020
Jun 18 2019,positive,this movie is about monster fights if thats what you want to see thats what youre going to get gidorah was amazing

Jun 18 2019,positive,its a very great movie
Jun 18 2019,positive,well worth the time and money  will see again
Jun 18 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is the perfect godzilla movie not mainstream movie the general audience member may enjoy this experience if they admire action genreshowever if you are not familiar with the godzilla toho films this film will hijack logical plot points present cheesy dialogue and cartoonlike moments between monster charactersthe said traits make up a classic toho production this film creates a marvelous blend of modern designsvfx nostalgic soundtrack monster moments subtle references to toho plots while maintaining a relevant human perspective that is there to strictly observe explain and experience the monsterverse from the ground level   this film gives great pacing to the balance between monster screen time and human development each japanese monster is treated with careful personalized respect to the source material established by toho one popular criticism is the human plot like i said earlier if you know the toho films you know humans were never the focal point of any godzilla film these characters serve to mobilize the audience between monster spectacles just as they did in older films the cast is strong competent and deliver the right amount of emotion humor and anthologyfilled ideas to bring godzillas role closer to realities humans face in 2019 die hard godzilla fans have complained about the lack of shot continuity in fight scenes and the continued darkness in these scenes as a fan myself i embrace the limited fight scenes this new style engages the human perspective into the fight scenes to bring a safari feel for the audience allowing one to sense how real humans would handle and react to a world filled with jawdropping creatures fight sequences still maximize the visual aw of the monsters without eliminating your thirst for more   godzilla king of the monsters is the godzilla fans end game
Jun 18 2019,positive,this movie remind me of the old godzilla movies i used to watch on tv as a kid this movie has all the old monsters in it it was very entertaining
Jun 18 2019,positive,if you are a godzilla fan you will probably like this movie a lot its pretty much old school godzilla love all the other monsters too its a fun movie
Jun 18 2019,positive,typical monster entertainment lots of good special effects millie bobble brown did a good job
Jun 18 2019,positive,typical monster film loved mothra would recommend
Jun 18 2019,positive,i loved it it focused more on godzilla than the humans like it should critics should understand giant monsters is a genre not a novelty docking a star for personal nerd critiques not worth mentioning here
Jun 18 2019,positive,quality of everything i thought could be better maybe they intentionally tried to mimic the original rubber suits but  i liked the story and that they remained somewhat faithful to originals and gave credit to original creators
Jun 18 2019,positive,interesting like the original one 4stars out 5
Jun 18 2019,positive,i saw it twiceit was nice just dont see it in 4d youll be very sorry lol 
Jun 18 2019,positive,all of those who go to the movies expecting reality need to remember that this is a godzilla movie and suspend their adult criticisms as such the effects were great the story made sense even if it stretched a bit at times and the monster remakes fit with todays image of things loved the fight scenes    my only criticism is for the ending the final scene was a bit corny even for a godzilla film  i still recommend it and will be seeing it again and again and
Jun 18 2019,neutral,this movie was ok there were unnecessary fight scenes and moments and was kinda boring i wouldnt recommend
Jun 18 2019,positive,the monster fights where the best parts of the movie imo
Jun 18 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie and would recommend this movie to others
Jun 18 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters in my opinon was the perfect godzilla movie giant monsters fighting all throughout the movie including thrills and some jumpscares actually i would be willing to watch it again in the future ps critics you are wrong
Jun 18 2019,positive,this movie is great if you are only going for the monsters fights everything else is pretty boring and rushed   conclusion  wait for the blu ray edition dont waste your money if you are not a super fan of godzilla
Jun 18 2019,positive,if youd like to see godzilla just wrecking everything and ripping heads off then youll love this film if you dont then you are missing out because this is everything a godzilla film should be 
Jun 18 2019,positive,it was a good movie liked the fighting
Jun 18 2019,positive,well the story may not have been the greatest lets face it you dont go to watch this movie for the plot you go to see giant monsters kick the shit out of eachother and the movie delivers just that in ample supply
Jun 18 2019,positive,the people who say this movie wasnt good need to lighten up and have fun this movie was made for fans of the franchise maybe if they just loosened up a little they could have been entertained
Jun 18 2019,positive,monsters good writing  acting poor
Jun 18 2019,positive,i was there for the monster movie and thats exactly what i got walked out with a massive smile on my face and godzillas theme song stuck in my head
Jun 18 2019,positive,not much different than from the 1960s
Jun 18 2019,positive,finally an american godzilla movie made for the fans excellent story and effects classic toho kaiju lovengly reimagined in a way that doesnt stray too far from the original source material this is how american remakes should be
Jun 18 2019,positive,great action w all the monsters
Jun 18 2019,positive,watching kaiju fight in well choreographed scenes that show their immensity and power is a guilty pleasure of mine and thats exactly what i got some amazing cgi scenes of gigantic monsters fighting if the entire movie had been just scenes of monsters fighting i would have given this a 5 star review however the plot line was sub par especially any of the parts involving only the humans would watch again but not anytime soon and would most likely skip the talky parts
Jun 18 2019,positive,the movie was so breathtaking and it is a mustsee for kaiju fans
Jun 18 2019,positive,every scene with godzilla and the other kaiju was awesome the human element however was garbage give me monsters for 3 hours straight in fact get rid of the cgi and put someone in a rubber costume
Jun 18 2019,negative,i was so excited for this movie after the 2014 version and kong skull island man was i disappointed this is one of the most poorly written movies ive ever seen i know i knowyou dont got to godzilla for the story or the dialogue but im telling younone of it was good worse than aquaman and thats saying something its also so dark that you cant tell whats going on half the time they have all these awesome monsters but you cant tell who is fighting who i hate when movies overexplain the plot and they went so far beyond overexplaining that it ruins it if i had to suffer through one more good luck thanks well need it or well my family is out there so ill be damned if im going to just sit here i swear i was going to walk out 
Jun 18 2019,positive,love these movies love huge monster battles the human part of the story doesnt matter godzilla is awesome and godzilla v kong will be great too
Jun 18 2019,positive,not enough story telling all monster action
Jun 18 2019,neutral,the plot was disjointed and the storyline seemed madeup on the fly this installment was a drastic departure from the style of the first godzilla movie directed by gareth edwards to me gareths 2014 godzilla was the perfect godzilla movie i always wanted this new one felt more like a transformer movie to me
Jun 18 2019,positive,king of the monsters is good fun with its pulse pounding monster action goregous creature designs and some jawdropping images that begs to be seen on the biggest screen while the action is almost nonstop it doesnt really kick into highgear till roden appears following gareth edwards cinematically artsy if somewhat dull previous film director michaal dougherty tries to keep the quieter scenes suitably serious  abit quirky and the fine cast squeezes everything they can out of the ludicrous obligartory human element to make it remotely compelling if you wanted more out of the human drama you are going to get more of the same that many other godzilla movies failed at before making this one feel more empty and lackluster if you just want to see monster mayham you could not have asked for anything better  6510 
Jun 18 2019,negative,a monster movie should not be this boring
Jun 18 2019,negative,dont waste your money no story line so dark you could hardly see the monsters
Jun 18 2019,positive,i liked that they had all the different monsters in this one godzilla is awesome and monster zero is a bad mofo
Jun 18 2019,positive,so much better than the first one cut alot of the human element and really emphasized the giant monsters gonna watch it again for sure
Jun 18 2019,positive,extending the story and cast from the previous godzilla movie and tying king kong and skull island into the same universe through monarch the secretive nongovernmental organization that has found and monitored these titans we see the rise of all the titans and the allout battle royale we deserve    this movie was a lot of fun while still carrying a gasp plot that was as believable as it could be with the subject matter  go its fun its satisfying and remember to stay after the credits
Jun 18 2019,positive,who doesnt love godzilla its just based on fun and action since 1954 godzilla has been an icon hes right there with the coolness of keanu reeves gozilla is so much better than any of the avengers hes godfreakinzilla for crying out loud
Jun 18 2019,positive,the fight scenes were nice but the actors acted stupidly
Jun 18 2019,positive,easily one of the best godzilla movies ever made and a huge step forward from the 2014 movie i honestly dont understand what the critics are complaining about this was the perfect godzilla movie 
Jun 18 2019,positive,i thought it was a good monster movie with great special effects
Jun 18 2019,positive,fun movie good cast
Jun 18 2019,positive,movie was great hands down though i recommend watch it in imax or dolby to better your experience unfortunately i saw it standard cause i missed all the good movie times but it was still great in standard but you always want that extra kick on the sound for any movie again hands down fantastic movie
Jun 18 2019,negative,the plot on this movie was so ridiculous that it made it hard to watch other than some good action scenes this was a horrible movie
Jun 18 2019,positive,this movie was way to long
Jun 18 2019,positive,bad movie but a great godzilla movie
Jun 18 2019,positive,monsters are great except godzilla ia a little fat
Jun 18 2019,positive,critics can suck a fat one this movie is everything a godzilla movie should be fuck the humans story we are here for the monsters
Jun 18 2019,positive,enjoyed the story line
Jun 18 2019,positive,pleasantly surprised better than expected pure spectacle summerpopcorn movie fun
Jun 18 2019,positive,if you hold a sense of disbelief and ignore some of the problems with the plot you get what you came for  giant citytoppling monster battles unlike anything else
Jun 18 2019,positive,it was a good family movie kids loved it
Jun 18 2019,positive,the whole movie was great the graphics the action everything
Jun 18 2019,positive,apart from what the critics say this movie had everything a modern kaiju movie could have giant monster battles amazing effects action and in contrast with the general opinion an unsettling story where the viewer was able to feel the threat for humanity that would escalate in one of the greatest battles in cinematic history characters indeed were attenborough minions but it was something necessary for the mainstream audience to understand the facts and terminology of the monsterverse soundtrack was a masterpiece and paid homeage to the older classic kaiju themes cgi and monster design were out of this world and ghidora was as nightmarish as he should be camera shots were breathtaking transfering you to the heart of the battle a 1010 movie in my opinion that you should see whether youre a kaiju fan or not
Jun 18 2019,positive,dont listen to the critiques listen to the audience score   were fans of godzilla not for the story but for the monster fighting and its everything that id hope it would be    the monsters looked wonderful we get to see more personality from godzilla and seeing all the interactions between the creatures was awesome 
Jun 18 2019,positive,the creatures were fantastic  go go godzilla
Jun 18 2019,positive,we love the godzilla moviescant wait fro the next one this one was good but we could have use less of the relationship between the people and more of the battle
Jun 18 2019,positive,loved the action and all the fight scenes well paced movie
Jun 18 2019,positive,it was pretty good ive been watching godzilla movies since i was 7 years old so it brought back some memories of seeing godzilla fighting king ghidorah again those two ate the top rivals to date
Jun 18 2019,positive,action packed one of the best versions
Jun 18 2019,positive,great action and story line
Jun 18 2019,positive,great movie had lots of fun monster action
Jun 18 2019,positive,i loved the movie it had more godzilla and the other kaiju and every moment with the monsters was worth it i think that the next godzilla movie should surround godzillas perspective people who love godzilla watch the movie for godzilla if you want to watch a movie with bitchy people running around watch avengers endgame humans in godzilla movies are meant to be the side characters theyre supposed to be spectators of godzilla in action and sometimes give him help when hes fighting his nemesis humans arent meant to be the main focus of monster movies the monsters are
Jun 18 2019,positive,better than the first one fantastic eyecandy the effects and cgi were top notch godzilla was a total bamf mothera was amazing gidora was a little campy but ferociously cunning rodan was the best fire bird it could be
Jun 18 2019,positive,godzila does not deserve as the king he was death and realive by mothra helps
Jun 18 2019,positive,how can you not like the action
Jun 18 2019,negative,worst movie ever i liked the last one much better than this one i literally checked my phone 6 times to see what time it was to count down how much of the movie was left suggest waiting until this is out on redbox to watch if you are interested
Jun 18 2019,positive,awesome graphics and action 
Jun 18 2019,positive,this is a very satisfying monster movie great monsters great visuals great buildup even some decent human interaction bring on kong
Jun 18 2019,positive,i expected the bottom of the barrel from all the critics the female doctor was definitely the worst part of the movie but other than that the lore and world building this movie accomplished was incredible the battles were amazing and godzilla is more badass than ever totally recommend
Jun 18 2019,positive,loved all the different monsters
Jun 18 2019,positive,this movie delivers everything we wanted i know many people complained about godzilla not appearing as much in the 2014 movie but this time he is in it a lot yet people are complaining that he is in the movie to a lot
Jun 18 2019,positive,i liked all the action looked pretty real the monsters
Jun 18 2019,positive,great effects lots of easter eggs
Jun 18 2019,positive,exactly what i expected from a godzilla film monsters and destruction

Jun 18 2019,positive,i took my grandkids to see it  we really liked it  and we liked how at the end of the movie they showed godzilla going to skull island where king kongs home is
Jun 18 2019,positive,who doesnt love monster movies exciting and loved the endinggodzilla skull island next installment t please
Jun 18 2019,positive,i liked the monsters but a dont liked the final
Jun 18 2019,positive,is good yes the humans are dumb and boring but are you really going to watch godzilla for the human interactions the monsters have a lot of personality the fights are amazing and the music took me by surprise
Jun 18 2019,positive,fun summer flick with good action and convincing fx monsters good cast but the simple story was presented in an overly complicated and unsatisfying story
Jun 18 2019,positive,it was great seeing all the monstersthe only thing missing were the twins that singcontrol monthra
Jun 18 2019,positive,movie took place at night and in the dark  would have been kinda cool to have a few other variations of sceneryenvironments for fight scenes
Jun 18 2019,negative,way too loud ended up leaving less than halfway through the movie
Jun 18 2019,positive,we are fans of godzilla movies and this one did not disappoint
Jun 18 2019,positive,the monster action scenes were great  the plot was just not believable  my hubby picked the movie for fathers day and he enjoyed the movie so thats what matters
Jun 18 2019,negative,this movie was great for all the action scenes and the fight between the monsters but in the midst of all the chaos and destruction  the way people just walked away completely unscathed was simply astonishing lol  great for the action though
Jun 18 2019,negative,even by the loose standards of monster movies the plot was ridiculous and illogical  the shame is that the cast includes some really fine actors such as david strathairn so it was bad but not quite bad enough to enter the plan nine category of sobaditsgood
Jun 18 2019,positive,i really enjoyed it decent story good action definitely some holes in the plot and how things work out but these movies always have that i watched this for godzilla not so much the humans in it
Jun 18 2019,positive,liked it but it could have been better   i felt that the final battle was anticlimactic    they could have done better with a scene more reminiscent of detroy all monsters
Jun 18 2019,negative,way too much talkingplot was super weak  very little explained about each monster few appeared never seen before and too much family drama  as a scifi enthusiast i was very disappointed with the final product  the script was not written with the true monster fans getting just due  we waited these many years for this  save you money and rent this one
Jun 18 2019,negative,too much talking and not enough monster fighting they tried to give meaning to a movie that doesnt need any reason to exist except for crazy monster fights and failed 
Jun 18 2019,negative,not really my kind of movie but it was fathers day and my two sons and i took their dad to the movies for some family time
Jun 18 2019,positive,loved the action packed scenes  wish we would have seen godzilla a little more throughout the movie not just towards the end
Jun 18 2019,positive,very fun movie to watch and a lot of good action
Jun 18 2019,positive,i liked the monsters not crazy about the characters
Jun 18 2019,positive,i felt the movie was a good nod to the original from my childhood very enjoyable i hope the storyline continues
Jun 18 2019,positive,brought back the nostalgia of the original godzilla movies
Jun 18 2019,positive,too much contrived human plot  mothra as a moth not accurate  dust from wings and electricity lightening spews silk only as caterpillar  everything point to a meeting in skull island with king kong  problem kong was only about 12 the size of godzilla who now has grown to 34 times his original size
Jun 18 2019,positive,it was an average movie to me same story a couple added monsters destroyed a state blah blah blah
Jun 17 2019,positive,the movie was way too long
Jun 17 2019,positive,this was amazing  i am an original godzilla fan from over 30 years and they did this really well keeping the spirit of the original monsters
Jun 17 2019,negative,the monsters look great but the human story is nothing more than exposition great fan service in nods to toho but the monster never ramps up enough to make the final battle feel like a payoff somehow this just winds up being a very boring movie
Jun 17 2019,negative,sleep through it then left early didnt go back
Jun 17 2019,positive,great entertainment if you are looking for plot this movie is not for you if you are looking for great cgi and cool monster fights go
Jun 17 2019,positive,this is the second time seeing this movie the visual effects alone is worth seeing this movie the fight scenes are awesome and intense the gman is and will always be the king the acting is a lot better then the stupid critics say loved it i already preordered my digital copy
Jun 17 2019,negative,the movie just wasnt satisfying it another movie that doesnt really have originality it has the same coding compared to other movies humans are basically made worthless and cant do anything to defend themselves hellboy godzilla brightburn and even transformers they all share the same thing
Jun 17 2019,positive,good special effects
Jun 17 2019,positive,absolutely awesome lived up to the hype
Jun 17 2019,positive,monsters and sound effects are awesome d
Jun 17 2019,positive,its an ok movie grand story that seemed rushed and a bit ridiculous even for a godzilla movie godzilla isnt even in it all that much
Jun 17 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was not only my most anticipated movie of 2019 but it was also my most anticipated movie of all time never have i been so excited for a movie in my life it is as of 6619 my favourite movie of 2019 yes i think godzilla king of the monsters is better than avengers endgame and third favourite movie of all time i had been excited to see where they go with godzilla after walking out of that cinema five years ago my anticipation grew more after finishing kong skull island and ever since they released the first trailer back at san diego comiccon 2018 i hadnt been able to stop thinking about this film i watched this film twice within 24 hours of each viewing    godzilla king of the monsters is directed and cowritten by michael dougherty known for lowbudget horror films such as trick r treat and krampus  it stars kyle chandler as mark russell vera farmiga as dr emma russell ken watanabe as dr ishiro serizawa returning from the 2014 reboot bradley whitford as dr rick stanton thomas widdleditch as sam coleman charles dance as alan jonah stranger things millie bobby brown as madison russell and of course godzilla as himself    the cgi in king of the monsters is incredible  from the opening scene to the final extended fight scene between godzilla rodan mothra and ghidorah never has anything seem so real on the big screen if this movie doesnt win best visual effects at the 92nd academy awards i dont know what will  each of the titans has their own distinct personalities instead of being a onenote citydestroying kaiju they had traits and characteristics a great example of this is with the behemoth ghidorah given he has three heads each one has there own quirk or role to play the middle head is the leader out of the three and during some of the fights you can see one of the outside heads look at the civilians and other kaiju    the acting was great being millie bobby browns first feature film she was amazing there is a scene where she is arguing with farmigas character that was engaging her mannerisms made her feel like a real teenager that you can relate to whitford was hilarious as the comic relief for the film his wackiness made him feel like a cartoon which never felt out of place in a movie with a giant lizard that is fueled by nukes farmiga and chandler were great as estranged husband and wife emmas arc throughout the film was great not knowing if what she is doing is for the greater good and for the betterment of her family and which one is more important you grew close to the russell family and actually care about them    just like a lot of godzilla and other toho films king of the monsters isnt without an environmental message the underlying message about climate change is as relevant as ever     no other score that ive heard this year deserves to win best original score at the 92nd academy awards then bear mccrearys score for godzilla king of the monsters the score has no lack of beauty not only does it complete a scene it also adds a special touch to it his rendition of the original godzilla theme is amazing and the endcredit song titled godzilla featuring serj tankian is with a lack of a better word awesome    this movie is jawdropping fantastic the entire third act i couldnt stop crying of happiness my face was numb and i couldnt stop my legs from shaking i couldnt control myself it was dying and then being brought back to life seeing godzilla and his other toho companions duke it out in boston is one of the best things ever put to film my eyes started dry up due to me not blinking as i didnt want to miss a single frame that final act was everything i wanted and more  watching godzilla walk towards ghidorah with fighter jets flying overhead was one the highlights of cinema and no third act will come close to being as good as the third act in this film    godzilla king of the monsters is a godzilla film for fans by fans make sure you watch it on the biggest screen possible and support this movie legally
Jun 17 2019,positive,cool special effect great monster movie
Jun 17 2019,negative,the movie was trash it seemed as though they allowed the producers of teen titans direct the movie i was so disappointed the main issue is they didnt let garth edwards direct this one as in the first the first was good because garth is not a commercialized producers looking to destroy cultures of movies in order to try and appeal to larger audiences the only way they can salvage this trilogy is to bring him back if not please do not disgrace kong in the manner you did godzilla just stop now trash and im a godzilla from a child 5 years old im 40 trash
Jun 17 2019,positive,the monsters were fabulous  
Jun 17 2019,positive,it was just oki guess i expected more
Jun 17 2019,positive,with each passing year i trust critics less and less godzilla was truly amazing i got exactly what i paid for truly a visual treat
Jun 17 2019,positive,a little cheesy but it is godzilla right
Jun 17 2019,positive,movie was good full of action and entertainment
Jun 17 2019,positive,it is good enough to go see but it is also a movie you can wait till it comes out on dvd
Jun 17 2019,positive,good action good story  great music aswellfun summer movie for surea
Jun 17 2019,positive,yes finally all action and entertainmentawesome specials fight scenes and a good story dont listen to the negative reviews reviews from people like micheal medved are based upon their desire to sell movies about boxy girl dolls if you like godzilla then you will like this movie if you like watching godzilla kick butt then go see this movie i took my son and he wanted to watch it again i grew up watching godzilla movies and this is fun if you want to watch a godzilla cuddle with bambi then ask medved for his recommendations and thanks to netflix for allowing customers to rate movies this gets a 90 from me 
Jun 17 2019,positive,critics doodoo on this one it was incredibly fun the human characters were fine and the movie is about the monsters
Jun 17 2019,neutral,this movie disappointed me

Jun 17 2019,positive,it was so worth watching it
Jun 17 2019,positive,it was awesome my son is a godzilla fanatic and we agree it is a must see for some amazing kaiju battles long live the king of monsters
Jun 17 2019,positive,what an awesome movie went into it thinking it would be poorly made but i was surprised i would totally go see it again
Jun 17 2019,positive,ive seen it 10 times movie was great cant wait for more monsterverse movies
Jun 17 2019,positive,i dont really care about all the other caracters of the movie what blows my mind are the spectacular effects when each kaiju appears just owesome
Jun 17 2019,positive,good action for remake of a monster movie biggest problem for me was weak reasoning for villains destroying mankind  humans have ruined the earth overpopulation pollution blah blah not that there isnt validity but avengers kingsman etc  so many villains using the same story you can almost guess its coming
Jun 17 2019,positive,i thought the movie was great smooth transition with other movie plot lines a touch of nostalgia for those who grew up with godzilla like my father it even spoke to important environmental issues we are having today
Jun 17 2019,positive,a lot of fun with tons of references to the classic films if you were a godzilla fan growing up then this is a must see
Jun 17 2019,positive,its a great movie i will see it again ill give it a 10
Jun 17 2019,positive,i enjoyed the whole movie except when dr ishiro serizawa died
Jun 17 2019,positive,i mean its giant monsters fighting whats not to like loved it for what it is
Jun 17 2019,neutral,great visuals but contentstory was lacking and repetitiveboring
Jun 17 2019,positive,special effects and the monster storyline carried the film
Jun 17 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic
Jun 17 2019,positive,i wish there were some fight scenes during the day i think the plot with mbb and the mother character was kind of dumb but the action more than made up for it 
Jun 17 2019,negative,monster fights were awesome but thats about it
Jun 17 2019,positive,listen i love godzilla the problem with this movie is they focus to much on  human characters instead of the monsters that was my only main problem and hope to see a better in godzilla vs king kong
Jun 17 2019,positive,i loved the intense action scenes storyline was lacking but i only went to see godzilla smash things so i liked it
Jun 17 2019,positive,loved this movie if your a godzilla fan you will enjoy this movie there has been mixed reports reference this movie mostly saying the human story part was boring  i honestly did not mind it  there was a twist with who the real human villain was that i enjoyed  i intentionally checked my watch as i was watching this movie and i was shocked to discover i was 90 minutes into the movie it had went in quit quickly as i had been enjoying the movie  this movie is also waaaaaay better than the first one and i look forward to godzilla 3 please support this movie enjoy
Jun 17 2019,positive,thought was cool  ive been watching godzilla movies for 30 years and i thought it was very entertaining
Jun 17 2019,positive,better than the 2014 godzilla and up there as one of my favs with godzilla tokyo sos  fantastic fights  
Jun 17 2019,negative,unfortunately having seen the original animated version before this one it makes me sad to see the alterations they made to the story characters monsters basically everything because it suited the production of the movie    no plot whatsoever and what little plot they try to push is constantly forgotten about they flip a 180 in the middle without any actual explanation to the reason behind it every character has very little to do most characters can be left out and it wouldnt change anything wish i hadnt seen the original so i could watch it now and enjoy it far more than before knowing it is a far superior version to this    awful pointless plot falls flat with the story characters no development throughout so seems a waste of time and money    dont bother watching it just wait for a free download and even then i wouldnt bother check out the animated original instead
Jun 17 2019,positive,good solid godzilla movie look past the typical oh the nos da humans are killing the planet lets release some big monsters hollywood crap and it is your typical godzilla movie monters fights destruction and mayhem
Jun 17 2019,negative,nothing but recycled cliches
Jun 17 2019,negative,this movie is a mess i do not even know where to begin  being a fan of the 2014 godzilla film i can still acknowledge where it comes up short  that being said i also largely forgive its misgivings due to the immense buildup to the monster smack down that is unleashed in the last 30 or so minutes  the sense of scale in 2014s godzilla is also dazzlingly well done      now we get this transformersish godzilla film for 2019 and boy was i disappointed  the plotting is just plain lazy there is no attempt  its as if the director knew exactly what he wanted in regards as the monster fights but had no idea on how to get us there  sure 2014s godzilla also had a thin plot but it stayed in its lane and had a narrow goal in mind  that being let bryan cranston carry the first 13 throw the enemy archetypes incarnation into the middle and climax with godzilla arriving to deliver a swift smack down  i could dig it    here we are treated to a veil attempt at family drama a ridiculous villainous plan oxygen nukes obvious character turns enough exposition to fill out all the star wars prequels and just laughable dialogue between the characters      well at least we get awesome monster fights  wellkind of  most of the battles lack the scale and build up that 2014s godzilla reveled in  here the fights are choppily edited poorly lit and just plain nauseating  the monster designs here are bar none but honestly that is about the only thing i appreciated with this film  within the first 10 or so minutes i had hope and then it all went downhill into laughably bad godzilla film  i really had high hopes for this with how well the trailer was done but good lord almighty did this godzilla film suck  i would rather watch the 1998 godzilla film again over this  i am not kidding  some may enjoy this for the numerous kaiju fights but honestly its not even that exciting  theres no pull here      anyway thats my own opinion i really wanted to like this but i am really not excited for kong v godzilla after seeing this trainwreck  
Jun 17 2019,positive,loved it had much more monster action than the 2014 film the human story was mixed and superfluous as id expect from this sort of film
Jun 17 2019,positive,the story and characters were silly  but  the visual spectacle was so gorgeous that i am glad i saw it on a big screen  the battles are absolutely breathtaking  stay for the postcredits scene  i dont even care about the shameless aping of the marvel model  ill keep showing up for the franchise expectations in check
Jun 17 2019,positive,big monsters fighting  whats not to like
Jun 17 2019,positive,if you like godzilla movies you will like this    if you dont like godzilla movies then dont go    its pretty simple
Jun 17 2019,negative,horribly long drawn out movie acting was terrible and predictable a shaking camera with the same godzilla fights for 2 12 hours was more than i could take couldnt wait for it to be over with im honestly not one to post movies reviews but please dont waste your money
Jun 17 2019,positive,i like the monsters  the human  characters  the monsters fighting  and the human drama are amazing and i like  the  destruction that the monsters cause
Jun 17 2019,positive,i enjoyed godzilla king of monsters of course we get to see godzilla in the movie right away the fight scenes are epic and the cgi was amazing you have to see it on the big screen to be blown away when your see the titans appear on the screen the cast was good but none were as great as bryan cranston  from the first godzilla they didnt have a character of his caliber in this movie the cast was more of an explanation group always giving you a history explanation of the titans but nothing more godzilla is an entertaining movie to watch and i cant wait for kong vs gozilla
Jun 17 2019,negative,horrible  and to long
Jun 17 2019,negative,it was terrible terrible story terrible acting not even good special effects worst movie ive seen all year
Jun 17 2019,positive,fun action and beautiful visuals paint by numbers plot enjoyable movie if you want to see giant monstet battles

Jun 17 2019,positive,when are we going to get this right 
Jun 17 2019,positive,the story line was too weak my grandchildren enjoyed it  that made me happy
Jun 17 2019,positive,the fight scenes were awesome
Jun 17 2019,positive,if you like giant creatures causing mass destruction then you will be entertained by this flick
Jun 17 2019,positive,there were a few corny parts usually when they tried to make funny one liners
Jun 17 2019,positive,action cinematography
Jun 17 2019,positive,my twelve year old son loved it so that is all that matters to me
Jun 17 2019,positive,best of the series and of the big monster genre
Jun 17 2019,positive,so much action and emotional   godzilla the hero
Jun 17 2019,positive,what a beautiful movie of monsters thats it beautiful godzilla kotm is the absolute masterpiece and honorable homage to the legendary japanese franchise very well done to everyone involved in the film i love you all 
Jun 17 2019,positive,the cgi is astounding but the story is lacking the plot just felt forced and character decisions didnt make sense 
Jun 17 2019,positive,the absolute best godzilla movie ive ever seen for the love of everything good do not listen to the tomatometer this movie is absolutely worth watching
Jun 17 2019,positive,ive seen it twice now and i plan to see it a few more times before it ends its run in theaters this movie is a mustsee for old kaiju fans and a fun romp even for the uninitiated the plot while nothing special allows for a fairly smooth transition into the action and we get right to the part we want to see giant monsters having spectacular battles for supremacy    the movie has its flaws of course but they tend to be pretty minor in comparison to all of the vast improvements over the 2014 goji iteration battles between monsters were primarily very dark and there wasnt a whole lot of onscreen destruction of cities which was a mainstay feature of the old toho films so heres to hoping they can fix these issues in next years rematch between godzilla and king kong    the plot can be summed up pretty simply with some fairly boring human cast members driving it forward a scientist for the titan observing organization known as monarch developed a device that can simulate the alpha call frequencies of the now restless superbeasts located around the world known as the titans kaiju to those familiar with the term and she and her daughter are taken captive by an environmental terrorist group who seek to use this device the orca to awaken one beast in particular known by the organization as monster zero    without spoiling the rest of the movie the humans really are little more than an eyepiece to view the fantastic adventures from and we set out to engage the fallout of the terrorist groups actions through the camp of dr serizawa played by the amazingly talented ken watanabe and the husband of the missing scientist mark russel played by kyle chandler i have to admit i wasnt much of a fan of chandlers character or acting early on and while i did warm up to him as the movie continued he just didnt really sit right with me till towards the end i am however glad that it seems watanabes character serizawa seemed to get much of the focus as he was one of the more interesting actors remaining from the 2014 iteration    speaking of while the movie references the 2014 film as it is part of a continuing chronology the monsterverse so to speak moviegoers will thankfully not require to have watched that film prior to seeing this as the references are easily summarized and no extremely important information seems to have carried over while i enjoyed the 2014 film decently enough i was happy they made the decision to not rely so heavily on it as many people did not like the slower pace and human centric plot of the film as that formula has been completely turned on its head for much more giant monster action    director michael dougherty was cited to have been a huge fan of the franchise since childhood and it shows with all the love letters to the toho legacy scattered throughout this movie and yet in such a way that it becomes cohesive with the presentation rather than a blink and you miss it easter egg that typically adds nothing of value to the presentation many decisions that you just dont see western studios making in regards to eastern ips were made in order to preserve the history and integrity of the source material while still giving it a hollywood coat of paint which while that has been synonymous in recent years with factory churned cgi vomit over a few hours on a screen in this case harkens to the kind of film fans have been wanting since 1998s godzilla broke the hearts of fans everywhere    couple that with unbelievably beautiful and faithful renditions of each monsters classic theme song from the old creature features and youve got a production that seems so very unlike modern hollywood and in the best way without fail the soundtrack managed to keep my attention and i found myself wanting to actually buy the ost something i havent done for a film in some time when i learned god of war composer bear mccreary was at the helm for the score i had already seen the movie and was planning to see it a second time and it really shows after you realize this his liberal use of drums and respect for the japanese cultural origins of the music shines in the rearrangements of all the monster themes and his overall score is something of a modern majesty     critics have been overly cynical about this flick emphasizing the flaws and magnifying  them disproportionately to how much they actually affected the film while the human subplot is weak and even predictable to a good degree though i will admit there was one plot twist i didnt suspect that does crop up about a third into the film i felt was well handled the reason you go to see a godzilla film is not to see the human plots its to see spectacle to see amazement its to see giant monsters breathing atomic breath and lightning to marvel in awe as the fights between titanic beings is imagined and presented before you if this doesnt sound entertaining then the movie just isnt your jam and thats fine as its own form of entertainment though i feel it can safely be called a good film even outside its immediate range of appeal    its a fun ride if youre just in for a good time with some awesome monsters and admittedly amazing cgi effects and practically a spiritual journey if you happen to have loved the old films from the heisei era especially ive shared it with my brother and my old high school buddy and i plan to share it with my father and my younger cousins very soon godzilla welcome back to the throne old buddy watch your step 3

Jun 17 2019,positive,the mother was called by her first name instead of her doctor title sexist but liked the monsters

Jun 17 2019,positive,great movie didnt really dislike anything
Jun 17 2019,positive,this is a one concept plotline and on that front it fails when it comes to action and special effects this film delivers this film is still better than transformers for example the action does serve a purpose to the overall storyline i was slightly lost on why they chose this character storyline an odd choice and one that doesnt deliver i liked the film but the mythology was growing tiresome towards the end there was a better film here one that deserved the five year gap 16062019

Jun 17 2019,positive,easily the most fun ive had watching a film in the theater in a long time all avengersstar wars etc movies included what a ride
Jun 17 2019,positive,great references to the original series
Jun 17 2019,positive,anyone who doesnt understand what this movie was going for doesnt understand giant monster movies its a fantastic accomplishment and elevated my appreciation of godzilla to a new level
Jun 17 2019,positive,fun movie if you like the genre
Jun 17 2019,positive,my husband has always been a godzilla fan he liked the last one while i snoozed through it but we both enjoyed this 2019 release the plot  fight scenes were great
Jun 17 2019,positive,awesome epic totally entertaining
Jun 17 2019,negative,everything i read about how poor this movie was turned out to be true  it was too long and it felt like i was watching the same scene over and over
Jun 17 2019,negative,it doesnt matter how frenetic a pace you have if it doesnt seem like you have a direction i didnt really have a rooting interest for any one or any thing
Jun 17 2019,positive,this movie was epic visuals are sick af action is nonestop acting is solid aside for a few momenta where its dull mostly from the stanger things girl most def getting this in ultra 4k 
Jun 17 2019,negative,what a snoozer this was as bad as the japanese made flicks from the 50s and 60s  dont waste your time and money  i really wish there was a godzilla who could have burned all copies of this awful excuse for entertainment
Jun 17 2019,positive,needed the whole nuclear more realistic thought the people were going to die from that explosion other then that pretty good and i cant wait to see whats next
Jun 17 2019,positive,it was decent my son really enjoyed it it was a little slow in some sections for me though
Jun 17 2019,positive,plenty of action and it stuck with the original story of the old school godzilla even though it had its modern twist to it
Jun 17 2019,positive,husband thought it was great better than expected
Jun 17 2019,positive,screw the critics the movie actually had too much human development and not enough godzilla but it was still really good with some questionable plot decisions
Jun 17 2019,positive,great memorial to the monster movies i grew up on
Jun 17 2019,positive,excellent movie kept me on edge totally loved it would recommend family and friends to go see it
Jun 17 2019,negative,it was just to much over the top for me to big every thing and it lasted to long just a mess of a picture to me 
Jun 17 2019,positive,this was a great monster movie
Jun 17 2019,neutral,lets be honest this movie was absurd the plot was thin at best the dialogue was awful every character is utterly forgettable including millie bobby brown but i didnt go to this movie for the acting i wanted to watch a super giant monster battle royal unfortunately the movie doesnt really pick up with the monsters until about halfway through but i will admit the payoff at the end was satisfying so if youre not into kaiju giant japanese monster movies dont spend your money on this they tease godzilla versus king kong several times as the next movie and i will shamelessly admit i will likely be going to that one too i watched moneyball on tv later in the day that was a much better movie
Jun 17 2019,positive,good movie not going to lie though i would rather watch a movie solely about godzilla with humans only cutting in to deliver required plot devices the scenes were amazing but most of the times people are on screen you sit there and go nah you would have died from that get back to monster madness 
Jun 17 2019,negative,its perfunctory and boring at least the last godzilla movie had the halo jump scene and the first scene godzilla uses his fire breath this didnt really have a single standout moment in the whole thing
Jun 17 2019,positive,fantastic representation of a classic godzilla in the modern age     f the critics 
Jun 17 2019,positive,action packed the entire movie took my 11 year old son and his 2 friends and we all had a great time
Jun 17 2019,positive,awesome great cant wait to buy it 
Jun 17 2019,positive,could have been better
Jun 17 2019,positive,great movie and good to see him in up close views not like before very fun to watch 
Jun 17 2019,positive,it was a great godzilla movie idk what more anyone who loves godzilla could want i mean if your looking for deep story or meaning what are you doing watching this if you want amazing monsters fighting this is it cant wait for godzilla king kong
Jun 17 2019,negative,i didnt are about any of the characters
Jun 17 2019,positive,i have always watched godzilla since i was a kid and this movie is defonitly one of my favorites
Jun 17 2019,positive,this movie was everything that a godzilla movie needed to be the monster fights were amazing though there was a complaint aboutthe lack of the human element i believe the quality of the human element was much greater cannot wait for the bluray
Jun 17 2019,neutral,if they removed the plot and people i would give it 5 stars loved the monsters
Jun 17 2019,negative,terrible story line  terrible acting super long ridiculous movie some of the monster scenes were cool so ill give it 2 stars  but i want my money back 
Jun 17 2019,positive,if you are a godzilla purist youre going to love this movie the team did so well sticking to our favorite kings classic look we appreciated the well timed and done campy feel of this movie highly recommend everyone to stay after the credits
Jun 17 2019,positive,my 8 year old cousin loved it so its cool with me
Jun 17 2019,positive,its an average disaster film with monsters youll just like these monsters more than most they could of balanced the film better between monster fights and human interactions but still slightly above average film
Jun 17 2019,positive,this movie was everything i expected and more 1010 would watch again
Jun 17 2019,positive,loved the graphics and storyline
Jun 17 2019,positive,the human plotline was tolerable the monsters were the best actors though godzilla really should get an oscar nod for his glorious performance
Jun 17 2019,positive,i saw it four times twice in the imax and twice in 3d love this story plot and cast great monsters fight and it has old godzilla theme i always enjoyed this godzilla movie so much i will be ready for godzilla vs kong
Jun 17 2019,positive,it wasnt what i expected people controlling monsters to takeover the world
Jun 17 2019,positive,while the big action sequences are thrilling and instances of humor are welcome the plot drags on for too long with its boring human villain
Jun 17 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a whole lot of fun great massive kaiju battles and a pretty decent story that tackles some interesting themes fairly well some of the writing and characters arent so great but overall its executed well and its a very entertaining watch the most important part is they captured the character and majesty of godzilla i really hope legendary continues to make godzilla films into the future
Jun 17 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters triumphs as an epic monster film with its breathtaking colossal brawls but receives casualties due to its onedimensional characters and dull storyline    godzilla and the titans in this film were brought to life in a fashion so visually appealing and captivating thanks to the outstanding work of director michael dougherty and the visual effects team the film definitely pulls through in satisfying the giant monster craving of long time fans of this genre with its visuals and other alluring aspects making it a gratifying step from the previous films of the franchise for these reasons the film itself is assuredly a thrilling experience for audiences to behold in theatres    though the film is accomplished in its visuals and in the provision of a unique experience it misses the mark in bringing forth the relevancy of the characters the humans in particular and the plot the primary family and team the film circles around make decisions throughout the film with insipid motives and personalities from the start thus the characters overall appear too one dimensional to have any dramatic effect on the audience throughout the film the storyline attempts to bring some relevancy to these characters throughout the film but fails to accomplish that leaving us to feel satisfied with the grandiose fight scenes between monsters while dissatisfied with the all the human characters    despite the casualties this film is still a jawdropping experience to watch in theatres there is still the monster universe to look forward to and hopefully in this universe humans actually bring some relatableness and depth to the plot until then the epic monster brawls is enough to keep us entertained
Jun 17 2019,positive,a good friday night action movie after a long work week the plot is a bit absurd at timesbut its godzilla so whaddya expect worth watching if youre not in a pricey market
Jun 17 2019,positive,what can i say  im a sucker for giant monster movies
Jun 16 2019,positive,i must say that i am thrilled with this movie  i was on the edge the entire time and literally danced in my seat while watching godzillas swag  he wasnt just some kaiju of destruction but rather showed emotion and character  as a huge godzilla fan this movies got my vote
Jun 16 2019,positive,godzilla is the real deal and the movie is worth seeing especially if you were a fan back in the day
Jun 16 2019,positive,pretty entertaining and better than the first one
Jun 16 2019,positive,pretty good movie if you just wanna watch monsters fight 
Jun 16 2019,positive,if youre fan of the classic monster fights in older godzilla movies youll like this movie
Jun 16 2019,negative,the movie was dragged out longer than really necessary
Jun 16 2019,positive,totally awesome  even better the second time a must see
Jun 16 2019,negative,too many humans not enough monsters they say they found 17 titan monsters and counting but when they all unearth we only see 8     the cgi wasnt that good     the movie plot was stupid and not what was represented in the trailers  monster scaling is inconsistent from shot to shot     boring at times almost fell asleep 
Jun 16 2019,positive,action packed i would watch again 
Jun 16 2019,positive,my kids and i loved it it definitely kept us on the edge of our seats highly recommend for those who like watching godzilla
Jun 16 2019,positive,pretty goodnice cg and pretty amazing battles the previews were awesome as wellno idea terminator was returningwhaaa
Jun 16 2019,positive,better than i expected keeps you interesting
Jun 16 2019,positive,who doesnt like giant fighting monsters
Jun 16 2019,positive,reminded me of the 60s70s monster movies was routing for godzilla
Jun 16 2019,positive,well structured overall and less cheesiness then i expected but felt bloated and lack much of the heart of the original 2014 outing
Jun 16 2019,positive,loved all the nods to the history of gozilla through the years 
Jun 16 2019,positive,mindblown  should show the monsters more and more
Jun 16 2019,positive,good popcorn flick
Jun 16 2019,positive,great action shots with all the monsters the plot is fairly decent for a monster action movie nothing revolutionary but definitely enjoyable for most audiences loved it
Jun 16 2019,positive,really love this movie old godzilla fan from back in the day the last two godzilla i gave two stars i enjoyed seeing more than just godzilla brought back memories of the older movies and they did a good job of the battles
Jun 16 2019,positive,apparently using an element that a movie franchise is known for and giving callbacks to previous installments is bad that being said this movie is blatant shameless fanservice and i loved every second of it eat your ass rt this movie was a blast
Jun 16 2019,positive,a pretty good movie definitely better than the previous godzilla movie

Jun 16 2019,positive,enjoyed it from beginning to end
Jun 16 2019,positive,amazing godzilla delivers action from start to finish
Jun 16 2019,positive,i know some people thought the previous godzilla movie spent too much time on the humans i loved that movie but i can see the merit in that critique this one got the humanmonster ratio much better and i think way more people will like it because of that humans provided exposition and theres just enough of a human connection excellent monster battles the crowd i was with applauded at the end honestly im usually in agreement with the movie critic score this is the first time i think its way off this is one of the best godzilla movies since i was kid
Jun 16 2019,positive,if you liked previous legendary godzilla you will love this one if you did not you will not and that is that its an awsome godzilla movie but its still a godzilla movie and even thou ken watanabe and charles dance were flawles as always in potraing themselves it had no impact on the awsomness of big monster smaskdown
Jun 16 2019,positive,great movie but i really wanted more monster fighting
Jun 16 2019,positive,it was a fun big ass monster ride
Jun 16 2019,positive,epic monster battles and great addition to the lore long live the king of the monsters

Jun 16 2019,positive,exactly what i wanted from a godzilla movie been watching them since i was 4 years old and it exceeded all my expectations
Jun 16 2019,positive,gray cg and graphics
Jun 16 2019,positive,much better paced than the previous movie and great action scenes of the monsters for a godzilla fan good mix of classic and hesei series with a few new twists on the legend

Jun 16 2019,positive,action packed fron start to finisg
Jun 16 2019,negative,fantastic monster cgi and decent fan service references couldnt save a choppy and disjointed movie i kept waiting for the big payoff that never quite arrived
Jun 16 2019,positive,obviously you go to the godzilla movies for crazy fictional out of this world entertainment you dont expect any kind of realism or believability but you do expect there to be an engaging storyline of both human and nonhuman depth and enjoyment while they used big sounding music and epic cgi effects to make it visually appealing it lacked the storyline and human drama the previous one did  did not engage my emotions or mental buyin like previous godzilla movies have
Jun 16 2019,positive,good but not so scary very interesting 
Jun 16 2019,positive,action packed monster move with some cool scenes 
Jun 16 2019,positive,godzilla is why people go to the movies period who cares if the human parts were hit or miss i didnt pay a ticket to get human story and deep interaction when it comes to this movie every monster was more satisfying than the next cant wait for kong to join the party
Jun 16 2019,positive,rich complex and keeps you interested in the relationships between the characters godzilla included
Jun 16 2019,positive,loved godzilla as a child i was so excited when i saw all the other monsters were going to be in it too i loved watching them i wasnt too thrilled with the story line kinda boring loved the monsters though
Jun 16 2019,positive,loved it great godzilla flick hit me in all the feels

Jun 16 2019,negative,worst plot of any movie i have seen this year
Jun 16 2019,positive,should have been queen of the monsters real godzilla fans know its a girl very good movie i would go back and see it again and again
Jun 16 2019,positive,lots of godzilla lots of other monsters and fun to watch loved it
Jun 16 2019,positive,it was just ok  i should have waited until it came out on dvd
Jun 16 2019,positive,it was a bit slow in the beginning but i guess it was telling us the storylinethen it picked up the action and turned out fantastic
Jun 16 2019,positive,gave me what i wanted giant monsters destroying things and looking epic
Jun 16 2019,positive,a love letter for kaiju fans but also a must see blockbuster that make awareness about the damage humans inflict on the environment absolutely awesome
Jun 16 2019,negative,movie was way too long  story line sucked  monster graphics were good
Jun 16 2019,positive,i enjoyed the flick as a childhood fan of godzilla i was so stoked to see the other monsters on the big screen for the first time in america and that didnt disappoint the cgi was fantastic however the acting was ok i wouldve preferred more of a focus on the fights between the monsters and have the humans be more secondary although it was still a fun movie
Jun 16 2019,positive,it was a great movie the storyline and action was a phenomenal representation for the godzilla franchise
Jun 16 2019,positive,it was everything you could want and then some sets the stage for more to come on par with shin there are throwbacks and nods to the originals well worth it when so many other movies now a days are just rehashes
Jun 16 2019,positive,really fun movie they referenced some of the old godzilla movies and themestwinsloved it see it in a 4dx theater and have a great date night
Jun 16 2019,positive,i dont care about the critics this movie is awesome in everything acting story and visual effects just great
Jun 16 2019,positive,the movies human parts were pretty awful and very lazily written but the monster action and the overall beautiful cinematography makes up for it its a really fun movie and a great addition to the still growing godzilla franchise definitely worth a watch
Jun 16 2019,positive,i feel equally excited thinking about the monster scenes as i do frustrated with the human scenes  i loved the monster action and actively despised almost every human character for being boring or one dimensional or dumb but when i think back on it i just think about how amazing the monster fights were  if you like kaiju battles this one won disappoint
Jun 16 2019,positive,ive been a fan of godzilla since i was two years old and when i heard that the series was getting rebooted for 2014 i was ecstatic but when i watched it was passable but it wasnt what i was hoping for the humans took the main stage as the namesake of the movie took a backseat to a bunch of characters who we didnt come for but king of the monsters took everything i disliked about the first one and destroyed it all with an atomic breath to the face the humans were not the main act any more but we still had their nessecary presence and godzilla took back his throne at long last i even yelled god i loved that movie as i left the theatre which got some laughs
Jun 16 2019,positive,best godzilla movie to date cant wait to see him kick king kongs 
Jun 16 2019,positive,very weak plot and very predictable
Jun 16 2019,positive,ok mediocre godzilla sequel starring the main girl from the conjuring the one guy from bloodline and millie bobby brown this movie for me was all over the place i hated every single character in this movie they bored me to death and their motivations were week and made no sense the monster action sequences were great and thats pretty much what i wanted but after 1 hour and a half of that when the final battle happens at the end i was all monstered out it didnt feel cool any more i almost fell asleep during this movie and writing this review a day later i prettymuch forgot what happened
Jun 16 2019,positive,it was exactly what youd expect i wish there was more emphasis on the monsters fighting but its really 2 hours of movie with 10 minutes of monster fights
Jun 16 2019,positive,if youre going to see it because you love giant kaiju fights on a big screen you will not be disappointed i thought it was awesome
Jun 16 2019,positive,was a perfect movie for godzilla
Jun 16 2019,positive,it was good  has great computer graphics
Jun 16 2019,positive,is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life  
Jun 16 2019,negative,godzilla was only seen in like three scenes
Jun 16 2019,positive,the composition of storyline and gradual revelations with twists allowed for my pleasure centers attuned to fictional stimulation to be gratified continually like an iv drip of fable plotline inversions amusement park excitement in a static cinema seat mma fight upset among historical characters set up for addiction to sequel one of few movies id ever consider buying post theater
Jun 16 2019,positive,this movie is intense the action is what you would expect from a godzilla movie you really start to think what if the titans really existed this is what it would be like if they did
Jun 16 2019,positive,right in line with what i would expect from the godzilla series over the years dont expect a modernization of changing the cheesiness of these titans  better than say 30 years ago by far  enjoyed it but was average showing  wasnt a fan of the baseline story of why the titans came back but might just be my take on it
Jun 16 2019,positive,so awesome it ties all the monster movies together badass effects story was perfect liked it hell no  i loved it
Jun 16 2019,positive,for monster movies this was awesome great effects a kittle over the top with some of the drama but overall a great monster movie
Jun 16 2019,positive,really good movie graphics were awesome story was balanced cant wait for the sequel to come
Jun 16 2019,positive,great action looking forward to the next movie
Jun 16 2019,positive,2 false kings battle for a crown not theirs to be claimed
Jun 16 2019,positive,loved this movie so much seen it three times i love kaiju movies and they did a superb job 
Jun 16 2019,positive,really good big step up from the last one monster appearances from the start and at decent intervals through out the film fight scenes are just epic especially on the big screen human drama is actually not bad it does get a little preachy at times being about the environment and man kinds negative effects but it does fit into the plot of the film instead of being shoe horned in there so although preachy it makes sense minor nit pick although some scenes of the monsters interacting with humans are well done eg the monsters actually are shown eating and obliterating humans in this film some scenes where humans are blasted across somewhere are a bit odd as the humans show no signs of injury just felt a bit odd is all eg one girl gets thrown accross cars and bricks and there isnt a drop of blood scrapes scratches bruises anywhere some fights could have been good in the day time too though unlike some films where fights are set in the night there is plenty of lighting going on so you can actually clearly see everything happening     other than that great film entertaining and worth a watch especially on the big screen
Jun 16 2019,positive,very good enjoyed it
Jun 16 2019,positive,the people were boring but the big fights were definitely worth price of admission
Jun 16 2019,positive,great movie fun action and a good plotline excited to see the kong v godzilla followup
Jun 16 2019,positive,i might be a little biased because i am a huge godzilla fan but this movie is awesome i was grinning from ear to ear everytime i saw a monster scene which was a lot i squealed when i heard that classic music start playing if yourre a big godzilla fan like me im pretty sure youll love this movie go out and watch it now it needs support so we can get more after godzilla vs kong i am going to go see it again with my bf as he hasnt seen it yet
Jun 16 2019,positive,tremendous action but no story as such
Jun 16 2019,positive,i quite enjoyed it the action scenes were nice it was nice to see godzilla ghidorah rodan and mothra again on the big screen after so long looking forward to seeing more of the classic titans from back in the day
Jun 16 2019,positive,great visuals human stories were a distraction was a bit too long
Jun 16 2019,positive,most amazing godzilla movie godzilla mothra rodan ghidorah they all looked amazing long live the king and queen of monsters godzilla and mothra rodan was a badass and ghidorah was truly the kaju king of villains
Jun 16 2019,negative,omg the acting was really horrible you know its bad when you keep checking the t
Jun 16 2019,positive,godzilla the movie was good alot of action but he did not look anything like the original godzilla and that for some reason urked me
Jun 16 2019,negative,sci fi is supposed to fun  what were these people thinking
Jun 16 2019,positive,its exactly what people want and expect
Jun 16 2019,negative,so much potential but ruined with an overly ambitious depiction of the many giant monsters and a relentlessly political message i feel dumber having watched it 
Jun 16 2019,positive,one of the most beautiful films of the year 
Jun 16 2019,positive,i liked it as a sequel to 2014s godzilla but sometimes i had that feeling wanting that next action scene to happen and then when it does you think to yourself dang this would be cool if they hadnt had waited 1530min later for that awesome scene great on story building actions scenes are beyond epic and spoiler mothra looks like a angel and a goddess overall good movie but im second guessing on whether its a good enough movie to see a second time in theaters or waiting until dvd release
Jun 16 2019,negative,a horrible pile of crap seriously what the hell is wrong with people are are giving this movie 4 stars please add a negative rating because thats what this movie needs so that we of cinematic intelligence can request our money back the only redeeming quality of this atrocity is the special effects which are beautiful other than that this pile of steamy shiny stinky turdfest should have never been allowed to be made as it is an insult to godzilla movies of old save your money people buy a blu ray buy a beer buy some lottery tix anything other than wasting it on this pile
Jun 16 2019,positive,i took my daughter and soninlaw and had the best time  i can not imagine a fan of godzilla not loving this movie  we sure did
Jun 16 2019,positive,many say this movie was not for them but your should not have bought the ticket to see a good movie you bought it to see giant monsters fight and thats what happened
Jun 16 2019,positive,the reboot of the king of the monster is what it suppose to be kill or be kill and they delivered
Jun 16 2019,positive,the only thing i didnt like was that they should have played the original godzilla song at the end not the wannabe cover
Jun 16 2019,negative,no setup of plot and it didnt really make sense
Jun 16 2019,positive,i will definitely watch it a 2nd and 3rd time
Jun 16 2019,positive,great upgrade and homage to the originals
Jun 16 2019,negative,plot and human action were terrible at best i am giving 2 stars only because of godzilla action 
Jun 16 2019,positive,it picked up from where it left off it had a strange plot twist to start off with i understood why the female lead character went off the rails the way she did but having a villain take advantage of lead character and abusing her capabilities for his desire backfired in the worst way imaginable
Jun 16 2019,positive,loved this movie the monster action was perfect and brought me back to the 80s when i was a kid and started to watch the godzilla movies  the procritics are full of it when they give a thumbs down i guess their rose smelling farts have gotten then high   
Jun 16 2019,positive,great action sequences didnt need milly bobby brown at all though
Jun 16 2019,positive,classic godzilla movie brought in with action maintained with story saddened and relieved as the story goes on very good
Jun 16 2019,positive,this movie was amazing
Jun 16 2019,positive,took me back to my childhood watching the original movies
Jun 16 2019,positive,great movielove watching godzilla movieshave been all my lifeit was a fun watch
Jun 16 2019,positive,the human parts were just ok they can be forgiven for all the sweet monster fights
Jun 16 2019,positive,action packed from start to finish
Jun 16 2019,positive,the special effects made the scenes seem so surreal and i couldnt help but cheer for godzilla highly recommend
Jun 16 2019,positive,i unabashedly loved godzilla king of the monsters easily one of my favorite movies this year its a perfect modern kaiju movie in every way     that being said i hate the disparity between the critic and audience score while i understand how critics go about judging movies i wish they would consider the type of movie it is im guessing if they saw all the toho godzilla movies theyd rate them poorly as well of course the story isnt going to be worthy of an oscar but when youre having 350 ft monsters battling each other i dont think it has to be or that it even should be    i love the movie for what it is an over the top monster brawl thats a love letter to the original movies and in that aspect the movie is a 1010 i dont think i could have left the theater any happier it made me feel like a kid again long live the king
Jun 16 2019,positive,the movie brought a modern spin to a classic movie spanning generations 10 out of 10
Jun 16 2019,positive,just amazing if your a godzilla fan youll love it 
Jun 16 2019,positive,awesome addition to godzilla i only wish that they had toned down the weather and the darkness a bit so i could see the monsters better aside from that ignore the pompous professional critics who murdered this film this was a lot of fun
Jun 16 2019,negative,liked the action but disliked there was to much action and the movie to long story predicable
Jun 16 2019,positive,it wasnt bad but it wasnt great either
Jun 16 2019,negative,horrible acting and story line political in their attempt to describe humanity as being the reasons for the worlds problems thats trash and i dont need political views within movies unless its for good and thats not and where were the masculine men who lead missing in action and that is another political view not a good movie at all and it was a waste of my time and money
Jun 16 2019,positive,same ol same ol no depth of characters no emotional attachment mindless cgi shallow dialogue mediocre directingeditingwriting but there were a few moments where it manages to captivate your attention the movie score was pretty dope and is the best thing about the movie along with gojira if it were 4 hours long i bet movie would have the chance to develop the story and provide some depth to it also all in all its a shame all that money effort and talent was wasted in the end but hey most movies are like that nowadays
Jun 16 2019,negative,to much filler and terrible bad movie
Jun 16 2019,positive,going into this movie i couldnt have had higher expectations due to how amazing godzilla 2014 was i wasnt disappointed by much though they definitely nerfed ghidorah and you could say they nuked godzilla surpassed my expectations for what i thought godzilla was capable of 
Jun 16 2019,negative,was horrible do not recommend 
Jun 16 2019,positive,there is a lot of monster action if that is what you looking for you will enjoy it shots showing the size and power of the monsters are kept the humans and story are a little weak but they are all acted fine and show different ways people would react to the monsters
Jun 16 2019,positive,come for godzilla and the other titans forget the poorly written plot and humans 
Jun 16 2019,negative,great nap so repetitivetake a helicopter to a new location almost crash landing run inside make stupid theories about monstersrepeat when the monsters show up they are awesome especially godzilla expressive cool they just dont have much to do in this awfully written movie 
Jun 16 2019,positive,i thought the movie was very good and had a lot of action and a good story but the one thing that i didnt like about it is that some scenes were carried out too much that some scenes got boring but i loved it otherwise
Jun 16 2019,positive,8510  godzilla king of the monsters knows exactly what kind of movie it is and it is awesome even with its cheesy and predictable script but hey its a movie about giant monsters fighting each other the monsters themselves are wonderfully well realized while kyle chandler vera farmiga and millie bobbie brown are good as the films leads their family drama leaves a lot to be desired while some of the human cast gets barely enough to do with such a large cast everyone still shines and able to make an impression in the roles they do have  particularly ken watanabe and bradley whitford this is a mustsee blockbuster to be seen on the big screen it is a beautiful sight to behold
Jun 16 2019,positive,this is no means a good movie  dont except good character develop or acting but thats not why you go see a godzilla movie  you go to the monsters fight and fight they did  and finally another city besides dc ny or la get decimated 
Jun 16 2019,positive,paid proper homage to the japanese films down to the japanese twins with mothra and their music also the music from the original japanese godzilla movie

Jun 16 2019,positive,action packed and great story line i was not a godzilla fan until this movie see it
Jun 16 2019,negative,terrible unimaginative claustrophobic directing the lead characters have no depth the whole film is done in a depressing gray and the entire movie seems to take place at night the plot borrows from better godzilla movies
Jun 16 2019,positive,so much fun action packed
Jun 16 2019,positive,the monster fights were exactly what i expected and loved them the human parts were unnecessary and brought the movie down

Jun 15 2019,positive,great how it fit into first one and call backs to originals
Jun 15 2019,positive,good visuals human villians not fleshed out well no backstory and a bit cartoonish
Jun 15 2019,positive,if your one who goes to moves to get lost in a fantasy world for two hours while not having to worry about anything then this move is for you king of monsters was a great movie though not perfect it still hits me on all emotions it may be an over the top hot mess like transformers but i loved everything about it its why i watch and love these movies
Jun 15 2019,positive,detective pikachu was better
Jun 15 2019,positive,great action sequences interesting plot and great classic concepts at play make this a very fun summer movie
Jun 15 2019,negative,positive reviews saying they just wanted a dumb monster movie like thats a good thing imo  the previous toho monster movies are not dumb despite their campy sometimes cheesy look and approach they gleam with aesthetics and charm that this movie cant seem to emulate  kotm is literally just a dumb monster movie and thats not a good thing 
Jun 15 2019,positive,i really love the movie and it is really amazing and the fight scenes is awesome
Jun 15 2019,positive,fun great monster mash i think we are still a few years away from having cgi that is truly convincing though rain and dark seems to be the handicap used in these movies
Jun 15 2019,positive,the movie was great alot if sistruction and mayhem
Jun 15 2019,positive,above average film worth a look 
Jun 15 2019,positive,monster movie brilliance
Jun 15 2019,positive,i grew up with all these monsters mid  60s  and i loved the movie
Jun 15 2019,negative,this movie is absolutely lazy trash godzilla 2 is actually a film i was very hyped for i didnt watch the original but i loved kong skull island the film dazzled me in the vfx and ok characters godzilla 2 was utter and complete trash though some vfx were good but overall most shots of the titans are dark or foggy making them betty hard to see and know if they are done well the characters are also horrible and milly bobby brown plays a child who just learned curse words well i feel no remorse for any of them in any moments im sure ken wantanabe gave the only good performance overall this movie is weak and cant stand on its feet at all without sequels or a love for the series but even with my love for kong i still had a horrible time watching this because of bad sound and a lack of creativity f
Jun 15 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movies
Jun 15 2019,positive,its the best godzilla movie ive seen in my life it was worth so much waiting
Jun 15 2019,positive,this is the kind of action movie you pay to see on a big screen
Jun 15 2019,positive,phenominal 200 better than the first
Jun 15 2019,positive,cannot top an original
Jun 15 2019,positive,good movie go see it i grew up watching the original godzilla movies i think these 2 new films have been a pleasant surprise in rebooting the oversized hero critics these days have very weird opinions of movies these days this movie was very entertaining and a great addition to the godzilla franchise the next installment will be against king kong if godzilla doesnt win the battle against the giant ape we will have problems 
Jun 15 2019,positive,great my favorite so far
Jun 15 2019,positive,godzillakingofthemonsters last night finally and thought it was just okay really didnt care about characters kind of disappointment from godzilla  skull island 
Jun 15 2019,positive,everything a giant monster fan wants some damn good monster fights
Jun 15 2019,positive,good monster movie  the fights are top notch  not much of a plot but then again its a godzilla movie
Jun 15 2019,positive,i have loved the godzilla movies since i was a child and this movie made me very very happy  while the last godzilla was at best meh its clear that this time they sat down and actually watched the earlier films  this was full of references to the older films and in particular the music  when the old mothra tune began playing i was bouncing up and down in excitement  this time they balanced out the human drama with the epicness of monster fighting and its a far more even film  the monsters have come out beautifully  lots of fun
Jun 15 2019,negative,shockingly awful the no budget original had better plot pacing and actual suspense and anticipation what has happened to hollywood  this was a lay up and they turned it into a completely unwatchable flop
Jun 15 2019,positive,thank god for these last two remakes as the broderick version does not deserve the name godzilla  that lizard aint no godzilla
Jun 15 2019,negative,godzillakingofthemonsters last night finally and thought it was just okay really didnt care about characters kind of disappointment from godzilla  skull island
Jun 15 2019,negative,i slept midway through the movie its just that boring i woke up for the fight scenes
Jun 15 2019,positive,want awesome monster fights this is the movie for you king of the monsters offers amazing visual effects with some incredible action sequences critics are complaining about lack of plot but its a godzilla movie and its a good one the plot is actually decent though the villain was very weak 
Jun 15 2019,positive,i loved every minute of it
Jun 15 2019,positive,good story line mixed with monster fights 
Jun 15 2019,negative,a dull lifeless script followed by a cast of thin characters that dont have much to work with except scream and look scared the action scenes and scope of this movie was the only watchable thing about it wouldnt recommend 
Jun 15 2019,positive,when mothra turned godzilla
Jun 15 2019,positive,it was okay there were some great parts but i give it 7 out of 10
Jun 15 2019,positive,it just needed more monster fighting too much human emotion other than that it was fun
Jun 15 2019,positive,no real theme too many monsters that they just made up and of course godzilla is the hero wayway too loud dont go rho the theater in the vancouver mall the popcorn was stale the barely staffed bathrooms were filthy paper towels were just left out on the counter top and before the movie combating get started the intermissions stalled for 15 minutes and only got playing again when a movie goer wont oft to find help and dont think your going tji get food service since amc forced atake over thats gone too wont be going black 7000 spent four 3 adults  with the crapy consessions to say the best could of got adecent medal and waited for the dvd to come out
Jun 15 2019,positive,every scene with the monsters kept me on the edge of my seat
Jun 15 2019,positive,the movie was masterful it had a good 5050 split on monster to human moments the only problem was it stated to flip the battle every few seconds making viewers seem like as if godzilla was dead then he wasnt over and over again but it fits this monster type of film format
Jun 15 2019,positive,action packed my kids loved it
Jun 15 2019,positive,it is awesome a little to much human stuff but otherwise a must see
Jun 15 2019,positive,great actiongreat entertainment
Jun 15 2019,positive,loved it  what it was meant to be  some human cheese and still really exciting  long live the king
Jun 15 2019,positive,the best film ever made obviously until godzilla vs kong 
Jun 15 2019,positive,the plot is boring the character dev is very low but still a good movie for people that looking for a good monster fight movie
Jun 15 2019,positive,soooo much action better then expected loved it 
Jun 15 2019,positive,great movie great new take on godzilla  i found it better than avenger
Jun 15 2019,positive,an average movie if you ignore the monsters but luckily its hard to ignore the monsters the kaiju in this movie are very expressive and its easy to gather each of their personalities it doesnt feel like a sequel to godzilla 2014 and its hard to say if thats a blessing or a curse 2014 was tame and grounded enough to bring in more of an audience but kotm is so heavily based on crazy toho lore that nondedicated fans might be intimidated or overwhelmed luckily im a very dedicated fan as per usual the humans are pretty lame except for ken watanabe and millie bobbie brown but the real main characters are the monsters godzilla ghidorah mothra and rodan are the real stars of the show theyre even in the credits i just wish mothra and rodan got more screen time mothra was my favorite and do i even need to tell you how awesome the action was
Jun 15 2019,positive,amazing movie will defenitely see that several times in cinema
Jun 15 2019,positive,good monster fights the human element was weighed it down godzillas power set at the end was a bit odd but ok the militarys use was horrible throughout im a vet so yeah
Jun 15 2019,positive,great action character plotline limited but well thought out far better than 2014 movie
Jun 15 2019,negative,horrible movie no essence and the picture was in poor quality
Jun 15 2019,positive,lots of action monsters were amazing great movie
Jun 15 2019,positive,watch in imax if possible visualy superb and thats the only purpose of this movie 
Jun 15 2019,positive,enjoyed the action first time i have seen godzilla movie
Jun 15 2019,negative,the movie was very dark some light and color would have made it more fun godzilla is a good monster so is mithras she should have been brighter colors  my opinion on this it was to dark and noisy  it didnt get the story across in a good way
Jun 15 2019,positive,i enjoyed it my 11 year old wanted more fight scenes
Jun 15 2019,positive,i liked the wide variety of monsters in this film i liked that godzilla kicked ass on all the other monsters did not enjoynothing loved it but i am a godzilla nut
Jun 15 2019,positive,loved that it was a love letter to classic gfilms very fun and entertaining
Jun 15 2019,neutral,the plot was kind of dumb and i really wasnt impressed with millies acting ability i really wanted more monster fights not a global warming narrative 
Jun 15 2019,positive,this was by far the best godzilla movie ever  it tied together all the megamonster movies and the cgi was terrific  it was the first monster movie ive ever seen that destroyed boston ma  all it lacked was the final scene where godzilla walks to the sea and swims away  all in all as a lifetime fan of monster movies i recommend it highly
Jun 15 2019,positive,no in depth explanation needed here  it was a lot of monsters a lot of destruction and a lot of action  i enjoyed it  were there issues with some of the characters  yes  vera farmigas character bugged me a little bit  ken watanabe was the only good human character in the movie  with thomas middleditch i kept contemplating verizon commercial riffs  anyways the movie was fun and exciting  this is all that is really needed
Jun 15 2019,positive,idc what the others say but for me this is the best monster movie in 2019 so far 
Jun 15 2019,positive,great action throughout good fx highly recommended
Jun 15 2019,positive,loved it fx were great and the story was very good
Jun 15 2019,negative,i thought i was watching the same 5 scenes over and over again for hours  it was awful
Jun 15 2019,positive,i liked everything about godzilla
Jun 15 2019,positive,i took my 14yearold son and we both liked it a little predictable somewhat hokey at times but good fun
Jun 15 2019,neutral,i went into the movie after seeing everyone saying its story was bad and i thought who cares its godzilla no one is seeing it for the plot damn i was definitely wrong i think the story was bad enough to distract from the spectacular titan battles i almost feel like the kaiju action wasnt enough to keep me on board as nearly half way through the movie i was just ready for it to be over i think it is worth a watch as an entertaining popcorn flick but i dont imagine it will go down as a classic by any means
Jun 15 2019,negative,the story  unfortunately  has absolutely no substance also the visuals look expensive but fail to convey the feeling of size gareth edwards managed to capture
Jun 15 2019,negative,i took my grandson to see this movie  he enjoyed it  i fell asleep twice
Jun 15 2019,positive,pretty entertaining not the best godzilla movie but pretty nice
Jun 15 2019,positive,with more human story this movie would turn into godzilla 2014 this movie is what the people wanted 
Jun 15 2019,positive,this is your summer popcorn flick  the special affects are just amazing and the only real drawback is that you see just 1 seconds worth of kong on skull island some bad language which might make it difficult to bring the kids to
Jun 15 2019,positive,hail to the king baby get out of the way hunans all i need is 40 minute setup by the token humans then have godzilla mop up the floor taking a star off fir the pointless humans 
Jun 15 2019,positive,very simplistic story monster fights were pretty good
Jun 15 2019,positive,ive been a godzilla fan since the mid 1980s and i loved this  the human story was nowhere near as bad as critics say  sure it was over the top but these were extreme environmentalists we are talking about and they have been known to wish for way less people on the earth one way or another   the cgi was great music was amazing sound design was excellent  the monster designs were dead on perfect mothra was beautiful rodan was bada   my biggest complaint is them cutting away from the fights  stop it  just show the fights in longer segments  kong skull island did the monster action perfectly hope they aim for that in godzilla vs kong   this movie was unfairly tanked by critics who dont understand what the fans want  look at the huge disconnect between most critic and audience scores on rtwith this the critics gave it a 40 and audiences high 80 percentile
Jun 15 2019,positive,i loved the monster fights
Jun 15 2019,negative,horrible horrible horrible acting plot  lack of suspense 
Jun 15 2019,positive,this movie was amazing       ive never really rated movies on rotten tomatoes but this movie really deserves to be watched i totally regret not watching this movie in 3d but this movie was only the beginning there are better ones coming  long live the king godzilla     my inner child of love and gonzalo came out
Jun 15 2019,negative,it was pretty messy at sometimes it was fun but it never clicked on me 
Jun 15 2019,positive,it wasnt bad but it was not my style of movie thought the ending could of been better
Jun 15 2019,positive,the scale of this film is majestic if you go expecting to see an action movie you may find your breath taken away multiple times the titans are beautifully designed and godzilla achieves true personhood it is epic at the very least must see in theater
Jun 15 2019,negative,when godzilla fighting camera focusing on a kid who we dont give a shit about running around tried to hide inside her bathroom is pretty annoying
Jun 15 2019,positive,its was very entertaining
Jun 15 2019,positive,felt like a lot of the movie was left on the cutting room floor
Jun 15 2019,positive,monster fights is why us fans come to see this movie and it does not disappoint the vfx and and soundtrack is great too 
Jun 15 2019,positive,loved everything about it great movie to go see
Jun 15 2019,positive,the only thing i disliked was the fact that the critics try to trash this movie first complaint of the first movie was that we didnt get to see godzilla too much and here what got classic godzilla and xtra monsters going at it if your a godzilla fan a must to see everyone that worked on this pic thank you thank you for that awesome vision that we can only dream about back in the day
Jun 15 2019,positive,great movie  will add it to my godzill mothra rodan and monster zero collection on dvd
Jun 15 2019,positive,it was awesome and all the fights were so intense  well made you must see it 65
Jun 15 2019,neutral,bad movie but a great godzilla movie
Jun 15 2019,positive,kind of slow coming together
Jun 15 2019,negative,boring with a messy plot all over the place
Jun 15 2019,positive,some human drama was good not all the cgi and action sequences were great any godzilla fan will have a blast watching this movie
Jun 15 2019,positive,by far the best godzilla movie spectacle and monster action is cranked all the way up human characters are sortve boring though    if you like kaiju movies definitely worth a watch   
Jun 15 2019,positive,great monster fights we need 30 more fights and only 70 humans for the next one
Jun 15 2019,negative,mindless garbage so many hilariously cringey lines so so many
Jun 15 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever made
Jun 15 2019,positive,wish there was more godzilla the action was pretty good nice in the 4d theatre with the seats and wind was an adventure 
Jun 15 2019,positive,amazing  they did it again  absolutely loved it  incredibly talented movie makers
Jun 15 2019,negative,worst movie of the year the whole movie is a mess with dark picture and weak plot
Jun 15 2019,positive,amazing visually and story wise i cannot recommend this enough
Jun 15 2019,negative,too supernatural and a little boring the effects were great though
Jun 15 2019,negative,i walked out after 30 min the scene with mothra in a sleep state was just silly why wasnt that acoustic sensor thing set up behind the safety area if the thing got loose why werent there more safety or containment hardware in place so dumb i suppose you overlook this type of stuff but i ended up walking out
Jun 15 2019,negative,terrible story  mankinds global warming at fault again great special effects  too bad they couldnt make it a good old fashioned monster movie with modern day effects  we can only hope someday they combine these elements  also new verizon spokesman was in the movie  every time he spoke i thought of cell service  terrible actor  took any credibility the movie might have had right away
Jun 15 2019,negative,the big sad not good wheres my boy voltron
Jun 15 2019,positive,dont ever go by the professional critics score listen to the fans only critics want boring movies that do nothing but talk this movie was awesome and fun to watch the fight scenes and special effects were amazing and thats why i went to see it in imax this is a must see for godzilla fans
Jun 15 2019,positive,i enjoyed this one as much as the last godzilla so i loved it great action and story to go along with it
Jun 15 2019,positive,major improvement to the first movie it was everything i could ever want in a movie about giant monsters fighting the music score was amazing the effects were amazing the acting the story everything about this was absolutely amazing best movie ive seen in 2019 as if 06142019 looking forward for the next godzilla movies 
Jun 15 2019,negative,for a godzilla movie i was disappointed i went in expecting the movie to be about godzilla but he seemed like more of a subplot than a main story the family suffers from lucky for no god damn reason syndrome literally having explosions happen well within deafening range and walking away completely unscathed on more than several occasions im pretty sure the family had more screen time than godzilla which was gay like seriously show me more godzilla everytime he showed up on screen i was left blue balled by him suddenly disappearing a few minutes later i hated the child actor for not actually acting like a fucking child and instead sucked the life out of this movie with her crocodile tears this movie was genuinely boring the final fight seemed rushed and i didnt care who died at all the voted tags for this movie catfished me
Jun 15 2019,positive,for some reason people seem to be under the impression that the humans are the main characters and that they are the people we should care about
Jun 15 2019,positive,im a big fan of godzilla films through out history  this one felt like the first true godzilla film from an american company
Jun 15 2019,positive,i thought it was a great movie that had you rooting for the large reptile maybe a little predictable but overall it wasnt as bad as some other godzilla movies out there 
Jun 15 2019,negative,not interesting and wasting of money
Jun 15 2019,positive,better than the first movie
Jun 15 2019,positive,this movie thrust me back into the saturday morning feelings of a child waiting for the next cartoon and while the fights designs and overall aesthetic of the movie evoked the original ghidorah the three headed monster the music with its mixing and remixing of the monsters classic themes left me with goosebumps throughout a must see especially for fans
Jun 15 2019,negative,the monsters were fun but the human story was pure stupidity and boring
Jun 15 2019,neutral,great monster fight scenes unfortunately interrupted by too much meh human acting
Jun 15 2019,positive,terrible human characters i did not care about any of them except for the one played by ken watanabe  however if you came to a godzilla film other than the original or shin for the humans youre an idiot and the big monster fighting action magnificent a must see for any fan of giant monsters beating the hell out of each other mothra and godzilla are the best movie romance this decade
Jun 15 2019,positive,loved the move could have a had a little less people story and more monsters fighting   however its the best godzilla i have seen feel as if maybe should see it again in an imax as my local theater screen was on the smaller size    actors were great  visual wow
Jun 15 2019,positive,this movie is damn great too bad some of the movie critics are dumb as rocks they should know these are for hardcore or at least real godzilla fans
Jun 15 2019,positive,the monsters were amazing and the fighting scenes were crazy but the human story line sucked movie would of been great if the humans conflict werent so flat
Jun 15 2019,positive,i loved this movie  the graphics were great and it was very action packed  made me feel like a kid again watching this movie
Jun 15 2019,positive,lot of action for the old schooler watching the toe to toe head to head getting it on like big ballers  a few corny conveniences to keep the show moving but still loved it  
Jun 15 2019,positive,godzilla was awesome a must go see movie
Jun 15 2019,positive,the movie is good there was some good action at the beginning and end of the movie but the middle of it was just really drawn out
Jun 15 2019,positive,good monster fights nice throwbacks to the original movies interesting world building  human stuff meh
Jun 15 2019,negative,so the title of the movie is called godzilla king of the monsters and godzilla got like 1015 camera time get outta here w that s the pace of the movie was so chaotic that why even bother trying to figure out the plot once the movie finally focused on the monsters fighting i already had lost my will to enjoy it
Jun 15 2019,positive,awesome experience and cant imagine not watching this in imax definitely an awesome movie dont listen to the critics and make your own opinion
Jun 15 2019,positive,woohoo we loved it
Jun 15 2019,positive,enjoyed the movie anyone who likes all godzilla movies may think a little out there like me i  thought it was a little long
Jun 14 2019,negative,this shit is the fucking ass its a 2 hour long shit hole
Jun 14 2019,positive,if you are looking for good story and why would you this is a monster movie then this is not the film for you if you are looking for epic and or corny cgi monster fights this is fantastic the story does a decent enough job leading the viewers along but the writers make a unfortunate mistake with one of the human characters which completely failed to affect me as i think it was intended of the deaths in the film one surprisingly hit home good on you writers another was far less punishing than i would have wished shame on you writers also global warming is apparently a thing please god save us from that stupid plot point i am sick to death of it thus i rate this movie 455 with the understanding that i was in it for the monsters and destruction not the story
Jun 14 2019,positive,awesome movie the fight scenes were epic and the more sentimental moments were real tear jerkers
Jun 14 2019,positive,plot was forced but it got some kaiju fighting so it did its job and was entertaining

Jun 14 2019,positive,i recommend this movie it starts off a little slow but the ending is full of a lot of action its worth it to see the different monsters and godzilla of course
Jun 14 2019,positive,it wouldve been a great spectacle but unfortunately the human element is what ruins most of the fun
Jun 14 2019,negative,monsters smash stuff and fight each otherthats about it the storyline was lacking
Jun 14 2019,negative,though the action and visuals were entertaining and fun to look at it doesnt make up for the movies bad story and unlikable characters i would probably watch this film again but would only skip to the actionscenes
Jun 14 2019,positive,love this movie a lot better than 2014 version although human side isnt so great it dont disturb watching monster fight love how they made ghidorah especial his first scenes in arctica
Jun 14 2019,negative,i offer my review as a hiaku  hamburger patties  wrestle over lightning bolts  for two goddam hours
Jun 14 2019,positive,entertaining but you didnt see enough of the other creatures like they advertised
Jun 14 2019,positive,as a godzilla fan i will fully own up to being a biased viewer but with that said i absolutely loved this movie it captured everything i love about godzilla movies its a lot of fun with some truly amazing fight scenes if youre looking for a fun and intense action movie this it a great watch

Jun 14 2019,positive,loved i liked this movie  very suspenseful
Jun 14 2019,positive,good but felt long lots of cuss words so i was sad i brought my boys under ten years old
Jun 14 2019,positive,it was action packed and fun
Jun 14 2019,positive,i mostly went and saw this movie in hopes i could help it make enough money for them to make king kong vs godzilla
Jun 14 2019,positive,amazing i loved it should be 1st of the summer
Jun 14 2019,positive,your movie theater could be louder though or you could hear was people talking it would be great if the volume is loud or
Jun 14 2019,positive,this movie needs to be seen in imax action packed a nice sequel to expand on the monsterverse so much fun and awesome fights next is godzilla vs kong
Jun 14 2019,negative,dear legendary pictures         when you produce a movie series about giant monsters destroying things and its not meant to be a suspenseful horror experience you should really focus on the giant monsters destroying things godzilla arguably the most famous of homicidal reptilian firebreathing ancient dragonesque humanhaters is no different a beast with a scream as iconic as the spikes on his back godzillas very presence should instill fear and awe and it should do so for more than a few seconds at a time with the sequel to 2014s godzilla we face the exact same problem not enough bad ass monster action         taking place after the events of the previous zilla thriller we focus on a new set of protagonists emma vera farmiga is a biologist whos been fascinated with godzilla since the destruction he caused that killed her son she lives with her daughter madison millie bobby brown in a remote jungle in china not too far from a monarch facility the research company tasked with learning more about these monsters deemed titans we find out that emma and her exhusband mark kyle chandler arent exactly on the best of terms after he decided to run off and photograph wolves while the world was left on the brink of impending doom yes really mark swore off working with monarch and dealing with any godzillarelated activities while emma continued the research eventually developing a complex machine called the orca which can simulate the various calls and voices of the titans and other animals          while discovering mothra another titan in china some ecoterrorists disrupt the procedure using orca and steal the tech for themselves killing a bunch of nameless scientists and kidnapping emma and madison in the process then a bunch of nonsense happens until we finally get to some good ol monster bashing         and when i say nonsense i mean absolute fucking nonsense the plot of king of the monsters is just an excuse for the titans to exist in the first place but we dont get to see much of them in the films 2hour runtime i understand the need for a baseline to have some humanity but absolutely no one cares about emma madison or mark and their strained relationships due to the titans existence its a nonissue especially by the end that plays no pivotal role in how the rest of the film plays out they couldve been a perfectly happy family and the story wouldve felt the same the revealed death of their son also plays almost no significant role in the overarching story so why bother with all this small interpersonal stuff         no one goes to a godzilla movie to shed a tear or ponder the philosophical and ethical ramifications of destroying ancient titan creatures sure its possible to make a godzilla movie that has more to it than just big monster fights but this is not that movie it tries desperately to ask some serious questions and make its audience conflicted about what the main characters should do but realistically no one cares its about 90 mins of people arguing and shooting eachother mixed in with shots of titans encased in ice or whatever and maybe 30 mins of actual monsterrelated action which is still cut with people shooting guns and being emotional         i need to make something super clear though i understand that godzilla king of the monsters is the type of movie you should watch and just turn your brain off  but its a film that constantly asks you to turn on your emotional receptors and thought processors despite being too stupid to know what its trying to ask you can say it was a dumb fun action movie but it wasnt primarily because the dumb fun parts are far and few between and not nearly long enough its not nearly cheesy or campy enough to give it that dumb on purpose label either as the characters are shown to act with agency and intelligence more or less unlike who you might see in an 80s slasher flick or an exploitation film there are way better dumbfun movies out there that actually fill their runtime with fun impressive action sequences or overthetop thriller films that do pose interesting questions and have interesting plots         godzilla king of the monsters suffers primarily from an identity crisis in that it cant decide if it wants to be the matrix of monster movies or the fast and furious of kaiju cinema there are some amazing shots and scenes primarily featuring ghidora and of course godzilla being the badass pseudodragon that he is but theres just not enough of these cool scenes you have to slog through a dumb plot with intermittent scares and some cool visuals the scene where they find godzilla in the ocean is amazing to get to about 20ish minutes of awesome monstermortalkombat for some people its worth the ticket price but i cant recommend the sleepinducing torture when you can rent it fast forward it and forget about it in 2 months
Jun 14 2019,positive,movie critica be like  godzilla2014 to much humans more monsters  godzilla kotm to much monster more humans  
Jun 14 2019,positive,great monster fights compensate the lack of interesting human characters
Jun 14 2019,positive,its firawesome
Jun 14 2019,positive,this movie was great i enjoyed every second of it
Jun 14 2019,positive,godzilla is always good what an you say about the big guy always the hero
Jun 14 2019,positive,i have been watching godzilla movies since i was 5 years old  now im 50  ive seen it twice  going back for a third time  it was the best one ever made 
Jun 14 2019,positive,not what you expect disappointed in the whole story line what is hollywood doing who cares if a computer can control a giant reptile saw that in jurassic park that didnt work   so the world has over 17 gianant creatures and we only saw 5  why are all the movies these days about mommy or daddy issues oh why was mothra and godzilla a thing um did you not see the old movies bring on kong
Jun 14 2019,positive,really good movie but still could of used more monster seems too much family in this not that its bad but its called godzilla and not the family and godzilla but overall hopeful for the next movie overall will see it again
Jun 14 2019,positive,good movie lots of action
Jun 14 2019,negative,special effects and graphics were the highlights cool scenes plot was largely predictable dialogue was brutal at points
Jun 14 2019,positive,it was just a lot fun had great time watching it 
Jun 14 2019,positive,even if the story isnt that good we has fans want to see godzilla not good actors or actress we were given a good monster movie we get to see godzilla has a king this movie is great
Jun 14 2019,positive,dumb but fun delivers on the monsters big time we were happy would see it again
Jun 14 2019,positive,it was exciting from start to finish  didnt have the goofiness of classic godzilla but thats not a bad thing  cant wait to see it again
Jun 14 2019,positive,great movie cant wait to add this one to my movie collection
Jun 14 2019,positive,great movie some of the best cgi ive seen my kids loved it as well
Jun 14 2019,positive,too long too many cgi fight scenes
Jun 14 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the special effects and having three screens to look at i felt like i was in the middle of the fights that the titans were having
Jun 14 2019,positive,horrible and unlikeable character if you like good plotcharacter development please go watch the anime version of godzilla this show is amazing has a lot of action that true godzilla fan appreciate
Jun 14 2019,positive,the graphics were awesome really enjoyed the film the only complaint i have is the theatre had the volume up way too high
Jun 14 2019,positive,i enjoyed the fight scenes
Jun 14 2019,positive,i know there were some very obvious flaws in the movie and there was many human charecter plots that were probably better left unused but at the end of the day i wanted to just see monsters fight and the sheer spectacle of the monster fights in this movie blew me away into a feeling of a kid imagining  massive monster fights with his toy dinosaurs again all and all i walked away from this film pretty satisfied
Jun 14 2019,positive,a good film for people looking for giant kaiju action but if youre looking for a film with a good story and character development this is not your movie overall a good monsterfight movie with a lack of story and character depth
Jun 14 2019,positive,movie critics are complete morons mike dougherty makes these films for godzilla fans that being said it rocked 
Jun 14 2019,positive,it explained many questions i have had for years
Jun 14 2019,positive,absolutely wonderful and awesome rendition of the kaiju monsterverse the critics simply dont have a clue about this genre or simply never went to see the film and rendered their criticism from their personal disdain of this kind of story and not from the reality that king of the monsters actually presents i have seen it twice once in imax and once in a dolby atmos room the atmos room kicked butt over the imax presentation go see it and immerse yourself in some monster love
Jun 14 2019,positive,better than endgame
Jun 14 2019,positive,plot was kind of confusing not sure why all monsters exsisted and how they got there but the special effects were cool
Jun 14 2019,negative,the visual effects and the sound design of the titans were pretty satisfying as a lifelong godzilla fan however there wasnt a single character worth merit in this entire film and the plot makes less and less sense the more you think about it the first one is the far superior film if you are a godzilla fan seeing the titans on screen is highly satisfying if you are not one there isnt much for you here
Jun 14 2019,neutral,packed full of cgi and gigantic monster fights this addition to the godzilla universe is a hell of an action movie but is less of a king and more of a squire in comparison to the rest of the series a sloppy story that is covered up by mass amounts of destruction the film is designed to be seen in theaters big and loud as can be good for a watch if youre in it for the action godzilla could have used a luckier dragon than ghidorah to make it a must see 
Jun 14 2019,positive,to me godzilla is one of the greatest movie monstrrs in the world this movie made me love godzilla even more that is why i think godzilla king of the monsters is a work of art
Jun 14 2019,positive,cant mess up a godzilla movie great action but dull dialogue still a great watch
Jun 14 2019,positive,love the monster fights
Jun 14 2019,positive,its not prefect but it is a very nice love letter to classic kaiju films one thing i was not expecting was how well done the musical score was done save for one scene that could have used a slightly different choice the movies score was handled quite well bringing a modern touch to several classic tracks from the original films
Jun 14 2019,positive,it was great to see just a goold fashioned smash em up monster movie without all the human garbage in the way
Jun 14 2019,positive,dont let people fool you  was the plot really stupidyesdid we only see 4 monsters which the other 13 barely showyeswere humans involveyes and was there alot of corny parts  yea but guess what the was amazing  we got way more fights then first movie  we got to see giant monsters within 10 minshell ya we did  also maybe human parts were dumb again but guess what movie be like 30 mins if they didnt include some kind story then big monster smash you and thats all we get  have to give them credit compare to godzilla 98 the humans make sense  instead of getting a worm guy to solve the godzilla problem they actually got an animal expertdont know what guy job title is call  who try to explain godzilla behavior in the most natural way possible  if people dont want to see humans in a godzilla film then they never watch the 20 godzilla movies pior to king of the monsters thus not true godzilla fans  also for new people getting into thisgiant monsters fightcome onu really think thats easy and dont use pacific rim as example because thats a movie with humans in giant robots so 100 of movie involve humans  we not rooting for the monsters in that film
Jun 14 2019,negative,my seven year old grandson loved it so who am i to judge
Jun 14 2019,positive,overall great movie only wish the the titans had more screen time
Jun 14 2019,positive,fantastic blend of the greatest elements of godzilla from across the franchise bringing the visuals of the x series the serious approach to the kaiju and their fights as presented in heisei the campiness of the outdated scientific theories of showa and the depth of the main themes of the original 54 film and the kaiju themselves once again are full of personality saying a lot without speaking if you like godzilla than this is the perfect movie for you if you recently discovered godzilla and want a good place to get into the franchise than this film and its prequel are also perfect    ignore the critics consensus as usual they dont really know what theyre talking about
Jun 14 2019,positive,good special effects but needed more story development on the main charactersfamily
Jun 14 2019,positive,great movie a fun call back to the classic godzilla movies but updated for the modern day would recommend 
Jun 14 2019,positive,the sandbox of monsters and locations was more than i hoped for and honestly better than i expected
Jun 14 2019,positive,a feast for your eyes visually stunning and a spectacle for monsterkaiju fans ive always loved godzilla grew up watching all the japanese ones but was not satisfied with the american versions of it till now finally theyve managed to adapt the monster culture in a way that honours the japanese movies and to all the critics this is a movie to entertain to give you an eyegasm not a copy of a beautiful mind why judge all movie genres and types with only one approach parts of the storyline might not have been perfect but still it had a relative solid base and thats all you can ask for from a monster clash movie absolute must see on a big screen
Jun 14 2019,positive,i loved the monster action a lot people didnt like the bland human story line but its not about the humans in this movie its about watching big monsters fight each other so i enjoyed this movie a lot
Jun 14 2019,negative,the movie was too dark  i couldnt see the fight scenes  the story line wasnt that good  something to watch in video at home
Jun 14 2019,positive,it was great to see multiple monsters and the story was good i really enjoyed it
Jun 14 2019,positive,this was my most anticipated summer flick i was not disappointed it felt exactaly like an updated toho movie with a huge budget many people remember godzilla in their minds eye as a kid i dont think people have gone back and watched those movies again as an adult i have this movie is everything those were and more     so many call backs the music the destruction even the device to control the monsters the people evolved in this did their due diligence if you like godzilla st all go see this  
Jun 14 2019,negative,disliked everything it was terrrrrrible
Jun 14 2019,positive,it was a smash up monster movie the acting was not as good as the 2014 version but king ghidorah was unreal
Jun 14 2019,positive,love love the graphics and cgi
Jun 14 2019,positive,it was good but not the kind of movie that you watch second time
Jun 14 2019,positive,amazing movie pretty good story and good battles my only nit pick is i wished they would have used king gadorahs original roar in the movie and made the roars louder
Jun 14 2019,positive,i went to see this for the monster battles and the movie did not disappoint i think the biggest problem with these movies is that producers and directors feel this need to have an ancillary storyline where none is needed and now were burning good fight time on some stupid family drama lol in summation there are a lot of monster fights in this movie and if you grew up on the classic godzilla movies like i did this wont disappoint
Jun 14 2019,positive,very loud very dumb and very entertaining    the third film in the monsterverse franchise king of the monsters is a direct sequel to gareth edwardss 2014 godzilla sadly he didnt return as director and sets up godzilla vs kong which is scheduled for release next summer however whereas edwards held godzilla back and made the action feel smaller by focalising it through the human characters new director michael dougherty inverts that formula putting godzilla front and centre and shooting the action in such a way as to make it seem as grandiose as possible he isnt half the director edwards is but king of the monsters works well in a braindead summer action movie kind of way sure there are significant problems all the best shots are in the trailer the plot is laughable the characters are so thinly sketched as to make those in the first film feel shakespearean but all things considered i enjoyed it    five years since godzilla defeated the mutos many more creatures now dubbed titans have been found in various forms of hibernation in charge of studying and protecting them is monarch sciences introduced in a fledgling state in kong skull island which took place in 1973 however when an ecoterrorist jonah alan charles dance steals a bioacoustics device designed to communicate with the titans he uses it to awaken the only nonterrestrial titan a fearsome threeheaded dragon known as king ghidorah arguing that humanity has brought the planet to the point of destruction jonah believes that a global titan conflict would wipe out most of human civilisation allowing the planet the time it needs to heal and so as ghidorah awakens the various titans godzilla emerges to stand against him    godzilla was originally conceived as a metaphor for the destructive power of nuclear weaponry and king of the monsters has one eye on its themes too eco disaster biodiversity coexistence with other species military impulsiveness but really the sermonising script by dougherty and zach shields is so badly put together that any thematic concerns dissipate into nothing and yes it does address the fact that through inattention and greed humanity is on the brink of ensuring its own extinction the problem is that the eco themes are so preachy they come across as background irrelevancies at best and distracting moralising at worst    and there are other problems with the script for example not one not two but three characters sacrifice themselves for the greater good resulting in none of the sacrifices really meaning anything another scene that doesnt work is the death of a major character which happens so suddenly amidst so much chaos with the camera on even focused on them that in the very next scene the film has to show us their face on a monitor with the word deceased written underneath there are also far too many scenes of characters standing on the bridge of the monarch flagship the argo spouting exposition at one another    there are also some spatial hijinks going on i get that the argo is supposed to be  superadvanced but it seems capable of flying from one side of the planet to the other in about ten minutes another issue is that zhang ziyi plays twins except i didnt even realise there were two of them until i read a few reviews sure i noticed what i thought was a singular character appear to be in two places at once but because the argo had already been globehopping i just put it down to the films lack of geographic realism the fact that its so easy to miss that there are twins is spectacularly bad writing    but for all that i thoroughly enjoyed king of the monsters although the trailer did promise what the film cant deliver on claude debussy and pensive apocalypticism aesthetically theres a lot to admire the sound design is suitably deafening and lawrence shers cinematography has a welljudged sense of scale especially in the 2391 3d imax format the film also does some interesting things with colour coding the titans in binary elemental shades there are also some extraordinary individual shots most of which have been spoiled by the trailer mothra spreading her wings ghidorah perched atop a volcano with a crucifix in the foreground the reveal of godzillas lair and the final shot is a goosebumps moment with which no kaiju fan could possibly be dissatisfied purely at the level of craft this is a hugely impressive film    citizen kane it most certainly isnt but who expected or wanted it to be the key to really parsing it is to consider the context looking at what it was trying to be and in this sense its a success sure the script is hideous and dougherty struggles to accomplish what edwards did with ease bring his own personality to the spectacle however if you approach it for what it is a dumb summer blockbuster about large monsters punching each other youll like it just fine
Jun 14 2019,positive,spectacular movie especially for the fantastic cgi and the 3 battle scenes instead of the two of the average action movie
Jun 14 2019,positive,awesome monster movie i will definitely watch it again
Jun 14 2019,positive,everything that a godzilla movie should be pure carnage and excitement
Jun 14 2019,positive,my son didnt like when the monarch died
Jun 14 2019,positive,entertaining with a lot of action
Jun 14 2019,positive,this movie is a godzillas fan dream nothing but monster action in your face
Jun 14 2019,negative,so terrible that i fell sleep
Jun 14 2019,positive,this movie is exactly what every mans inner child screams for some cheesy one liners and a bunch of giant monsters punching giant monsters the story did the job and was interesting to see the evolution of humanities capacity to adjust in the world of titans remember youre watching it to watch titanic monsters its not james camerons titanic movie 
Jun 14 2019,positive,long live the king the monster fight scenes were great worth seeing
Jun 14 2019,positive,this film is a monster show the story in itself doesnt break anything the villain motivations are very blurry and its hard to swallow emma russell lines of thoughs and there isnt much emotion apart coming from the monster those for the humans are kind of bland like a series b movie however everything regarding the monsters the actions the new lore are the fun parts the fx are pretty decent bradley whitford has the better lines in the movies the 3d effect is absolutely ineffective i give it 72 good film for monsters lovers and a good follow up to the first 
Jun 13 2019,positive,the movie was excellent i highly recommend staying until all the credits are over
Jun 13 2019,negative,too much of a focus on the human characters and not enough on the monsters everyone was waiting to see an epic battle scene with all the monsters and it was really only 4 that battled when the battle between godzilla and ghidora near the end of the movie looked like it might redeem the movie somewhat they blocked the two monsters about to fight with an aircraft that flew into the scene just very disappointing a buildup to nothing
Jun 13 2019,positive,loved it lots of action
Jun 13 2019,positive,the plot is a little wonky at times but the visual effects easter eggs for longtime fans solid acting and awesome fights will satisfy any kaiju fan
Jun 13 2019,positive,awful writing the storyline was mind boggling cinematography was excellent  but the characters were so unbelievably bad acting wasnt terrible for what the actors were given to work with i cant emphasize enough how bad the plot line was whoever came up with this script should never write a big budget hollywood movie ever again i am just glad i got viewing this out of the way to make way for the godzilla vs kong matchup thats all i want to see at this point long live the king
Jun 13 2019,positive,monster were great humans were pretty lame
Jun 13 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movies my mother wouldve loved it especially with the designs of the kajius
Jun 13 2019,positive,i loved it not happy with ending i wanted more like did godzilla start where zero left off
Jun 13 2019,positive,i loved it it was all i had hoped for and more
Jun 13 2019,positive,this movie is awesome i was at the edge of my seat the time the problem with the last godzilla was they never showed the monsters or the fighting till the end not this time we got so much more monster screen time and it was just so epic king ghidora was so  cool i just felt likr whoever made the movie loved godzilla as much as i did i felt like a kid all over again i kept getting dry mouth haha i am so happy to see such a masterpiece  imagine godzilla and king kong next year  they are doing the fans such an amazing service thank you legendary i highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves godzilla monsters or just good movies in general
Jun 13 2019,positive,loved it definitely worth going to see go godzilla go
Jun 13 2019,positive,amazing loved every second of it
Jun 13 2019,positive,it was so amazing i love it
Jun 13 2019,positive,i loved this movie easily one of the best modern monster movies of our time i definitely recommend it
Jun 13 2019,positive,a fantastic kaiju rumble from start to finish definitely reminded me of a lot of the old godzilla films all rolled into one a nice addition to the franchise
Jun 13 2019,positive,it was a good godzilla movie
Jun 13 2019,positive,went in expecting weak characters a paper thin plot full of dubious holes and a highly entertaining thunderous display of earthshattering kaiju battles got just what i expected
Jun 13 2019,positive,as a fan of godzilla i have to say that i enjoyed this movie  not sure how a nonfan would like it but for fans it was nice to see several of godzillas old friends and enemies on the big screen again
Jun 13 2019,positive,great effects brought me back to my childhood always a godzilla fan wish there was some king kong tho
Jun 13 2019,negative,whilst i am not going to defend this poorly conceived attempt in building up wbs monster universe the film is hardly loathsome or irritating just numbing and unremarkable following gareth edwards 2014 reboot which reintroduced us to godzilla and ended up destroying san francisco michael doughertys film set 5 years later introduced us to the russells a husband and wife scientists kyle chandler and vera farmiga who after suffering a tragedy back in sf have invented the macguffin orca which manipulates the frequencies the monsters emit in order to control them  and chaos ensues on paper the fight between godzilla and the threeheaded king ghidorah together with the appearance of mothra and rodan wrecking havoc on our poor planet has potential but the cg effects are murky and monotonous with no big names and a script beset with superficial characterizations and flimsy motivations the audience is never invested in any of the monster cast of characters assembled on screen while ken watanabe and sally hawkins return to connect with the earlier film and ziyi zhang is mainly here for her asian market appeal more character actors and tv actors join in to enhance and glam up their imdb credentials as this bloated cast has little to do other than spouting expositions between action sequences while a chosen few get to make heroic sacrifices that fail to pack much of an emotional punch ultimately this is all too predictable and safe almost to the point of insipid and things just get louder and louder while the mass destruction onscreen gets more wanton and inconsequential with little going for it in terms of style and fun this ambitious bridging movie thats supposed to lead us into the big one with kong only proves that size sadly is not everything
Jun 13 2019,positive,very good only saw it once but very good there was this one part that part that kind of made me mad and there was a plot point that dragged on a bit of extra human drama
Jun 13 2019,positive,godzilla fans will like how kept similar story lines like old movies
Jun 13 2019,negative,i enjoyed watching the monsters fight but there isnt enough of it not nearly enough
Jun 13 2019,positive,a surprisingly conservative film great
Jun 13 2019,positive,pretty good movie great effects
Jun 13 2019,positive,it was very good the theater was comforting and yhe movie was one of the bests
Jun 13 2019,positive,it needed more facts on monsters
Jun 13 2019,positive,monster fights fun summertime popcorn movie
Jun 13 2019,positive,one word that describes godzilla king of the monsters underrated true its poorly written but awesome action sequences special effects and well monsters overtake that flaw
Jun 13 2019,positive,massive fun cant wait for the next one
Jun 13 2019,positive,this movie was great the low rating of the critics is most likely due to the fact they never watched the older movies the amount of easter eggs from the old movies were insane however the movie was really fast paced so at the end my brain felt like a mushy plump the final downside is mainly due to some of the shots taken of the fights being in awkward positions otherwise the cgi is great and unlike the critics say the characters feel real and you can understand and feel for them wanting them to connect 
Jun 13 2019,positive,what did the critics think they were going to watch  so dumb  its a big monster battle movie  get off your high horse and just watch a movie for the sake of watching a movie  40  pro critics are a joke
Jun 13 2019,positive,excellent movie ill definitely recommend to a friends
Jun 13 2019,positive,all i have to say is that this movie was top 3 of the year
Jun 13 2019,positive,overall it was good but i felt that there were holes in the storyline from the beginning  i was super hyped to see this movie after seeing the previews so maybe my expectations were to high  
Jun 13 2019,positive,loved the continuation of the movies saga
Jun 13 2019,positive,i liked the movie but was disappointed that they change the look of godzilla
Jun 13 2019,positive,i loved all the visuals and effects it was amazing 
Jun 13 2019,positive,felt like a love letter to fans of even the oldest toho studios films absolutely outdid themselves and realized that in godzilla movies the focus is never the human characters that only are there to move the plot forwards beautifully shot and the cg was top notch
Jun 13 2019,positive,this movie does not live up to the last  should have waited for it to come out on dvd
Jun 13 2019,positive,as a longtime godzilla and kaiju fan i have to publicy thank michael dougherty director beanbear mccreary music and all the wonderful actors and staff of legendary for bring us an unabashed spectacle of giant monsters fighting each other this is the movie of the year for me it was a dream come true for many fans and a joy to watch for every other moviegoer in the theater is the kind of movie ypu must see at the cinema to fully appretiate it what a blast 
Jun 13 2019,positive,character design and story were excellent
Jun 13 2019,positive,great movie well worth the ticket price
Jun 13 2019,positive,i have been a godzilla fan for over 40 years the new modern movies do godzilla justice and cant wait for more
Jun 13 2019,positive,its loud obnoxious and awesome i watched this on the biggest movie screen in colorado the dolby cinema at amc chapel hills and if you want to enjoy this movie to the fullest i suggest you see it on the biggest screen you can find godzilla is the king of monster movies and the setup for the godzilla monsterverse makes me excited to see the big guy back in action again soon godzilla vs kong coming next year    dont expect this movie to have a great story or great characters because it doesnt youll will probably dislike it because it was not meant for audiences to be attracted to the storyline but just to watch giant monsters fight each other and destroy cities sorry boston its your turn to be destroyed a lot of the dialogue was very quiet and annoying even with some good actors like ken watanabe vera farmiga and millie bobby brown theyre really just faces just like bryan cranston in the last movie     if you go in just to watch mosters fight each other then you will proabably enjoy this one there is plenty of fighting and much more than in the previous movie so that adds to the epicness that is godzilla dont expect too much else though     even though its a critics nightmare i will always love these godzilla movies theyre just plain fun will i be rewatching this anytime soon no but its worth a watch in the theaters in my opinion i had a lot of fun watching the fight scenes but when it was just the humans it was bland 
Jun 13 2019,positive,this movie is truly a mixed bag i saw it twice on my first watch through my mind was a bit shut off due to the excitement and i went blazed even snuck some mcdonalds into the theater and so i loved it upon my second viewing i tried to focus more on the story and man oh man is the story mostly trash the alist talent in this movie is completely wasted and majority of the cast could have been cut to achieve the exact same story the human plot lines were a bit boring and dragged on without much actually getting done and just waiting and praying for godzilla to show up and bail them out at the last second many times it felt like watching a youtube reaction video with characters simply reacting to a tv screen while never feeling like theyre truly in danger plot armor is fairly heavy in this movie and it doesnt need to be and things just kind of happen with little setup or explanation however anytime godzilla is on screen or any of the other titanskaiju for that matter its truly breathtaking and magnificent michael dougherty clearly has immense love and respect for these monsters but its clear he loved the monsters a lot more than the humans because much more thought and care was put into the monsters and how they act and what their goals are ghidorah is menacing and clearly a true monster it is vicious and almost unnecessarily cruel it basically makes charles dances character obsolete as the main villain once he frees the three headed dragon from its sleep which is a waste of such an incredible actors potential at the end of the movie you will forget majority of the human characters names or what they even did but will be scrambling google trying to learn more about the new titans and make excited guesses as to what could be in store for godzilla vs kong i give this a good rating despite its human flaws because once again the titans are truly awe inspiring and amazing seeing rodan ghidorah mothra and many new faces come to life in such an astounding and newly grounded way treating them as living animals with biological instincts and feelingsman theres truly nothing like it reimagining the monsters and their powers while still staying very respectful to their origins was clearly a labor of love and it paid off i recommend you see this movie just to see these incredible beasts come to life in a whole new way if youre okay with turning your that didnt make sense part of your brain off this movie is incredible 
Jun 13 2019,positive,best movie of the year for a real fan  real fans of other franchises may be disappointed with what is coming out of hollywood these days but this one is a diamond in the rough 
Jun 13 2019,positive,i loved the monsters they looked absolutely horrifying and every shot they were in was awesome and cinematic the human characters in the story all leave some kind of impression with you which is always good you dont want bland throw aways the overall human plot was pretty decent but the amazing monster fights make up for any slack
Jun 13 2019,positive,really interesting story and the overall movie was great the effects were really good and the fights were amazing to watch i recommend watching the first movie cuz if you dont you wont know what the hell is going on 
Jun 13 2019,negative,too much handwringing from the ridiculously overthought plotline integrating the ethics of humanitys relationship to nature distracted from the fact that this is a movie about monsters if the creators wanted to communicate some moral about humanity and its bent toward selfdestruction it would have done better to make the point with fewer words the whole point of movies is to show not tell    all the best moments in the movie are in the trailer
Jun 13 2019,positive,kept my attention good action
Jun 13 2019,positive,i found this film to be a great sequel to the prior films godzilla kong skull island and i cant wait to see the final grudge match against the two main players next year
Jun 13 2019,negative,very unrealistic  we fell asleep
Jun 13 2019,positive,epic fight thats the point of this movie
Jun 13 2019,neutral,i love the concept and the first godzilla from this series was great this sequel just kinda lacks its not lone ranger terrible but pretty lame and i hate to say that as a scifi lover
Jun 13 2019,positive,this one finally met godzilla movie expectations
Jun 13 2019,positive,a very good movie solid acting technology
Jun 13 2019,positive,awesome monster fights and musical score  this movie deserves to be seen on a big screen
Jun 13 2019,positive,movie was awesome def the best one yet
Jun 13 2019,positive,exactly what you want in a big monster mash movie action packed fun with great laughs through out the plot isperfect for the massive monster battle royale its a shame rotten tomatoes and other movie critic site tarnish a movies rep when alot of their ratings are the opposite of their own followings opinion this is why i usually disregard a rt low score when you promote garbage movies and hurt anything that doesnt fit your own formula
Jun 13 2019,neutral,good special effects but boring storyline and some bad acting
Jun 13 2019,negative,long on action and special effects and short on plot skull island was much better
Jun 13 2019,positive,it was a fun movie to watch very predictable but still fun they have some good story lines which lead to future movies but i wish we had seen more build with some of the other monsters it felt rushed in that sense still worth a watch
Jun 13 2019,positive,so this being a follow up to 2014s godzilla sorry 1998 you can keep matthew broderick it delivered on 2 points more monster fighting and less characterization  if we wanted deep character back stories in a monster movie we would watch oh i dont know 2003s monster with charlize theron maybe  we finally got to see complete godzilla throwdowns with big bads and not having them cut away like the scenes on the tv in the 2014 movie  the introduction of the classic titans such as rodan ghidora and mothra were great it was also nice to see homages to aspects to the classic mothra movies thrown in there as well ie twin japanese women  all in all solid effort  you have to suspend some disbelief when it comes to the human element of the story  there are some moments when you say to your self i dont think so or even a couple of bs alerts  but what can you say  it scifi  go for the monsters
Jun 13 2019,positive,terrible movie but it had monsters 
Jun 13 2019,positive,all the old monsters we grew up watching were brought to life and so lifelike and real the story was good to best special effects than any other godzilla to date popcorn summer fun all the way will own this one when blue ray disc is released
Jun 13 2019,positive,storyline for humans is questionable  cgi is beautiful  watchable movie with many easter eggs that would make tnt cable channel proud when it hits their viewers
Jun 13 2019,positive,loved it as a godzilla fan very fun from the beginning just expect though the only reason the human characters exist are to set up scenarios where big monsters fight each other regardless of what theyre intentions might be
Jun 13 2019,negative,its slow and boring movie not impressed
Jun 13 2019,positive,great monster smash film boring human drama
Jun 13 2019,positive,the action was awesome great story line
Jun 13 2019,positive,amazing movie great storylines and godzilla was a bad ass
Jun 13 2019,negative,after a promising start the movie soon nosedives  the storyline is pretty horrific as is the script as the characters are all over the place not really knowing who is doing what as there were so many  oh my god zilla was actually even uttered  the monsters were dull zero looked like it was borrowed from a clash of the titans movie and godzilla was well the same as always  i did like the sound though nice and loud with plenty of boom  i reckon sally hawkins must have read the script and demanded her characters early demise  
Jun 13 2019,positive,fun but too loud and over top with big moments and trying to be epic over acted
Jun 13 2019,positive,human characters could have been better
Jun 13 2019,neutral,not a good movie characters unlikable  effects subpar storyline insane
Jun 13 2019,positive,this film was amazing and actionpacked  even when the godly titans werent fighting or onscreen the human characters were so interesting and developed that you were still intrigued  the build ups were amazing and the music to go with it made it sound like these titans were actual gods
Jun 13 2019,positive,godzilla is still king of the monsters
Jun 13 2019,positive,anytime a monster was onscreen it was incredible
Jun 13 2019,positive,loved being able to see the monsters i used to watch in the 70s come to life now in 2019 if you loved those movies you will love the movie
Jun 13 2019,negative,so boring but the end fight scene was kinda cool
Jun 13 2019,positive,great when the monsters are on screen but the actors slow down the movie quite a bit  if you like giant kaiju fighting each other then youll like this a lot
Jun 13 2019,positive,the monsters were great fun 3 d was awesome
Jun 13 2019,negative,the special effects were basic and not at the level you would expect in 2019 there should have been clearer  more graphic monster battles the story line took too long to lay out  made the movie prolonged  dry we could have waited for the cable tv showing
Jun 13 2019,positive,i loved the action but i wouldnt mind to have had more connection as an audience to the characters instead it felt like you were dropped in disaster after disaster but no need for the characters to be a significant point in the show
Jun 13 2019,positive,the action sequences were amazing the dialogue and the human characters were very cliche though
Jun 13 2019,positive,i loved it was more than i expected i love monster movies tho so im biased glad i got to see it on the big screen 
Jun 13 2019,negative,nonsensical such unlikable characters and wasted charles dance by making him smirk from a distance uttering nonsense
Jun 13 2019,positive,i loved it its a big love letter to godzilla fans i dont watch godzilla movies expecting schindlers list and neither should anyone else that being said this movie gives godzilla fans everything they could ewant 
Jun 13 2019,positive,loved the movie still a fan after 20 years
Jun 13 2019,positive,you go to see this movie for badass giant monsters fighting against another badass giants monsters    the only problem with godzilla kotm its the human drama about the mom and girl it needs to happen or it will be so bored but i can be better to be honest    if you are interesed about kaijus or monsterverse yes you need to see this movie    dont care about critics they think a 60s japan monster that destroy everything its a family that lost a child and they need help carrying the problem making the kaijus fighting themselves drama lol
Jun 13 2019,positive,very awesome movie seeing most of the classic monsters in it
Jun 13 2019,positive,the monsters were great unfortunately the monsters they hired to write the script werent as good its obvious they put a lot of work into the visuals there were a bunch of shots that looked almost like paintings and the design of everything was very stylized and i thought it worked for it something that surprised me was the actual scale of everything felt realistic to the situation a lot of movies tend to say somethings the size of a city but it just blows up right away and you feel numb to the size and strength of it the effects teams in this one didnt entirely let that happen the entire time it really feels like a giant behemoth and not just another set piece but i guess someone got my list of things i hate hearing in movies and decided to just use that as the script  i honestly think if there wasnt any dialogue it wouldve worked better mostly because they do really good visual storytelling
Jun 13 2019,positive,adrenaline rush to the core a must see for all
Jun 13 2019,positive,very entertaining movie good to see all the old monsters back in one movie
Jun 13 2019,positive,i have been a godzilla fan since the 1960s it was full of humanity action and a hope for the future
Jun 13 2019,positive,this is what godzilla is supposed to be big loud fun destructive just like watching creature features 
Jun 13 2019,positive,if youre not over critical about everything in your life and you love godzilla this is a very entertaining movie i really have a great time
Jun 13 2019,positive,in summary a beautifully made and epic monster movie the experts rating were way off i have read briefly of the critiques this film either lacked human character developments or the human story elements get in the way of the monsters i didnt think both are true the human story worked well with the titans i think without the 2014s human drama development i would not have appreciated king of monsters simply put if its just monsters fighting without depth of story of the human struggles with the monsters it would make it a flat and boring film perhaps there was a little uneven flow of plots but it didnt get in the way of the overall story the pacing was good leading to a great big spectacular ending after watching john wick 3 and endgame avengers i think godzilla 2 stood out refreshingly in various aspects all creatures were well made  animated the cg production and environment were seamless soundtrack was great too give it a chance on the big screen well worth it
Jun 13 2019,positive,fun  better than we thought
Jun 13 2019,positive,motion caption for king ghidorah is amazing especially alan maxon 
Jun 13 2019,positive,great but  too much dark and rain ha
Jun 13 2019,negative,the worse movie ever
Jun 13 2019,positive,it was very interesting and the godzilla was what i was use to seeing
Jun 13 2019,positive,i dont want to give anyone the impression that this film will blow your mind or leave you perfectly satisfied when you leave the theater but it is a good movie acting is great ken watanabes acting was perhaps the most dry but i am not familiar with what he can do so his dryness may have been an attempt to give the character a personalityeven if a somewhat inflexible one the father figure played by kyle chandler is a believable guy but not developed beyond the potential that the actor brings to the role i think the main weakness with the acting is simply that the movie is caught between developing the monsters and developing the humans    the plot is not too complicated you cant follow but its also not terribly streamlined this again might be the conflict between the human drama and the monster drama    overall i really recommend this movie if not in theater on dvdnetflix its worth the adrenaline    for godzilla fans i am not sure how the movie held up but as a nongodzilla fan walking in i wanted to know more about him walking out
Jun 13 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie  i got to watch it in an empty theater gotta love late night showtimes and i was hopping in my chair shouting at the screen the whole nine yards  even the parts i didnt like which were few and far between were entertaining enough to keep my attention and when the action hits boy do you feel it  i highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the classics or even just looking for a good action flick  it is phenomenal
Jun 13 2019,positive,focused more on the fighting and the action rather than the humans it was great
Jun 13 2019,positive,i didnt know it was about dinosaurs but it was cute
Jun 13 2019,negative,do not go to this movie it is awful the plot lines are ridiculous there are so many holes that the movie makes no sense they just create stuff out of thin air with no explanation the acting was also weak and the dialogue was trite and cliched please save your money and see something else i wanted to leave after the first quarter so disappointed i didnt 
Jun 13 2019,positive,awesome movie   after the credits is a sneak peek of a sequel 
Jun 13 2019,positive,great movie layout with nice special effects
Jun 13 2019,positive,he pick up a critic and he throws em back down as he wades through reviews that were written by clooowns godzilla its summer popcorn fare sometimes slow sometimes really not there was a nice thread of continuity from the johnsoncranston movie the chacacters were worthy of our empathy the giant airplane carrier concept has been done to death now couple of continuity errors but it was nice to see the saturday afternoon movie monsters of my childhood brought to us in a modern format  story cant get too much of that radioactive hate breath these days whats next
Jun 13 2019,negative,nearly fell asleep this story seemed to have minimal linkage to earlier movie lots of destruction by monsters could have had more character development that would tie in to future movies as it turned out the hope was that this would be the final movie of this series
Jun 13 2019,positive,whether you followed the original movies or not its easy to a appreciate this movie for what it is and thats a knock down drag out monster brawl fans of the franchise will appreciate the way the movie ties in all the originals but in a new way go go godzilla
Jun 13 2019,positive,outstanding graphics great story line great presentation of the us armed forces in action with giant monsters
Jun 13 2019,negative,a bloated example of why you need a good writing team it was technically proficient with a fantastic score and wonderful effects but they arent everything everything from the lackluster story to the poor writing to the phonedin performances of many great actors made this film unwatchable after a while and may i just say the constant cutting away from action to focus on human stories is infuriating no one cares about the humans in a godzilla film please just give us more godzilla story and if you cant find a writer to write a good script or story around it keep looking dont just settle for the guy who lazily wrote krampus godzilla must be treated better and as a megafan this can not be acceptable its not a horrible film but it does a disservice to fans and moviegoers alike while crapping all over the biggest monster in hollywood congrats michael 
Jun 13 2019,positive,excellent  loved the giant monster battles theres a little bit of pacing here  there but its still pretty good
Jun 13 2019,positive,amazing movie spectacular effects and a great story 
Jun 13 2019,positive,just a godzilla fan sense birth  the good ones and the bad ones  loved it
Jun 13 2019,negative,terrible script long winded walked out after half an hour
Jun 13 2019,positive,if you love godzilla movies this one is the best everrrrr
Jun 13 2019,negative,too dark and the monsters were not realistic a bad storyline
Jun 13 2019,negative,im glad i saw it at a discount price
Jun 13 2019,negative,way too long and having not seen part 1 had zero emotional investment not that you needed it to not be disappointed
Jun 13 2019,positive,omg best monster movie ever so much to say 5 stars isnt enough in my opinion
Jun 13 2019,positive,the visuals are beatiful you have so many screen pictures tu use and i like the story a real problem but with a non real solution to it
Jun 13 2019,positive,the plot action climax and the characters of the movie
Jun 13 2019,positive,it was good in graphics and story but i feel they could really do more with the other monsters overall because rodan has beaten godzilla before and now hes a weaklingalso angirus appears in two scenes
Jun 13 2019,positive,just a movie to watch relax and very exited by the colorful and epicness is godzilla
Jun 13 2019,positive,way better than the first setting up for the movie ive been waiting for
Jun 13 2019,positive,amazing the plot is honestly subpar but come on thats not why you see a godzilla movie the action cgi and special effects more than make up for it this is the big budget godzilla movie fans have been waiting for since the 1998 tragedy if you have ever liked a godzilla movie please please go see this movie
Jun 13 2019,positive,absolutely loved this movie an impressive amount of archetypal imagery for a monster movie and as always ken watanabes performance was impressive as always the monsters were more expressive characters than some of the other actors but that just goes to show how well done all the cgi was
Jun 13 2019,positive,monsters causing destruction awesome
Jun 13 2019,positive,ive always been a monster movie fan since i was a child andvthis one did not disappoint looking forward to the next installment
Jun 13 2019,positive,its got the best toho kaiju in it and they all fight each other  the humans are dumb as expected its a blast
Jun 13 2019,positive,very entertaining and great fight scenes
Jun 13 2019,positive,i thought that we could have done without the reference to atlantis to many tangents but overall it reminds me of godzilla from my childhood
Jun 13 2019,positive,great action scenes dialog was weak though
Jun 13 2019,positive,great monster movie but we need more fighting scenes in the final battle
Jun 13 2019,positive,it was good no real wow affect but it was good
Jun 13 2019,positive,just 2 hours of cgi  and loudness
Jun 13 2019,positive,the critics got it totally wrong on this one this movie is exactly what a godzilla movie should be it was obvious that this was made with the fans in mind while also being accessible to general audiences
Jun 13 2019,positive,this is exactly what a godzilla fan would want kaiju fighting kaiju while keeping a more simple story with the human characters and kept my girlfriend and i more entertained than we were with the first godzilla in 2014
Jun 13 2019,positive,good godzilla movie but not perfect still if you are a godzilla fan youll find most of what you were looking for here definitely worth seeing on a big screen
Jun 13 2019,positive,it made me cry when mothra died
Jun 13 2019,negative,confusing plot but great monster action
Jun 13 2019,positive,very good film for fans of all godzilla movies  it reminds me very much of a modern interpretation of destroy all monsters and i enjoyed it to say the least  the writing for the human characters could have been better but the cgi was incredible and the monsters fights offset any writing deficiencies in my opinion  i give it 4 out of 5 stars and it is a movie that i highly recommend
Jun 13 2019,positive,the action was outstanding moment after moment of extreme monster action and fighting some may say the acting performances were meh but to be honest they were better than expected definitely should see with your entire family its a very fun and exciting movie godzillathe monster is the definition of action he provides everything you need to see in a monster the other titans introduced in the movie did not disappoint and the special effects were beautiful and incredible best monster action movie i have ever seen
Jun 12 2019,positive,they call godzilla king of the monsters for a reason   it was totally awesome  it super cool when you have more that two monsters butts to kick   throw in a bunch of akicking special effects a large popcorn and a large soda and youre ready to go and fortunately so was godzilla
Jun 12 2019,positive,despite what paid critics say if youre a fan of monster movies whether old or new this is a must see theres a good balance of human focus and monster focus though the monsters are much more interesting than the humans its basically a love letter to godzilla fans
Jun 12 2019,positive,really good movie definitely the best godzilla movie so far
Jun 12 2019,positive,i loved it very much
Jun 12 2019,positive,fck the critics this is a love letter to the moviegoers not the people who professionally judge things without ever having done that in which they judge rotten tomato just goes to show how out of touch these clowns really are and always have been robert ebert actually tried to prove this untrue once let return to the valley of the dolls serve as a constant reminder that critics are just the original internet trolls passing judgement from behind their keyboards pathetic
Jun 12 2019,positive,ok movie a little slow and long but basic story nothing different
Jun 12 2019,positive,hands down the best godzilla film ive seen so far go get your friends your family your family dog get everyone to watch this movie   this film has everything a godzilla fan could ever want in a movie the characters the plot the action and especially the monsters this is a film you dont want to miss  man i shed tears of joy throughout the whole movie this is seriously a film you have to watch  all hail godzilla king of the monsters
Jun 12 2019,positive,honestly lets be real its a godzilla movie it is basically made to see badass fights between giant monsters as they destroy citys and yes the story and plot could be wonky but at the end of the day its monsters fighting monsters what more do you want
Jun 12 2019,positive,spoiler alerts    when i first saw the first one 5 years ago the hype of that film was worth it and i can say i feel the same to this latest godzilla film in the new monsterverse and i have to say this is by far one of the best godzilla film i have seen in a long time     the story was great it had interesting ideas and character development and best of all and this is the first they gave godzilla his original roar and even the 1954 roar in one scene which was the best thing i had seen and my reaction on it was shocking and i was happy    king ghidorah was also an amazing but terrorizing monster in the film and at one scene made my mouth drop was him eating one of the main cast which i love how the middle head is like not liking this at all and when he does get his comeuppance by godzilla it was by far my favorite scene in the movie    if there is one thing i do have to complain about is the critic and bad reviews on this film docent make any sense    perfect example some say that there too much monster fights and not many human scenes kinda weird since its the opposite of what critics and fans me me included not a lot of monster fight and lots of human scenes    when i went to see this film on june 2nd i didnt notice this at all since it was 50 human and monster scenes and i can say this was more lighter then godzilla 2014 as i will agree that one was kinda hard to see as it was shot or put in night time      in the end this is still a great film way more better than the netflix anime film and i am happy that the wait is finally over and im looking for to godzilla vs kong next year this film is a 9510
Jun 12 2019,positive,superior special effects
Jun 12 2019,positive,great effects entertaining flick
Jun 12 2019,positive,it was fine couldve stayed away from the human characters more i mean seriously its godzilla why should i care about the humans problems especially when said problems are cliche and just time consuming next time just focus on the monster fights thats what everyones here for so give the people what they want literally nobody cares about the human characters all they do is spew exposition they really dont matter
Jun 12 2019,positive,this film while not perfect is an epic tribute directed by a fan for the fans there is so much to unpack from this film and ive seen it 3 times over opening weekend and have even purchased the soundtrack the story is a little weak but not without its merits clever plot devices and a couple characters that really shine the monster scenes fantastic absolutely an atomic blast of epic fights accompanied by an incredible film score by bear mccreary     if you grew up watching the old toho films or thought the 2014 godzilla film didnt have enough monster battles youll really enjoy godzilla king of the monsters go see it i know i will at least once more
Jun 12 2019,positive,its was alright better than all the other godzilla movies thats for sure
Jun 12 2019,positive,less dialogue  more monster fighting  what happened to mothra the queen vs rodan  prefer more of a shallow human plot to viewing more monster battle scenes  we missed a lot between godzilla vs ghidorah and mothra vs rodan
Jun 12 2019,positive,this was the real original godzilla along with all the monsters  there was even a subtle reference to motheras twins  add in todays technology
Jun 12 2019,positive,need more monsters fights and less people
Jun 12 2019,positive,loved it  cant wait for the next one
Jun 12 2019,positive,everything a godzilla movie should be
Jun 12 2019,positive,good entertaining but not very much as far as storyline worth a watch or two
Jun 12 2019,negative,full of stereotypes acting not very good visually entertaining but thats it
Jun 12 2019,positive,it was really good and the critics are bull as usual if you came for a human drama then i dont know why you are watching a godzilla movie if you came for epic giant monsters then hell yeah this is the movie
Jun 12 2019,positive,if your a godzilla fan you will love this movie the grafics and cgi are some of the best to come to a monster movie the plot and human story was awesome for a monster movie loved all the easter eggs and the godzilla scenes
Jun 12 2019,positive,these critic reviews baffle me what movie were you expecting when you went to see godzilla if you expected anything other than a spectacle of monster mayhem cgi destruction and cheesy dialogue then the fault lies with you entertaining and filled with some of the best cgi ive ever seen     b
Jun 12 2019,positive,probably the best godzilla film in many many years im amazed that a us studio could pull off such an outstanding godzilla film the film puts more emphasis on the monsters which is what most people want in a monster film anyway far and away the final battle scene left me over satisfied and excited to see what they do with godzilla vs kong
Jun 12 2019,positive,started out good but then became very predictable
Jun 12 2019,positive,absolutely stunning
Jun 12 2019,positive,it was pretty good i actually enjoyed it
Jun 12 2019,positive,liked monsters fighting worth the watch
Jun 12 2019,negative,omg perhaps the worst hodgepodge  flic in a long time 2 hours ill never get back
Jun 12 2019,positive,this movie was made for the fanboys and fangirls watched it with my adult sister and we were both pumping our fists when the old school godzilla and mothra theme music started playing this was a movie made for the audience and not the critics and that is ok if you grew up watching the old school movies you will definitely appreciate this movie if you are hoping this will have the emotional depth of latest basedoffajaneaustennovel period film then you will be sorely disappointed 
Jun 12 2019,neutral,the monsters were great i can always do with some more godzilla the rodon entrance was particularly good there just wasnt enough of monsters the humans were with some exceptions uninteresting and not likable also i could do with more monster fights in broad day light godzilla et al spent way too much time obscured by weather 
Jun 12 2019,positive,its perfect monster movie
Jun 12 2019,positive,absolutly enjoyed tbis film will be going to see again forget what the critics say if you love monster movies you will love this
Jun 12 2019,positive,awesome effects tons of action
Jun 12 2019,positive,lots of action interesting story great characters
Jun 12 2019,negative,this was one big continuious battle that suddenly became a political statement on climate change of all the dcmarvel action thriller movies this one was the worst the plot was predictable and the cgi wasnt much better than the original japanese godzilla movies of the 60s and 70s save your money and watch on line next month
Jun 12 2019,positive,way better than i expected what you want and expect from a godzilla movie that doesnt drag on between visually epic monster battles
Jun 12 2019,positive,i enjoyed it though i thought they cut away w a lot during the battles to me godzilla movies need to have decent battles as well as human element  for ppl who care as for me i never did i just think american audience and or critics complain when humans dont get their screen time or story isnt up to snuff  if u look back none of the plots were good for me  i  never cared bout human story it was just there to pass time till godzilla shows up 
Jun 12 2019,positive,good solid fun lots of monster fighting fun and it didnt shy away from the silliness of the franchises roots
Jun 12 2019,positive,king of monsters kept me entertained throughout the entire film i felt that the film was paced nicely and it kept me engaged the entire time
Jun 12 2019,positive,it ties to the old movies great way to bring godzilla to the present day
Jun 12 2019,negative,boring cgi fights  wobbly human subplot
Jun 12 2019,positive,king of the monster movies color size scale majesty see it on a big screen and enjoy
Jun 12 2019,negative,this movie was a trip down memory lane if you loved the old dimeadozen japanese monster movies from the 60s you might love this too it brings back monster zero mothra rodan and of course godzilla all of them minus the zipper if you didnt like these movies then skip it

Jun 12 2019,positive,not enough godzilla
Jun 12 2019,positive,was a little long and the plot was a little distorted hard to follow  fight scenes were good
Jun 12 2019,positive,what do the critics know probably never seen a vintage godzilla movie this movie kicks the visual effects area little below par but to see the king in all his glory is worth watching

Jun 12 2019,positive,it was a godzilla movie they did so much to love the only thing id whine about would be there was too much cutting away from on going action to focus on the humans its great to have a story from them but not when all the titans are going buck wild all in all tho it was a great movie i plan on watching it again soon
Jun 12 2019,positive,it was really good unlike godzilla it had lots of monsters and monster fights thought it was well paced and the world building was pretty interesting    but unfortunately also unlike godzilla there was no elizabeth olsen 
Jun 12 2019,negative,the one star is for the effects and the time it took to make this movie i know its a lot of hard work but the story and pacing for a movie this expensive to make was uninteresting long ridiculous and the writers and director should give the money they were paid to the rest of the staff
Jun 12 2019,negative,this movie is ridiculously boring and there is almost no fighting
Jun 12 2019,positive,it has some plot holes but its a kaiju movie  it was a lot of fun and good special effects
Jun 12 2019,positive,good showing of old school
Jun 12 2019,negative,horrible plot and story line
Jun 12 2019,positive,the movie is a dream comes true the action is great the special effect is satisfying the story well im not really paying attention to that i just want to witness the action
Jun 12 2019,positive,very fun movie highly recommend seeing it in with the best sound you can find as long as you dont expect anything more than battling monsters you should be over the moon with this movie
Jun 12 2019,negative,i thought i just travelled back in time to watch a 50s monster movie but with better vfx silly story and poorly directed a total disappointment after the previous two
Jun 12 2019,positive,bad plot over the top acting and one giant invincible airplane all the correct elements to satisfy the true godzilla aficionado reminds me of godzilla movies growing up absolutely loved it me and my son cant wait for the next installment 
Jun 12 2019,positive,the plot may be simple but the depth of the movie is just phenomenal along with the visuals and action scenes emotional parts along with amazing soundtracks as a godzilla fan myself i approve this
Jun 12 2019,positive,just a really good overall godzilla movie short on story but thats not what these movies are aboutits all about the awesomeness of the monsters

Jun 12 2019,negative,what a entertaining but uninteresting film 
Jun 12 2019,positive,i thought they did a great job with this movie acting was good as was the story line and of corse the special effects were amazing 
Jun 12 2019,positive,the movie was reminiscent of the 50s old godzilla movies but without seeing men in monster suits  the monster were great and the fighting scenes were awesome  would go see it again and recommend this movie to others
Jun 12 2019,positive,dynamic and so original
Jun 12 2019,positive,this was the godzilla movie ive been waiting for since i was a teen in the 90s lots of monster action classic story and the return of all of the classic monsters from the days of old iconic music tons as well and the acting was pretty solid maybe im biased but i loved every moment of this movie
Jun 12 2019,negative,chaotic plot that had no reasonable pattern that i could discern  a waste of two hours
Jun 12 2019,negative,it was 100 degrees outside and this was the first movie showing i would have walked out but it was 100 degrees outside lol its a stinker wait for the video and then pick something else sorry
Jun 12 2019,positive,awesome movie kept my 12 year old at the edge of his seat
Jun 12 2019,positive,it was what i was looking for a badass monster movie just less humans next time still great 
Jun 12 2019,positive,it was amazing and highly underrated mainly due to people watching it for the wrong reasons when i watched it i was expecting to see a 350ft monster go against a500ft dragon that makes got dragons look pale in comparison beat the snot out of each other and i got just that we dont watch godzilla for the humans we watch it for godzilla plus the easter eggs for true fans makes it an even better film
Jun 12 2019,positive,im gonna be honestthe only reason i saw this film was because watching a trailer for it in the theater made me realize the visuals would be best seen for the first time on a big screen that being said i enjoyed this movie the visuals were stunning i particularly loved the soundtrack like damn the human focus didnt really bother me the russells struggle felt real that being saidspoilers spoilers spoilers after the twist with emma vera farmiga i kinda disliked her for the rest of the movie props to farmiga though i guess if i felt so strongly about that character she was doing her job right also rip serizawa you made me tear up for me godzilla was a summer blockbuster and it didnt disappoint
Jun 12 2019,positive,got what i expected a great monster movie
Jun 12 2019,positive,fan of godzilla movies growing up awesome addition
Jun 12 2019,positive,action packed i want more back story
Jun 12 2019,positive,everything was amazing
Jun 12 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was the best movie i have ever seen the fight scenes were awesome all the titans were designed perfectly and every fight could be your next desktop wallpaper extremely underrated movie marvel is about to have some competition  
Jun 12 2019,negative,big loud and bloated the movie barely passes the time too much dumb human interaction that takes away from the barely put together plot the movie takes the science so seriously youd think this was their thesis 
Jun 12 2019,negative,mai slab decat cel din 2014 am fost pentru ca theo era obosita si vroia sa se deconecteze dumbed down version pt audience cu special effects 
Jun 12 2019,positive,great fun lost of monster fights great special effect everything you want from big monster movie
Jun 12 2019,negative,terrible dont watch cringe worthy scenes 
Jun 12 2019,positive,showed more godzilla than the first one had epic monster battles like the old days and was visually stimulating
Jun 12 2019,positive,from start to finish the movie has alot of action it was so stressful to watch because of all the suspense going on definetly would recommend watching
Jun 12 2019,positive,im a huge godzilla fan  so i can only say i loved this movie
Jun 12 2019,positive,loved it godzilla look absolutely spooky but amazing alot of action lol
Jun 12 2019,positive,finally got to see what we wanted in the first godzilla movie some actual monster fighting there were a few plot contrivances that were annoying and were made it even worse by the fact that the story was getting rushed along so we can get to the next monster scene and the fact that they had human characters and they needed to make a plot for the human characters to follow at the same time that there was a monster fighting plot going on i was just kind of too much so they ended up having to rush the human plot and get through it so that we could get to the monster fight but then that just made the human plot really weak because its we dont really care about it anyways but it has to be there because the show writers think that people need something human to relate to the movie which we dont but theyre stupid and they think we do so they were really plot holes but it just kept getting pushed forward too fast and its just something that we didnt really need in the big to begin with and then the fact that it was there wasnt so bad but the fact that it was there and also rushed just made annoying they went a little overboard on kind of like making it like prometheus where they tried to show how godzilla has been present in throughout human history which is just kind of stupid a non also unnecessary it doesnt really enhance what we came to the movie to see which was monsters fighting it doesnt really matter if stories from the bible or ancient greece talk about godzilla or not but overall the visuals were awesome the monster fights were actually done well and they hit the right mix between huge lumbering creatures that have a lot of mass and actually making exciting combat what i didnt want to see was something like the power rangers where or even pacific rim where they have these giant machines that just move way too fast and agile and are just way too maneuverable commensurate with their size and massiveness and these monsters didnt do that they moved in a way that it was still believable but it wasnt so slow that it was just a boring fight they actually were able to do things that you might believe that a gigantic monster might be able to do if stretched to the limits of their physicality i think it was an awesome big dumb monster movie without actually being dumb it was big and it was monster
Jun 12 2019,positive,this is the best godzilla movie since the 1956 sci fihorror classic godzilla king of the monster excellent
Jun 12 2019,positive,so awesome  finally a godzilla movie with lots of godzilla fighting thats what fans want  weve seen it twice 
Jun 12 2019,negative,one of the most boring and silly movies i have ever seen the only saving grace was that i got a nap in during the final hour the plot went all over the place a whale machine made sounds to control these titans and the acting was abysmal dont waste your time unless you are a huge godzilla fan 
Jun 12 2019,positive,love it specially the fight scenes 
Jun 12 2019,neutral,effects effects effects i missed the story
Jun 12 2019,positive,godzilla fan and cant stress this enough but a huge improvement over the 2014 version where he was literally in the movie for like 5 mins which is ridiculous but monsters looked absolutely amazing and it was more balanced with them showing godzilla and the other monsters than when they showed more of the muto in the first and showed less godzilla but excellent movie bad ass monster fights 1010 for any godzilla fan
Jun 12 2019,positive,the movie was great af but teamkong
Jun 12 2019,positive,great special effects somewhat stilted script and the family reunion at the end was just feel good junk
Jun 12 2019,positive,incredible i loved every minute of it
Jun 12 2019,positive,little slow at parts but the monster action was splendid and visually stunning acting was superb especially from millie bobby brown farmiga and the father absolutely recommend this to anyone go see it the critics are completely off on this one  always listen to the fans
Jun 12 2019,positive,hated the characters loved the titans emma was just a bitch tbh  daughter was so forgettable i forgot her name reason why i rate it 3 is because the person i sat next to was cute otherwise this would have been a 1
Jun 12 2019,negative,extremely boring dragged on and on
Jun 12 2019,positive,loved the nonstop action godzilla is the king but character development and motivation was confusing at best
Jun 12 2019,positive,everything was as i expected and i expect the next one to be even better godzilla vs kong thats gonna be exciting to watch
Jun 12 2019,positive,people who think theres too much human plot never watched the old movies i was fairly interested in what the people were doing for a good amount of the movie but the monsters by far were incredible  its nice to see amazing designs for other classic kaiju
Jun 12 2019,positive,i feel like someone went into my memories and made a 2019 hollywood blockbuster for my 10 year old self trying to watch godzilla movies on vhs with shitty dub i loved every moment of this movie the score used the themse of the old toho movies but added that extra layer for additional epicness the moster fights were pg13 orgasms they honoured the riginal series in such a fantastic manner so many easter eggs to the original films i was crying betterthanendgame
Jun 12 2019,positive,injoyed every second fun movie 
Jun 12 2019,positive,it had alot of action between the titans but very little dialogue with the humans it was  very entertaining liked the detal

Jun 12 2019,negative,straight trash and that british girl sucks at being american get out of here you twat
Jun 12 2019,positive,the only thing i didnt like was if there was so much radiation how could they touch godzilla
Jun 12 2019,positive,if you are a true gojira fan you will love it
Jun 12 2019,positive,the monster fights were spectacular the plot was outlandish but managed to tie in a lot of elements from the franchise 50year run a must see for godzilla fans 
Jun 12 2019,negative,too much talking and not enough action
Jun 12 2019,positive,i really disliked the first movie and im not even sure why i agreed to go see the second one with my partner but im so glad i did this is great monsteronmonster fighting action and the human storyline is pretty good as well cant really put it in words but i actually got anxiety at the end of the film because i felt the worldbuilding was so authentic i got worried the monsters existed in our own world seems silly but it just felt so genuine
Jun 12 2019,negative,sadly i cannot think of even one positive aspect  it is soooo bad  the acting the linesit all fell flat  even the monsters were poorly done really wanted to like it but there was nothing to like  save your money
Jun 12 2019,negative,the only reason why i saw this was because i had an employee meeting and i needed to kill time since i showed up early i literally fell asleep super boring
Jun 12 2019,negative,terrible derivative of a movie the assumption made is that the audience has no cognitive function
Jun 12 2019,positive,had monsters had godzilla had more of that then the human characters and that was enough for me in this film
Jun 12 2019,positive,the monster cgi was incredible monster o from the sixties toho movies was recreated extremely well in this movie
Jun 12 2019,positive,more godzilla screen time and shows how he truly is the king on the monsters
Jun 12 2019,positive,i enjoyed it for the most part  the human story is the weakest part but i left satisfied and i will definitely watch again when it comes out i liked it much better than the first godzilla
Jun 12 2019,positive,very good scenes cant wait for the next one
Jun 12 2019,positive,while the story would be seen by many as bland it still delivers an entertaining experience that would satisfy those who dont constantly look for the negatives in movies
Jun 12 2019,positive,a love letter to classic showa and heisei godzilla
Jun 12 2019,positive,it was everything i wanted it to be if you are a fan of godzilla then this is the movie to see
Jun 12 2019,positive,exciting and tied up loose ends but left it open for another one  it was just fun and loud entertainment
Jun 12 2019,negative,it was long and bad the monaters though were very cool and well made but the plot and realm everything else about the 2 hour long movie was bad
Jun 12 2019,positive,im not a fan of godzilla never watched any of the movies until now because my son really wanted to watch it i must say it was awesome the visuals are amazing never a dull moment highly recommend
Jun 12 2019,negative,the mother joins terrorists kills off half the planet including her coworkers and appears to be accepted back by everyone before she is killed by the monsters too frustrating i almost walked out several times
Jun 12 2019,positive,an utterly fantastic godzilla movie with such devotion to the godzilla lore the action is top notch kaiju fighting fun and the human characters are way more interesting than the main character in the 2014 film the plot may be silly which may be the problem critics have with the movie but that is actually typical of a godzilla movie if you love godzilla please for the love of god see this movie on the big screen
Jun 12 2019,negative,very bad pacing long boring moments hopefully they can improve in the next installment to the franchise
Jun 12 2019,positive,it was a awesome fun movie  the visuals were great the human story didnt really get in the way of  monsters story i liked the call outs to the older movies like the o bomb mothra powering up godzilla and the other monsters looks and them  being from all around the world was interesting so i really enjoied the movie and hope they keep up with this quality 
Jun 12 2019,positive,you want monsters fighting and doing cool sht this is the movie for you see it in the theatre it gives the subwoofers a good workout
Jun 11 2019,negative,i disliked the brightness it was too dark
Jun 11 2019,positive,for long time gfans this movie was everything anyone could ever want from a godzilla movie very respectful to the source material
Jun 11 2019,neutral,im not getting the plot of the movie acting is a 25 star the best thing about the movie is the monster fights which i was totally excited about until i saw on unrealistically resilient and prone to attack this family is 
Jun 11 2019,positive,its very good beautiful 
Jun 11 2019,positive,love that all the monsters where present and the story had thought behind it not just cool blue screen stuff
Jun 11 2019,positive,do i smell an oscar for the big fella if anything for entertaining audiences for over half a century he deserves at least a lifetime achievement award if you want to overthink a godzilla movie then no move along if you ever wondered as a kid what a godzilla battle might look like in person then this is the movie for you well thought out and adhering to godzilla canon with plenty of easter eggs this film was awesome and loads of fun why are you reading this go out and see the movie
Jun 11 2019,positive,best kaiju film by hollywood great cgi and intense action 
Jun 11 2019,positive,lots of action  seemed a little long to me

Jun 11 2019,positive,great graphics the monsters looked so good
Jun 11 2019,positive,everything good script great acting fantastic special effects the story tied together the godzilla king of monsters mythology it was almost like a religious experience for me i have followed the godzilla movies since 1958 the sound track used all the best music from the series even the blue oyster cult song
Jun 11 2019,positive,godzilla was outstanding
Jun 11 2019,negative,was unable to make the movie
Jun 11 2019,positive,awesome movie  lots of action and suspense
Jun 11 2019,positive,they need to get away from the shooting the action scenes from the lens of another person like watching it on tv or from the cockpit of a helicopter more birds eye few shots of the action also work on the human story give them a connection to the monsters like kong and that chick also use monsters that are already in the godzilla lore not no name monsters that is the thing that killed transformers for me loved the cgi and 3d effect hopefully the next one just gets better like this one did this one was way better than the first
Jun 11 2019,negative,very worst bad movie
Jun 11 2019,positive,wow graphics are insane monsters are insane good movie
Jun 11 2019,positive,amazing effects amazing story loved it no political bs

Jun 11 2019,positive,action and story line was amazing
Jun 11 2019,negative,uninspired 8th grade level writing and generic fight scenes drenched in all the action movie cliches you can imagine the cgi however is spectacular i wouldnt recommend paying the big bucks to see this in a theater but if you want to watch 2 hours of computer generated monsters beating each other up it would be a decent rental especially since you could fast forward through the complete septic sludge that is the story
Jun 11 2019,neutral,this movie is best watched if you dont speak english  dont try to follow the story line  it makes no sense whatsoever  godzilla vs alien  you are funny  high speed tunnel inside of earth  you are too much      the best part of the movie is the dialogue  japanese guys he fought for us he died for us  audience jesus    this movie shouldnt be in the science fiction it should be comedy  think it as an expensive snake on the plane
Jun 11 2019,positive,as long as youre not expecting an oscar worthy script youll enjoy really cool graphics nothing game changing like the matrix
Jun 11 2019,negative,you see the same thing throughout the movie lame
Jun 11 2019,positive,great suspense kept my attention
Jun 11 2019,negative,the worse godzilla movie ever
Jun 11 2019,positive,great action but thats really it
Jun 11 2019,positive,saw this movie over the weekend and thought it was a great summer popcorn action movie was definitely worth a see in theaters the monster designs were better than i expected  i dont watch the trailers for movies that i want to see so i go in cold
Jun 11 2019,positive,best giant monster movie to date loved all the interaction with monsters and mankind such a great experience on the big screen
Jun 11 2019,positive,i love this film this is by far the best monsterkaiju films ever made in cinematic history im glad they give the godzilla more screen time appearance than the first one that came out 5 years there are some parts and elements that were taken from other previous godzilla films here we get cgi monsters that look realistic like no body has ever achieved before we are lucky to see three other tohos top 5 kaiju such as king ghidorah rodan and mothra i would be happy if thy make more monsterverse godzilla movies soon besides seeing him going up against king kong again in the next film godzilla vs kong and would love to see him face off against the giant firebreathing turtle monster gamera that would be awesome godzilla vs king kong and godzilla vs gamera will have fans light up all around the world keep making more godzilla films and keep the legendary king of the monsters alive
Jun 11 2019,positive,more monsters story was much better seen it twice and would see it again
Jun 11 2019,positive,faster more beasties and loud also really enjoyed the cast zilla ii was much better than i expected
Jun 11 2019,positive,the problem if really exist in this movies is the people want to see kaijus fight dont care about humans history unless they interact with kaijus
Jun 11 2019,positive,as a long term fan of godzilla movies i have to say seeing the monsters in full cg glory was amazing dont get me wrong i loved the suitmation but lets be honest it was more than a little cheesy however the big gs cg parade was amazing and you shouldnt listen to the 40 bc thats bs if you go expecting a story its got an ok one but why would you go to a giant monster movie for story youre here for the action and there is plenty of action here 
Jun 11 2019,positive,acton packed movie   better than i expected
Jun 11 2019,positive,my son saw it with his cousins and they loved it

Jun 11 2019,negative,terrible human drama that i dont care about  i want more monster action  felt like sharknado with a big budget  as a lifelong fan of godzilla i was very disappointed
Jun 11 2019,positive,holy john wickavengerstransformers   the body count is off the charts   but the plotdepressing at most points has a strong current that radiates goodness in the darkest of times   this is my new favorite monster movie  the monster designs behaviors devastation effects etccompletely suspends all disbelief in the carnage they bring to earthscores of monsters   avengers sit down transformers  forget about it   these titans are not fazed by rockets of any magnitude   i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie even during the breaks in fighting   the excitement i felt as a child when popeye ate his spinach or green lantern recharged his ringis just like the charge i got when gojira feeds on essence of nuke     watch this movie  
Jun 11 2019,positive,it was just ok i love the history and back story but i was left wonder is there more
Jun 11 2019,positive,really enjoyed the movie
Jun 11 2019,positive,six words ghidorah the threeheaded monster on steroids

Jun 11 2019,positive,my 7 yearold told me daddy this was the best film ive ever seen in my entire life    what more can you say sometimes its for the 7 year olds in all of us
Jun 11 2019,positive,i think the movie is great and that the world needs to wake up critic reviews are worthless what matter is the audience score this movie should be at 84 not judged by the hot air bags who do not actually matter the money is in the audience not the critics 
Jun 11 2019,positive,this movie finally gives godzilla fans what they have been asking for 
Jun 11 2019,positive,this movie is very cool

Jun 11 2019,positive,its exactly everything a fan of godzilla movies would want great monsters amazing fight scenes and some nice homage to the original flicks and stories the human storyplotline is weak but it suits its the purpose to get from one monster battle to the next will see again and cant wait for the next one
Jun 11 2019,positive,when other people said about it lacks story but it compensated by its action i like its storytelling and reasoning in more realistic way not only giant monster mashup fight
Jun 11 2019,positive,delivers exactly what it promises
Jun 11 2019,positive,the movie was good special effects were very good i did not see the last godzilla movie about 5 yrs ago  was a little surprised that godzilla was now good  my kids and grandchildren really liked it  and if another godzilla movie comes out we will see that also
Jun 11 2019,positive,the plot was paper thin but hey godzilla and hydra and mothra and more
Jun 11 2019,positive,its gonna be hard to set my own bias aside for this review since ive been a fan of the tohos godzilla franchise since i was a kid but here i go     godzilla king of the monsters is a phenomenal movie and a huge step up from its 2014 predecessor while i loved gareth edwards take on the film i agree with the major consensus that there was not enough godzilla this movie corrects that problem tenfold as michael dougherty keeps the monsters onscreen consistently the designs for the monsters themselves have been updated for the new godzilla loving generation and are familiar and terrifying each honors their toho predecessor and dont feel generic as they give them their own personality such as gidorah heads fighting each other to show the audience which head is in charge godzillas back spikes have been updated to look more like his toho design which also looks amazing     the fights  the fights between these titans left me in awe as they showed the true power and devastation of these monsters cities are leveled after their awakening and give audiences what they want by not cutting away from the action there are plenty of hell yeah moments throughout as the monsters tear into each other and there are plenty of easter eggs and references to their previous iterations to satisfy godzilla fans    the humanity  while most believe the human plot in this movie is lacking i found it had depth and nuanced compared to previous films kyle chandlers mark russell and vera farmigas emma russell developed a device the orca designed to pacify the titans is used as a weapon to awaken gidorah and restore the balance in nature the russell family suffered the loss of their son during the events of 2014s godzilla and is still trying to pick up the pieces with their daughter millie bobby browns madison russell while i dont wanna go into specifics about the plot they are relateable to those who are dealing with the loss of family member during a natural disaster or tragedy and how we all try to find meaning in why it happened something i believe was attempted in the 2014 godzilla but never really fully realized that is one of the main reasons why this godzilla movie sets its self apart from the rest of the monster movies     the verdict  with cool monster designs and fights with a compelling humanside godzilla king of the monsters is an awesome addition to monsterverse and is definitely a mustsee for all audiences this summer 
Jun 11 2019,positive,the current stab at doing godzilla is not the worst but the producers are ignorant about who the main character is and insist on putting sappy human stories in the way of the real money maker a good godzilla move featuring mostly monsters aliens made up techmazer tanks etcand cannon fodder government agencies can be done with knowledgeable writers stop with the whiny human connection crap already
Jun 11 2019,positive,loved the action story was soso but i didnt go into this for the story really enjoyed the movie in 4dx
Jun 11 2019,positive,enjoyed it very much
Jun 11 2019,positive,fun movie with lots of action dont expect the best story line but its still good 
Jun 11 2019,positive,super fun movie to just sit and enjoy no big expectations love the fight scenes but a little to dark at times
Jun 11 2019,positive,campy but we liked it
Jun 11 2019,positive,monsters monsters everywhere
Jun 11 2019,neutral,everything with the monsters was great everything involving the human characters was overacted and poorly written incredible visuals surrounded by plot holes and cheesy dialogue 
Jun 11 2019,positive,not a better film than the 2014 godzilla but it was definitely more entertaining and rousing popcorn fun with a better director and tighter editing and slightly more thought out script this could have been a classic however godzilla kicks some serious ass and for that it is worth it 
Jun 11 2019,positive,it was a faithful adaptation of the source material  retaining some level of realism from the first movie while incorporating some of the mystical elements from the movies from heisei and showa eras
Jun 11 2019,positive,excellent movie a real roller  caster ride   brought back all the monsters i remember from my childhood
Jun 11 2019,positive,a bunch of kaiju action and destruction hell yes  human plot that has plot holes hell nah  i came for godzilla and was not disappointed
Jun 11 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was awesome  absolutely delivering on what it promises the only reasonable benchmark for evaluating all works of cinematic entertainment does it deliver what it promises try this with any movie watch the trailer see the movie ask the question   professional reviewers dont evaluate movies in this way they instead take personal and hivemind cinema lore bias and tear apart any movie that doesnt fit a predetermined mold see the historic award show winners for decades   
Jun 11 2019,positive,loved it  nonstop roller coaster ride  incredible monsters as well  
Jun 11 2019,positive,they have good elements from this movie like king ghidorah the major villain against godzilla in this movie  but the sad thing is they keep switching the  screen all the time when godzilla and king ghidorah are about to fight that really disappoint me comparing with the first godzilla movie from 2014 if the firm can let us focus more on the monster fighting scenes this movie can become much better 
Jun 11 2019,positive,the action when they showed it was incredible next time more monsters less humans
Jun 11 2019,positive,people were annoying sometimes but monsters were the best
Jun 11 2019,negative,didnt really like it
Jun 11 2019,positive,im a big fan of godzilla and i love all the movies that were made what i dislike about the movie is that they killed off mothra
Jun 11 2019,positive,excellent godzilla movie exactly what i was hoping to see 
Jun 11 2019,positive,giant monsters fighting if you like that statement you will like this movie
Jun 11 2019,positive,loved it cant wait for next year with kong
Jun 11 2019,negative,weak interchangeable characters with convoluted plot even the monster boss battles struggle to show you something you havent seen before
Jun 11 2019,positive,amazing the fight scenes the story lines ill see it again
Jun 11 2019,positive,loved it  everything i wanted from a godzilla movie cant wait to see him with kong

Jun 11 2019,positive,the action and special w
Jun 11 2019,positive,awesome storyline with amazing fights awesome to see how awesome these graphics were great film all around
Jun 11 2019,negative,great sound and lighting award winners for sure loved the refreshed monsters unfortunate that writers forgot why godzilla was created by the japanese in the first place godzilla is bad but this film flips it the humans are beyond evil and godzilla is the hero humans willing to exterminate each other ugh just a horrible story extremely depressing
Jun 11 2019,positive,follows the rebooted franchise well
Jun 11 2019,positive,the only thing i disliked was the cheesy dialog from the supporting characters because the real stars are the kaiju  otherwise the movie was awesome and i really appreciated the homage to the finer details from older godzilla films that maybe mostly only adults would recognize  cant wait for the next installment
Jun 11 2019,neutral,great fight sequences between the monsters but unfortunatley very poor execution in writing a acceptable story
Jun 11 2019,positive,there was action throughout the entire movie  not a boring part so you were engaged until the very end
Jun 11 2019,positive,hard to follow any story line  all about destruction and mayem
Jun 11 2019,positive,i know some parts dont make sense but it still is really fun to watch i would recommend people to watch it in their free time
Jun 11 2019,positive,if your a godzilla fan your going to love it
Jun 11 2019,negative,the titans looked real   the story was boring
Jun 11 2019,positive,visuals on 10 during kaiju battles callbacks to amazing past godzilla moments and humans making dumb decisions what more could one want from a godzilla movie i loved it
Jun 11 2019,positive,pretty good movie worth watching acting not the best but its a godzilla movie
Jun 11 2019,positive,i never watch the japanese original godzilla versions but this movie is really serious intense and has lots of battle actions the casts are awesome its great for family watch too theres a hint of a sequel but i really dont know how it gonna be next and i cant wait for the next one
Jun 11 2019,positive,loved it weve had some pretty bad godzilla movies made over the last 30 years this is not one of them i hate when reviewers say too much or give too much away so ill say nothing else just go and see this movie excellent
Jun 11 2019,positive,good pace and plenty of action
Jun 11 2019,negative,my wife and i were unhappy with the movie the movie had a lot of  stupid scenes like the scientist driving the the navys small sub and the hunt for there daughter in ny 
Jun 11 2019,positive,the monsters were great and i loved the action the story was bland and forced but if you know godzilla movies its par for the course cant wait for godzilla vs kong
Jun 11 2019,negative,trumendous lack of consistency regarding the screenwriting in general and the characters arc main example  the mother nothing in this movie is believable its a scifi movie im not asking for something perfectly realistic but at least something which remains a bit logical     the actors are not bad but not great either   the special effects are good which is the one highlight of the movie     oh also the frequent godzilla scream makes your ears bleed every single time so dont forget your ear plugs im not suggesting a birdsong but maybe something just a little more audible  
Jun 11 2019,negative,horrible walked out after 30 minutes
Jun 11 2019,negative,movie was rambling incoherent and on the whole unsatisfying
Jun 11 2019,positive,must watch best godzilla movie yet i wish there were less scenes of the humans and just more of the monsters

Jun 11 2019,positive,great action loves the titans
Jun 11 2019,positive,godzilla was just trying to get him some action from his side chick and then she died so he killed everyone
Jun 11 2019,negative,the monsters were cool but the story and the people was boring it was hard to stay awake
Jun 11 2019,positive,i will say this when it played it serious that we just have to live with these things and when they would satirize the position their in it was fantastic but that was only about ten percent of the film the rest was a boring story of i need to find my daughter and we are doing this to save the world but at least they got the lore right    ps praise mothra she died for our sins and her true love godzilla  hail to the queen baby
Jun 11 2019,positive,great action movie from visuals to sounds
Jun 11 2019,negative,the dialogue was so bad in this movie had expectations of at least a mediocre movie but the horrendous dialogue was actually difficult to sit through
Jun 11 2019,positive,godzilla fans will like it not worried about what others think just enjoy the king
Jun 11 2019,negative,worest movie i watched this year so far if i wasnt with my firneds ill leave the movie around 30 mins there are some other people probably think exactly what i tought i counted the kids more than a dozen people who left middle of the movie 
Jun 11 2019,positive,absolutely loved this movoe was everything a little kaiju could hope for 
Jun 11 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the movie very action packed kept me on my toes love all the actors also
Jun 11 2019,positive,a godzilla film made by and for godzilla fans  i loved the homages to the original 1954 godzilla movie  i counted three  im hoping that they will make more like this  ken watanabe as dr ishiro serizawa was a favorite for me
Jun 11 2019,positive,good job from warner and legendary full justice you must see it
Jun 11 2019,positive,perfect summer movie
Jun 11 2019,negative,the movie did not need a mass amount of cringy jokes and random human characters no one is invested in all i ever wanted was a monster film and we got horrible human drama and hardly any monsters a majority of this movie is shit aside from the very short monster scenes also why is king kong even in this film theyre separate franchises and it was pointless to mention him anyway in the plot     the plot was horrendous and the humans did not need to be main characters at all
Jun 11 2019,positive,its very good music is just fantasticall the monster looks great it really brings the good old memories of toho monster movie back to me
Jun 11 2019,positive,story was good and monsters were what i was looking for

Jun 11 2019,positive,it was good once the action started  was slow starting
Jun 11 2019,positive,not to bad a lot better than most movies took to long to get going but the fight scenes were ok
Jun 11 2019,positive,if you have seen the movie godzilla you will like this movie the plot line is easy to follow
Jun 11 2019,positive,best godzilla movie ever didnt seem overcrowded with monster screen time critics seem to be over critical
Jun 11 2019,negative,did not understand the story behind this godzilla movie i was very disappointed   there was too much going on i will not recommend going to see this movie
Jun 11 2019,positive,the god of monsters reigns supreme aginst all challengers to the title amazing fights that had my heart pumping the whole way far better human characters who are more interesting to follow the only reason i dont give 5 stars is for the dumb joke about king ghidoras name thats it      im looking at the critic reviews here and yall are some joyless skeletons that can turn a sunny day gray
Jun 11 2019,positive,it was interesting because it had some old monsters with their backstory it was interesting that because i was expecting other monsters to fight each other and just leave the most dominate one would be left for final battle i also enjoyed how it is set up for more movies in a series
Jun 11 2019,positive,good action fight scenes were a little too close up
Jun 11 2019,positive,although somewhat hampered by its focus on the human subplot i found it to be an excellent 35th entry to the godzilla franchise must see for any godzilla fan
Jun 11 2019,positive,thought  it was a great action movie with a good story
Jun 11 2019,positive,needed more action 90 of the movie being action isnt enough 
Jun 11 2019,negative,nothing make sense i was not looking for realism but at least a storyline that makes sense
Jun 11 2019,positive,its as if hollywood took the old godzilla movies and remade them with great actors and great cg the 10 year old in me was as happy as could be go see this and dont overthink it just have fun
Jun 11 2019,positive,millie and the action seems were so good
Jun 11 2019,positive,very good godzilla movies are a classic if you have not seen the godzilla movie previous to this one you will be confused
Jun 11 2019,positive,good cast concept of follow up well executed good monster introductions
Jun 11 2019,positive,i grew up with godzilla  those cheesy movies kept a little kid entertained for hours during a weekend monster marathon 2014 was a huge let down only because the human element was so boring but the king of the monsters is back and in full reign over his kingdom hold on to your butts because next time out we get to see kong all grown up and ready to take his place in the monarch
Jun 11 2019,positive,this movie was great fun with a lot of nods to the original movies great cgi and a fabulous performance from millie bobbi brown 
Jun 11 2019,negative,didnt make sense most of the time  no real emotion involved but stuff happened  
Jun 11 2019,positive,good movie if you like monster fights but the plot is a bit lame
Jun 11 2019,negative,i really wouldnt even give this movie a half star it was so bad my girlfriend left me in the theater with 45 mins left only reason i stayed was because i figured maybe it would end wellonly fooled myself this movie was complete garbage 
Jun 11 2019,positive,full cgi full action storyline so so just bring the ultraman then it will be complete hahahah overall this movie is quite entertaining
Jun 11 2019,positive,it was good to see those old monsters  im glad to see how they came up with a story on how godzilla rejuvenated himself
Jun 11 2019,positive,i love all godzilla movies so this was an interesting premise its like you came into a series of movies that already started and we missed stilled it was entertaining and i really liked the ending
Jun 11 2019,positive,fantastic monster movie i think it actually needed more monsters and fight scenes honestly critics shouldnt even go to monster movies some parts were dull and i wanted mark to shut up throughout most of the film but otherwise i loved it 
Jun 11 2019,positive,storyline was kinda junk
Jun 11 2019,positive,ive been a godzilla fan since the 6os godzilla and mothra have always been heroes they got it right
Jun 11 2019,positive,loved this movie fun and exciting good effects and music
Jun 11 2019,positive,movie was great didnt care for the human story but the action fighting cgi was very good can not wait for god vs king in 2020
Jun 11 2019,positive,i seldom give 5 stars but this was a solid 4 stars  i think if you are a fan of the original godzilla you will really like this movie it really had great photography and effects the music was fantastic as well the character development was as good as it could be without making the movie less of an action adventure after all most go for the titans and not the humans i was very impressed overall
Jun 11 2019,positive,i wanted to see giant monsters fighting and destroying everything thats what i got and it made me happy
Jun 11 2019,positive,i wanted giant monsters beating the crap out of each other and i got my moneys worth
Jun 11 2019,positive,special effects were very good but overall the movie was pretty stupid to many monsters didnt make any sense the last godzilla movie was the best
Jun 11 2019,negative,horrible  i cannot emphasize how horrible this movie is  it would have been ok is the monsters fought more  the human aspect was too great and boring
Jun 11 2019,positive,i liked the way the story was formulated
Jun 11 2019,negative,disliked is an understatement i want my money back ive possibly seen every godzilla movie ever this one was horrible it wasnt campy exciting or barely watchable
Jun 11 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen shallow characters and stupid rehashed middle school puns paid for 3d and never had any real 3d effects would not recommend
Jun 11 2019,positive,monster scenes were awesome is this movie oscar worthy absolutely not however just for the same reasons i watched these movies 40 years ago its all about the godzilla and the other monsters although theres no ridiculous dubbing of voices
Jun 11 2019,positive,exciting and so happy to see my old monster friends
Jun 11 2019,positive,i liked when the big monsters fought but overall it wasnt my favorite it was memorable with all the cool monsters and stuff but the plot was weird as heck id recommend it for fans of that type of thing i wouldnt recommend it for people who like following the characters on an adventure because that part was sort of meh overall it was decent 
Jun 11 2019,positive,35 stars  glad i saw this i was reserved after seeing the review scores but its definitely the best american made godzilla film not that its a hard bar to pass but still there was finally enough monster fighting and the film seemed pretty focused on the monsters for once instead of the humans
Jun 11 2019,positive,the graphics are so realistic and the action is entertaining from start to finishmy kids loved it
Jun 11 2019,positive,thr story itself was awesome thr acting was great   i love that big radiated lizard
Jun 11 2019,positive,great movie love all the actionand cinematography
Jun 11 2019,positive,awesomeeverything i expected from a new godzilla movie the final fight seen in the film alone was worth going to see the film
Jun 10 2019,positive,good action horrible horrible action
Jun 10 2019,positive,the original 1954 gojira was a masterpeice the movies that followed were kaiju fights with cheesy plots and they were amazing godzilla 2014 laid the groundwork like the 1954 movie and kom did the next logical step kaiju fights and boy did they deliver i was sitting on the edge of my seat almost the entire time of the movie and endgame was only able to do that at the last third of the movie so yeah i loved godzilla kom watch it and have fun because face it if you logic a giant monster movie then you will be no better then a grumpy critic lol
Jun 10 2019,negative,i wanted a godzilla movie not a dysfunctional family drama the limited amount of monster screens failed to compensate for the balance of the movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,  we expect a movie that revolved around the main character of the film godzilla and fulfilled its mission even with gaps in the explanation of the story of monarch did a good job full of references to the old godzilla movies
Jun 10 2019,positive,i loved it saw it with my twin 15 year olds they are both big millie bobbie brown fans
Jun 10 2019,positive,good movie it was what i expected it to be action packed and full of monsters
Jun 10 2019,positive,this was the very first time for 8yo son going to the movies he was wow what an experience glad i made his day with a movie full of cgi me as an adult i knew in advance the plot and what exactly to expect so i wasnt that much impress its one of those ok movies the 5star are coming from my son
Jun 10 2019,negative,boring and ridiculous
Jun 10 2019,positive,always a very good time
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was like they took the criticism of the first movie and double down on we want screen time with the monsters lots of great action and cool set pieces with the key focus going back to the kaiju    the kaiju is front and center the most important part of this movie silly human drama is merely a vehicle to deliver more kaiju if you wanted some deep personal drama you are clearly watching the wrong movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,script was terrible but known actors and monster fight scenes helped bring it to a 3 star
Jun 10 2019,negative,they tease a great monster action start for a second the next moment they move it in the background to focus on the poorly written and acted human drama it was so annoying they kept doing this constantly all the monster action is moved in blurry or distant background from the first godzilla installment they probably got the feedback to focus more on human drama and they took that feedback stupidly literally the camera always focused on senseless human drama keeping good monster action out of focus
Jun 10 2019,positive,the perfect godzilla movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,seen 4 times now definitely best godzilla movie ghidorah was epicly evil looking mothra was beautiful godzilla reaffirmed why he is king of monsters not sure what movie you guys watched but apparently youve only seen the matthew broderick 1
Jun 10 2019,positive,thought the action and monster fight scenes were awesome was perfect to watch on a imax screen but the story and human drama was a bit silly and needed more work overall the story maybe flawed but the sight of godzilla fighting on the big screen is worth the ticket
Jun 10 2019,positive,great for any old godzilla fanless human drama more kaiju madness
Jun 10 2019,positive,its a true monster moviean enhanced classic
Jun 10 2019,positive,i love how none of the actors chosen for this movie ruin it each one carried their role as expected the effects are on point and the action has you on the edge of your seat the entire time it was great to see all the monsters in one movie absolutely the best movie ive seen in a long time
Jun 10 2019,positive,visually stunning a couple surprises and even has a reasonable plot device to keep the humans in the middle of it my only disappointment was the characters were superficial but it is called godzilla not humans the big guy showed up and did what he does best
Jun 10 2019,positive,the action scenes were incredible it was visually stunning and not cheesy
Jun 10 2019,positive,awesomenessfor the true fan i felt the same emotion as if i had 10 years old again keep the good work fans are very happy its a movie about monsters not a medieval drama if you didnt like it go watch martin scorseses movies
Jun 10 2019,negative,it was a horrible movie with a horrible plot i could go into detail with constructive criticism however it is not worth my time nor do i believe my comments will make any change but i would not see this movie again
Jun 10 2019,positive,fun monster battles with great soundtrack but truly awful dialogue actors tried their best to overcome the script
Jun 10 2019,positive,only true fans will love this beautiful movie not some old ass white critic if u dont like the movie then you dont or didnt deserve to see this mas
Jun 10 2019,positive,everything pac rim 2 should have been when the movie allows itself to be the fun flick its trying to be without apology it shines combining the doubt of humanity in a world where its no longer top dog with striking visuals that rival any scenario you made up as a kid with action figures go see it
Jun 10 2019,positive,this is a movie about a giant lizard and a 3 headed dragon dont go into this movie expecting oscar contender this movie was entertaining in the way monster movies are supposed to be destruction action heroes and special effects have i seen better monster movies yes but this doesnt fall too far behind grab your popcorn and enjoy the show 
Jun 10 2019,positive,godzilla kom shines whenever godzilla and the other monsters are on screen the action and cinematography and breaking taking and blood pumping its a thrill to watch until the movie stops to bore you with human drama it can not only detract from the action but tries way too hard to be the heart of the plot when it clearly isnt there is a notable flippancy when it comes to the human drama as it is unusually complicated and needlessly dwelled upon some characters are actively superfluous and as various plot points get revealed  these characters motivations begin making less sense it drags down an otherwise great movie while some boring focus on a bunch of people not played by ken watanabe may make or break your experience godzilla king of monsters is a delightful watch
Jun 10 2019,negative,womans actions dont make sense
Jun 10 2019,positive,critics suck lol they will tell you the new garbage star war movies are remotely good and down rate these types of movies godzilla fan here there are bad godzilla movies and good ones this definitely falls in the latter 
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was exactly what i expected from a godzilla movie giant monsters fighting each other with a little bit of human drama and crazy good shots i know the plot was all over the place the acting was weird the script was badly written and all that but when you go to watch godzilla you do not need a good plot or script just show me the freaking monsters godzilla rodan and mothra cgi were good but ghidorah was not as good as i expected anyway this was my summer blockbuster
Jun 10 2019,positive,mothera was magnificent
Jun 10 2019,positive,everything a gojira fan wanted
Jun 10 2019,positive,romping stomping giant monster action loved it
Jun 10 2019,positive,an absolutely gorgeous spectacle and a must see for any godzilla fan 
Jun 10 2019,positive,best movie ever i come for titans fights and thats what i got
Jun 10 2019,positive,who needs story when you have giant monsters fighting the love that went into each of ghidorahs heads mothras background everything was an homage to the classics with a huge budget and it is worth it
Jun 10 2019,positive,what people tend to forget is that the original godzilla movies were corny  so what do you expect  the action was great the monsters were awesome  the plot had good intentions but did fall flat in some areas  i really hope this titan world will be ramped up and given the stories they deserve
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was not the worst thing ive ever watched 
Jun 10 2019,positive,great fan based movie old school feel that tied into godzilla movies 30years ago dont listen to the critics just like warcraft they had an agenda to troll the movie before it came out whiney ass punks
Jun 10 2019,positive,the bad  not enough mothra or rodan  the lead human villain is rather uninteresting and mostly talks and talks  some of the dialogue but not too much of it was corny andor wasnt necessary  how they handled emma russell was a bit choppy    the good  godzilla gets more screentime  how they expanded on the influence of the titans on human civilization  ghidorah was so badass omg  you can feel the stakes rising throughout the movie  most of the human characters were more interesting and more likeable than in the 2014 film  the action scenes with the monsters were f a n t a s t i c  whether its monsters destroying cities monsters vs humans or monsters vs monsters  the soundtrack  good job bear mccreary    overall not perfect but it still works well enough
Jun 10 2019,positive,great movie as a fan who watched all the old godzilla films this one definitely did right by all of them great soundtrack and music score i was on the edge of my seat the whole film 
Jun 10 2019,negative,15 hours of boring human drama maybe 20 minutes of monsters fighting monsters  any time anything was happening to the humans it was like i dont care what happens to any of them
Jun 10 2019,positive,loved this movie a bit too long but didnt mind because the story and action were entertaining lots of wonderful easter eggs for godzilla fans
Jun 10 2019,positive,a fun popcorn movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,as a fan of godzilla this movie was magnificent i must have more human plot lines be damned i dont care if they didnt make sense or even matter theyre finally getting at what fans of the franchise want from it 
Jun 10 2019,positive,i honestly thought this movie was really good i honestly love the ending 
Jun 10 2019,positive,so good should have been longer  casting could have been a bit better but all in all it was a perfect way to introduce a new universe of movies
Jun 10 2019,positive,honestly for a monster movie its great sure the people side of the movie is forgettable with exception to the amazing dr ishiro but it gives us what we want when we go see a movie like this bad ass monsters and bad ass fight scenes i would give it five stars if they focused on a good story for the people to follow but im not going to give it less than four stars because honestly i wasnt really there to watch the people it was good to have them in the movie to fill in between fight scenes so were not overwhelmed but they werent important enough to really have to focus on emmy winning story and performances i wanted to see godzilla fight and thats what i got so im happy also the critics on here are ridiculous how are you going to give godzilla and end game a rotten score than say captain marvel was a fresh score godzilla alone has a better character arch emotion and yeah ill say it even a better story line monster and human side than captain marvel
Jun 10 2019,positive,i came to see monsters fight and thats exactly what i got  people storylines are weak but with this franchise thats not my main concern loved seeing godzilla more this time
Jun 10 2019,positive,exceptional love letter to the franchise while messy at times it is easily forgiven 
Jun 10 2019,positive,very fun movie exactly what youd expect and hope for in a godzilla movie visually stunning
Jun 10 2019,positive,via fax should be saying either an imax or using the dolby sound system at amc the sound is reverberating through the seats
Jun 10 2019,positive,a lot of good action
Jun 10 2019,positive,the critics obviously dont understand what this genre of film is meant to be as this movie is amazing and much better than the one preceding it
Jun 10 2019,negative,it would have been a better snoozer if not filled with flashes and loud noises  lots of lame jokes and a dumb story if there was one  maybe ill watch it again at home but this was a terrible movie in the theater
Jun 10 2019,positive,man this movie is just awesome so good you need to watch this movie if you like giant monsters movies especially godzilla 
Jun 10 2019,positive,looks like there is no option for six stars
Jun 10 2019,negative,they couldnt have made a worse movie even if they were paid 200 million to do so oh wait they did id rather watch the worst movie of the decade whatever thatll be than this piece of garbage
Jun 10 2019,negative,personally i am a person who loves a good story rather than any effects that doesnt make any sense  this movie does give a lot of visual effects a bunch of big monsters which spit out electric shock if you are into those then it will be a great movie    but if you need logic and good storyline just keep the money and buy other movie ticket too much plotholes unexplained character cliche scenes it was just a mess  wasted my time
Jun 10 2019,positive,awesome movie not bored for a single second on the edge of my seat cgi was on point and the fights were glorious simple plot but its a kaiju fight feast for the eyes so that didnt bother me my only gripe is during some of tbe fights the cameras would cut to the human characters so we could see their point of view unnecessary it interrupted the spectacle  but would definitely recommend im seeing it again this time in 3d definitely getting it in 4k when its released cant wait for godzilla v kong
Jun 10 2019,positive,i loved this movie if you go in with the frame of mind that its a godzilla movie then you will really enjoy this movie this is probably one of the best godzilla movies i have ever seen
Jun 10 2019,positive,excellent what can i say its a oneofthebests at least for me it was the best monstermovie ive ever seen
Jun 10 2019,negative,the theater had the volume so loud i had to leave
Jun 10 2019,negative,i did not see the show since the theater i was in was in a disgusting statei would like a full refund
Jun 10 2019,negative,no plot confusing story line  nave waste of time
Jun 10 2019,positive,great movie lots of action cant wait till the next one comes out
Jun 10 2019,neutral,i thought they said there was less military and more monsters in this movie i keep rolling my eyes at every corny human joke or awkward scene just get on with the monster fighting no one cares about this forced humor
Jun 10 2019,positive,great in keeping with the toho model
Jun 10 2019,positive,critics were wrong this movie is awesome you know what youre getting yourself into when you see a godzilla film monster fights
Jun 10 2019,negative,pretty shitty movie utterly non sensical
Jun 10 2019,negative,family issue story line just didnt fit for me  also godzilla looks like hes been supersizing all of his food  i dont like the way he looks in this movie  if hes gonna meet up with kong next year and look good doing it fix him  a bit disappointing
Jun 10 2019,negative,the movie is at its best when it sticks to what it promises monster fights and amazing scenery however the majority of the film is comprised of unnecessary and dragging backstory if they focused a little more on the title character and less on the supporting cast it would have been a much better film 
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was very good lots of homage to the old films and revamped enough that new audiences can enjoy
Jun 10 2019,positive,i love it   long live the king of monster
Jun 10 2019,positive,this is godzilla movie not human
Jun 10 2019,positive,having seen the movie twice i will say when the action is good its good the plot has so many holes and hardly connects its points leaving alot questions about motives enjoy the beautiful cgi and the monster movie it was meant to be and you wont be disappointed
Jun 10 2019,positive,what i see here is recomended movie that obviously mixed a sad momentfightand the other but this movie got really light scene that my eyes feel burn and the sound who is really really strong make my whole ear is want to coming out for the stories is little bit bad i dont like some scenes that the mixes is not good at all so whatever for the monsterverse movie this is so recomended
Jun 10 2019,positive,the critics are a little idiodic this movie isnt perfect by any means but as a monster movie it is great they actually let the monsters take center stage and dont clutter it up with humans and monsters just happening to be there missed 5 stars by shoving a humans destroying themselvs story line in there too cliche
Jun 10 2019,positive,stop cutting away from the monsters for human drama i dont care about the mothers redemption arch i wanted to see two kiju beat the crap out of one another and they cut away from the boss battle to have an eternity of slow motion as the daughter is held back while the mom drives off
Jun 10 2019,positive,i expected a kiju version of wwe and i got that and then some
Jun 10 2019,positive,godzilla was a fun movie  it had great action and cgi  the story was decent as i was not expecting an oscar worthy script  i thought this movie was better than endgame  the last of the trilogy should be just as entertaining
Jun 10 2019,positive,the movie try to delivered what was the fan wishes forbut ended with messy story and characters development and unjustified fast travel but we have our monsters in best possible way
Jun 10 2019,negative,just another monster film that added nothing to the genre  lots of action and chases through out the film
Jun 10 2019,positive,cant wait for the next one
Jun 10 2019,negative,i had hoped the movie would be more fun than what reviewers were writing but boy was i a sucker no fun at all the storyline was beyond stupid and all over the place even the fight scenes were a king sized disappointment no kidding and i am offering this as one who likes all kids of scifi monster movies zombie movies etc but this version of godzilla was the biggest pos and waste of money ever sorry folks
Jun 10 2019,positive,i like it the movie could be better but still its a good movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,a great fun mindless monster movie  always a fan of godzilla here  this was an enjoyable 2 hours of wanton destruction death and dismemberment  definitely worth seeing in the theaters    the 45 stars is strictly for the style of movie it is and its intent which it meets and exceeds  if youre looking for a movie with heart or a scifi epic this really isnt that though it includes elements of both  watch it if you enjoy what i just described
Jun 10 2019,negative,attention second paragraph contains spoilers  watched in cinestar berlin paid 1550 for this i am really disappointed never ever  had if felt more unsatisfied regretful and disappointed after watching a godzilla movie before   i have to watch shin godzilla a third time today to help out with the recovery   so much went wrong with this even though its a monster movie so many times other things try to get in front of what the movie is about there are so many cringy scenes that could have easily been avoided etc and they are all about the humans the  monster story was fine but the rest its just bad     let me write about details attention spoilers following  they way they put the monsters second in this movie is horrible constantly monster fights are cut to show me faces of the actors doing so emotional expression thats totally unnecessary or some futuristic human weapons somewhere that dont matter at all but have to make the american military look cool   like the first fights the weapons are useless against gidora and later they pretend they could actually help out godzilla by distracting gidora and the other monsters   as if rhodan pittyfully weak would go for the smallfry jets instead the flying fortress of the monach organisation wtf one little nibble and the thing would have went down   constantly humans are in the middle of the fights  on purpose or accident and actually survive huge amounts of debris fly around giant monsters collapse entire citiscapes but the main character never really get hit i mean a single stone hitting a human on the head is enough end it but no they still place them into the middle presumeable so the can be in front of the monsters who wants to see them gtfo there is little display of helplessness on the human side its rather the opposite they even even made godzilla useless and chased it away at some point invalidating the whole idea of godzilla just to realise that  it is the only thing that can kill gidora then afterwards revive it with an nuclear bomb exploding in environment where only a suicide mission can do it killing off the only one that really believed in godzilla why couldnt they have just killed the american instead no off course not   but even after that the final fight where a single nuke couldnt they have just feed him radioactive material like showing of the huge amount of radioactive waste we dropped on the ocean floors why does it have to be always an explosion juiced up godzilla  its was a very short and spectacular fight and after that i felt cheated because it felt like there was more human time interacting with each other than monsters i am actually angry at the makers of this movie now   for gods sake just accept that the movie is about monsters and humans are just have to get trampled   shin gozilla all the way even the last anime gozilla was better even the ending was a bit meeeeh     
Jun 10 2019,positive,it had incredible kaiju fights in it
Jun 10 2019,positive,this movie approached godzilla with a different more optimistic tone rather than the dark tone the predecessor had this movie tried and succeed to connect with its japanese roots but sacrificing some of the badassery that godzilla brought in the last movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,all these critics are really stupid if you like godzilla youre gonna absolutely love this movie i love marvel and endgame was my favorite movie until i saw this godzilla 100 my favorite movie of all time 
Jun 10 2019,positive,gozilla was truly the king at the theaters for me my kids thoroughly enjoyed the movie it starts off a bit slow but builds up you wont be disappointed once the monsters start to get some screen time
Jun 10 2019,negative,this movie lacked an emotional connection with the characters shallow story fighting scenes between monsters too long not good effects dark no flashing colors we like these kind of movies on big screen for awesome effects which this lacks also little boys on each side of us were terrified dont take kids under 9 unless you want them to have nightmares way too scary for young kids these boys were hiding in parents laps jurassic park movies are so much better
Jun 10 2019,positive,lots of action and fun cant wait for king kong vs gordzilla
Jun 10 2019,positive,the movie was great  perfect for a big screen 3d theater experience  the cinematography combined with the 3d effects made it seem very real and some scenes i felt like i was really there  good mix of plot and action  i would definitely recommend it
Jun 10 2019,positive,amazing movie if my 6 year old son loved then its pretty good
Jun 10 2019,positive,perfect lots of monsters good actors exactly what i wanted
Jun 10 2019,positive,the acting was great but the script was cheesybut that what you expect at a godzilla movie the monster fight scenes were awesome all in all it was a great reboot
Jun 10 2019,positive,interesting story line good graphics  but almost predictable
Jun 10 2019,positive,great movie from start to beginning cant wait for the sequel 
Jun 10 2019,positive,the bad first emmas plan in the movie was moronic based on her tragic past to have the same thing happen to everyone around the world but be like im doing this for my dead child and proceed to spew environmental talking points basically starting genocide was hypocritical also people do a lot of standing around when they should have been running to safety  for the good theres a lot the monster fights were epic it shows the scale and destruction that goes with it and how helpless we are as humans this is really shown in the rodan scene where it takes off and the sheer force of it is tearing cars off the street an throwing people into the air    for me its about an 810 poor character motivation and dialogue brought it down but everything else was great
Jun 10 2019,neutral,worst of all godzilla movies  too flashy and too fast to even follow i am done with godzilla 
Jun 10 2019,positive,i really liked the movie it tied in well with the previous movie and gave godzilla the respect he deserves very well done
Jun 10 2019,negative,monsters cool people not
Jun 10 2019,positive,the special effects were great but the plot was bad scientists setting monsters off to save the planet common man
Jun 10 2019,positive,monster fights are glorious as i could wish for a shame that they are buried under heaps of human garbage 
Jun 10 2019,positive,i watched this movie to see monsters fight and thats what i got there was less story than the first movie but more action
Jun 10 2019,positive,fun movie a bit long but a great big screen action movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,this was clearly the best godzilla movie ive seen  plenty of action moved quickly for a 2 hour movie super setup ending for next movie  went in with plenty of high hopes and it didnt disappoint
Jun 10 2019,negative,script was horrible waste of money good actors and actressesvery promising but quite disappointing
Jun 10 2019,positive,i honestly thought that the movie was better than the first one just because there are more monster fights and godzilla didnt get enough screen time in the first movie and i also feel like this one focuses more on godzilla and what would happen if happened in real life  1010
Jun 10 2019,positive,the crux of every godzilla movie ever has been the constant denial of what the audience and fans actually want monsters onscreen    if you cast aside all of the fluff moments centered on humans with nothing interesting to do  say the movie would get 5 stars easily the main plot triangle was good enough to add depth to the story and the moments where scientists theorize  why the monsters are fight are fine as long as they are not overdone everything else just makes the movie drone on while i wait for the next fight    at this point it wouldnt feel like a godzilla movie without switching back to a room full of scientists and soldiers bickering every 5 minutes so i cannot fault them too much for trying to maintain their flawed identity
Jun 10 2019,positive,its a damn good godzilla movie probably the best made plenty of godzilla action with lots of hints to old godzilla movies for long time fans like me some blatant some subtle all with a twist the monsters look awsome they did a great job giving them emotion the main human actors are good the only flaw would be the supporting human actors but its a a godzilla movie who cares as long as the one true king looks good 
Jun 10 2019,positive,i think the special effects could use some work but everything else was great
Jun 10 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie and loved the nostalgic easter eghs
Jun 10 2019,positive,packed with monster action godzilla rocked
Jun 10 2019,positive,if you want kaiju battling then this movie gets to it takes a while to get what everyone really wants unfortunate amount of poorly written plot they feel is necessary in these kind of movies just show us monsters fighting is that too hard
Jun 10 2019,positive,great job with the monsters
Jun 10 2019,positive,besides a few dumb human moves by the characters this was the essential monster batter movie special effects were great and godzilla king of monsters was better than any previous godzilla movie i have ever seen nonstop action and wow moments
Jun 10 2019,positive,good old monster fun weak dialogue
Jun 10 2019,positive,lots of action great graphics exciting to watch
Jun 10 2019,positive,for a man that grew up on godzilla i really liked it but for anyone that didnt relate to the monster of old i could see this movie just being ok 
Jun 10 2019,positive,this is one you should ignore the critics on its a underrated and very good action packed monster movie i didnt pay to go see the human element of the movie it was just enough of that to keep the movie moving along i payed to go see the monsters and thats exactly what i got and expected a good popcorn movie very very underrated movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,king of the monsters delivers awesome big budget monsters with epic battles however it lacks a storyline it could be argued we see too much human and not enough of big g for such a big film it feels pintsized
Jun 10 2019,positive,this movie is full of action i enjoyed the fact that it starts from the very beginning and lasts the entire movie the monsters appearances show a true reflection of how the monsters looked in the old movies with a new twist enjoyed the fact it was mainly about them and not humans go see
Jun 10 2019,positive,haters can hate but monsters will always be awesome
Jun 10 2019,positive,i love the excitement
Jun 10 2019,negative,titan battle scenes are too dark and murky to clearly see the action and worst of all godzillas head is too small for his body this is a pinhead  version of godzilla 
Jun 10 2019,positive,godzilla was awesome even my daughter and my girlfriend liked the movie its a good part 2 from the previous godzilla movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,its like kings gng fr war but bigger in size long live the king
Jun 10 2019,positive,good film for scifi fanatics
Jun 10 2019,neutral,godzilla wasnt really all that dont waste your hard earned money wait for it on cable
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was a typical godzilla movie  if you are a fan you will like it
Jun 10 2019,positive,a great summer blockbuster while a plot surrounding kaiju monsters will only ever be so complex this film isnt made for the viewer that wants some dialogue driven drama it is made for the viewer that still wants to see something that can still visually amaze after exposure to the visual phenomenon that is the marvel cinematic universe  on that note the film does a splendid job the scale of the monsters is captured well and their various displays of powers is a sight to behold  the musical score even calls back to the original godzilla with the kings iconic theme song  if one has ever considered themselves a godzilla fan this is a must see
Jun 10 2019,positive,i just love the godzilla pantheon since i saw the first one in 1956
Jun 10 2019,positive,an incredible western love letter to one of the oldest and most legendary characters from toho long live the king 
Jun 10 2019,positive,godzilla went to a super power stage
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was exactly what a good godzilla movie should be the first movie was great except it was an hour and a half of balltickling teaser and a mere 20min fight at the end this movie is what godzilla was meant to be it is if these socalled critics have never witnessed a godzilla film in the past tsk tsk
Jun 10 2019,positive,godzilla movies have come a long way and this definitely delivered i hope that their monster universe flourishes because its a great little break from superhero movies at the moment if you love action monsters and battles this movie will keep you entertained and at the edge of your seat i will continue to watch it until it is out of the theatres
Jun 10 2019,positive,visually stunning wish millie bobby browns character had more lines
Jun 10 2019,positive,the easter eggs the throwbacks the cinematography the revised score all of it was gold i was not a fan of the humans too much but thats not who i came to see
Jun 10 2019,positive,comics to life best movie yet
Jun 10 2019,neutral,a step down from kong skull island and godzilla 2014  too much time was spent watching the kid during the final battle and i reached a point of irritation where i didnt care if she lived or not  the easter eggs that reference the previous kaiju films were a nice touch though  theres still room in the franchise for improvement in later films i hope this films failure doesnt kill the studios desire to make sequels
Jun 10 2019,positive,for the most part i enjoyed the monsters
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was a good movie but felt like it needed something else to the plot of the story
Jun 10 2019,positive,i really liked this movie interesting and actionpacked plot digestible dialogue ie not shitty bowelclenching star wars prequelsqualitydialogue thankfully great looking scaryass ginormous monsters  special effects riveting monster fight scenes  coupled with military warcraft action  dont believe all those uptight fancy schooled movie criticstheyre just trying to keep you from watching this fun action  monsterpacked movie you definitely need to see this in the theater
Jun 10 2019,positive,the movie was great even better than godzilla 2014 im super happy mothera was in this one as well as rodan and ghidorah i hope anguiras shows up in the monsterverse soon
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was a good film that brought back some monsters i recall my 7 year old totally enjoyed it
Jun 10 2019,positive,loved the movie loved all of the monster fights and thought they did a great job in giving them all unique personalities a lot of the human scenes were boring and useless
Jun 10 2019,positive,the best movie of godzilla
Jun 10 2019,negative,oh my gosh this movie sucks none of the characters in this movie give you any reason to care about them and the choices they make are so incredibly unrealistic and just downright stupid also after setting up king kong in the last movie he only gets a very brief mention in this movie the credits should just be an apology save your money and time can we please just an honest trailers of this already
Jun 10 2019,positive,so good cant wait for king kong vs godzilla
Jun 10 2019,positive,such an amazing movie highly recommend to anyone
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was fucking anazing
Jun 10 2019,positive,visual effects were great  loved how more kaiju were in the movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,action packed with occasional instances where acting could have been better however it does tie in a lot of source material and is a nice fresh experience to godzilla also godzilla is very prominent in the film contrary to last time which is a huge plus 
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was awesome nonstop action with a plot that made sense well balanced and up to date unlike the old versions    i grew up watching godzilla and it dragged on i had to fight myself not to fast forward to something interesting i dont like to see a bunch of humans talking about nothing and minitwins singing     the primary character was a focus and thats something the old movies never did godzilla was more a thing they mentioned and they gave you glimpse until the finale this one shoved that garbage plot line back to 1960 where it belongs    terrific job guys you gave fans what they wanted watch it and im buying it
Jun 10 2019,positive,love the fighting scenes  great movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,lots of good action and pretty good story line
Jun 10 2019,positive,i create this account only to give godzilla 55 stars suck it metacritics you know nothing   
Jun 10 2019,positive,always been a godzilla fan i really enjoyed it all
Jun 10 2019,positive,koo because of the other monster
Jun 10 2019,positive,honestly this movie is exactly what you think it would be a mindless entertaining spectacle of huge monsters fighting 
Jun 10 2019,positive,i loved this movie the kaiju fights were amazing and the special effects spectacular though i wouldve liked to see more of the destruction the other kaiju caused when they were under gihdorah overall i really liked the movie and while sure the movies plot was a little basic i definitely recommend this movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,im glad i ignored the reviews of the critics who for reasons known only to themselves tried to make sense out of the movie its a freakin monster movie people the human characters arent deep psychological studies the scientific explanations are silly and the monsters are the heroes and villains it captures all the spirit of the toho movies that i loved as a kid but with state of the art cgi what you want out of these movies is to sit back and enjoy watching godzilla whos really just a big softy at heart and the good guy monsters fight the bad guy monsters i believe one review remarked that it was too farfetched and the human characters werent sufficiently developed ffs professor what were you expecting chekhov or ingmar bergman i was glad to see vera farmiga i kind of have a thing for her and ken watanabe who apparently was there to collect a paycheck since it appears to be a big money maker i can only hope the franchise will continue
Jun 10 2019,neutral,my 10 year old son enjoyed it my husband and i couldnt wait to leave almost clapped when it ended because we were so over it millie bobby brown was magnificent the rest was a bunch of crap 
Jun 10 2019,positive,love it soo much action i enjoy it
Jun 10 2019,positive,since this movie doesnt need an oscar worthy script but the director does know what fans want and delivers it its worth my money 
Jun 10 2019,positive,great fun movie to watch on the big screen 
Jun 10 2019,positive,some of the monsters were used gratuitously and really not needed for the story disappointed in the short time allotted to mothra as she is a favorite of mine
Jun 10 2019,positive,very well done modern monster mash movie  ive seen many godzilla movies over the decades and my son and i very much enjoyed this
Jun 10 2019,positive,just a great remake classic
Jun 10 2019,positive,if you like godzilla movies of old you must see this movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,good action and great looking monsters
Jun 10 2019,positive,amazing movie i totally recommend  this movie had a ton of action in it
Jun 10 2019,positive,movie was a ton of fun to watch the characters unfortunately were boring and seemed to have no uniqueness at all except milly bobbie browns character other wise it was an awesome monster bash movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,boom crash smash godzilla is on the loose and he is pissed
Jun 10 2019,positive,its fun king ghidora is awesome in the movie and the sound is spectacular
Jun 10 2019,negative,i love godzilla but the humans in this science fiction almost ruin it 
Jun 10 2019,positive,lame plot but great monster action entertaining movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,great fun  at times a bit hard to follow3d not worth it
Jun 10 2019,negative,i do not get used to the idea of seeing godzilla being treated like the hero of the city it is a giant monster and apart from the plan of villain it has no logic why liberate the titans to eliminatecontrol the overpopulation  it also has the problem of its predecessor the movie is called godzilla not in search of my daughter and my ex people expect to see godzilla destroying the city not saving the day and clearly not be the only hope of humanity
Jun 10 2019,positive,what it lacks in a cohesive and fluid story it makes up for in kaiju duels
Jun 10 2019,negative,cheesy storytelling special effects without purpose
Jun 10 2019,positive,pretty cool and great visuals its not everyones cup of tea so dont expect much from the story and some details regarding the action just enjoy it for what it is a summer mega monster action popcorn flick that the whole family can enjoy 
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was a godzilla movie and a true sequel to the last one i went in wanting to see monsters fight and i got that i loved the lore aspect to it where the titans came from etc if people go in expecting more than an upgraded version of the old godzilla movies then they are missing the point i loved this one and look forward to godzilla vs king kong
Jun 10 2019,positive,liked that it continued from part 1 great cgi
Jun 10 2019,positive,enjoyed the movie even more in 3d good monster action which actually seemed easier to follow in 3d
Jun 10 2019,positive,godzilla lives even greater than ever but the future shall reveal not only other challenge but one or more surprises long live the king
Jun 10 2019,positive,one of the best kaiju movies ever made  the action is intense the monster life like i wont spoil anything in a review but i did like how the expanded upon the mythos of the titans all the nods to the 65 years of godzilla movies all the eater eggs makes it so much fun for life long godzilla fans to go see but easy enough for new fans to jump in and enjoy as well dont listen to the critics clearly looking at the difference between the 2 scores critics vs fans above shows they have no clue what makes for a good kaiju action flick 
Jun 10 2019,positive,i liked the monster fights but the middle seemed to drag on
Jun 10 2019,positive,you had me until we had a stealthlike bomber that can launch and recover ospreys inside through bomber doors and how can ospreys fly forward with the props always in vertical flight mode
Jun 10 2019,positive,go watch it now one of the best monster movies out there the graphics were great godzilla and the ghidorah were incredible looking i was very impressed by how the monsters looked couldnt of designed them better myself the movie was interesting from start to finish the critics are completely wrong about this movie it is because of people like them why we dont have many good movies like this anymore i hope to see more movies made like this one best godzilla movie to date
Jun 10 2019,positive,was everything i expected it to be
Jun 10 2019,positive,fun pic but twas a bit silly by the end
Jun 10 2019,positive,just saw about an hour ago and i freaking loved it the effects the soundtrack the design of the monsters they didnt make mothra a punk she actaully put up a great fight    one critizism i have is the family story it was kinda a trope thats been done to death but it didnt effect my over enjoyment
Jun 10 2019,positive,the godzilla movie godzilla fans wanted it was great the critics have no idea what they are talking about
Jun 10 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever i thought he human characters where interesting as well 
Jun 10 2019,positive,if you go into this movie looking for oscarworthy performances youre going to be disappointed if you go into it looking to see monsters fighting you should enjoy it nice nods to many of the japanese godzilla films and the people are basically just there to help the audience follow along
Jun 10 2019,positive,too many hoomans not enough monsters
Jun 10 2019,positive,it wasnt bad but wasnt anything special good cast and some good effects but the plot didnt really hook me 
Jun 10 2019,positive,movie good for culture but a lot of people will not enjoy 
Jun 10 2019,positive,great godzilla movie pure action just what i wanted out of this movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,good movie not the best 
Jun 10 2019,positive,its an awesome kaiju movie no matter what critics are saying but its absoluty the  best  monster movie ive ever seen
Jun 10 2019,positive,better than the end game lots of actions
Jun 10 2019,positive,giant monster fights what more do you want in a movie
Jun 10 2019,negative,cgi is magnificent do they even bother with scripts anymore two hours of fighting shooting roaring and blowing crap up and a script that would make professional wrestling promoters blush as we just all collectively getumless smarterer the quality of american cinema is just tanking are there other countries that have good cinema 
Jun 10 2019,negative,some of the worst writing and character development or lack thereof in a big blockbuster in sometime well besides the transformer movies but even then this would give those movies a run for their money unfortunately the very few and far between great godzilla scenes dont nearly make up for it very lackluster in action as well and one of the most disappointing blockbusters in a while waited 5 years for this
Jun 10 2019,positive,my favorite thing is how they tie in some old characters to this movie like the twins that use to sing
Jun 10 2019,positive,the entire movie is only there for the sole purpose of leading you to the final fight scene
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was a good godzilla movie entertaining but dont expect an academy award winner
Jun 10 2019,negative,long and boring all kinds of dumb even for a monster movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,we loved the godzilla movie it was full of excitement as each titan was awakened we had a great time at the movies
Jun 10 2019,positive,good story line and battle scenes through the whole movie very action packed
Jun 10 2019,positive,a very good disaster movie im not sure why critics kept saying there were too many kaiju with too little humans because most of what i saw was constant human interaction cutting into the middle of the actual kaiju fight scenes which honestly killed the experience for me as a godzilla fan but overall a solid movie 
Jun 10 2019,positive,the ultimate godzilla movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,now yes the movie didnt have a good story and yes it had bland characters but honestly if your a real godzilla fan you dont focus on that you just want to see godzilla wreak havoc on tokyo or monsters which this movie delivers on all of that action that was missing from the first one
Jun 10 2019,positive,genuinely one of the best godzilla movies coming from the franchise recently legendary pictures did a great job at revamping the monsters to keep up with the times unlike the critics may say i thought it was fine with the story aspect when critiquing this film you have to keep the past movies of the franchise in mind the story is important but what most people want to see is the drama and conflict between these kaiju while the human side of things just compliments the film when it comes down to the human story they can only ever be spectators and they must struggle to get along with these new situations its not like a character from the film is going to take on a kaiju one on one because the movies have always been about the humans being on the sideline i dont agree with the critics and i feel like before you trash on a film you should do your research and think of the past incarnations while taking into account that certain movies cannot be compared to others on the same level these movies cant be considered the same genre or class of other movies from recent memory the godzilla franchise is different and has obtained a different status over the course of time from other entertainment the movies have their own charm its not a fair judgement to think of this as a stand alone idea
Jun 10 2019,negative,such a boring movie 
Jun 10 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen it would take an hour to explain why please heed my word dont waste any money for this movie must be the movie investors  employees who have given this movie a good review
Jun 10 2019,positive,so much action all the way through from start to finish did not feel like two hours this is a must see godzilla is king
Jun 10 2019,positive,i thought it was a great movie me and my family enjoyed it very much
Jun 10 2019,positive,it is a great movie
Jun 10 2019,positive,such a great throwback to my childhood
Jun 10 2019,positive,best godzilla movie ever they did a great job and recreating a classic movie cant wait for the next one
Jun 10 2019,positive,movie was awesome really enjoyed it as it reminded me of the old godzilla cant wait for the kong vs godzilla movie in 2020
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was great less stupid human drama more monster fighting much better than the 2014 movie 
Jun 10 2019,positive,i loved the movie everything a godzilla fan can hope for  the human aspect of the movie was not boring at all and the monster fights were out of this world
Jun 10 2019,positive,was ok but felt it was a bit cheesy actors could have been better an plot too 
Jun 10 2019,negative,just not a fan the plot was thin and messy and the dialogue was terrible the visuals and songs were fantastic however but i just couldnt get behind this movie  
Jun 10 2019,positive,i enjoyed it to many people are harsh on a monster movie would recommend
Jun 10 2019,positive,the critics can suck it this movie actually contains a lot of godzilla unlike the first film where you felt like he was just making cameos when i see godzilla in the title i expect to see him more than a couple minutes this time i felt like i really got what i paid for
Jun 10 2019,neutral,decent monster action terrible plot  acting
Jun 10 2019,positive,i loved the monsters and the action i wish there had been more of both
Jun 10 2019,positive,slow in the beginning but fight scenes were cool  got better as movie went on
Jun 10 2019,positive,i came for kaiju and got them if that is what you want you will love this movie if you came for story not so much visuals are stunning designs are fantastic multiple goosebump inducing moments so cool
Jun 10 2019,negative,its boring and stupid plus its not even real barley anyone died its just dumb its not my cup of tea
Jun 10 2019,positive,it is absolutely now among my alltime favorite films a glorious spectacle of kaiju glory crafted so well that the passion and love for the original movies shines through it is everything i have ever wanted out of a high budget american godzilla film and for everyone who has grown up watching the toho classics i can not recommend seeing this film in theaters enough    1005    long live the king
Jun 10 2019,positive,about an hour too long had some cool action scenes but nothing that i think will stand the test of time
Jun 10 2019,positive,not much plot action scenes were mostly too zoomed in and jumpy
Jun 10 2019,positive,it was an amazing movie with a perfect balance of human drama and monster fights
Jun 10 2019,negative,so cliché my nose started to bleed also walked out havent walked out of a movie in a few years
Jun 10 2019,negative,the cg was subpar also felt like the plot was stopping and starting and not flowing very well
Jun 9 2019,positive,i cant imagine any godzilla fan not loving this movie the human plot is a little thin but its enough to string together an otherwise perfect monster movie if you dont like this your probably not a fan of all the japanese godzille films 1010
Jun 9 2019,negative,an abysmal plot with some awful dialogue this movie was almost a comedy
Jun 9 2019,positive,i like it good special effects 
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved it  just sit back and enjoy the iconic godzilla roar and watch the old creature features we saw as kids come to life  the human drama can get old but you have to have something besides monsters battling it out 
Jun 9 2019,positive,fantastic monster movie action if youre on the fence because of critic scores dont listen and give it a shot its well worth the time if you enjoy big action movies also lots of great callbacks to original godzilla series for fans
Jun 9 2019,positive,godzilla will rock your world 
Jun 9 2019,positive,i have now seen it four times gets even better each time this movie is fun action packed and the music and monsters are amazing would give it 10 stars if it would let me 
Jun 9 2019,positive,the theme song was lit af gojira
Jun 9 2019,positive,i came for the monster fights and was not disappointed king ghidorah
Jun 9 2019,positive,didnt like calling human race a disease on the earth also how godzilla and mothra had something going on seriously just have a good old monster movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,liked the story line but there should have been less human involvement and more monster involvement  the graphics were great i t should have been a 2 123 hr movie with more impactful fighting especially with mothra with rodan overall it was a very good
Jun 9 2019,positive,look  this is a fans movie  it was made for the true godzilla fans by a godzilla fan  this movie is for every day that had watched the showa heisei  millennium godzilla movies more than once    this movie isnt for those godzilla weekenders  this movie is for the fan who has watched ever japanese godzilla at least 50 times    so if youre a true godzilla fan  then go see this movie  you will not be disappointed    the best way to describe godzilla king of the monsters is as a modern day showa film    its a joy to behold in the big screen
Jun 9 2019,positive,great gc kaijus look real the nonsensical plot filled with incomprehensible motives by the human characters utter ignorance to the gojira history he was born as a result of the us nuke testing not an ancient monster and the lack of tanks  made it hard to watch
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was ok nothing great
Jun 9 2019,negative,total suck dont waste yer time or yer money  jittery effects earbustin lame strictly ham on cheese story line  a visual mess woulda got a refund i knew who to ask even my kid thought it wuz lame stay homen watch the 50s original
Jun 9 2019,positive,better than expected different twist on how weve known godzilla through the years
Jun 9 2019,positive,the critics just dont know what constitutes a good godzilla movie for those who like godzilla and giant creatures battling it out for dominance this is the movie for you if youre looking for a movie about humans trying to coexist with giant creatures maybe this is still the movie for you however if youre looking for a movie about humans with a giant creature cameo like the critics seem to want then this is definitely not the movie for you 
Jun 9 2019,negative,i fully went in knowing what i was getting into but my god remember in the king kong with jack black et al kyle chandler player an overthetop actor this movie is like that movieinamovie jack black was directing the entire worlds balance hangs on a family tragedy about a son who died like the whole earth aquaman was terrible this was stupid monsters were great but 
Jun 9 2019,positive,welp the worst thing about this movie is the plot acting and no one cares why the monsters have been unleashed best thing about this movie is monsters fighting the special effects are top notch all the monster were top notch and that part is fun fun fun shouldve just been two hours of them beating each other up and it wouldve been a 5 star winner for me go see it its cheesy entertainment at its finest
Jun 9 2019,negative,plot was cliche and terrible
Jun 9 2019,positive,amazing esthetically pleasing great story its the empire strikes back of the godzilla franchise
Jun 9 2019,positive,the human drama is not sooooo bad as all said ken watanabe is the one who makes that plot worthy and the titans are reeeeealy dope must see it entertaining movie with epic moments
Jun 9 2019,positive, i  thought the movie was great it brought me back when i was a kid watching the old godzilla films  from japan hope they make more after  godzilla versus kong
Jun 9 2019,positive,finally a godzilla movie that harkens back to the style of the toho movies of long ago and once again humans i didnt care for still a fun movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movies was owesome donnot listen to critics they are payed by dianey
Jun 9 2019,positive,definitely a must see if youre a godzilla fan a ton of easter eggs that will make a godzilla fan very happy
Jun 9 2019,positive,was an excellent movie i enjoyed it greatly
Jun 9 2019,positive,great visuals great story presentation actors did a great job
Jun 9 2019,positive,do not believe critics when they do not understand the finer points of a monster movie the monsters themselves thats why people go to a monster movie to see cool monsters not for human drama when it comes to godzilla this was a perfect addition to his saga
Jun 9 2019,negative,wanted godzilla fights got trash drama
Jun 9 2019,positive,i didnt dislike any of the movie it was awesome through the whole movie it was very excruciating and lots of action throughout the whole movie its a must see movie for sure
Jun 9 2019,positive,would have given it a full four if some of the cgi wasnt so cartoony
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved it  great movie  cant wait til the next one comes out
Jun 9 2019,positive,really enjoyed the movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,everything godzilla should be great character development and effects loved the hints at the coming godzilla vs kong cant wait
Jun 9 2019,positive,this movie is my favourite godzilla movie of all time  no godzilla fan wants human drama the monster fights are the best i have ever seen
Jun 9 2019,neutral,it was a little too long acting isnt that great
Jun 9 2019,positive,haiku moviereview    so much character   in a cgi monster   you forget theyre fake
Jun 9 2019,positive,sticks to established lore and characteristics of the monsters and little easter eggs throughout for the diehard godzilla fans
Jun 9 2019,positive,while the human story is bland and unoriginal the action all but makes up for it ten times over the first act is actually pretty good but the story starts to get bad in the second act and it never recovers despite this negative there are still some positives to the film for example the action has a amazing and is jam packed the visual effects of the film is amazing beautiful and breathtaking the soundtrack is pretty good as well not the best but its still good so overall id say to go and see it
Jun 9 2019,negative,can we admit that almost no one goes to a godzilla movie for the metaphor regarding mans technology outpacing his wisdom gozilla king of the monsters has adequate visual effects  the human storyline of a family drama involving characters played by kyle chandler vera farmiga with millie bobbie brown as the justifiably rebellious teenager is somewhere between a throwaway and cringeworthy the outlandish number of coincidences and laughably unfathomable decisions by humans is the signature of this atrocious script there is one good performance and that is by ken watanabe there is another king on skull island who drew me into his movie and maybe can get things back on track with the next installment 
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved the action i would have liked to have seen more of the connection with madison and mothra there at the end though madison needed more story line 
Jun 9 2019,positive,awesome cgi and sound fx
Jun 9 2019,negative,dont waste your money after 10 minutes i knew this movie was going to be horrible i was so looking forward to a good ole monster movie and instead saw a total mess  the fight scenes were dark and out of focus and uninspired the storyline was ridiculous and sadly the acting was phone called in by normally amazing actors you are better off saving your money and watching the original godzilla movie if you want to be entertained
Jun 9 2019,positive,action packed and fun to watch to my grandson and he loved it
Jun 9 2019,negative,special effects were good but  rest of movie    1 pathetic story    2 acting laughable     3 dark as in theatre quality viewing    4 too long for content    5 lastly its a jokeriddle of a movie      
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was a little more than i expected i thought it was going to to include king kong but my mistake next titan movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,i really liked the movie except for the part when can take the dna and create more titans thats just stupid
Jun 9 2019,negative,its bad   
Jun 9 2019,positive,monster fights are solid overall plot feels rushed like maybe this should have been more than one movie which stunts some character work and limits seeing some of the monsters in action even rushed the core elements of the human story a pretty good at least as to the momdaughter dynamic the father is forgettable and undeveloped which makes the torch passing moment fall completely flat
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved it only improvement would be less human storydrama more kaiju thats the real reason anybody went to the cinema to watch it 
Jun 9 2019,positive,a ton of fun for actual godzilla fans ignore the critics 
Jun 9 2019,positive,excellent  definitely worth watching
Jun 9 2019,negative,i was ready to walk out several times
Jun 9 2019,positive,its exactly what its supposed to be when the finale started i looked over to see my sons mouth open in awe of the visuals the story is a little lazy but i went to see a kaiju movie not anything more money well spent 
Jun 9 2019,positive,tons of fun and lots of nods to the classic godzilla movies give me more
Jun 9 2019,positive,it has everything you need in a godzilla film  godzilla looking awesome kicking the crap out of other kaiju if you were looking for something more then im not sure why youd waste your money   
Jun 9 2019,negative,it delivers on the monster vs monster action put cant get out of its own way with a conveluded plot lazy direction and downright awful writing
Jun 9 2019,negative,talented cast pulled down by bad a script and bad directing not even epic monster battles could save this movie 
Jun 9 2019,negative,not as good as the one in 2014 dont like the super tall spikes on godzilla
Jun 9 2019,positive,movie was great lots of action and worth every minute
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was better than avengers endgame
Jun 9 2019,positive,great watch the were are a couple lows like they tried to redeem the villain she wants to monsters to kill all the humans and then decides she doesnt want them to kill all humans  
Jun 9 2019,neutral,it was entertaining to say the least lots of godzilla and other monsters with more godzilla however comes less of a story and good characters  both the story and character aspects of this movie are i believe weaker than both the other monster movies that are a part of this franchise in addition to the characters being bland it also didnt have any star power like kong did with sam jackson tom hiddlson and brie larson  same as for the first godzilla where coming right off of avengers 2 elizabeth olson and breaking bads own brian cranston played major rolls in the first godzilla  in a nutshell this movie is entertaining and has more than enough monster action and it lacks in good story and characters  so its a good movie to go see with a bunch of fiends if you wanna have some fun but not so great if youre looking to find a perfect mix of good monsters action characters and story 
Jun 9 2019,positive,heres the thing about godzilla movies theyre a childhood memory for me spending time with my grandma after school it was a great time and i never really saw a man in a rubber suit fighting another guy in a rubber suit fighting on wires in a cardboard city scape i visualized beasts fighting in such a way that mirrored animal kingdom  this movie realized that vision the all 15 minutes or so the other 3 and half hours thats what it felt like anyways what a boring bland human story movies like godzilla dont need  you want badly written human dramas go to brainless places like lifetime or hallmark the only roles humans should play in these movies are exposition or being killed  it is a monster tearing shit up thats it even the comedy relief was shruggable   its meh at best
Jun 9 2019,positive,lots of fun for fans if the big g
Jun 9 2019,positive,the antagonist is completely unbelievable but the special effects are good
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movie was great right from the start seeing scenes from the previous godzilla movie tied everything together for this movie godzilla is definitely the king of the monsters
Jun 9 2019,positive,less human drama more godzilla whats not to like
Jun 9 2019,positive,much faster pace than the previous film if you found the 2014 film too slow plot and characters are more engaging although blink and some details may slip past you not conducive to bathroom breaks monster scenes are much more varied and plentiful and the spectacle and effects are jaw dropping one of those films that should be seen on the big screen great summer popcorn blockbuster godzilla fans will love it just dont go in expecting an art house film
Jun 9 2019,positive,absolute must if youve ever been a fan of the classic godzilla films legendary has done a great job with this adaptation and given the plot the human stuff was kept as short as possible the acting was also spectacular by the main human antagonist i got g m tarkin vibes from him and a lot of the dialog though not oscarworthy helps keep things fun the sound was spectacular and the visual effects were irresistible the modern adaptations of the original monster themessoundtracks were great and quite nostalgic thought not 100 true to the source films id still give this an a in that regard
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was freaking awsome loved every second of it
Jun 9 2019,positive,i loved going back to my childhood and revisiting these titans on film the story was well connected to the previous movie and easily understood throughout the battle scenes were amazing and had a great interplay between shots of the titans and shots of the humans if you like godzilla movies like i do you will love this film
Jun 9 2019,positive,took the family to amc and saw this opening night and loved it this movie took me back to my childhood growing up in phoenix watching the english dubbed japanese godzilla movies every weekend after the cartoons the story is hokey but i didnt go to see gone with the wind i wanted to see a monster movie and that is what i got and i loved it the monsters were awesome and seemed huge in scale a lot of japanese godzilla is in this movie from the notion that some monsters are terrible while others are human protectors some of the music comes straight from japanese godzilla movies and i just couldnt get enough it was clear that godzilla was the star of the show and godzilla got most of the screen time from within 5 minutes of the start of the film to the very end as a movie called godzilla should i am so glad they made this movie my kids were asking me about the old movies so now i get to share some oldies with the kids 
Jun 9 2019,negative,really disappointed dialogue so poorly written mindboggling twists in the plot  did not enjoy
Jun 9 2019,positive,excluding great performances by ken watanabe millie bobby brown and bradley whitford most of the characters are corny and not very well written sorry kyle chandler however long live the king because godzilla is at peak performance in this film and thats who you come to see 
Jun 9 2019,positive,as long as you dont go in with high expectations for human character development youll have a blast watching godzilla king of the monsters  the visual effects cinematography sound editing and score youre the best bear mccreary are top notch  dougherty really shows that he cares for these spectacular creatures they all have their own unique personalities and when it comes to the action sequences my godzilla this movie does not disappoint
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was everything a godzilla movie should be critics are irrelevant pieces of shit these days anyway 
Jun 9 2019,positive,i finally saw this movie i thought it was great and im am super excited for godzilla vs kong to come out next year 2020
Jun 9 2019,positive,every bit of this film delivers exactly to the community it was built and created for godzilla fans will not be let down  as expected the acting from the human counterparts seemsfeels dry  is it because of the script  i dont think so  the plot and story is excellent as well as the talent used to portray it  i believe that the films main man simply and literally over shadows the acting expertise of even vera farmiga who did quite a magnificent job with her role  this could be a biased opinion ive been a fan of the big g since he was literally a man in a rubber suit  ill leave this at its worth 101200 for standard easy and its that much better in i max this film deserves to be seen on the biggest screen  dont be swayed by the tomato throwers it is known they have skewed  opinions with such a drastic difference in audience rating and theirs  this time listen to the audience sit back and be amazed  and dont forget god meets king in 2020  
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movies title says it all about the movie its one of the best movies with visually beautiful filmed kaiju action and then there are the boring human characters that give silly reasons to release these so called titans with imensely cheezy dialog in a nut shell only watch this movie for the huge kaiju action while you will just forget about the human characters once the movie is over
Jun 9 2019,positive,excellent visuals and monster battles its what summer blockbusters are made of 
Jun 9 2019,positive,movie was incredible and a true treat for godzilla fans the movie had a good story line that tied in well with godzilla 2014 has plenty of human drama with even more monster fights perfect kaiju movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,just an absolute instant classic that youd have to be a damn fool not to enjoy 
Jun 9 2019,positive,growing up this is what you would imagine a godzilla movie would be like  the easter eggs through out the film payed homage to its great past the score imagery were all done very well by someone who was obviously a fan of godzillas origins  dont listen to the criticism of this film because if you loved the films of your childhood this is exactly what the director gave you
Jun 9 2019,negative,almost walked outalmost
Jun 9 2019,positive,better than the imax 2d
Jun 9 2019,negative,this is one of the most boring movies ive seen in a while really dissatisfied with the characters and they focused so much on them there were some cool battles but my brain went numb whenever the humans were on screen cause i was so bored
Jun 9 2019,positive,a great godzilla movie lots of action
Jun 9 2019,positive,i liked everything about it
Jun 9 2019,positive,did not care for the family dynamicnarrative that was woven into this movie aside from that beautifully done  
Jun 9 2019,positive,great monster movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,for a godzilla fan it ticked all the boxes  was satisfying in its homages to the earlier movies and characters had plenty of kaiju action overall and in relation to time spent with human characters would have enjoyed more balance between darker and daylight kaiju scenes the movie had us jumping all over the globe with no way to reference the time line china to antarctic to mexico to bermuda triangle then washington dc and boston typical toho kaiju story telling overall it is a giant monster movie after all so we must suspend our logic and just enjoy the destruction 
Jun 9 2019,positive,absolutely brilliant the criticisms of the script were unfounded the entertainment first class whilst it was an action film first and foremost the battle scenes werent laboured as in the 2014 movie couldve done with an opening credit scene as in the 2014 movie but thats nitpicking a movie for all the family its the best of the year so far 
Jun 9 2019,positive,godzilla was great waiting for blu ray so i may add to my collection
Jun 9 2019,positive,awesome effects specially with mothra and fire godzilla the movie is way underrated people cry ti much but it was what a monster movie can be about theres fights from the begging to the end watching how godzilla was looking for something so desesperate teach you how old is their rivalry i love the other titans unique designs thanks to the novel aftershock i manage to understand a lot of things here as well
Jun 9 2019,positive,i just got back from seeing this and i really enjoyed it was it the absolute best movie ever no but it was exactly what it was supposed to be  a fun movie with monsters fighting each other im looking forward to more in the future and i bought my ticket right at the theater counter so the verify is pretty useless
Jun 9 2019,positive,a proper godzilla film may be a little too much focus on the human characters but like all good godzilla films it focuses on the idiocy of mankind in causing the disasters depicted
Jun 9 2019,negative,absolutely terrible plot and dialogue a few okay fights but overall not good 
Jun 9 2019,positive,this movie is a very underrated i would say this is way better than endgame this is a movie i would recommend to everyone
Jun 9 2019,neutral,not enough godzilla and too much storyline
Jun 9 2019,positive,best american adaptation fun fun  fun
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved the graphics  you actually felt like the monsters were right there realistic    didnt like some of the writing ie the little girl was able to outrun the equivalent of lightning flashes  then the girls mother who decides to unleash these mega giants knowing that they will destroy most of the population of earth a terrorist is made out to be some kind of hero at the end because she doesnt die  the writing could have been better but i really dont go for the storyline i go to see godzilla and he was amazing  my nephew liked ghidorah best  mothra caterpillar and moth was pretty awesome too
Jun 9 2019,positive,2 hours of monsters kicking each others asss with comedic and dramatic moments sprinkled in 
Jun 9 2019,positive,not as bad as i thought it would be
Jun 9 2019,positive,i loved it when at the endwhere godzilla stood in that pose like a king
Jun 9 2019,positive,great monster movie loved every minute 
Jun 9 2019,positive,big monsters fight with subtle commentary 
Jun 9 2019,positive,need the non instrumental music for mothras
Jun 9 2019,positive,its two hours of giant colorful monsters battling each other and the military the human element makes sense and keeps the movie moving along without dominating it as in the first movie   a fun movie that made me feel like a kid again
Jun 9 2019,positive,godzilla fights giant monsters with a finite amount of human drama for added story benefits exactly what a godzilla movie should be 
Jun 9 2019,positive,absolutely mind blowing
Jun 9 2019,positive,if i could i would put this film at 49 stars there were some thing that i disliked but heyi had the greatest time in this theater than i had in any other theater this film was probably one of the best godzilla films out thereapart from the original it might have slow pacing with he humans but it was worth it in the end i can see what michael was going for it wasnt going for any of the human dramait was going for the monster fights he wanted the audience to feel like a kid playing with dinosaur toys forget what the critics say this film deserves its place at being 1 box office go go godzilla
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was definitely better than expected it was a refreshing take on an old classic
Jun 9 2019,positive,as i think is a story that tell us that tell us a different story of godzilla with the classic monsters and for god sake is a movie of monsters fighting the the narrative is the less matter of the movie but is true that it dont have the best narrative but it is necessary the monster fights and the movie give us enough of that 
Jun 9 2019,positive,fun for fans of monster movies
Jun 9 2019,positive,i enjoyed the battles between the titans but could care less about the story same old plot as always 
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was amazing  more action packed thrilling experience and the story connects so well godzilla is truly the king of monsters this movie was just jaw dropping amazing  going to watch it again im so so hooked 
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movie was amazing not the best acting in certain parts but the story was well told and full of nods to the original movies that i loved to watch growing up 
Jun 9 2019,negative,put on the headphones and listened to disturbed and watched the monsters move on the screen honestly the only way to do this one 
Jun 9 2019,negative,it was the worse movie ever  all you see is dark rain strobe light in back ground and kept changing the action parts that you can not enjoy or follow at all even worse the 3d quality worse than the first ever produced 3d i want my money back and the time ive wasted 
Jun 9 2019,positive,i rarely write reviews but am going to defend this movie it was amazing special effects were awesome and i feel this was a much better movie than the first as it does focus more on the monsters also appreciate that some of the music came from the original films very well done 
Jun 9 2019,negative,the movie was a total disappointment  we didnt see godzilla until the last maybe 30 minutes all was seen was the 3 headed monster throughout the movie lots of loud noises they were making would not recommend this movie wish i could get my money back the old godzilla was much better
Jun 9 2019,negative,i love the godzilla movies but this one was not good i actually was bored multiple times the story was weak the characters were not engaging and there was no connection to the monsters did i say the plot was dumb and not engaging 
Jun 9 2019,positive,criminally uderrated movie epic monster fights and adequate screen time of the individual titans overall a spectacle flawed pacing but doesnt really take away much imo the breaks of action dont do enough to stop the flow the finale is truly something to see all in all a solid 910
Jun 9 2019,negative,this movie is awful there is no better way to say it story line is slow and not even an open imaginary mind can explain the contradictions that occur throughout my 11 year old son was calling out the absurdity almost every 10 minutes we almost walked out but we didnt think we would get our money back the worst part is the insertion of political rhetoric about why the titans exist in first place just overall top 5 worst movies of all time 
Jun 9 2019,positive,monster fights where so great and scenery loved everything about it
Jun 9 2019,positive,an amazing sequel definitely not worth the hatred from critics  
Jun 9 2019,positive,definitely an entertaining movie and probably would have been even cooler if every theater near me hadnt stopped playing it in 3d so i saw in 2d and it clearly was made for 3d way to much cgi for a standard 2d movie but whatevs it was still good not great not really much else to say except theres a lot of godzilla lots of monsters and a whole lot of wreckage and destruction ill totally see the next one if they do another one 
Jun 9 2019,positive,big monsters fighting literally the only thing anyone wants from godzilla
Jun 9 2019,negative,mellow and bland movie lacking of present day special effects and visuals horrible film in general
Jun 9 2019,positive,fun and entertaining action
Jun 9 2019,negative,the story line was horrible  the fight scenes between monsters was too distorted  horrible movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,good summer movieif you like giant monsters see it
Jun 9 2019,positive,i loved godzilla king of  the monsters it was an action packed monster fest if your a godzilla fan or just a fan of giant monsters youll love this film
Jun 9 2019,positive,as usual the critics opinions are worthless this was a great monster movie and a solid entry in the godzilla franchise true g fans would have a hell of a ride watching  this and you can see the amount of love that was put in this film my only complaint was the quick cuts between the monster fights and the humans besides that would  definitely recommend 
Jun 9 2019,negative,what a horribly made movie my kids slept through and i saw many others in the theater browsing or sleeping too the special effects were outdated even if this came out in 2009 everything was gray dark and blurry most of the movie not gonna comment on acting since thats never the focus of a godzilla movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movie was phenomenal one of the most action packed movies of the year ive watched it twice already godzilla is represented like never before watch and enjoy i have twice the king lives like never before 
Jun 9 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie good acting action and the special effects were on point
Jun 9 2019,positive,action packed and stayed true to the original godzilla movies
Jun 9 2019,positive,a great cgi movie for general mass
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved this movie its easily the best in the monsterverse franchise great monster battle scenes pretty good storyline thats easy to follow and good acting i really enjoyed watching this movie i hate critics because i have no idea what theyre looking for in movies  i went to see a good action film with a decent story and my expectations were exceeded it was a great movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,i really enjoyed all the action and comedy throughput the film it really made the pacing and flow of the movie much easier to watch as a big action movie fan i kept getting bothered by the camera panning too fast during some fight scenes with the titans there were some few parts of the story that i criticized but for the most part this movie was so enjoyable to watch all the fight scenes were intense and all the characters were admirable in their own way
Jun 9 2019,neutral,not as good as we hoped rental not worth paying movie prices
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movie was everything i wanted from it and more i went into the movie to see some epic monster battles and thats what i got i could not be happier with the movie the soundtrack was amazing aswell as the cinematography the story was a little lackluster on the human side but that is by far not the main focus of these movies the mystic story background was teased so nicely and i hope it gets even more attention in the next movie as the credits rolled i realized the corners of my mouth were hurting a little bit because i could not stop grinning like a doofus cause of the movie i am really excited for the next movie and i hope they ignore the reviews of the critics because it seems to me they do not understand what these movies try to establish if you are just a little bit interested in godzilla movies go watch this one and make more of them possible have a great day
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movie was great it was good from start to finish
Jun 9 2019,positive,if you are or ever were a godzilla fan you have to see this film
Jun 9 2019,negative,with boring and flat characters and focus this godzilla sequel fails in many unforgivable aspects
Jun 9 2019,positive,would have been better without all the talking parts i just wanted to see the monsters beat the sht out of each other
Jun 9 2019,negative,what the hell was that loved the first one tho
Jun 9 2019,positive,great film glad i didnt listen to critic reviews
Jun 9 2019,positive,godzilla king of monsters was definitely a meh outing the only fun bit was watching the cgi monsters in action the story telling was not compelling and suffered from poor pacing could have been better 
Jun 9 2019,positive,epic film loved when the big lizard beats everybodys ass he almost died a few times but thanks to a couple nukes he still kicked ass i loved this movie it was sick 
Jun 9 2019,positive,good story line to go with the godzilla story
Jun 9 2019,positive,great movie great action and cal backs to past godzilla movies dont listen to the critics go see it for yourself and get blown away by godzilla
Jun 9 2019,positive,get a bag of popcorn and sit back and watch a modern day monster movie of the king in action
Jun 9 2019,positive,i loved the special effects the monsters were great   good sounds effects action all away through
Jun 9 2019,positive,monsters were great and actionfight scenes another lecture about how humans are a virus and destroying the  planet the story of the family was lame attempt at pulling heart strings was annoying
Jun 9 2019,positive,my first godzilla movie seen as an adult it is extremely entertaining fantasy movie of the summer absolutely loved it
Jun 9 2019,positive,godzilla never disappoints loved that they had more than 1 of the monsters cant wait for the next movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,great story line and great way to revamp the old godzilla franchise
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movie was spectacular its everything i hoped it would be the cgi is great the fight scenes and the story i am not saying that i loved the movie because im a huge godzilla fan but i loved the movie because of how great the story was told about the titans and the amazing cgi really caught my eyes but what im really gonna say is that whether you are a godzilla fan or not the movie will really surprise you on how amazing it is
Jun 9 2019,positive,i have always loved and watched these kind of movies
Jun 9 2019,positive,one of the best movies to ever exists the visuals are simply amazing the action are unstoppable i get chills on my spine everytime i watch this movie not to mention that the titans have much more screentime than the previous movie even though the human characters are a bit unimportant in my opinion that doesnt really affect me to not give a 5 stars as this is one of the best movies in the godzilla franchise and the universe a must see
Jun 9 2019,positive,excellent monster movie lots of action and good human element storyline  i thought the cinematics were very well done only regret was not seeing it in a imax theater that would have made even better
Jun 9 2019,positive,this is what a monster movie is supposed to be a battle royale of monsters as far as i am concerned the movie could have been 2 hours and 12 minutes of monster kicking the crap out of each other and the human presence would be in the background    this movie proves that critics have no understanding of what audiences want and are still confused by hard core fantasyscfi and horror movies
Jun 9 2019,negative,another great example why hollywood needs to pay writers for new movie content this movie is super lame continuity mistakes everywhere who has clean roads to drive everywhere with giant monsters demolshing cities stupid dumb storyline we must stop the world being dommed to find our daughter wtf dont waste any of your hard earned money on this pos 11 is 11 still plays the same role can we gove negative marks can the studio give me my money back yea that bad
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was surprising  storyline was great  full of action
Jun 9 2019,negative,if like me you dont care about monster mythology youll experience a weird dissociation from what you actually went to see the monsters are easily the movies least interesting part legendarys monsterverse surprises mostly because the characters are actually compelling and worth following but this movie tries its very best to make us care about the monsters and just cant partly because godzilla is the least special of all of them most of the time the cgi spectacle is impossible to follow and you strangely find yourself wishing to see more of the human drama
Jun 9 2019,positive,great movie exactly what i expected  classic monsters fighting each other
Jun 9 2019,positive,still think kong was the best among all 3 although this godzilla movie was def better than the first it was still too dark too dark so many awesome action scenes but not clear enough even though i watched in imax i really hope they address this issue because if you cant see the visuals in movies like this whats the point 
Jun 9 2019,positive,is it just me or do these monsterverse movies get better with each subsequent movie the critics dont share those feelings with me but they did pay to see compelling human drama rather than kaiju action but i seriously think that this is the case with the monsterverse godzilla 2014 3 stars kong skull island 35 stars godzilla king of the monsters 4 stars keep this up and godzilla vs kong might earn 5 stars while development of humans is pointless because were just here for godzilla the actors still do a fine job though millie bobby brown is the one i felt who knocks it out of the park it might because she gasp says bad words but i felt this character would immediately be established as a different girl rather than eleven having grown her hair out the story is nothing special the good kaiju tries to defeat the evil kaiju thats literally the story the visuals are gorgeous you really feel the size of these creatures and the vfx artists put their blood sweat and tears into translating their scaly textures to the big screen seeing how the time for stopmotion is past and the movie has better lighting than godzilla 2014 too though that might be because i saw it on a big screen the action sequences whoa arent they spectacular i still feel that aquamans action was more exhilirating but this is a kaiju movie not a superhero movie so i just have to play with the hand im dealt and how could i forget the sound design while i usually never comment much on sound design with the notable exception of a quiet place i thought the sound design and mixing were spectacular the academy better nominate this movie for best sound mixing andor best sound editing you really should see this movie on a big screen playing at the loudest volume possible you really feel the vibrations from godzilla coming to save the day and roaring gkotm isnt the best movie in the world but since were all going into this movie expecting epic giant monster action that might not be such a bad thing
Jun 9 2019,neutral,this film need more monsters on screen time i think its not a all bad film but they make these movies they need to stop with the humans storylines cuz it rubbish writing
Jun 9 2019,positive,the attempt at adding in an attempt to fix a broken family fell flat i didnt care for the family as characters and theyd have been better off taking the same plot of the son and father in the previous godzilla movie    or even better skip that whole plot and just have more giant stompy monsters fighting
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was awesome great story line and great effects
Jun 9 2019,positive,utterly spectacular one of the best godzilla films ever epic kaiju battles and not too much time wasted on twittering humans the whimpering critics bleat about the human characters not getting development but i have news for you you dont watch godzilla movies for the humans you watch them for giant monsters best film ive seen in years
Jun 9 2019,positive,king of monsters the movie took me back to saturday afternoons in front of our tv to enjoy the toho films of godzilla would what king kong will do against that atomic breath
Jun 9 2019,negative,overall do not waste your time in seeing this
Jun 9 2019,negative,awful acting and stupid plot this was 2 hours of my life that i will never get back
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved the action and fighting scenes
Jun 9 2019,positive,best movie this year
Jun 9 2019,negative,i must be getting too old as this movie made no sense whatsoever  my son said dad its a monster movie  its not suppose to make sense  i yield to those 16 yrs and younger  whove scored this movie four and five stars  anyone whos older cannot possibly score it more than one star  and shame on the critics for getting it up to the 40 level  please  give me something that has a shred of scientific basis then travel into make believe but dont just invent reality as you go along  puhleeze
Jun 9 2019,positive,enjoyed movie great graphics
Jun 9 2019,neutral,i am and always will be a huge fan of godzilla unfortunately this was a movie with too many characters with unnecessary dialogue including the weird connection with the family of three
Jun 9 2019,positive,great movie and it sets everything up perfectly for godzilla vs kong next year
Jun 9 2019,positive,too long first hour of movie could have been covered in 20 min
Jun 9 2019,positive,very good movie never a dull moment and the action just keeps coming if your a godzilla fan or even just and action nut this movie is for you
Jun 9 2019,positive,excellent all around
Jun 9 2019,negative,disjointed and everywhere wasnt exciting

Jun 9 2019,positive,loved it action packed
Jun 9 2019,positive,i like it   its good movie whatever it is   few cringe moments but i enjoy it 
Jun 9 2019,positive,godzilla was finally the main character of the movie hes actually visible over half the film vs the last one where he was only in it about 17 minutes the fight scenes were awesome and they set it up nicely to do another sequel this is definatly worth an afternoon
Jun 9 2019,positive,amazing movie full of action and excitement throughout the entire movie long live the king
Jun 9 2019,neutral,graphics great but the story is pretty much a rip off of infinity wars and end game also if youre in the army youre going to hate ityoull see what i mean
Jun 9 2019,positive,for absolute fans of godzilla
Jun 9 2019,positive,way more fun than i expected the critics reviews were pretty off yes there are chunks of stupid in this movie but its nonstop action gorgeous visuals plenty of monsters and genuine love for the franchise make up for it
Jun 9 2019,negative,no impressed slept through last half definitely a snoozer
Jun 9 2019,positive,you rotten tomato  you have no right to misguide non  godzilla fans and other people by providing wrong low rated critics on such legendary godzilla movie you misguide people and you have no idea of how godzilla movie works  because wb has delayed godzilla vs kong movie  the movies are for entertainment and people are enjoying it  you anti democratic liar  
Jun 9 2019,negative,wtf was that really i wouldve stayed asleep if it wasnt so loud the story mustve been written by a child so bad
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was great honestly cant remember the characters from the last godzilla film but this current film  skull island were amazing amazing visuals  soundtrack hopefully ill remember the characters in this film because of elven lol
Jun 9 2019,positive,monsters fighting they built on the excitement really well for the human side to keep the momentum going some narrative decisions arent the most sensible but still its fun 
Jun 9 2019,positive,fantastic kaiju battles story was enjoyable loved it
Jun 9 2019,positive,this movie is a love letter to the old heisei and showa era films critics and wannabe critics just dont get it and they never will the disparity between the critic and audience scores here show just how bad the system is
Jun 9 2019,positive,enjoyed this feature  reminded me of the godzilla movies we watched as kids
Jun 9 2019,negative,mystery science fiction theater 3000 bad campy worn out plot dark 80 cgi flat characters a few twists but good lord they are reaching just how does a teenager get into yankee stadium into the booth crank up the sound system to draw creatures from halfway around the world took like 3 mins if youre there to see all the creatures fine godzilla looks more like a iguana than my old campy favorite guy in a rubber suit or cgi mastery if cloverfield this will be on tv within a year or 2 late late late late show
Jun 9 2019,positive,this movie was streets ahead of the 2014 movie it had so many subtle references and easter eggs for the godzilla fans sure it has some bad things about it but it makes up for it with how faithfully they portrayed godzilla and the other monsters they brought back the themes for the monsters and only changed them slightly to fit the movie i was literally on the edge of my seat at some parts the cgi and recreation of the monsters especially king ghidorah was absolutely incredible
Jun 9 2019,positive,amazing movie i got a nostalgic feeling while watching this i expected to see kaiju fighting and was not disappointed
Jun 9 2019,positive,the scale of the monsters were awesome breathtaking was the word
Jun 9 2019,positive,very actionpacked your definitely get your moneys worth for the cg characters the scale was confusing in one scene you see two titanic monsters fighting taking up the whole screen then in the next scene you see a jeep taking up the same amount of screen all in all i enjoyed it though
Jun 9 2019,negative,yes it has some great monster fights but thats it i do not remember the last time i saw a worse movie than this one it looks like it was written by a tenyearold all the human characters are stupid predictable and just dislikable  the plot moves without any logic characters come to conclusions out of nowhere they have technology that is impossible where did they get a scanner that knows that the beast is going to explode in 12 minutes emma does things that are not consistent with what she is saying well all the characters do  i know it is a fantasy but even the most outrageous stories must be true to their own universe this one fails as hard as it can  
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved the special effects
Jun 9 2019,positive,im sorry the critics didnt like it they obviously dont understand godzilla  this movie was clearly made by a fan for fans  
Jun 9 2019,positive,though it was a great monster movie i hope they continue to make more  
Jun 9 2019,negative,terrible movie cheesy cliche no story predictable the worst ive seen in a while 
Jun 9 2019,negative,painfully bad writing and direction with such a great cast it was surprising walked out very predictable
Jun 9 2019,positive,absolutely loved it
Jun 9 2019,positive,i thought it was great i dont understand the hate the visuals where great and i thought the human element was fine i dont really see the problem i think rotten tomatoes made a mistake 
Jun 9 2019,positive,godzillas proper roar is back  great action and musicdun dun dun
Jun 9 2019,positive,please note the incredible difference in critic rating and audience score rating  go with the audience rating  this is the greatest godzilla film since the original 1954 japanese production the film is amazingly sophisticated and the story has great depth and meaning  godzilla is king 
Jun 9 2019,negative,they learned nothing from the 2014 version this makes it way worst because they had a base none of the human characters were good they were a waste of space the title king of the monster was wasted on this movie every joke fell flat i do not know why they tried making this monster movie into a comedy there are about 20 minutes of fighting and every fight is them cutting to the human and not the actual fighting just watch any other godzilla movie from japan they keep using godzilla as a prop a background character godzilla is a fucken star the movie is called godzilla why are they not using godzilla dont watch this movie if this is the legendary universe dont give them your money let it die and pray next time godzilla gets better treatment
Jun 9 2019,positive,if you are a godzilla fan this movie will rock your socks off all the little homages to the classic toho legacy are perfectly interlaced with the new graphics and human character story arcs you may laugh cry and most certainly cheer on our beloved titan go go godzilla
Jun 9 2019,positive,good movie but its been done before
Jun 9 2019,negative,soooo disappointing  a whole city with no people in it everything destroyed but all the power works open uncluttered roads in a city of crushed buildings for hummers to drive through pretty lame i was expecting so much more 
Jun 9 2019,negative,i was praying for my own death until the last 10 minutes of this terrible mistake 
Jun 9 2019,positive,much better than the first godzilla movie which decided to hide godzilla and focus on the forgettable human characters if you are going to see a godzilla movie then you probably want to see godzilla excellent action great special effects and a ton of fun throughout highly recommend critics ratings here should be totally ignored 
Jun 9 2019,positive,excellent monster fights the oneliner gags needed a bit more work adrenaline rush throughout 
Jun 9 2019,positive,didnt care for the human plot a few times during the film it got somewhat dry but overall movie was dope cgi fighting scenes were great cant wait for kong vs godzilla next yr
Jun 9 2019,positive,this movie was awesome the best kaiju movie out there great plot and so much action ignore all the dumb professional critics they said that the movie had no plot and the movie actually had a very strong plot they said it was not worth seeing but i highly recommend it all the critics need to be fired because of their horrible movie tastes they only like lame boring movies anyways go watch this movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,yes there are few mistakes in human part yet the monster fighting scene can absolutely  cover it
Jun 9 2019,negative,the rotten tomatoes score is pretty accurate on this one
Jun 9 2019,positive,really dope very story driven and action packed cant wait for kong v godzilla 
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was fun to see the classic monsters again
Jun 9 2019,positive,this movie really stuck to the traditional godzilla setup focusing more on the monsters than the people i particularly enjoyed the sounds and score throughout the entire film any godzilla fanatic would be ecstatic im glad to see the godzilla legacy done right by this movie
Jun 9 2019,negative,2 hours of screaching nonsense dialogue was preschool quality
Jun 9 2019,positive,all in all the acting is great vera farmiga is always a win as well is ken watanabe the story is there although maybe not as strong as id have liked it to have been but hey its a godzilla movie since when has the story been amazing the fight scenes are amazing they do a great job of building the tension throughout the movie and getting to see a side of the godzilla universe weve never seen before 
Jun 9 2019,positive,monsters fighting at its best just an fun movie and best monster movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics movie was great 9410
Jun 9 2019,negative,terrible acting terrible writing so much could go wrong in a movie like the hell that japanese guy could breathe underwater and why the hell that girl survive without a scratch even though her hand was struck down by a wall even jamie lannister cant survive that 
Jun 9 2019,positive,king of the monsters was an excellent movie i really love how they show the destruction from humans perspectives and thanks to the book aftershock i could comprehend a lot of things in this movie the fights are awesome and the way mothra is make is beautiful and the effect they use make the movie feel so intense ghidora was a real menace it was completely out of this world rodan look very badass but fire godzilla is the star of the show that nuclear pulse melt ghidora like if it was a piece of ice the thing is they didnt let the other monster or part of the world in blanck they show it even if it was little they give you the knowledge of whats happening arouns the world and how intense things are if they dont hurry
Jun 9 2019,negative,the entire time i was either waiting on the titans to come out what i would write on this review and when the movie was going to end this movie tried so hard to have its funny moments and it failed miserably i dont think ive ever rolled my eyes more also the main woman mom preached the entire time about how we have to do the greater good this is bigger than all of us blah blah blah but the moment her stupid daughter gets away she risks it to go save her hypocritical much i only liked the titans and if they were legit paid actors then maybe id consider giving this review more than half a star     want to watch a typical corny movie that you know whats going to happen next every single time this is it
Jun 9 2019,positive,everything godzilla fan wants to see absolutely appetizing for an experience best spent seeing on the big screen
Jun 9 2019,positive,good for hollywoods standars good enough for godzilla fans has some interesting references im giving it a 5 because i liked it a lot i would like to listen to your opinions
Jun 9 2019,positive,so good  iconic and epic  g is the white lion who defeats all the forces of evil monstrous and human  i wanna see it again

Jun 9 2019,positive,had lots of action and a good story
Jun 9 2019,positive,amazing monster fighting
Jun 9 2019,positive,perfect storm of thrill and sacrifice
Jun 9 2019,positive,very entertaining and sequel coming up
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movie had a lot of great action the plot was a little bit loose and unnecessarily complicated overall the movie was a fun watch
Jun 9 2019,positive,overall i thought this was a pretty good movie compared to the first one directed by gareth edwards it was a lighter toned sequel that relied heavily on monster filled action scenes this doesnt make it a bad movie it just lacked in dialogue compared to the far superior first godzilla movie id give it a 6510
Jun 9 2019,negative,was lostwasnt sure where they were trying to go with the story line was there a storyline
Jun 9 2019,positive,i took my 14 year daughter to see it we both liked it should be seen on the big screen
Jun 9 2019,positive,awesome movie lots of action from start to finish
Jun 9 2019,positive,this is exactly what it should have been it was a movie about huge monsters that fight and you get that beautifully done the sence of scale was amazing the battles were intence and that what i came for its a monster movie done well and should be seen on the big screen to really do it justice 
Jun 9 2019,positive,best godzilla movie to date enjoyed it very much
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved the effects and origin story tied all of the movies we watched as a kid together
Jun 9 2019,positive,wonderful action filled movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,it is a good movie but story is worst 
Jun 9 2019,positive,reminds me of old school toho godzilla movies if youre a godzilla fan youll enjoy this movie
Jun 9 2019,negative,storyline is just pretentious and acting is just lame effects are fine but everything else us just lame and there are multiple holes in it its just a waste of money
Jun 9 2019,positive,godzilla was awesome
Jun 9 2019,positive,a great and fun action movie with giant monsters  the kids loved it
Jun 9 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,typical godzilla movie little cheesy but good monster movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,this movie is only palatable because of the incredible visual effects stunning and beautiful and truly epic  worth the price of the movie however the story and plot is so incomprehensibly idiotic and stupid seriously this is such a bad movie at every level except for the visuals its bad bad bad lol
Jun 9 2019,positive,great movie just dont watch it in 3d at deer brook mall the 3d glasses are in very bad condition scratches and smudges all on the lenses overall the movie is fantastic
Jun 9 2019,positive,love the movie and sorry for saying this but rotten tomatoes and all the other movie critics can suck it  feel free to send me an application and ill start reviewing movies
Jun 9 2019,positive,as great as avengers endgame was i will say i had much more fun watching godzilla king of the monsters piggy backing off of godzilla 2014 and kong skull island we begin to see the monsterverse take shape the human element while not the greatest its bad either as a matter of fact i have to say it is much better than most godzilla movies the bread and butter is in the monsters themselves as a matter of fact they evoke more emotion than most actors today then you have the sound its like they cranked the volume up to 100 the highest point of highs the music godzillas theme hits your hair will stand up like a bolt of lightning goes through you all i have to say is see it
Jun 9 2019,positive,kinda cheesy  but it was a perfect summer night movie  did you really expect an oscar movie ha
Jun 9 2019,positive,this is a great fun movie that fixes most of the flaws with godzilla 2014 while having a few of its own how much you like this movie will very much depend on how much of a preexisting godzilla fan you are it is very clear from the first moment this movie was written and directed by lifelong godzilla fans for lifelong godzilla fans it is densly packed with references homages and outright wholesale plot points from many of the 30 movies from godzillas 60 year history and therein lies the problem this is not a beginners movie this is not an entry point into the franchise its a spectacular love letter to it its rather like trying to watch avengers endgame or infinity war without seeing any of the other mcu movies i would suggest seeing a few of the heisei era movies such as godzilla vs mothra and godzilla vs destroyah first destroy all monsters also gets a lot of love in this
Jun 9 2019,positive,some glorious action great creatures but as of others have said some of the action is too often cut off by the human action this movie is worth the price of admission the monsters are magnificent i did not go to this movie expecting any suspense mystery nor much drama if you want these things see another movie i doubt anyone can impart a sense of mystery or any great suspense in the godzilla universe at this point
Jun 9 2019,positive,fun movie full of action and adventure tons of giant monster action plot was a little weak but lets be fair thats not what youre going to a godzilla movie for anyways
Jun 9 2019,positive,really good graphics and plot moved good could use less humans though and more about the monstersfights
Jun 9 2019,positive,bruh this was absolutely awesome i didnt get up once and i usually get up at least once during a film
Jun 9 2019,neutral,the scenes were too dark the cinematography was below average at best too many rainy dark scenes i went to the theater to clearly see monsters fight however i expected this because the trailer was dark and grainy too so i guess i got what i expected id pass on this one 
Jun 9 2019,positive, this movie was a fun ride  great action  amazing special effects everything you want in a godzilla movie 
Jun 9 2019,positive,just saw this movie last night and really enjoyed it    the plot is fairly weak but i dont go to godzilla movies for the plot i go for the monster fights    i like how they do the special effects for example godzilla looks like an actor in a godzilla suit very nostalgic really i really enjoyed there were some errors i think the size of king ghidorah monster zero appeared much larger on the volcano than he did next to skyscrapers fighting godzilla but honestly i loved the scene where he spread his wings on the mountain    one concern i have is with the massive amount of destruction around the world i wonder how they can continue the franchise in this movie they implied san francisco and las vegas that were somewhat destroyed in the first movie were not rebuilt in this movie there are more monsters in more locations so there are many more cities that were destroyed washington dc and boston for example     overall i enjoyed the movie and look forward to the next installment also i will have to check out kong skull island now that i know it is in the same universe
Jun 9 2019,positive,enjoyed it its a godzilla movie if you go into this thinking anything else you are not going to get it
Jun 9 2019,positive,non stop amazing action super fun movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,the john wick of monster movies too much of everything except a proper story and believable plot  not recomemded
Jun 9 2019,positive,the human interactions where pretty goofy but better than the old movies the monsters actually looked cool in this godzilla movie an all around b
Jun 9 2019,positive,i saw this on imax and the screen was still not big enough to show how massive and magnificent godzilla is  godzilla is still king of the monsters
Jun 9 2019,positive,i wish kong was in it
Jun 9 2019,positive,i gave it 5 stars because i was absolutely entertained the only disappointment was the absence of gamora i would have liked to have seen himher as an island awakened by godzillas call 
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was like pacific rim 25  not much story development  more of the other kaiju monsters would have been nice too  godzilla looked great but ghidorah looked like 3 smaugs tied together  mothra was the best part of the movie  i hope godzilla vs kong is better than this
Jun 9 2019,positive,this is a good monster movie but i wish they would get better writers because the plot is dumb it was obviously created by a yankee fan too  it has so many dumb parts
Jun 9 2019,positive,awesome movie better than the previous godzilla movies
Jun 9 2019,positive,a bit ridiculous and cheesy at times
Jun 9 2019,positive,ive always loved godzilla the monsters looked so much more real than when i was a kid
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was very action pack and you get to see a some of the mothers in this movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was very action pack and you get to see a some of the mothers in this movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan like ive been for the last 40 years then you will love this film as much as i did  where the 2014 movie had too little godzilla footage this one makes up for it 
Jun 9 2019,positive,amazing exactly what a godzilla movie should be epic battle scenes stunning visuals monsters perfrctly created  choked up with nostalgia from watching godzilla movies when i was a kid   must see if you like godzilla 
Jun 9 2019,positive,the second best movie other than endgame
Jun 9 2019,positive,plot was way too complicated lots of talk and not enough godzilla
Jun 9 2019,positive,for s godzilla fan of 40 years this was a perfect movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was a long movie but it was good in the end
Jun 9 2019,positive,my advice is form your own opinion on this film the critics obviously arent godzilla fans it is very action packed compared to the previous godzilla movie enjoyed the story and the monsters get plenty of screen time 
Jun 9 2019,positive,this is what the 2014 godzilla should have been though they still spent waaaaay too much time on the lackluster human characters with questionable motivations the human interactions should have either been cut back a lot which would have helped with the runtime this movie felt 4 hours long or they should have written more compelling and believable humans
Jun 9 2019,positive,good hints of the old programs brought back memories
Jun 9 2019,positive,great special effects
Jun 9 2019,positive,action packed made me sit at the edge of my seat
Jun 9 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the spectacle of it all and how mothra was used to help godzilla growing up watching godzilla movies in the 1970s and 80s i felt like this was a great omage to that time it was visually impressive and the people story was a nice touch
Jun 9 2019,neutral,pacific rim without any of the goofy earnestness
Jun 9 2019,positive,loved the special effects so much better than the last one loved the multiple monsters and their stories awesome
Jun 9 2019,positive,awesome movie especially for godzilla fans
Jun 9 2019,neutral,not a lot of godzilla meh
Jun 9 2019,positive,great movie still havent seen endgame growing up in the 70s seeing the old monster movies from the 50s and 60s nothing could compare old school good stuff i did expect too much when they mentioned skull island i was waiting on kong guess ill wait a few more years for him
Jun 9 2019,positive,a true masterpiece the critics had pulled the ratings down due to a poor story however that is absolutely not a major concern when creating a godzilla movie    every frame of cgi was a complete painting the fight scenes were infinitely memorable as well as the ending to the movie the symbolism for this movie was well put together and the soundtrack even more so    this movie was a love letter to everything that made this franchise this franchise it is a masterpiece at every level except for story but that matters little to me    the critics are worrying too much about the story and too little on what this movie was made for spectacular action farmorethanexceptional music and cgi that borders on art
Jun 9 2019,positive,even with there being a bunch of stuff that doesnt make sense how did the oxygen destroyer bomb leave water since its 13 oxygen atoms why did the muto bow to godzilla at the end and not in the last movie  etc i still thought the movie was awesome  when its in the zone its in the zone and its really really fun  you just have to stop asking questions and just enjoy godzilla going beast mode on ghidorah  i definitely recommend it
Jun 9 2019,positive,godzilla reminds me a lot of a pokemon named feraligatr and the rugrats reptar great movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,very action packed godzilla is king
Jun 9 2019,positive,everything was easy and enjoyable
Jun 9 2019,positive,forget the critics this thing is a must see 
Jun 9 2019,positive,i enjoyed all the action the story line could have been a little stronger
Jun 9 2019,negative,so terrible writing was the worst i have ever seen for godzilla and thats saying something bad acting and directing as well cmon godzilla you deserve better writers
Jun 9 2019,positive,great movie amazing graphics and pretty good story bf wished there was less human interaction tho lol
Jun 9 2019,positive,not enough interaction with the monsters too much actor dialogue
Jun 9 2019,positive,good movie but at some parts took long to reexplain instead of just doing it so it couldve been shorter
Jun 9 2019,positive,needed more kaiju fights but otherwise an enjoyable movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,the movie was great i love the special effects and cgi
Jun 9 2019,positive,as a longtime godzilla fan i thought it was great
Jun 9 2019,positive,i dont what the critics are talking about this movie was awesome
Jun 9 2019,positive,seriously its godzilla whats not to like even bringing in the twins from mothra was a nice touch to the old classics the sounds of godzilla gave me chills yeah theres not a whole lot of depth in the human characters but still enough to have that little emotional feel for what theyre going through bring on the monsters and definitely stay through the end credits
Jun 9 2019,positive,action from the beginning plus i love goszilla
Jun 9 2019,positive,the humans thinking they matter was a bit distracting
Jun 9 2019,positive,it reminded me of classic godzilla i loved the monster fights
Jun 9 2019,positive,this film is so much much better than all of the other american cinema movies of this franchise this movie connected to the japanese context and did not stall with all of the people talking bullshit fantastic thrilling movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,i like everything bout this movie i think this is the best godzilla movie ever  i think we gonna c godzilla vs king kong on the next one
Jun 9 2019,positive,if you are a fan of godzilla this movie is for you the movie starts slow by giving some backstory to the past events and introducing character motives but as the movie progresses it just gets better the cast did a great job and the soundtrack was well done special effects were great and most importantly the monster battles were entertaining 
Jun 8 2019,positive,intense film straight out of the gate  i liked that there was a great deal of monster action from beginning to end that is why we watch these movies unlike some past films  well done
Jun 8 2019,positive,awesome got a little soreness from smiling so much 4d experience just takes it to another level and if you do it take a jacket the cheesiness thrills badassery and straight up ridiculousness was well balanced with a little man vs nature message cuz sure why not a side note  if godzilla would have grabbed ghidora from its three heads and suplexed body slammed him i would have lost it that is one of my fondest memories of his movies didnt happen but still it was fantastic cant wait to see mechagodzilla or mechaghidora  in the next hopefully
Jun 8 2019,positive,one of the most action packed movies this year
Jun 8 2019,positive,i grew up in godzilla so it was food die me to see and updated version that i could relate to
Jun 8 2019,positive,beautifully destructive movie as a godzilla die hard seeing the old monsters with updated skins look awesome new monsters mixing with old monsters is a great touch as well  
Jun 8 2019,positive,loved it as a true fan
Jun 8 2019,positive,much better then the first one 
Jun 8 2019,positive,minor plot contrivances do nothing to detract from the movies solid pace and nonstop action
Jun 8 2019,positive,a nod to the originals exactly what i would want in a godzilla movie 
Jun 8 2019,positive,this was a great movie to see in 3d it was so much better than the last godzilla movie and they must have listened to critics this movie has planrtbif godzilla main frame shots hes the king if the monsters hes a good guy kinda and i love him  
Jun 8 2019,positive,great flick rotten tomatoes is a corporate sell out and wouldnt know a good movie if it bit them
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was better than i thought it was gonna be godzilla is a great friend to have
Jun 8 2019,positive,giant monsters fighting what more do you want
Jun 8 2019,positive,excellent monster fighting action just what a godzilla movie should be
Jun 8 2019,positive,its godzilla sit back and turn your brain off
Jun 8 2019,positive,critics are the same people that liked star wars last jedi  this movie was freaking cool
Jun 8 2019,positive,we loved it   great cast and action packed
Jun 8 2019,positive,for some reason the critics are picking on this one dont be discouraged if you are a godzilla fan and who isnt you will enjoy this it uses material going back to the very first godzilla movie and hits a lot of high spots along the way maybe that is the issue if you are not familiar with godzilla movies some of this one will be a bit obscure but that hardly ruins the film the action may be a bit spotty but it satisfies in the end a great action movie 
Jun 8 2019,positive,this movie was epic cant wait for the next one  long live the king
Jun 8 2019,positive,pretty awesome if you are an old time gozilla fan yes plot holes you can drive a truck through but we are watching godzilla all in all very much worth seeing if you are short on cash wait and rent it
Jun 8 2019,positive,entertaining a little cheesy good godzilla movie
Jun 8 2019,negative,a good cast wasted on a bad movie a piece of garbage full of cliches and overuse of special effects with a confusing yet very predicable plot  godzilla deserves better 
Jun 8 2019,positive,great film wasnt the biggest fan of the human side of the story but the monsters were awesome godzilla done right
Jun 8 2019,negative,jumbed incoherent mess   the person that played godzilla was really believable  i was hoping for at least one bright sunny blue skied day but no every day was a dark rainy night   also why does godzillas head get smaller with the release of each subsequent movie  do these monsters breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide if so they need to be regulated by the government
Jun 8 2019,positive,awesome graphics and special effects my kids loved it
Jun 8 2019,positive,whats not to love about it great action story line  and sets up godzilla vs k k
Jun 8 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie it is a trilled movie i knew what to expect and gozilla delivered it
Jun 8 2019,positive,godzilla had way more screen time this time around compared to the last movie  great acting and social issues made for a decent plot and better understanding of character motivations
Jun 8 2019,positive,really dont know what the critics were expecting    bashing the writing for being surface level the characters for having weak personalities and the fights being too bombastic to the point of becoming repetitive    these are the same people that praised every single marvel movie all of which have the same faults that kotm has albeit on a much larger scale and frequency telling moviegoers that theres not enough of a political or social message in a godzilla movie of all things is stupid when depth was never the intention so expecting it is ludicrous     kotm is meant to be fun titan packed monster movie and nothing else those critics that will give a perfect score for a female protagonist or a forced political agenda in the trash heap of a cinematic universe that has finally concluded at least all of the mainline entries have come to an end have no respect for the medium they claim to love    go see king of the monsters unlike many films today its directed michael dougherty someone who cares about the entertainment and the art value they produce go have fun for a change instead of watching the same marvel movies and generic romcoms and the recent explosion of political scandal films go see something this year that was made to entertain and not to condescend theres never too much godzilla especially in his own movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,the movie was great for a godzilla fan it had so many call backs to the older movies it definitely feels like a old fashioned godzilla movie which is just spectacular
Jun 8 2019,positive,very good movie love it
Jun 8 2019,positive,we liked everything about godzilla
Jun 8 2019,positive,best godzilla movie in ages the action was off the charts and the characters really brought it together only thing i can complain is godzilla not fighting all the monsters 
Jun 8 2019,positive,entertaining and decent story some of the acting was a bit cheesy though worth a look
Jun 8 2019,positive,a good ol fashioned slugfest the graphics and technology bring new meaning to the classic characters just one problem how is godzilla the king when theres another named king like ali said to frazier youre not the champ until youve beaten me
Jun 8 2019,neutral,another disappointment from a godzilla movie which felt like there were holes and they filled them with lazy writing dont remember the japanese actors name but like in the previous movie makes lots of facial expressions but says almost nothing he squints a lot and makes it like we should be able to read his mind to know what hes thinking cgi was ok but even that aspect of the movie felt short the end scene was the straw that broke the camels back in my case lazy ending that felt very comicish wait till it comes out on dvd in a few months and only get it because youre curious thats the only reason to watch this movie just my opinion who grew up watching godzilla starting in the 70s hence why the need to watch it from a godzillas fan perspective it was a must see for me which is why i am so disappointed because my expectations were so high considering the technology available to make such movies today theres lots of holes and whomever wrote this really missed the mark that plus some actors need to go back to acting school 
Jun 8 2019,positive,much better than 2014 godzilla
Jun 8 2019,positive,monsters fight for 2 hours true monster movie plot who the hell cares still better than cringy and meaningless john wick or got or most of the movie that are trying hard to be something this movie is not trying to be anything go and watch it with popcorn and brain turned off hell yeah go chubby lizard boy for the earth 
Jun 8 2019,negative,totally devoid of a plot and too heavy on monsters thrashing each other  worst movie of the year
Jun 8 2019,positive,animation was great acting sucked
Jun 8 2019,positive,ive grown up with godzilla and kong great movie fun as long as they make them ill go see them
Jun 8 2019,positive,it is the godzilla we grew up on going to see it again
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was good start to finish villain was pretty apparent to me from the jump though
Jun 8 2019,positive,no idea what critics are talking about its a kaiju movie big monsters fighting that what you go to see this film for just deal with the human drama and youll be fine if youre expecting anything more from this film youre expecting too much
Jun 8 2019,positive,in a world of complicated plots its refreshing to have a movie thats simple and to the point it will never win any awards but its a solid action movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,i loved it  action packed and the monsters were awesome long live the king 
Jun 8 2019,positive,great monster movie coming from og godzilla fan
Jun 8 2019,positive,special effects were amazing love the storyline of the titans
Jun 8 2019,positive,just like the classic toho era godzilla flicks just substitute gaijin
Jun 8 2019,positive,awesome godzilla movie best one yet
Jun 8 2019,positive,way better than expected they did a great job on this one best american version made so far
Jun 8 2019,negative,while the effects and the monster fights are well done the story here is  a mess the human characters despite some good actors in the cast are uninteresting and the pacing is off so that most of the middle section is a complete bore definitely doesnt make one want to continue with the mosterverse
Jun 8 2019,positive,kaiju fights were good the writing left a bit to be desired
Jun 8 2019,positive,greatestmovieever  true godzilla fans will appreciate this movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,by far the most awesome kaiju experience i have had in a decade  which if you think about it is by definition a qualified statement lets face it this is not a great movie in so many ways but none of that matters if youre a giant monster fan it has the godzilla themes  both the jazz entrance and the godzilla march it has the mothra song it has the oxygen destroyer rodan emerges from a volcano the fan service is neverending and we appreciate it no end
Jun 8 2019,positive,competently written character drama distracts slightly from epic monster battles but doesnt ruin the experience mayhem galore and they actually managed to come up with an inuniverse explanation for giant monsters that doesnt make you lose brain cells every time you think about it
Jun 8 2019,negative,not worth your time or money i expected at least a fun dumb ride but it was so painful i almost walked out  i shouldve i wouldve had more fun in the lobby     the story was nonsense the lines sounded like they came from prince valiant the moments were not just cliche but the same cliches over and over again brave sacrifices that are completely useless and inexplicable a monster puts its face right up to a main character they say something brave godzilla saves them at the last minute   i couldnt count how many times that happened      but heres the worst part an international team many of whom are women have been researching the monsters for years a white man who breaks the rules walks in and tells them everything theyre doing is wrong and they should do it his way  and guess what hes right every single time  i thought this tough whiteman outsmarts the world narrative had died with john wayne but evidently like a multiheaded gorgon it rears its head     strangely it seems like the filmmakers dont know the difference between chinese  and japanese people ken watanabe japanese makes a reference to a fortune cookie americanchinese and ziyi zhang chinese traces her lineage to actors from the old godzilla series japanese this is rendered a little bizarre when you realize that writerdirector michael dougherty is halfvietnamese  whats going on here overcompensation    it really felt like a story told by twelveyearolds characters were inconsistent and made nonsensical decisions instead of planting this bomb and then running away like everyone else im going to stay here and kill myself  gallantly the new monsters were ugly and poorly rendered on the bigscreen they look fuzzy and out of focus i felt awful for the assemblage of really fantastic actors putting their all into lines like if these rocks could speak the legends they would tell it hurt    you have a life you have better things to do rent the old godzillas and watch them instead heck even godzilla 2000 was more fun than this
Jun 8 2019,positive,its a great movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,lots of action looking forward to kong versus godzilla
Jun 8 2019,positive,annoying family drama was annoying
Jun 8 2019,positive,moster beautiful  humans meeee  
Jun 8 2019,positive,monsters were good story and characters were disasters
Jun 8 2019,positive,the monster fights which are the main reason anyone is seeing this movie were absolutely fantastic
Jun 8 2019,positive,very enjoyable action and great monster battles
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was good not great if you like monster movies it is worth seeing
Jun 8 2019,positive,yes the plot isnt there for the people of earth but were here for the monsters monsters were awesome watch in 4dx if possible
Jun 8 2019,positive,i didnt know what to expect i enjoyed it
Jun 8 2019,positive,its a monster movie the critics are expecting star studded acting godzilla was the star 
Jun 8 2019,positive,i thought it was awesome i have been a godzilla fan all my life  well done
Jun 8 2019,positive,really enjoyed this one
Jun 8 2019,neutral,not bad but also not amazing 
Jun 8 2019,positive,with less of the human element installed i would have given another star
Jun 8 2019,positive,nonstop monster action my mom didnt fall asleep and that saying something
Jun 8 2019,positive,anyone who complains about weak characters and a simple story has never seen a godzilla movie before this just relax and enjoy special effects at their finest 
Jun 8 2019,positive,exactly what a godzilla movie should be action monsters then monsters and action simple and amazing 
Jun 8 2019,positive,monster action was legit human story a little weak and kind of distracting but still a great monster movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,5 stars  ive been a godzilla fan since i was a little boy  such a fan that when i saw the first american version in the theater early 90s i cried when he died lol  but that was that movie onto the new one  this movie was total fan service  i love it  i wont spoil any plot details but the human story section actually wasnt bad  it had its moments had some people and moments i didnt care too much for but not in a way that distracted me fro enjoyment  all of the monsters had sounds reminiscent of their old school counterparts but with a new updated flair  gedora gave me goosebumps when he made his battle cry at the top of a mountain chilling  if you are a fan of godzilla do not skip this one  might be blasphemy to some but this is my favorite godzilla movie of all time  i will be seeing it a 2nd time
Jun 8 2019,positive,despite what these socalled critics say it was a great movie
Jun 8 2019,negative,terrible movie came for monster fights and i got 1 hour dialogue  terrible one cringy dialogue who wrote this  according to this director scientis and military people only vocavulary is wtf whats that you have to be kidding me  slang and more one like diálogo    monster actual fight is at the end but i was so bored by that time that i didnt longer care  slow boring movie make me want to sleep in the thearer  if a action movie make you sleep then is a terrible one  only 1 star for the girl of stranger things actually she is the only one in this movie that shows emotions 
Jun 8 2019,positive,great watch excited for the sequel
Jun 8 2019,positive,the perfect fusion of a superhero blockbuster and a disaster movie this chaotic ride oozes a love for the source material and japanese media in general thats right its got solid anime vibes    it also has the big g himself storming across the screen like fifty million tons of big dick energy come to life    ghidorah is terrifying and intelligent mothra serene and benevolent and rhodan is cowardly little starscream wannabe who cant even backstab properly    if you have any love for the classic godzilla franchise or anime or even the mcu this movie will be all you ever wanted it to be hammy ridiculous and amazing from start to finish
Jun 8 2019,positive,good fighting and visuals but wished it focused more on godzilla than the people
Jun 8 2019,positive,loved everything about it beautifully shot and easy to follow action godzilla is a badass i do hate though how in all monster movies like pacific rim there is a part where the monsters can just stand up after swimming like what are you swimming through a puddle highly recommended
Jun 8 2019,positive,captures the spirit of a classic vs godzilla film with the added bonus of modern day film making
Jun 8 2019,positive,this was a really good movie there plenty of action and little tug at your heart for the favorite god size monster and the store picks up after the 2014 godzilla movie 
Jun 8 2019,positive,exactly what you want from a kaiju movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,much better than i thought it was gonna be
Jun 8 2019,positive,the action and graphics were amazing
Jun 8 2019,positive,great fun enjoyed the movie and looking forward to what may come in the future  definitely a lot of fun tie ins and pretty neat in 3d
Jun 8 2019,negative,cheesy corny cheap and for the kids
Jun 8 2019,positive,great movie action from the beginning til the end glad that they used the older songs from previous godzilla movies
Jun 8 2019,positive,this movie was great it is a must see movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,amazing dont really know what the critics were talking about   
Jun 8 2019,positive,an absolutely epic film reminds me of all the old kaiju films of the 20th century it brought the power and scope of the monsters as well as the heroism godzilla became known for
Jun 8 2019,positive,been a godzilla fan since i was a kid this movie was awesome the storyline was well done and they focused more on godzilla than the last film which is something that fans pay to see more monter time highly recommend
Jun 8 2019,positive,so so movie cool graphics but has too many explosions
Jun 8 2019,negative,movie review godzillaking of the monsters    godzillakotm 3510  this movie literally doesnt even make sense the storyline is all over the place and saying it is like something my younger brother would make is being nice so many problems firstly most of the movie barely has any monster fighting theres 2 fights that last about 2 minutes or so and then theres a massive fight at the end i shouldnt have to wait 1 hour and 30 minutes for a large fight in a movie about large monsters fighting the fight at the end is why this grade is as high as it is also this movie focuses on the humans more than godzilla now if you have compelling stories i can understand that see kong skull island the feltboard characters in sunday school have more dimensions to them than all of the characters in this movie except 1 ken watanabe does an admirable job as dr ishiro serizawa i love kyle chandler clear eyes full hearts cant lose but he is given nothing to work with the script and dialogue make you want to insert yourself into a middle school message board in order to hear intelligent conversation then after focusing on the human characters the movie abruptly ends literally no warning at all one of the worst endings ive ever scene this is all in all a straightup terrible movie if you like godzilla movies wait for it to come out on redbox but i suggest you dont mentally scar yourself by watching the movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,the movie is visually great basically it is a wrestling match of huge monsters still too much humans for my liking and the story is pretty bad however i can overlook that when the monsters are so awesome to see if you can go to a theater that has good sound stage then it is well worth it with how amazing the movie sounds
Jun 8 2019,positive,this isnt a bad movie im so surprised by some of the reviews if youre wanting an escape where big large monsters kick the you know what out of each other you wont be disappointed however if youre wanting the next dead poets society this probably isnt for you
Jun 8 2019,positive,this movie a true godzilla movie definitely for the die hard godzilla fans fucking awesom
Jun 8 2019,positive,if you wanna go see awesome giant monster fights go see it if you want plot i recommend something else this is for those who just want pure cgi fights and awesome monsters
Jun 8 2019,positive,loved it and great plot
Jun 8 2019,positive,compared to the 2014 movie this time we get a far more engaging human story and much much much more time with the monsters each monster has a distinct personality action scenes are as loud and as intense as you want them to be great summer movie entertainment
Jun 8 2019,positive,my daughter really liked it
Jun 8 2019,positive,stunning visualsfairly good story just takes a little while to get started but once it does it is very thrilling  definitely enjoyed this movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,good summer action movie visuallyaudiowise it was great predictable plot and nothing special with storyline or anything worth checkingout in theaters
Jun 8 2019,positive,once again the neurotic and repressed film critic community get it completely wrong godzilla king of the monsters is a fun romp around the world with a swarm of giant nuclear and fire breathing megamonsters its not supposed to be citizen kane it needs just enough story and character development to hang together lots of epic monster fisticuffs jira delivers all the roaring kickassery you could want plus you get to hate a super villain liberal soccer momscientistclimatepanicking ecoterrorist trying to end the world by ridding it of human infestation  she fails long live the king 
Jun 8 2019,positive,totally awesome godzilla rocks
Jun 8 2019,positive,as a lifelong fan i love it i dont care about the human factor at all never been an important issue go see this movie
Jun 8 2019,negative,i guess when i was watching these kinds of movies growing up i didnt realize how stupid these monster movies were 
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was an awesome movie phenomenal special effects and great actors i just thought the plot of the movie was a bit far fetched and not put together well i
Jun 8 2019,positive,it did not show the other monsters enough but it was a good new age representation of an old monster movie
Jun 8 2019,negative,other than the fight scenes with the monster the movie did not peak my interest at all
Jun 8 2019,positive,action packed great godzilla movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,if you like movies where the monsters create mass destruction and there are well choreographed fight scenes  this was a great movie  i was not expecting the characters to be especially well developed or that there would be moving dialog   the exposition supported the monsters and their motivations and that was enough  being it has been a few years since the previous godzilla i would have like a better refresher at the start of the film but you eventually get the full picture by the midpoint of the movie    i would stay for the end credits scene it seems to support a fourth film for the franchise rather than the upcoming godzilla vs kong  what do you think
Jun 8 2019,positive,this wasnt too bad of a movie exceptionally better than the past remakes an action packed monster filled movie with family in the middle trying to find their way
Jun 8 2019,negative,i took my granddaughter to the movie as she wanted so badly to see it  it was the most boring movie  i couldnt wait for it to be  over  i kept checking my watch to see how much longer  of course i am older
Jun 8 2019,positive,i went in thinking it was a punishment from my kids but i came out loving the movie i was really impressed by it having watched the previous movies i can say this is the best instalment
Jun 8 2019,positive,loved it and cant believe it was filled with that much action brought memories of me back when i was a child and all i would think of was who is godzilla fighting next movie was great and hope they name another one 
Jun 8 2019,positive,everything the first godzilla was missing was out into this movie epic monsters and fight scenes everything the first godzilla had this one lacked the story was meh i enjoyed it but didnt love it if they take the best of both movies and put it into the next it will be epic
Jun 8 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie probably one of the best kaiju films ive seen to date
Jun 8 2019,positive,this is the best action filled monster movie ive seen if you like or love to see any kind of monster flick youll really enjoy it its filled with special effects suspenseful keeping you on the edge of your seat  action film i didnt give it 5 stars only because itd seemed like the human characters were bland and just in the movie as narrators as it went along however i did like the selection of actors overall godzilla kicks butt and takes names which is what a monster movie should be all about
Jun 8 2019,positive,i love it if you are a fan of toho godzilla movies there is a lot of call backs my only complain is the titan fights were too dark i cant wait for godzilla vs kong
Jun 8 2019,positive,saw it in imax  enjoyed the movie

Jun 8 2019,positive,more entertaining than i expected pleasantly surprised
Jun 8 2019,neutral,slow predictable great graphics though
Jun 8 2019,positive,the movie was good but tbh i could have waited for the netflix release it kinda reminded me of the justice league movie i couldnt help but feel like the movie crammed a lot and so the movies pace feels a lil off and a lil jumpy  character développent was lacking so the more emotional scenes fell short to deaf ears
Jun 8 2019,negative,one of the worst ive ever seen storyline was strange and it wasnt anywhere as good as a jurassic park or the last king kong
Jun 8 2019,positive,i enjoyed the story and the graphics long live the king
Jun 8 2019,positive,this movie was intensely fun to watch its everything you could hope for if your looking for some giant monster battles
Jun 8 2019,positive,i liked it my kid wanted to watch it and i thought it was going to suck but i thought he was an adorable bad ass godzilla great summer family movie 
Jun 8 2019,positive,godzilla was my childhood and as a long time fan i was blown away with this movie what a fantastic thrill ride with plenty of easter eggs for fans like me the visuals are stunning and the monster battles and sense of scale are incredible i couldnt be happier this is an american made godzilla film done right and im glad that the big g is finally getting the respect he deserves from american audiences
Jun 8 2019,positive,graphics didnt disappoint this movie has amazing scenes just dont expect a deep story plot
Jun 8 2019,positive,good movie its such a huge difference then the last one i actually got to see godzilla and not some dark shade like the last loved the actors 
Jun 8 2019,positive,just a fun movie no need to dig any further its godzilla
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was a pretty good moviewhat i expected out of a godzilla movie
Jun 8 2019,negative,its like they spend all of their budget on hiring actors and the cgi teams then had a highschooler who took ap film to write the story it feels like the writer literally went through a checklist of things that they want to include in the story line and present the themes in the most obvious way possible the sheer lack of common sense and excitement makes me feel like watching a kindergarten production wish i can give negative stars here
Jun 8 2019,positive,great special effects plot holes but overall very cool
Jun 8 2019,positive,amazing movie all around non stop action well written and multiple times you feel emotionally connected to the titans 
Jun 8 2019,positive,loved it ive been a godzilla fan since the 90s difficult to have both a story plot and huge monster fight at the same time but they did well
Jun 8 2019,positive,the family drama messed it up a little bit the didnt use mothra as good as they could have the monsters were cool the people were stupid the previous movie was better
Jun 8 2019,positive,great summertime movie we need more of these yes it makes no sense but its enjoyable tons of action good story 
Jun 8 2019,positive,great action 90 monster fights hell yah i would buy 100 more tickets
Jun 8 2019,positive,i felt some of the actor choices could have been better also some of the dialogue seemed off
Jun 8 2019,negative,terrible  enough said
Jun 8 2019,positive,big rambunctious and epic are three things i wanted out of this film and boy did i get them the script does suffer from being predictable and the characters can have confusing motivations but man did the monster fights win me over as a godzilla novice i had a really fun time watching this and think people are being to harsh on it 
Jun 8 2019,negative,thin plot line very loud battle scenes were basically just noise and light the motion was so fast you couldnt really see anything i dont even recommend wasting time watching it on tv
Jun 8 2019,positive,some really epic monster brawls im so ready for an encore
Jun 8 2019,positive,i enjoyed this more than the first one
Jun 8 2019,positive,a little bit boring in the middle part of the movie but a very nice experience
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was an awesome monster movie visually stunning the kaijus were absolutely awesome and well designed if you want to go watch a monster movie with stunning visuals and awesome monster fights this is for you the movie is godzilla king of monsters and it lives up to its title dont watch if you dont like monster films
Jun 8 2019,positive,action packed awesome movie m8 must see
Jun 8 2019,positive,the plus side action from beginning to end the down side action from beginning to end great movie but it was a bit fatiguing to watch
Jun 8 2019,positive,this was exactly the godzilla movie ive been waiting for a real tribute to the original bw movies and captures a lot of their charm only knock i have on the movie is that it was a bit heavy on the human dialogue would have liked to have seen more of the titans
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was so fresh absolute must see    in a more original opinion it was great i enjoyed it as a fans but i dont think you would enjoy it as much as i do if you werent a fan of big monsters movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,i loved it i think it brought the story line together and gave some preparation for whats to come 
Jun 8 2019,negative,i hate the familyi hate them
Jun 8 2019,positive,the entire saga has survived on unoriginal plots so anyone who says the storyline is overdone doesnt know what theyre talking about   my only complaint is that godzilla looks fat
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was exactly what i wanted from godzilla and frs we loved it
Jun 8 2019,positive,fixing the orca was a longshot but special effects of all the monsters fighting was awesome mostly good plot and characters fun monster movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,great action and cgi was well done but not over done
Jun 8 2019,positive,lets be real took my family watched this for the kaiju action nothing more  we all left with biggest smiles and eager to watch it again
Jun 8 2019,negative,noisy too dark and bad screenplay 
Jun 8 2019,negative,very disappointing it lacked any emptional connection however a small child in the audience 3 or 4 loved the movoe
Jun 8 2019,positive,lots of action and lots of monsters
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was amazing absolutely one of the best monster fighting movies i have ever seen
Jun 8 2019,positive,i really liked the movie very good and very well composed the monsters looked amazing and the cg is great 
Jun 8 2019,positive,this movie is everything it is supposed to be if you are a godzilla fan then you will enjoy this film immensely i really dont understand the negative comments about this movie it is a fun movie to watch definitely worth the price of admission 
Jun 8 2019,positive,first the good godzilla king of the monsters is a dream come true for fans of the toho godzilla franchise or simply just monster movie lovers you go to this movie to see incredible monster fights and boy it delivers that and then some the monster designs were impeccable the action sequences perfectly choreographed the music was excellent sending chills down my spine upon the arrival of every creature the sound design was on point making you feel the sheer force behind every movement of the monsters the scale of the movie worked for some reason the human scenes worked about as well as the old toho movies while exposition heavy and not nearly as emotional as they wanted to be they did their job this is godzillas world after all isnt it this movie is one of the best monster movies ever made simply because of the beauty creature design and lovingly created fights themselves all that said it is not a perfect movie godzilla king of the monsters works on every level as a modern godzilla flick it does not succeed on being an excellent movie though particularly in terms of plot the writing is very subpar it is masked at times by the acting contributed by excellent actors riddled throughout the film but it is still evident the constant exposition dumping hurt the pacing constantly this movie wouldve been helped tremendously by more monsterverse movies being created prior to it it throws too much at the audience all at once for most people to care or fully understand all the potentially fantastic lore it is creating this movie is a monsters avengers movie without the foundational iron man 2 thor and captain america that came before it i cannot help but wonder how much better the story could have been had there been a godzilla 2 3 rodan and mothra movie all teasing king ghidora in the background go see the spectacle for the spectacle you will not be disappointed however on the ride home its hard not to wonder how much better it couldve ultimately have been this is a 910 godzilla movie compared to other movies of the world it earns a solid 710 
Jun 8 2019,positive,brings back the old memories of godzilla back in the day except why better graphics
Jun 8 2019,positive,not bad felt like it could of done more with the story
Jun 8 2019,positive,i think anyone who doesnt like godzilla should watch this
Jun 8 2019,positive,great action and visuals the family storyline was a bit corny but didnt take away from the overall movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,liked monster battle hated the dialouge
Jun 8 2019,positive,action packe  just enough balance between human and titans unlike the first one where it primarily focused on the human spectrum
Jun 8 2019,positive,awesome flick cant wait for the next one
Jun 8 2019,positive,funniest movie of the year  good times good times  that last one was a whisper
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was a great godzilla movie  it was entertaining  a lot monster time  i probably liked this better than endgame
Jun 8 2019,positive,loved it story was a lil off but still went together well
Jun 8 2019,negative,the storm make my eyes blind
Jun 8 2019,positive,most amazing movie i have ever seen and hands down my favorite movie ever id give this movie 10 stars if i could this is what happens when you get people like the director and everyone involved that are fans to make a godzilla movie this is a movie made for us enough said the visuals are amazing the action sequences are perfect and the acting is good obviously most of us arent here for the humans but they atleast get you invested emotionally more than the humans from the first movie and again the monsters are what were all here to see and man did they load this movie with them godzilla perfect tons more screen time this time around king ghidorah is menacing and evil and the best movie monster villain ever rodan is amazing and very scary looking and mothra is a beauty to behold and also the music for this movie is probably the most perfect soundtrack ever made it blends a new score plus recreation of the old school godzilla movie soundtracks bottom line if your a fan of godzilla or a fan of monster movies or even a fan of just awesome visual and stunning action movies go see this movie you will not be disappointed and if your basing your decision to see this movie on reviews read the fan reviews and not the critics the critics could not be more wrong on a movie so do yourself a favor and skip there reviews theres a reason fans and audiences are giving this one 85 instead of the dumb 41 
Jun 8 2019,positive,bought my ticket from amc which doesnt seem available on here yet to verify my ticket ive seen the film four times now and i just want to praise how much love for the godzilla franchise and fans went into this film from bear mccrearys score with plenty of callbacks to akira ifukubes music from the toho films all the way to the callbacks of what makes godzilla great to begin with even if you have never watched any of the japanese godzilla films and are new to the franchise this is still a great film and highly recommend it to all 
Jun 8 2019,positive,the special awesome
Jun 8 2019,positive,the new godzilla is an epic pure blood blockbuster a nice steady pace with the most jaw dropping kaiju action thats ever been displayed on screen meant to be seen on the big screen its everything a life long godzilla fan could hope for
Jun 8 2019,positive,what can i say i was looking forward to this movie for a while it was my movie of the summer however it fell short of creating that nostalgia i was hoping for this of coarse affects my review in that i might have expected too much which almost always bites you in the you know what so with that said i would say the movie had some good moments and good action the monsters carried their load unfortunately i didnt feel that the human actors did their part the dialogue seemed forced and not authentic character progression was almost nonexistent as a consequence you didnt feel connected to any of the lead characters including my man godzilla this was not the case with the first one which had a few human characters and godzilla that you could relate and therefore connect to so if you ignore the actors or better yet watch an old godzilla movie from the 6070s before going to see king of monsters you might be more satisfied with the overall production 
Jun 8 2019,positive,godzilla was an excellent movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,the film surpasses its predecessor improving in several aspects like the battles of the kaijus and the stories of the humans being these better executed  recomended  
Jun 8 2019,neutral,kinda like it btw this page is a clown 
Jun 8 2019,negative,it was so long and boring
Jun 8 2019,positive,you know a film falls short of its potential when the most believable and compelling performances are given by the cginormous lizard moth threeheaded dragon and stilted mammoth in fact if the actors and dialogue were edited out leaving this simply 80 minutes of monsters mashing it could earn an additional 12 star
Jun 8 2019,positive,wont win any oscars but it was a fun time at the movies
Jun 8 2019,positive,movie was a lot of fun great action sequences between godzilla and king ghidorah at the end of the movie i you liked the first you will love this as well must see for godzilla fans only criticism is the attempt in trying to develop audience attachment too human characters makes it a little choppy in middle of the film 
Jun 8 2019,positive,great movie action packed from the beginning to the end
Jun 8 2019,positive,good movie watched it with the family
Jun 8 2019,positive,despite the generic plot and characters the movie combines all the monster action and human drama you expect from a godzilla movie it also contains some of the most eyepopping memorable moments in the series 65year history
Jun 8 2019,positive,the movie is awesome and the criticis are out to lunch     its a monster movie so its already going to be cheesythe only real thing that suckedwas i wish there was more godzilla fights less human drama     dont listen criticsthey wouldnt know whats good for them even if it was spewing blue fire from its mouth 
Jun 8 2019,positive,i enjoyed it action packed and had some great nostalgia to older godzilla movies
Jun 8 2019,positive,dynamite  this was the movie i wanted to see this summer and it lived up to my expectations  the monsters and their fights were fantastic and it embraced the kaiju storyline from toho  will see it again while its in theaters
Jun 8 2019,positive,if you are looking for big monsters beating the crap out of each other this is your flick loved it
Jun 8 2019,positive,hard to find the words absolutely incredible from start to finish
Jun 8 2019,positive,monster action is what im in for the others wants it to focus on humans go watch the 2014 again
Jun 8 2019,positive,was exactly what i was hoping a great monster movie yes the plot wasnt exactly shakepere but so what i cared about the characters and godzilla was amazing i loved how the other monsters harken back to their predicessors so excellently definitely worth seeing on the big screen 
Jun 8 2019,positive,definitely one to watch worth my time and money
Jun 8 2019,positive,the story line was enjoyable a bit clichéd but enjoyable love the monster fights the monsters themselves all looked pretty good it was a good time at the theatre
Jun 8 2019,positive,besides the awful dialogue its very enjoyable hail to the king
Jun 8 2019,positive,finally a great godzilla movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,the human plot is a little awful but the rest of the movie is excellent
Jun 8 2019,negative,do not waste your time hollow earth and aliens no thanks 
Jun 8 2019,positive,a true godzilla movie the human story is always second to the king of the monsters one of my favorite godzilla movies ever
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was everything that i wanted it to be a saturday afternoon monster movie just like i watched as a kid with better special effects 
Jun 8 2019,positive,im a fan of the old movies and this was beyond what ive been waiting for
Jun 8 2019,positive,for a lifelong godzilla fan like me this movie has everything i could ever want long live the king
Jun 8 2019,positive,fantastic cgi good acting good storyline i could care less about a critics opinion youd have to be a dull person to not have liked this film
Jun 8 2019,positive,it was too long  and a little boring but the fight at the end was pretty good
Jun 8 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie ever
Jun 8 2019,positive,a fun monster fighting film the critics complaining about wanting more story probably complained about the 2014 godzilla having too much story
Jun 8 2019,positive,this is by far the best godzilla movie despite the ignorant reveiews done by many famous youtubers i encourage everyone to see this movie it was exciting nerve racking and intese the cgi was beautiful and very detailed
Jun 8 2019,positive,what the story lacked was more than made up for by all the monster melee action trying to develop characters appears impossible when theyre overshadowed by skycraper tall radioactive monsters all in all i enjoyed the movie
Jun 8 2019,positive,good action  classic godzilla movie monsters
Jun 8 2019,positive,dont think of the people because it wss never about the people it was about the monsters so the people that watch movies for the people should not watch it a people that love kaiju and mostly godzilla movies would love this also these stupid critics movies dont need a good story to be good and bet most the critics that reviewed this movie probably never watched it or just watched reviews
Jun 8 2019,positive,fuck the critics its a good movie yall go see it
Jun 8 2019,negative,it seems that all screenwriters have fallen into a trap that they just cant get out of every action movie now has to be the end of the world i remember when godzilla just stomped on tokyo and when superman stopped bankrobbers in metropolis everything is overdone to the point that it is just numbing now this movie is so overcooked that you can smell the charcoal in the theater  attention directors lets just slow it down slow it waaaaaay down try developing a plot for a change of pace
Jun 8 2019,positive,imax just made the whole experience i just really needed more mothra
Jun 7 2019,positive,solid origin story for ghidorah awesome material for later iteration sweet callback to the original thiccc godzilla
Jun 7 2019,negative,godzilla king of the monsters doesnt deliver what godzilla fans want delivered its hard to tell if the monster battles are good bad or indifferent  the entire film is in a world with no sun maybe the filmmakers had to wait until the sun went down and mothra came out the film is too long over two hours and too politically correct godzilla and his monster pals except king ghidorah who is the monster villain are returning from the bowels of the earth i use the word bowels on purpose to save the planet doing away with the nasty climate change wars and other evil elements of the terrible monsters known as humanity for monsters that want to save the world they sure try their best to destroy it  godzilla king of the monsters is the third us try at a godzilla movie please just let toho films make the godzilla movies
Jun 7 2019,positive,loved it big ass dinos killing each other
Jun 7 2019,positive,probably one of the best thought out godzilla movies thereve been  its not an easy thing to write a decent creature feature but this movie tied things together pretty well  special effects looked pretty cool  my main gripe about this movie is the same as every other godzilla movie id like to see more monster battles  even in this one which was good the battles seemed to be almost peripheral to the human story going on around them  nevertheless there are some good monster clashes in this movie  im looking forward to having more of them made
Jun 7 2019,positive,the critics must have watched a different movie than me and my boys   we loved it  style is respectful of the japanese films  
Jun 7 2019,positive,awesome   visuals are amazing  with new caste
Jun 7 2019,positive,i grew up with monster movies and have always been a godzilla fan  i liked the last movie and this is no exception because for this genre i dont need a great scriptjust give me enough plausibility and the most important thing is great clean cgi monster fights  and i got that
Jun 7 2019,positive,hold on to your seats  lots of action  i was entertained the entire time
Jun 7 2019,positive,   why i knocked off half a star if you where a fan of the first of legendarys godzilla you know the flaws of it and the flaws of most modern bombastic action flicks featuring monsterscars with human affectations that humans are usually the worst part in these films ideally youd create something thatd take from the recent fast and furiousgi joe movies and make the humans into cartoon characters running around and not trying to tack on any sort of weighty drama onto them and having it be said characters primary propulsion focus on making them fun to watch first give them an interesting story arc second make any dramatragedylife defining event for the character a mcguffin for his character ark dont make it his character ark now why did i only knock off half a star for a problem that takes up so much of the movie because its rather expected at this point and you still bought the ticket which means you wanted to see the giant monster fights        why did i give it four and a half stars the big lizard fought the other biggerer lizard real good and then they tagged in the moth and pterodactyl and they fought real good too and then the lizards where tagged back in and fought real good and then they had a promo for the big lizard vs the big monkey
Jun 7 2019,positive,the visuals storyline everything satisfied me so much i had to see it twice the deaths in the movie had me shed a few tears wont lie but the action scenes cinematography the battle scenes was great better than end game by far i cant wait to own this on dvd
Jun 7 2019,positive,great combination of classic godzilla with modern cgi awesome ending
Jun 7 2019,positive,great effects but extremely boring i actually fell asleep 
Jun 7 2019,positive,everything i expected for a monster movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,the movie had some good special effects it is obviously not an award winning movie but the story line was so boring i nearly fell asleep i think it was a waste of money probably much better at an imax theater
Jun 7 2019,negative,didnt get to watch the movie due to car trouble may i please have a refund thank you
Jun 7 2019,positive,not a very deep plot driven film but tgen again its a godzilla movie i enjoyed the hell out of this movie and as a godzilla it exceeded expectations there are so many awesome godzilla elements in this film for true godzilla fans 
Jun 7 2019,positive,over all it was a good movie for the subject matter my1 10 year old granddaughter loved it
Jun 7 2019,positive,overall great movie loved the dialog and what they did with the monsters monster zero was a creative masterpiece and omg mothra was amazing if you grew up with these sci fi movies then you will love this one 
Jun 7 2019,positive,visually stunning when the monsters fought but the story was decent at best
Jun 7 2019,positive,loved itlove the originals
Jun 7 2019,positive,an awesome monster brawl definitely worth seeing
Jun 7 2019,positive,for me the greatest godzilla movie of all time and my favourite movie of all time 
Jun 7 2019,positive,just a fun movie to watch the effects were good the monsters were great acting and story weak but its a monster movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,this was a great monster flick  the only thing i was disappointed with was the story of the main human characters  the movie would be better without that distraction  theres enough happening in the movie to create any necessary drama without having to follow a familys drama  again it was just a distraction
Jun 7 2019,negative,absolutely the dumbest movie ever made  almost three hours of my life ill never get back
Jun 7 2019,positive,this is the godzilla movie i have waited most of my life to see if you were a fan of ghidorah the threeheaded monster or destroy all monsters when you were a kid this is the movie for you the special effects bring these monsters to life in a way your imagination did as a child seeing this in imax was a definite plus screw the critics since they cant seem to understand what it means to have fun or be entertained by a movie grab a fellow godzilla fan and enjoy
Jun 7 2019,negative,too loud too long for such a simple movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,the movie was amazing its a mist see for any godzilla fans ignore the critics and see the movie yourself
Jun 7 2019,positive,its a summer movie worth watching its godzilla smacking down unruly monsters put your brain in neutral and enjoy the over the top fight scenes long live the king
Jun 7 2019,positive,ive been waiting for this
Jun 7 2019,positive,fantastic movie ignore the critics just go wacth and judge for yourself you will not be disappointed
Jun 7 2019,positive,whats not to likeit was awesome
Jun 7 2019,neutral,everything that wasnt monsters fighting was horrifically boring  they needed to cut the number of human characters in half add a comic relief character and get one more monster fight in that long boring stretch in the back half of the film
Jun 7 2019,positive,lot of action excellent
Jun 7 2019,negative,very very bad messed up the story and the family struggle was unreal maddison was not supposed to be a part of the movie at all very bad 
Jun 7 2019,positive,great fun if you like godzilla more action than 2014
Jun 7 2019,negative,global warming propaganda claims humanity is a virus genocidal message not suitable for childeren
Jun 7 2019,positive,best godzilla movie since i saw the original in 1954 when i was 8 cant wait for the sequel
Jun 7 2019,positive,cool movie with cool monsters terrible cast
Jun 7 2019,positive,i think it is fine  i jast saw it and the effects are graet  it is a monster movie monster movies rarely get more then 4 stars  but it is quite enjoyable after all
Jun 7 2019,positive,bear mccreary did an excellent job on the score and it is a visually spectacular movie with the monster battles being epic as hell must see movie here
Jun 7 2019,positive,great action movie  love godzilla movies
Jun 7 2019,positive,scrip couldve been better as most expect it given the astonishing visual effects but in the context of typical kaiju campiness it is passable
Jun 7 2019,positive,finally a monster movie filled with monsters  i liked godzilla 2014 but this was so much better mindless fighting  im ok with it
Jun 7 2019,positive,loved it the fights were so good definitely a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat they even remastered some of the original godzilla music which is def a nice bonus for nostalgics
Jun 7 2019,negative,it didnt really hold my interest
Jun 7 2019,positive,would be 5 star if they had left out the propaganda about the environment i dont like paying my money for left wing bs
Jun 7 2019,positive,godzilla king of monsters  initial reaction how do they get a crown big enough for this guy    main characters  mark russell emma russell madison russell a family of scientists played by kyle chandler vera farmiga and millie bobby brown    plot summary  this movie takes place shortly after the 2014 godzilla movie  scientists are looking into the discovery of several large creatures that lie dormant all over the world  but emma wants to revive some of them because of her scientific vision  however more of the creatures come to life than at first thought and they start fighting against one another to see who is the strongest of the bunch  one particular monster has everyone talking  the large lizard creature known as godzilla  many believe that he is the one that can protect humanity from all the other kaiju creatures that are running rampant all over the world    scoring  main characters  these three are really bland and boring  just take any three scientists and plug them together and you get these three  whats even worse is that i have to root for the teenage girl madision because shes a teenage girl  score 4    supporting cast  the action shouldve centered around these guys  the kaiju monsters like godzilla and mothra  when they are on screen they are fun to watch  but thats not for very long  score 8    plot  all the kaiju action sequences are a joy to watch but to get to those scenes youll have to slog your way through more than an hour of boring scientists doing boring sciencestuff with a tripped out tablet  score 5    originality   the humans in the film come straight out of any disaster movie  they are that bland  but the kaiju creatures are interesting enough to give it a bit of freshness  score 7    violence factor  there is a whole lot of destruction created by the kaiju monsters and madison survives an attack on boston while shes in boston is because  shes a main character  really  score 6    other moral issues  this film tries to talk about how humans are destroying the world and must be contained but i found it really annoying why anyone would unleash really powerful really large creatures that are there only to unleash mass death and destruction  and i found it odd that they tried to make godzilla and mothra a romantic couple  what do they do on a date  score 5    final score out of 60 35 score 5833  love the kaiju  hated the humans  
Jun 7 2019,positive,fun movie enough human interaction to carry the plot and actual monster fights if you liked the original movies you will likely enjoy this
Jun 7 2019,positive,exactly what it should have been
Jun 7 2019,positive,this movie was the best movie i have ever seen i highly recommend you watch this its more badass than a tom cruise movie
Jun 7 2019,negative,boring and predictable nothing new and the human plot line was flat out uninteresting
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was like reliving my childhood it brought back memories of saturday afternoons in front of the tv watching the classics with my dad i even teared up a little when i heard mothras song
Jun 7 2019,positive,as an old godzilla fan i thought the monster action was top of the line i also loved the new take on rodan as he really felt like a clever bird enjoyed this far better than any of the pacific rim movies only downside is that godzilla needs to get on that tread master a little more  what have they been feeding him
Jun 7 2019,positive,its a godzilla movie  amazing special effects subpar plot  needs more uninterrupted fight scenes
Jun 7 2019,positive,the people villains are unconvincing and there is some cornball dialogue everything else amazing   its a stunningly beautiful film the kaiju have a ton of personality the score is phenomenal and the acting is always great   best of all it has that deeply weird streak that you see in the toho films stuff like human military tech being crazy advanced the location of godzillas lair and the backstory for zhang ziyis character are exactly the sort of strange i want out of my kaiju films  i adored it
Jun 7 2019,positive,all around fun movie much better balance between human and monster action its not perfect it does have some flaws with the script and story choices but its not enough to keep you from enjoying this movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was epic the visually of action was amazing but story was alright just need to be a bit better    i recommeded all of you to watch for the expericense and entertaining  
Jun 7 2019,positive,great monster action the human angle brought the film down but i do recommend this movie to anyone who is a godzilla fan or even thinks he is a godzilla fan
Jun 7 2019,positive,sequel was better than the first enjoyed the environmental hints realization for us human beings on this earth we should protect it if we expect it to maintain us as a race

Jun 7 2019,positive,this movie did what a movie should doentertain in a big way the monsters looked amazing and colossal the fighting was epic the human element was true to the original japanese movies simple and about the monsters will be watching again 
Jun 7 2019,positive,ok ı just finished watching big g and here is what ı think    first of all holy fuck it was the greatest fucking shit i ever seen    second if any soul thinks movie is not good   go die in a atomic hellfire
Jun 7 2019,positive,the action in this movie was fantastic the tension was intense and was felt in the majority of the movie and it was quite entertaining but the movie suffered because of many subplots which made the movie a mess of entertaiment and the payoff at the end did not feel like it was worth the build up of the entire movie at the end the movie was quite entertaining but the story felt like it had not come to a conclusion and that resulted in a quite unsatisfactory ending
Jun 7 2019,negative,ill start by saying i wanted this movie to be good it wasnt in fact if the wife hadnt been sitting next to me i would have walked out some of the characters were so annoying that i found myself rooting for the in this case the bad monsters
Jun 7 2019,neutral,the best thing about the movie was the monster fights could have cut about a half hour off runtime 
Jun 7 2019,positive,awesome godzilla action
Jun 7 2019,positive,fuck what yall say its everything i wanted

Jun 7 2019,positive,saw it in 4dx three times cant get enough of this movie the visuals and sounds are amazing 
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was a pretty good movie but not nearly as good as the first one this one was too much about the people and less about the actual monsters the action was really good though
Jun 7 2019,positive,this was great visually the characters were very forgettable you see a lot of old faces from the previous movie but no one really left a big impact however when it came to the monsters fighting its so cool i feel like the fights were sped up which is unfortunate because they were very entertaining and i would have enjoyed them a lot more if they were longer a lot of great visual moments the monsters were outstanding they looked awesome there where a few times that the visuals had me saying whoa thats awesome not the best cgi but not the worst over all good movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was very interesting to see how humans thought of offsetting the balance of nature by releasing the other godzillas opponents but as always he cane through with the help of humans of course action packed thrilling imagery was flawless thank you
Jun 7 2019,positive,lots of action no dull moments its exactly what i wanted from a godzilla movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,fun popcorn flick with awesome special effects
Jun 7 2019,positive,this movie was dumb entertainment for me and on that level it was pretty great  but only because all of its cliched story threads and unbelievably moronic human characters took a back seat to all the super awesome monster punching contest that i actually wanted to see
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was amazing the jump scares the endless monster fights lord it makes me wanna see it again

Jun 7 2019,positive,this movie took me back to when i was a kid just way better special effects  better storyline
Jun 7 2019,positive,the reason why i gave this film 5 stars is because i had so much fun with the film and enjoyed the ride it took me on and it gave me what i wanted is a good kiaju movie with awesome special effects the monster fights are so so good and for a godzilla fan thats all i go for to see yes the scenes with humans was all great but i still enjoyed the film for what it made for is the well designed monsters and fights when i saw the film i didnt see what the so called critics was talking about the film i enjoyed it for what it is and its real blockbuster godzilla movie not like the crap they tried to feed us back in 1998 now that is the worse zilla movie but this film has heart and a great message like every godzilla movie has your not there to watch the humans you are there for godzilla battling evil monsters michael dougherty did a great job in capturing the monsters and the lore you can tell that this was made for the fans and i hope he gets to do another film
Jun 7 2019,negative,visual effects for the most part was amazing sadly they spent no time with the cheesy dialogue that fell short reminded me of the venom movie dialogue its definitely an entertaining film but it was very hard to stay serious when some of the dialogue was just ridiculous maybe worth one time watch as a godzilla fan growing up in japannothing will ever reach the pinnacle of godzilla vs destroyah
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was the best movie since the 2014 film ive been a godzilla fan since i was a child this movie live up to my expectations

Jun 7 2019,positive,more big monsters no monologues wanted the people to die faster so i could see more monsters
Jun 7 2019,positive,always didnt want to see this movie coz i was confused why they had the girl from stranger things in it  then the movie started and i was hooked i mean  it was cheesy and predictable at times but it flowed well and the special effects was impressive i love how they linked it to to king kong when they mentioned skull island so we can be ready for the king kong vs godzilla showdown go see it  its a great summer movie  
Jun 7 2019,positive,if you wanted godzilla you get him here go watch the movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,just fucking get all those useless humans to be casualties or food godzilla is a godzilla movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,this film is focus on the monster not the human lol
Jun 7 2019,negative,i love godzilla but it was a struggle to get through this movie the storyline was weak predictable and way too long my husband and i both fell asleep a couple of times during the movie there was just too much going on i enjoy actionpacked movies but this was overstuffed for no reason at all with that said i still love godzilla and king kong
Jun 7 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie i watch so far very realistic and good storyline i especially love the arctic fight scene really shows the size of king ghidorah
Jun 7 2019,positive,absolutely a great movie
Jun 7 2019,negative,sigh how to describe this    if the only thing you like from the godzilla movies is the kaijugodzilla fights and dont likecare so much for human dramathen you are gonna be disappointed because thats what you are getting in fact theres even more drama and less kaiju moments than the previous movie and yes there are some decent moments but the way the movie tries to shove the humans down your throat whether you like it or not is annoying and its like that through the entire movie     even during the kaiju fights they find a way to put the humans in your face every 5 seconds     its like they dont want you to see godzillakaijus they want you to see the humans even though the movie is called godzilla
Jun 7 2019,positive,good movie although highly disappointed with the lack of other monsters too many mini scenes eluding to old fan favorites not much delivery
Jun 7 2019,positive,lots of action with all classic monsters and stuff too much you mention
Jun 7 2019,positive,definitely a good sequel to the first one a must see before the clash with kong
Jun 7 2019,positive,godzilla is the king
Jun 7 2019,negative,a mess bland characters who spoke in sound bites and shaky camera work whenever the monsters appeared
Jun 7 2019,positive,the story was kind of shit but the actors do the best with what theyve got had some cool fight scenes especially in imax but ultimately wasnt that satisfying
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was everything a godzilla film should be and anyone who says its a bad movie doesnt understand the genre  
Jun 7 2019,negative,too much talking in the movie if you read the reviews they were right on point  when godzilla was actually fighting though pretty good fighting scenes but as always there were never enough andor too short
Jun 7 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters    pros awesome monster fights ghidorah in his full glory is truly terrifying some pretty spectacular humans working with godzilla scenes    cons human stuff doesnt come off great some of the fights are dark and hard to see    overall im pretty happy with it just for all the monster stuff ghidorah alone was worth the price of admission and i got way more than that while i feel some of the human stuff could have been better and feels like it almost was where that fails didnt really take me out of the movie too much its still a pretty good time at the movies    grade b
Jun 7 2019,positive,was nice could have been just a little more monster fights
Jun 7 2019,positive,all monsters are great best to watch in theatre
Jun 7 2019,positive,best action movie ive seen in 2019 better than infinity war and some others i loved how they used the original theme songs and ha some bice play backs of the good old gozdzilla movies i was was just so astonished of the whole movie the good heavily outweighs the bad  
Jun 7 2019,negative,i actually fell asleep part way thru yes there is explosions and monsters but bad story script was almost as bad as game of thrones last season acting was okay the worst part about it was there was no leading character in the movie who drove the movie no emotional connection to any character no sadness no happiness no yes parts no hope parts no anticipation i was like yah ummm okay meh i could get the same effect watching 4wd monster trucks crushing other trucks they spent all their money on cgi and they had a little left over for the actors i was a little annoyed leaving the theatre thinking i wasted my time i had more expectations when that millie bobby girl was cast but the script didnt do her any justice could have been so much better
Jun 7 2019,positive,movie was way more than i expected dont expect band in depth review from me because i am not that type of person growing up and being mesmerized by godzilla was amazing and seeing the 2000 version made it even better skip to 2014 i believe and the reboot came about and i got excited all over again after came shin godzilla which was amazing as well  when kong came out and watched the end credit scenes i was jumping out of my seat that this monster universe would finally make a return ive seen the japanese versions of godzilla after seeing this movie the emotions of being a little kid and rushing to blockbuster came back tenfold i can safely say that both the 26 and 8 year old me were extremely happy that out favorite monsters came back to the big screen the cinematography cast everything baas amazing some parts were a bit cheesy but im not complaining overall it was an amazing movie for all you old school fans the fight scene will want you have more
Jun 7 2019,positive,godzilla was a badass and the special effects were amazing
Jun 7 2019,positive,great battle great song long live the king
Jun 7 2019,positive,this movie is awesome cant wait to see more
Jun 7 2019,positive,i thought this movie was ok overall the plot has a very been there done that feel to it but i cared about the characters more in this one than i did in the previous two american remakes and the acting is pretty good all around as well the monsters play a bigger role in this film than they did in the previous film and there are some really awesome fight scenes with the monsters my only gripes are that the story really wasnt all that good and the movie drags on about 30 minutes too long but other than that this was a fun movie and if youre a fan of godzilla i think youll enjoy it 
Jun 7 2019,positive,the action scenes were epic but the human characters lacked so much
Jun 7 2019,positive,a new concept of why godzilla was even on earth as well as the rest of the titans very good plot with twists and even some stunners great special effects
Jun 7 2019,positive,is it a great work of art  no  is it a fun summer action flick  absolutely  come for the giant monsters stay for bradley whitford being sassy
Jun 7 2019,positive,good for me  godzilla fan no drama just fight
Jun 7 2019,positive,was casually looking forward to this after seeing it 2x now godzilla king of the monsters has become one of my favorite films this yearand inspired me to seek out some of the old films and lore 
Jun 7 2019,positive,great movie nice plot twist
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was action packed fun and enjoyable it was not boring and is connected well to its roots
Jun 7 2019,negative,the movie is cinematic garbage i predict it will be used in film schools as a prime example of how not to make a movie the human dialog is reminiscent of jar jar binks in star wars episode i the phantom menace its not that there should be humans with a dialog its that it shouldnt insult the intelligence of the audience as with other recent movies in the superhero realm the use of cgi is completely over the top scene framing is abysmal film editing is atrocious in the action scenes particularly with repeated quick cuts producing a chaotic incomprehensible frenzy instead of rubber suit monsters beating each other up its cgi monsters bashing each other welcome to the monster version of the wwe with orchestrated choreographed fights in which none of them will ever die so they can go on to fight again in the next movie and the next and the next and the next one after that its an attempt to create a godzilla monster universe patterned after the marvel cinematic and dc extended universes the goals of which are mostly cgi characters thrashing each other for two hours to wash rinse and repeat ever year more often if possible with the monsters forget about humans in fancy superhero suits just use cgi check your brain at the door its better if youre braindead when watching this human waste landfill fire excuse of a movie last but not least wear hearing protection if you value your longterm hearing the damage is a cumulative effect emerging later in life im going to start taking a sound meter to record the sound levels im tired of leaving theaters deafened for several days afterward
Jun 7 2019,positive,as a big gojira fan watching all the toho movies this one was fantastic it really scratched my itch and more dont listen to the critics this movie is a lot of fun and exciting 
Jun 7 2019,positive,awesome godzilla movie looking for awardwinning plot eh this movie isnt for you but thats never the point theres enough story to move it along and has the best action pieces which as we all know is the real reason were there all hail the king
Jun 7 2019,negative,horrible plot movie all over the place
Jun 7 2019,positive,i really think this is the best kaiju movie ever made the storyline might not make sense to those that didnt follow godzilla series the moster fighting sequence is really good 
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was okchi was actually realistic
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was awesome   it could of been a longer showing
Jun 7 2019,positive,visuals were incredible ghidorah looks scary and the threat feels real if youre in it for the monster fights see this movie  if youre in it for the human story youll probably leave disappointed the overall story is decent but the execution is awful the dialogue is written lazily and the motivation of the mother constantly feels unclear first shes a good guy then a bad guy then a good guy does she want to cure the human disease or does she want to save humanity pick one  i wont spoil the after credits scene but im very hyped for the sequels
Jun 7 2019,positive,great movie for godzilla fans everywhere
Jun 7 2019,positive,a quintessential monster movie you get exactly what is advertised it is not a thing mans movie but if you are able to suspend your disbelief even temporarily the movies fast pace and impressive visuals will help you maintain that suspension until the end
Jun 7 2019,positive,great monster fighting scenes
Jun 7 2019,neutral,monster were great story line was weak
Jun 7 2019,positive,the giant gap between what the fans think of this movie and the paid critics is amazing goes to show how disconnected they are from movie goers and their reviews taken with a grain of salt
Jun 7 2019,positive,everything you want from a godzilla movieepic monster fights
Jun 7 2019,positive,i am glad i do not listen to criticsin the end their opinions are pointless meaningless and selfserving
Jun 7 2019,positive,michael dougherty set out to make a movie that pays tribute to the godzilla myth and he succeeded with ghidorah rodan  mothra  added it is worth it to sit through for the big fights even if you arent a fan of the stock human characters but then again what good is a godzilla film if it cant have an enjoyable b movie kick to it
Jun 7 2019,neutral,dumb fun about 30 minutes too long
Jun 7 2019,positive,movie was awesomelong live the king
Jun 7 2019,positive,the humans story was okay and what their motivations are were made clear it just came off a little silly since it had a infinity war type of vibe with that said though this is a godzilla movie and we all came to see godzilla fight other monsters not to hear about the human troubles godzilla and all the other monsters look great and the fight scenes are amazing so for me that makes this move a must watch if you are a godzilla fan
Jun 7 2019,positive,vfx work is fantastic  and story is amazing also millle boby browns acting is awosome 
Jun 7 2019,negative,not entertaining  acting was weak with no character fevelipment
Jun 7 2019,positive,every monster fans should watch this movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,great movie if you like the classic toho style of movies this is for you draws most of its nostalgia from the period from 1985 up to 2000 story is good enough your typical illogical decision making but it serves the plot lets be honest though its godzilla we are ok with some pretty wacky plots p 
Jun 7 2019,positive,my kids and i loved the movie it was awesome
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was a great film you need to see it in a theater hope this franchise wil  carry on
Jun 7 2019,positive,this was by far the best godzilla movie yet the monsters looked great perfect actually special effects fantastic sound track excellent the human drama is well balanced with all the monster action godzilla fans expect  did the critics even watch the movie i am going to see it again but im disappointed that its not offered on imax here totally recommend this movie especially blue oyster cult fans and stay until the very very end credits there is a jonah easter egg great job legendary
Jun 7 2019,negative,trite action film  little plot only  a succession of monster vs humans and monster vs monster battles
Jun 7 2019,positive,loved it good to know the king is alive and a great tribute to the of creators
Jun 7 2019,positive,lots of great action
Jun 7 2019,positive,a movie for true godzilla fans full of easter eggs and nostalgic music it suffers from poor characters with lame jokes but makes up for it in epic monster battles
Jun 7 2019,positive,it brought back childhood memories of the syfy creatures i grew up watching
Jun 7 2019,negative,never saw it because you never will refund nor reimburse a gift card so you failed miserably
Jun 7 2019,positive,when you are into kaiju films you cannot pass up on the king
Jun 7 2019,positive,loved it many nods to toho and the original godzilla movies some nice hidden gems
Jun 7 2019,positive,full of great monster goodness this isnt an oscar winner type film but i love it the fights and lore are fun to watch i dont think the critics rating this movie know how to watch movies for enjoyment based on their terrible reviews but the fans have spoken and the vast majority say the enjoyed it if you like kaiju or monster movies watch this movie 
Jun 7 2019,positive,top 3 godzilla movie ever for sure good callbacks too 
Jun 7 2019,positive,great movie the action was great and very entertaining true not much of a story line but action makes up for it and i love action 
Jun 7 2019,positive,not as good as the first one but still fun and entertaining
Jun 7 2019,positive,fantastic   simply amazing
Jun 7 2019,positive,best american godzilla movie ever
Jun 7 2019,positive,excellent movie  great visuals and setting kaiju fights are epic as are their designs and expressions could have had more monster fights but it will suffice mothra was absolutely stunning and was designed fantastically
Jun 7 2019,negative,complete and utter crap the story arc is laughable they attempt to create meaning and depth where there is none i would pass on this pile of garbage if i were you 
Jun 7 2019,negative,hot trash  im really not impressed by flimsy scripts that are just looking for excuses to make these cgi monsters fight each other  and im sorry but every actor in this movie was awful  f
Jun 7 2019,negative,tedious boring overly long
Jun 7 2019,positive,went to see kaiju fighting kaiju and boy did they deliver

Jun 7 2019,positive,tons of action fun movie for sure
Jun 7 2019,positive,with fantastic monster action and excellent visuals godzilla kotm is perfect for any godzilla fan  
Jun 7 2019,positive,this was exactly what true godzilla fans could ever ask for  monster rivalry human drama a secret weapon and of course mothra in all her legendary glory so many easter eggs  and nods to the toho franchise made modern with awesome cgi
Jun 7 2019,positive,awesome monster flick they went all in and it was far better then i ever expected it to be id go see again in the theater
Jun 7 2019,negative,i fell asleepthat should be enough
Jun 7 2019,positive,loved it  gonna see it again
Jun 7 2019,positive,this movie was so beautiful i was almost moved to tears at time its not shakespeare but anytime a monster is on screen it made me feel a child like sense of awe bright colors excellent cinematography a fantastic score call backs to earlier movies its the godzilla movie i never knew would be made its hard to even describe how much i loved this movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,overhyped too big
Jun 7 2019,positive,going in right direction more monsters and less people still
Jun 7 2019,positive,loved this movie so glad to see that the sjws didnt jump on this one to ruin it long also 2 hours  and very litle slow time
Jun 7 2019,positive,an excellent recovery from the disappointment of its predecessor decent story paying homage to the originals but it was the strong cast that tied everything together as one who grew up loving the original creature features this is the first i can say i really enjoyed
Jun 7 2019,positive,not enough godzilla kicking ass
Jun 7 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is one of the best films in the kaiju genre the action was amazing the story was pretty good and the human characters were actually tolerable and it is really annoying when a bunch of critics go in and see the movie insult it and past films and give an extremely biased review which is accepted her on the tomatometer 
Jun 7 2019,positive,its definitely creaking in the dialogue and plot department but i dont care i didnt go to see shawshank redemption  monster version its massive spectacular often cheesy but super entertaining i got exactly what i expected giant monster breaking stuff and beating the crap out of each other 
Jun 7 2019,positive,i thought this movie was a total let down i have it three stars becuase it wasnt a total disaster but from a different standpoint it was bad when you label a movie king of monsters why is half the movie have to do with people it couldve been way better if it had more monsters in a time managing sense also i feel as godzilla is very weak its getting boring with him getting a power up to get through the final battle on a key note the battle scenes were a touch and go last note is that they shouldve had king kong in this movie to set into prospective what the next movie has in store im more interested in king kongs part than this movie 
Jun 7 2019,positive,absolutely loved it the director is brilliant mixing todays big hollywood expectation to the everyday moviegoer but was very respectful with multiple nods to the original godzilla movies from the monster looks the original music and other easter eggs that will appease those fan boys amazing
Jun 7 2019,positive,definitely a huge step up from its 2014 predecessor a lot more kaiju action than expected and the human drama was not a drag
Jun 7 2019,positive,for a monster movie it was awesome
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was amazing  one of the best movies ive seen in a while
Jun 7 2019,neutral,not enough of the big guy
Jun 7 2019,negative,  usually movies have some unique interesting dialogue and you figure out the plot as you go  but the dialogue in this movie right from the start sounds so comvinently cheesy as if they were reading the plot of the movie nothing is left to the imagination the movie is also filled with plenty of tolkien character in order or represent the diversity quota
Jun 7 2019,positive,absolutely amazing totally wont be disappointing for fans 
Jun 7 2019,positive,so much fun great visuals plenty of action loved the nods to skull island and the original godzilla movies  
Jun 7 2019,positive,best monster movie in my life i waiting for kong vs godzilla

Jun 7 2019,positive,your typical predictable movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,a fantastic godzilla movie that deserves more support than what it is currently receiving listen to the audience and go is it for yourself while it may be far from a masterpiece of cinema it is far more fantastic than what the critics are saying about it besides after certain recent events on rotten tomatoes are you going trust someone who gets paid for their opinion or the people just want you to have fun  
Jun 7 2019,positive,this is the best monster movie in decades 
Jun 7 2019,positive,this film was very disappointing   im a huge godzilla fan and was excited to see a good hollywood version with great special effects this was not the case with godzilla king of the monsters way too much time spent in the control room listening to clunky one liners absurd military strategy and vapid family drama
Jun 7 2019,positive,i have loved godzilla in all his ludicrous glory since day 1 ive seen every movie multiple times and this is one of the best word of advice dont overdo your expectationsits a monster movie and things arent going to make sense just sit back ignore the plot surrounding the people and let the monsters entertain you if you look back almost all of his movies with a good plot line focus on godzilla antagonizing humanity and humanity dealing with how they ultimately created him this movie isnt trying to do that they are big monsters just duking it out the real treat is the homage to all the previous movies it honors from showa to the hesei to millenium era     i couldnt get enough of this move but i didnt go for the rousing theme i chose to go in admitting the whole monster movie genre is corny to begin with the effects were great the music was so nostalgic i got giddy and the fight scenes actually did a great job making you ache for just a little bit more each time but not leave you hanging either  
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was sooo good i think it was better than the 2014 version
Jun 7 2019,positive,fun story and action
Jun 7 2019,positive,def a must see  there are several main kaiju both good and bad guys as well as several guest kaiju appearances  imho the best of the western hollywood godzilla movies so far  it was also good to hear the familiar roar and theme music from the original godzilla movies
Jun 7 2019,positive,loved all the easter eggs totally geeking out throughout the whole movie
Jun 7 2019,negative,i fell asleep 3 times so boring worst movie ive seen so far im 2019
Jun 7 2019,positive,the story is simple straight forward and easy to understand but most people come to godzilla king of the monsters for another reason big monsters battling against each other with giant explosions let just say they did not disappoint me at all the whole fight is breathtaking the camera work managed to show me the dynamic of each titans appearance and actions i can assure you this is what i expect from a godzilla movie 
Jun 7 2019,positive,visually amazing 
Jun 7 2019,positive,good movie over all godzillas rival looked more animated than the other monsters though
Jun 7 2019,positive,definitely directed towards godzilla fans like myself a must see if you love godzilla   
Jun 7 2019,positive,action and suspense all the way

Jun 7 2019,positive,freaking phenomenal lots of easter eggs to the original movies
Jun 7 2019,positive,meh acting was pretty boring and bad and so was the story line but we come to these movies to watch monsters fight which we got a lot of good action from
Jun 7 2019,positive,godzilla 2014 critic complaint not enough monster action  godzilla kotm too much monster action its dark the humans are boring it lacks a deeper meaning    deeper meaning what were you expecting schindlers list levels of depth      tldr ignore the thumbsucking critics this movie was amazing 
Jun 7 2019,positive,excellent monsters a little too much people
Jun 7 2019,positive,first i have to say i like this better than the previous godzilla film in the previous film the people annoyed me in this one the cast is better however their role in the film is just questionable i kept asking what are you doing and then when i figured out why they were doing what they were well smh ill just leave it at that the actual fight scenes between the monsters were awesome its just how we get to those fight scenes the explanation behind it all is unbelievable the message that drives the story has been used before and it never works i dont think it will ever work and the movie seems to be aware of that which means the writers needed to think of a different driving force that leads to the fight scenes
Jun 7 2019,positive,great kaiju film intense in all the right places gotta put up with human characters but thats par for any kaiju fan 
Jun 7 2019,positive,movie was great threatre was not there was no leg space between the rows so the movie watching was uncomfortable thank goodness the movie was so good

Jun 7 2019,positive,the human characters were boring iam giving 3 stars for the epic monster fights and why the hell is godzilla appearing from nowhere everytime when ghidorah is about to kill someone mothra was amazing
Jun 7 2019,negative,just an horrible effects driven film with no real story or any real acting awful
Jun 7 2019,positive,a really good an entertaining movie the special effects and the battles were awesome    long live the king
Jun 7 2019,positive,a huge lot of monsters and throwbacks to the originals and the human characters are about enough luckily it spends more time with the big lizards that with the tiny apes its overall a really fun movie to turn off your brain for about 2 hours 
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was exactly what i wanted from a godzilla movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,the monsters are spectacular and worth the price of admission there were also some nice plot callbacks to the original films from the 60s and even the 50s the humansmeh but the sound volume started at 11 and stayed there and that made for an unpleasant experience bring earbudsearplugs just in case your theater has similar acoustics    this will sound like an odd criticism for a godzilla film the special effects were at times preposterous and underwhelming too much action takes place at night andor in the rainnot a good sign there are certainly aweinspiring soontobe iconic scenes but they are too few and buried in a lot of murky incomprehensible action
Jun 7 2019,positive,visually stunning in every shot  
Jun 7 2019,positive,amazing destroy everything 
Jun 7 2019,positive,awesome monster movie with great visuals and great sound
Jun 7 2019,negative,this movie was all over the place horrible story line
Jun 7 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie it truly captured the might size and spectacle these creatures are suppose to have  any time the monsters were on screen i got goosebumps this movie captured the spirit of what the original toho  movies created
Jun 7 2019,negative,the idea of seeing a childhood movie was exciting  fight scenes intense  actors great but plot build up  the family dynamics were truly unnecessary  just made me want my money back  somebody really dropped the ball
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was the craziest battle i have seen godzilla fight i enjoyed the movie so much that i want to see it again the human story was mediocre but i didnt go see godzilla for the human story lived up to my expectations
Jun 7 2019,positive,glad to see they stayed more true to the japanese version of godzilla it had its moments where i rolled my eyes but overall it was still entertaining
Jun 7 2019,positive,best godzilla move ive ever seen wonderful special effects great action scenes okay acting but lets be honest people dont go to this movie to see awardwinning acting skills they go for the king
Jun 7 2019,positive,wanted to see other titans more but great movie overall
Jun 7 2019,positive,truly a piece of art hearing children coming out of the theater talking about their favorite monsters warmed my heart as a long time fan 
Jun 7 2019,negative,i liked the monsters but wanted to punch the human characters in the face especially vera farmigas character  i felt like the movie had political motives and i get enough of that on tv daily and i certainly dont want to pay to hear it i go to the movies to escape not to be lectured 
Jun 7 2019,positive,this is a great movie visually stunning and entertaining
Jun 7 2019,positive,its exactly what you expect its gonna be and way better than pacific rim 2
Jun 7 2019,positive,if youre going to say godzilla king of the monsters you already know what it is enjoy
Jun 7 2019,positive,amazing movie yes the human character development is not great but this is a monster movie this movie pays homage to the old godzilla movies wonderfully the music the story even some of the characters are a direct link to the old characters from the 60s and 70s go see it for yourself
Jun 7 2019,positive,the cinematography was stunning some of the shots look like epic paintings good balance between people and monster action the fight scenes were extremely interesting to watch warning there are a lot of flashing lights scenes  otherwise i adored this movie i loved the fighting and cgi i would watch this a second time
Jun 7 2019,positive,great special effects
Jun 7 2019,positive,great movie for all godzilla fans cant wait to see it again
Jun 7 2019,positive,one of the best to the series great way to live up to the legend
Jun 7 2019,negative,its tough to put a story into spectacle and yet without somewhat of a decent story spectacle has no substance like its predecessor this version of godzilla suffers from lack of story and engaging chatacters cliches are abundant and the monster battles and appearances are not much better than what you may find in video game cut scenes godzillas powerset is inconsistent in one moment he is weak in the next 20 minutes he is strong then blue and weak then red and strong its all over the place with no explanation the geography of the fight is lacking as well all these movies need to take a page from john wicks book on how to do great spectacle while still maintaining semblamce of story
Jun 7 2019,positive,an open love letter to japan faithful to the original godzilla movies loved this avtion filled movie 
Jun 7 2019,positive,the movie was awesome the action was perfect with enough dialogue ignore what those snobbish movie critics say
Jun 7 2019,positive,epic movie i cant wait to see the sequel
Jun 7 2019,positive,perfect godzilla movie lots of references to king kong  the critics of the movie are clearly not godzilla fans lol
Jun 7 2019,positive,i like when all the monsters fighting
Jun 7 2019,positive,as someone that has seen all 33 godzilla movies this one is by far the best  godzilla king of the monsters is going to establish itself as a fan favorite it gets the kaiju right and it lets us see a lot and i mean a lot of the monsters   the special effects are fantastic keeping up with the quality of the 2014 film its an awesome feeling to see so many classic kaiju brought together on the big screen with the amazing digital effects i mean no disrespect to the guys in rubber suits in the past    a great story and lots of excellent giant monster action the film gives us a huge scene  with a huge monster  within its first few minutes   this godzilla movie is walltowall with the monsters  they include the classic godzilla players mothra rodan and the very nasty king ghidorah all with designs that call back to their toho origins while also looking fresh and basically fantastic as for godzilla as we saw at the end of the 2014 film he is firmly on the side of good ready to battle these creatures alongside humanity    the battles are some of the best done of any monster vs monster battle    godzilla king of the monsters is a big expensive action movie lots of skyscrapersized creatures beating each other up  all you need to know is that when the big boys come out to play things get destroyed they blow up people die in large numbers the monsters fight each other they go nuclear what more do you need to know       i have seen the movie twice once in 3d once in 2d  i preferred the 2d version  when i saw the 2d version i went with 3 other people who had never seen a godzilla movie they all loved it    if youre a godzilla fan you will love this movie  if youre not a godzilla fan you will be
Jun 7 2019,positive,fantastic addition to the franchise  its 2 hours of giant monsters giant monstering each other  theres humans and a small plot about helping the earth or something but who cares about that  this movie isnt called hippies savior of the planet  its godzila king of the monsters  it should feature godzilla  and monsters  and someone becoming a king  an dit delivers
Jun 7 2019,positive,the movie was absolutely amazing for me the monster action was incrediblenot gonna spoil there were at least 34 when the monsters were fighting that made my mouth drop and there was definitely more monster action than godzilla 2014 unlike most people i think the characters were alright many people say that they are cheesy and that what they say is so unrealistic but i think that they are just exaggerating the story was also fairly decent and was pretty decent to follow the only actual problem i had with the movie was that it would get really shaky sometimes when the monsters were fighting but i mean thats one bad thing out of so many things they did well i like how they were building more of the monsterverse lore by going into the monarch sites with monsters and when they were traveling through the ancient ruins in the end it is the best movie ive seen in 2019 and one of the best movies ive seen people just have to remember that godzilla is a different type of genre the story was alright the characters were good the soundtrack was great the lore building was pretty interesting and the action was epic 1010
Jun 7 2019,positive,the acting and dialogue may have been forgettable but if youre sitting in the theater about to watch a godzilla movie for the acting you dont know what youre doing anyway so i will just say this is one of the best godzilla movies because it actually features godzilla for longer than most of the other ones the special fx are amazing and the battles are gigantic with plenty of huge moments five stars prove me wrong 
Jun 7 2019,positive,great action with all the monsters some human parts were a bit boring but over all great
Jun 7 2019,positive,who wasnt too bad it was a lot better than the other ones were lot of action packed i even for
Jun 7 2019,positive,watched it in imax worth it 
Jun 7 2019,positive,although the script wasnt the best i came to see this movie for its monster battles this movie definitely delivered those monster battles
Jun 7 2019,positive,seeing four of tohos big five kaiju was an amazing spectacle to see hearing godzillas iconic roar in the theater made me shake in my seat with excitement and watching other monsters bow to their king was worth watching
Jun 7 2019,negative,story line felt forced and awkward  some characters were poorly developed  monster fight scenes seemed silly at times
Jun 7 2019,positive,the characters were a little lacking but overall loved the movie especially the monster fight scenes was one of my favorite movies so far this year
Jun 7 2019,positive,the movie is awesome but only if you are a true godzilla fan  the monsters origins and the way the look especially mothra which is a favorite of mine music score was unforgettable as was the battles highly recommend if a fan of godzilla  not godzilla fan you wont understand most of the movie recommend watching the old godzilla films by toho    
Jun 7 2019,positive,great special effects
Jun 7 2019,positive,so good watched it twice
Jun 7 2019,positive,whatever the critics say do not listen to them this movie was phenomenal for what it is listen a godzilla movie doesnt need a great human aspect the critics need to realize that a godzilla movie needs a lot of great action which the sequel to the 2014 movie does godzilla king of the monsters has fantastic and much more action and yeah the human aspect isnt great but at least that doesnt ruin the movie so when the critics say the movies bad because of that theyre wrong because there was much less humans in this movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,excellent visuals great fight sequences godzilla killed it eleven was awesome norma bates and coach taylor were solid and tywin lannister played his role very well would recommend 
Jun 7 2019,positive,i loved it and made me remember the original godzilla the movie had awesome fights and used all the best part of the original godzilla movies
Jun 7 2019,positive,the movie was ok its hard to apply logic when you are watching a monster movie human characters just made bad decisions throughout visuals were good imax was a great picture amc 5 tuesdays were made for a movie like this 
Jun 7 2019,positive,great movie but it cut off in theater for about 20 minutes with no hey were working on it or anything
Jun 7 2019,positive,amazing movie you must stay till the very end of the credits
Jun 7 2019,positive,it did bring me joy and was watchable but if you are not a kaiju fan i wouldnt recommend it overall review good
Jun 7 2019,positive,its godzilla back on the big screen we all need to look past its so called faults and reveal in what it is a cinematic masterpiece each fight scene was satisfying and left me and the group i was with in the edge of our seats its worth watching for any true godzilla fan its also a great introduction for new fans to get hooked on this monster verse
Jun 7 2019,positive,not enough mister fighting 
Jun 7 2019,negative,it took a while to get the plot going and the scenes were so crazy and fast moving that you really couldnt see the creatures until the last part of the movie
Jun 7 2019,positive,great summer popcorn film
Jun 7 2019,neutral,long boring by the end you have long been looking at your watch not caring who wins in the end fight scenes were short and original as in just like the originals 40years ago i had trouble keeping my brother awakelol  acting was great  though the story waswell it just wasnt good it looked good visually if your twelve you will love this movie if you are creepy collecting weird godzilla trinkets for the last 30 or 40years and smell you will love this movie comparing it to its kind while much lower budget pacific rim was easier to watch  a difficult film to sit threw for the normal person sorry
Jun 7 2019,negative,the action sequences were marvelous stunning special effects cliche plot twists and uninteresting story arc worth a watch at home but not in theaters 
Jun 6 2019,positive,exciting movie monster fights were great could have benefited from less human side of story and more kaiju battle length
Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie was definitely action packed and kept us on the edge of our seats i highly recommend and i cant wait to see it again
Jun 6 2019,positive,exactly what you would expect godzilla fights king ghidora and rodan mothra comes along for the ride
Jun 6 2019,positive,finally godzilla is the good guy about time
Jun 6 2019,negative,has to be one of the worst films ive ever seen in theaters the plot was devoid of reason and the actors couldnt rise above it
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was excellent from beginning to end
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was an awesome movie al the titans fighting each other and all cgi was great but the human characters mehhh they just was there for explain and make some dumb and unecessary discussion the only character that do all good was the dr serizawa
Jun 6 2019,positive,best way to see it is in the dbox seatsi think it would have been a little flat without it  but im a fan of godzilla so i enjoyed it 
Jun 6 2019,neutral,this movie was predictable  the special affects were not so special  reminds me of the old movie godzilla
Jun 6 2019,positive,a movie packed with awesome on screen effects and epic sized fights godzilla kotm takes advantage of every possible scenario to pit monsters against each other and thats what audiences came to see a movie of titanic proportions big fights and a humbled human race that can only observe and hope for the best while huge beasts decide who is the one king to rule them all
Jun 6 2019,positive,exciting lots of action
Jun 6 2019,positive,i liked the action in the movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,awesome just what a modern godzilla should be more kaiju and less human struggle
Jun 6 2019,positive,the monster fight scenes were awesome loved the movie score
Jun 6 2019,negative,too loud too long too many monsters
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie was awesome  me and my son enjoyed it soooooooo much
Jun 6 2019,positive,was one of the best movies ive seen in a while long may he reign
Jun 6 2019,positive,fanservice and giant monsters fighting to the death what more could a kaijugodzilla fan want
Jun 6 2019,positive,the nearly perfect modern godzilla movie fresh and relative while paying tribute the the classic toho feel
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved it see alot more kaiju and i think the execution of the plot with the humans and kaiju is great i enjoyed the plot and to me this is a perfect example of story first and not pushing an agenda something i am glad the movie stuck to there is the whole environmental push in the movie but it fits the narrative and once again i did not feel they were using the movie as a platform  they stuck to what makes godzilla badass monster fights 
Jun 6 2019,negative,so youre showing me movie about a giant radioactive lizard fighting a three headed dragon oh yeah and they both breath radioactive fire and electricity respectively how did you make it boring    we all expected king of the monsters to follow a certain path that almost all godzilla movies have and when i realised 5 minutes in that this one wouldnt i was happy i was excited to see what would happen in a fresher take   after about 20 minutes i wished theyd stuck with the tried and tested formula   the human characters with the exception of tanaka are possibly the most dull ive ever experienced on film this film managed to make charles dance dull that in itself is impressive   with absurdly backwards character motivations a star lead in millie bobby brown who doesnt actually achieve much and an irritating and downright cringeworthy science group king of the monsters becomes a film that you endure the people for the fights     the first of which is mediocre and wasnt substantial enough to serve ghidorah a decent enough reveal   the other two are visually astounding they are the usual screaming screeching slobberknocker that we expected but will always enjoy     unfortunately kotm is let down wholly by the human contingent and should have focused far less on a strange family subplot and more on the big beasties fighting 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the monster battles were cool but the humans were cliche and boring
Jun 6 2019,positive,wasnt into the family that is the center of the movie but the monsters and supporting cast were fantastic theres plenty of monster fighting to go around if youre a fan of godzilla
Jun 6 2019,positive,amazing cgi amazing sound but the story was not as good
Jun 6 2019,positive,none stop action and fights
Jun 6 2019,positive,movie was paced well and packed a punch really enjoyed the twist of the ancient civilization where godzilla was a king all in all a really good action movie 
Jun 6 2019,positive,this is exactly what fans asked for after the last godzilla bigger monsters more fights and more godzilla no political bullshit just a good old fashioned monster movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,too many critics over analyzing a story that doesnt need to be there the movie does fine with the plot it has without becoming overly complicated or forgetting the heart of it badass kaiju fights the visual effects are stunning the easter eggs are a pleasant return to the series and they somehow were able to modernize giant monster fights thats i have only seen since the first pacific rim this is a great edition to the godzilla franchise and truly makes me excited for the monsterverse
Jun 6 2019,positive,i gave 5 stars not because its one of the greatest movies of all time but because this is one of the best godzilla movies ever the people who made this movie actually watched the old godzilla movies before doing this one so sit back relax and enjoy watching a monster movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,they finally made a true godzilla film like the ones from japan thats not for everyone and its not perfect but its glorious and a lot of fun
Jun 6 2019,positive,this is a good movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,if you like this type of movie then its a must see
Jun 6 2019,negative,for a monster movie there sure was alot of talking
Jun 6 2019,positive,visually incredibly impressive 
Jun 6 2019,positive,its a monster movie amazing imagery average plot line and character development
Jun 6 2019,positive,very very huge improvement from the 2014 movie a lot of action and good storyline and finally great monsters
Jun 6 2019,positive,an interesting film for a monster movie the film isnt propaganda like most movies are currently no big bad guy and super good guy just two groups who want to do the right thing and have different ideas on how to achieve that     also the monster summoning group are ecofascists which is a weird and new extremist group in a movie although twelve monkeys had a similarly motivated villain
Jun 6 2019,positive,great story and we loved the special effects its come a very long way since the first film
Jun 6 2019,positive,great movie i dont understand the critics rating but either way godzilla ii was terrefic 
Jun 6 2019,positive, always been a fan of godzilla since i was a kid
Jun 6 2019,positive,ii moves slow and the huge battle sequences blend together but you dont go see a godzilla movie expecting anything else it passes the time but not by much my 15 yr old son fell asleep at one point so a nap may be a better investment
Jun 6 2019,positive,miles better than the 2014 version
Jun 6 2019,positive,as a longtime godzilla fan it had everything i wanted tons of fan service the monsters were done right and the human story didnt distract too much from the real point of the movie  the monster fights
Jun 6 2019,negative,agreeing with critics on this one plenty of action but the story and dialogue was bad there was so many plot holes and cheesy one liners for it to get anything better
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was perfect for a godzilla film best movie ive ever seen in theaters as far as visuals and sheer size godzilla himself was amazing king ghidorah stole the show millie bobby brown was fantastic
Jun 6 2019,positive,great high points great monsters  a little lite on story but fun for the whole family
Jun 6 2019,positive,if you are a godzilla fan and looking for a fun 2 hours this is a film for you characters are much more likable and flushed out and overall written better godzilla gets his fair share of spectacular scenes this time around 
Jun 6 2019,positive,great visuals and monster fights
Jun 6 2019,negative,like the godzilla movies of my childhood 70s this movie is all pay no attention to the plot its rather dumb  look at the cool monster fights on that level it works visually great but otherwise very bland 
Jun 6 2019,positive,all the rest of these ratings are bull this was the best movie i have ever seen everyone in the theater were wide awake and were amazed at the sights of the wonderful titans i dont understand how infinity wars would be more interesting then this this had me on the edge of my seat the entire time fantastic movie i recommend it to others and in my opinion its more interesting than infinity wars i feel asleep during infinity wars but i was wide awake for this
Jun 6 2019,positive,i dont know why people arent okay with the film i throughly enjoyed it i wonder if theyll make another film with some of the monsters that didnt show up
Jun 6 2019,positive,really enjoyed godzilla always has been one of my favorite cant wait until kong vs godzilla
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie was the best godzilla movie i have seen so far primarily because computer graphics are so advanced the monsters look great and i thought it had a good story line  there was plenty of suspense
Jun 6 2019,positive,good movie really enjoyed seeing godzilla and rest of those titans
Jun 6 2019,positive,a great movie for a godzilla fan if you want to see monsters fight the movie will deliver it to you
Jun 6 2019,positive,okay this is godzilla it does not need to be perfect to be a must see are there problems i have with it yes while the previous one took too long to have him appear overall i liked the gravitas they gave to the movie this movie lost that to an extent and id like to see some of the seriousness put back in for those of us who arent 10 years old however it had all the monsters i wanted and i think i can forgive some of the screw it lets make it over the top the filmmakers had because its a giant radioactive monster fighting other giant monsters the japanese ones are far more absurd and i love those they should return to the more grounded nature of the first movie because if i want full on absurd ill watch the old japanese films despite my criticisms i still had a great time seeing it and want more so go see it and just appreciate it for what it is its not meant to be an oscar award winning film so go into it expecting big fights with monsters and have fun
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was fun the human plot could have flowed better in my opinion but it was still fantastic
Jun 6 2019,positive,much better than its predecessor still needs more godzilla and less family drama
Jun 6 2019,negative,its bad real bad not just as a dramatic film but also as a simplistic dumb action movie its not even good as a godzilla movie    full spoilers    i walked into the theater with my expectations pretty low i thought godzilla 2014 was a decent monster flick with some great moments that was dragged down by mediocre pacing and a lack of focus despite this it knew how to use the monsters and how to use them well     godzilla king of the monsters does not follow this trend the monsters are used poorly the very first thing the audience hears is a godzilla roar which ends up being a sign of the lack of restraint of whats to come the chief complaint of the previous movie was that there was too little godzilla and the new movie tries to remedy this with more monsters and more scenes dedicated to them this would be fine if the monster scenes werent done so incredibly poorly that the only thing accomplished was the active stripping away of anything that made one of these monsters so special to see the previous movie took less is more too far but now this one goes too far in the other direction to the point where there is no tension or drama that results from the monsters presence or absence     there are three major fights in this movie godzilla v ghidorah in antarctica rodan v ghidorah v godzilla in the ocean and godzilla  mothra kinda v ghidorah  rodan kinda in boston the antarctic fight is disappointing the camera focuses mostly on the unlikable cast of human characters and any shots of the monsters we see are too muddled and noisy to make out any details im not sure whos decision it was to set the scene as a blizzard at night but it did not help with any clarity that was left after the questionable cinematography the ocean fight was mostly rodan v useless human characters until ghidorah and godzilla arrived and tussled again not much focus on the actual fight and when the camera is on them its going above and below the water with splashes and bubbles everywhere for about five seconds at a time not as bad as the previous fight but still pretty boring the final fight in boston does a decent job of building up expectations  the first worthless human character arrives probably 30 minutes or so before the monsters throw down and it is to the benefit of the conflict the fight itself reminds me of the bvs fight with doomsday in all the wrong ways all noise and no substance at least the camera is on the monsters for most of the fight and its possible to tell whats going on sometimes     the human characters are worthless as previously mentioned many times theyre even more unlikable than ever and seem to have more screen time than before at least it certainly feels like it i cannot remember a single line spoken that either was not a cliche or didnt make me wince this would be fine if they didnt have such a massive focus in the movie seriously if i had to ballpark it its like 7525 humans to monsters     the more i think of it the more i realize that this may actually be the most soulless movie ive ever seen not a single character is likable not a single line is even decent not a single shot is stunning or breathtaking and i doubt a single ounce of creativity went into this movie the visual effects were decent but a definite step down from last time the cinematography was shit the action was about as entertaining as smashing action figures together the characters were both terrible and pushed into the spotlight far too much the sound nearly made my ears bleed and the art direction gave me a headache if you wanted a wellmade engaging drama then keep looking but thats hardly news not many come to a godzilla film for drama but to see stuff blow up and some nice monster action but let me make it clearif you are in this camp theres a good chance youll be disappointed godzilla king of the monsters is a bad movie a bad action movie a bad monster movie and a bad godzilla movie     stay away 
Jun 6 2019,negative,godzilla king of the monsters is a boring contrived movie that doesnt have many positives besides the beautiful cgi and the soundtrack being ok some of the performances i might add were not terrible at all but the writing for the characters is not very well developed so you are not invested in what is happening to them in the theatre i could barely muster enough patience to finish this movie but that is because i have never been a fan of the godzilla franchise if you are a fan of godzilla youll probably enjoy the monster fights but for the general audience stay away and watch another movie instead
Jun 6 2019,positive,great movie it brought back old favorites and even brought back the first way godzilla was killed in the original king of monsters
Jun 6 2019,positive,alright people i have been a godzilla fan for a long time and let me tell you this movie was amazing and the making of this film pushed the limits of cgi i didnt care for the 1998 film and the recent one that came a few years ago was okay but this was great ignore these critics of rotten tomatoes 
Jun 6 2019,positive,as i came to this movie for awsome kaiju battles i was not disappointed with it on that front with its top quality cgi and memorable monsters this movie is chalked full of fan service and i recommend it to all godzilla fans 
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is everything you would want in a godzilla movie if you signed up for intricate plot lines and stellar human character development i have to believe you have never seen a godzilla movie this was about monsters clashing against other monsters larger than life battles and planetary destruction the titans looked amazing and the cinematography was on point go see this movie 
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla is a beast
Jun 6 2019,positive,lots of action and cool creature fight scenes acting was a little low budget and the storyline was basically non existent but it was a fun movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved this film perfect for every godzilla fan dont listen to critics
Jun 6 2019,positive,everything a godzilla movie should be and more
Jun 6 2019,positive,absolutely brilliant film goofy story line but all godzilla movies are like that 
Jun 6 2019,positive,love the movie seen it three times now and still want to see it more all i want in a godzilla movie came true more monsters and less humans dont care about the story of the humans i just care about the monster long live the king
Jun 6 2019,positive,just to be honest i probably would have waited until this was released on dvd to watch if it wasnt for my teenage daughter so i went in with no expectations i thought the movie was okay didnt hate it or love it my 13 year old liked it and she normally doesnt get into godzilla movies
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved the battle scenes along with godzilla being revived in the ocean
Jun 6 2019,negative,great visual affects good overall story had a lot of dumb parts to cater towards giving the actors screentime
Jun 6 2019,negative,story line and effects ok the flow really sucks no logic to times and distance
Jun 6 2019,positive,awesome how it got tied back to skull island
Jun 6 2019,positive,great movie excellent in imax format excellent rendition of the classic saturday monster movies end credits with potential of another
Jun 6 2019,positive,i just want to say that i loved this movie their was so many things good about it it was really neat to see all of the monsters be more alive than just men in suits like king ghidorahs heads interacting with eachother and the cgi was spectacular all of the fights kept me at the edge of my seat and the humans were pretty good for a kaiju film as well each person had their own motivation or personality so overall i loved this movie and cant wait to see it again
Jun 6 2019,positive,i honestly could of gone the rest of my life without seeing this movie but at the end of the day im happy i saw it 
Jun 6 2019,positive,love this movie it was my second time watching it in theaters
Jun 6 2019,positive,good monster film and a good way to pass the time reasonably good cast nothing special but nothing bad either good monster battles increased my enjoyment and made me glad i went to see it no need to see it opening week best to wait for the tickets to reduce in price
Jun 6 2019,positive,tells you something when critics and audiences reviews are so different critics are supposed to be our guides to what audiences like but they are way off godzilla is a monster movie what do you expect from that i expected exactly what they delivered action and distraction 
Jun 6 2019,positive,good if you just want to see mosters fight not for story line or acting but if you love godzilla its good
Jun 6 2019,negative,no story line just monsters fighting
Jun 6 2019,positive,king of all monster
Jun 6 2019,positive,a perfect giant kaiju movie godzilla rodan king ghidorah and mothra looked like the originals but with a modern twist and of course the best cgi available the story is little off but godzilla and the fighting carried the movie cant wait for the final installment in the monsterverse kong v godzi
Jun 6 2019,positive,good action packed movie with good effects and good acting
Jun 6 2019,positive,screw what the critics say see it for yourself and make your mind up its great movie godzilla delivers it will have you cheering at the end
Jun 6 2019,negative,really poor overall  i actually think panto is less predictable than this film  
Jun 6 2019,positive,visually awesome  as a huge fan of the godzilla genre this one keeps pace with the others  you have to have some perspective before you watch any godzilla film  its a movie about a giant monster not the bicycle thief  with that being said it hold the beast up to the standards he i am assuming its a he even though no gender reveal is every done deserves and introduces some of the best of the godzilla antagonists
Jun 6 2019,positive,wow  it was an awesome movie to see there is a great storyline with humans you just have to actually watch the movie and pay attention there are those going to see it without understanding what a monster movie is and are especially clueless about what godzilla is a guy stood up and the end of the movie and announced to the theater  what the hell is that all about i was very happy when another person shouted out you are a clueless man watch  a godzilla movie before you come to a remake and then post a bad review this movie is amazing i happily am passing the love of the genre and for the king onto my children and my grandson cant wait for the next one
Jun 6 2019,positive,the mosters are intimidating the moment they appear on the screen they really feel like giants in a world of ants  using objects most people seehave seen helped scale their massive size the story of the main cast can feel a bit cliche or predictable at some points but it still stays strong from beginning to end if you like godzilla or giant monster movies this is a must see  
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved it some may not but i found it good i went in and loved it definitely  gonna buy it on blu ray but some may just be interested for other reasons me ive been a fan  since i use to be able to watch the films when blockbusters  was a thing and those movies were a bit silly here and there at times lol there many movies that been out since it late 1950s movie that launched it first film  but for this one dont go in expecting you get best story it depend on the person many dislike it some like it some dont care and just love the monster cgi unlike most of other film this one continues from 2014 movie many of older one just continues from something random or from the very first film just changed up many times  i loves movie regardless 
Jun 6 2019,positive,great action and sound was awesome
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it just a good fun monsters fighting movie cant wait for the mext one a must on the big screen imax if you can
Jun 6 2019,neutral,great monster movie but story was meh
Jun 6 2019,positive,so the human storylines through this film are boring plain and simple however the monsters are amazing it is no oscar winner but it is what i paid for i came to see a monster throw down and it delivered im excited to see what comes next in kong vs godzilla 
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved this movie it had the beautiful charm of a to the point storyline it gave us classic monster brawls it brought so much nostalgia from the originals into play i loved it so much a true homage to the godzilla classics i grew up with a great ost sound track and beautiful cgi just a great movie all and all i suggest those who grew up watching godzilla to go bring your childhood back and watch this movie long live the king
Jun 6 2019,positive,dont really care what critics say the general audience has spoken and its great at the end of the day i like it very much i went to see godzilla fighting monsters and thats what i got unlike the 2014 film in which godzilla is rarely in the film
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was awesome and nostalgic
Jun 6 2019,positive,a magnificent godzilla movie and one fans have been waiting for so many moments of majesty within sequences that are stunning obvious affection has been given to the godzilla legacy along with some of the best onscreen depictions of the monsters ever the critics  as usual out of touch with what audiences love and what godzilla is all about missed it on this one but lavish praise on the absurdly plotted go back in time and fix it tiredness of avengers endgame long live the king
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was an amazing film of godzilla good fights and tons of action from our favorite kaiju if you consider yourself a godzilla fan is a must see
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was a really good movie very entertaining and well written it wasnt too long either where youd lose interest
Jun 6 2019,neutral,i loved the 2014 godzilla didnt like long skull island as much this latest installment of godzilla is worse than both previously mentioned movies what a letdown it is too long too many people are on screen who are never developed too long to set up too many beasts terrible moronic plot that had me shaking my head and talking to myself the entire movie what a hot mess i left extremely disappointed everything was either dark and rainy or dark  snowing oh  give the creeper from jeepers creepers his wings back also dont have godzillas adversary have basically the same roar as he does its lazy
Jun 6 2019,positive,critics being way to harsh on this movie sure its a little silly but its about a 300ft tall crocodile fighting a 3 headed space dragon the visuals are amazing and the fights are a fun what more do you need 
Jun 6 2019,positive,story script  acting were all horrible the giant monsters fighting were amazing
Jun 6 2019,positive,i saw godzilla king of the monsters last night and it is very good its one of the best godzillamonster films most of the critics are wrong when reviewing this movie but thats nothing new        the monsters all look very good the cgi is one of the best ive seen in movies and the fights are very fun the humans were alright not the best but they did their part and are not as bad as the critics are saying some of them i actually ended up liking and the villains i wanted dead but were good villains       the score for this movie is very good as well they had a lot of the original themes of each monster redone and even that godzilla song by blue oyster cult remixes which i thought was funny       they have characters from godzilla 2014 and kong skull island which makes the world feel more connected and alive      they make references to older godzilla films but you dont need to watch them to understand the movie as they put them in that dont feel forced and you dont need to read the comics of this universe to understand the film either but they do help you understand some things and again make the world feel alive one of the references is that in the original films mothra lives on an island and these natives there worship her and there are these two tiny girls the size of a barbie doll that look identical and i guess connected to mothra telepathically but they obviously thought that was to silly for the monsterverse which it is so they had two twin asian scientists that studied mothra which i thought was a neat reference      some people say that people make stupid mistakes and their decisions dont make a lot of sense but when i watched it about everything made sense to me as to why the villains are letting the titans free as one of them has a tragic past from the first film and that kind of tragedy can make people really crazy and the rest feel that humanity is a disease to the world with pollution and war luckily its only the villains that think this way     some complain that there are too many monster scenes in the movie even though the complaint of the first film was that there was hardly any godzilla scenes so whatever when i saw the film there was less scenes of monsters than i thought still a lot thats not overwhelming and i thought they balanced the human and monster scenes out really well the monsters have their own personalities and king ghidorah each head has its own with the middle one be the dominant one and the left one being curious about things which is a neat detail     there is a post credit scene and man it gets me pumped for the next movie which is kong vs godzilla comes out next year march 13th there are other things in the credits like articles that give you ideas of what happened after the movie and some funny things in the credits that makes the credits a bit more bearable to sit through for the end     this movie does not get political which is really refreshing for a big movie as they have a black female in command of this unit throughout the film and they dont make a big deal about they dont remind you that shes a girl or black so i thought nothing of it which is great you shouldnt be thinking about that stuff unlike captain marvel they had men and women working but is wasnt forced like it was in the last jedi so props to this movie for doing so the only political thing in the movie was that people should be purged from the earth as we pollute the earth and the titans should rule as they were here first but thats only the villains point of view everyone else thinks their crazy thankfully throughout the film i was hoping that the good guys would not agree with the villains or whatever towards the end but that never happened whew      this movie so far is in my top three movies of the year and i give this movie an 8510     fun fact 1 in 1996 godzilla received the mtv lifetime achievement award as well as being given a star on the hollywood walk of fame    fun fact 2 became a japanese citizen in japan in april 2015 and an official cultural ambassador     fun fact 3 there are 36 godzilla films 33 produced by toho  three of which are anime only on netflix and are terrible and the other three are american made and more godzilla movies are on the way there were three tv shows two were cartoons and one uses action figures to portray the kaijus monsters rather than suits not making that one up its weird    this is my first in depth review
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it great monster flick
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie gave us fans a amazing experience throughout the movie it also gave us emotional impact when the doctor we all love sacrificed himself for godzilla 
Jun 6 2019,negative,poorly done for the high caliper actors in this movie very unrealistic scenarios and too much stupid talking the cgi are excellent as usual very disappointed
Jun 6 2019,positive,i really doubt anyone that disliked this movie likes any of the old godzilla films like any of the old movies the humans exist more to further the plot and add a bit more scale to the kaiju then to be compelling characters thats not to say that they dont all have their rolls and personality quirks and the father mother and daughter of the main family do have back story and character growth even if it is some what limited however we all know the real reason to watch a godzilla film is to watch giant monsters duke it out and this one delivers it doesnt do what the 2014 movie did where it would just cut away right as the action started and when it does cut to the humans most of the time the fights are still visible behind or even right on top of them all in all a great addition to the monsterverse and giant monster movies in general
Jun 6 2019,positive,go godzilla  enjoyed the ride  this is a good old fashion monster movie  can not wait gozilla king of monsters vs kong  
Jun 6 2019,positive,super cool movie the three dragon heads monster ghidorah was so amazingabsolutely the best monsters movie so far
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved the monster titan scenes didnt love the family stuff
Jun 6 2019,positive,ok thats good
Jun 6 2019,positive,it wasnt the best story ever but it was full of action and entertaining a really good summer movie with your family
Jun 6 2019,positive,great stupid fun loved it
Jun 6 2019,neutral,needed more fighting 
Jun 6 2019,positive,pretty much everything i could have asked for in a kaiju film i honestly prefer to see humans in these movies lose their cool and react irrationallyemotionally for tough guy types to realise just how puny they really are in comparison for brainiacexpert types to struggle and realise just how little they really know for one its way more relatable massive ancient forces of nature that feed on radiation and were previously worshiped as gods start popping up all over the world only spock could remain perfectly composed and logical under those conditions   thats not to say the story was perfect one expects to see tropes aplenty in any type of action movie yet even for this particular subgenre the russells family drama seemed hastily stitched together
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla has brought back to me what i lost when i watched avengers and game of thrones simply a great movie with everything you will want when you watch it 
Jun 6 2019,positive,it had a lot of throwbacks to the original movies and was a beautifully shot action thrill ride for basically the entire movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,great godzilla movie with lots of monster movie easter eggs loved it  only thing is it didnt need to be 2 hours otherwise it was a good time
Jun 6 2019,negative,its not movie it was physically difficult to watch it
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic it was very action packed along with a good storyline i would recommend anyone to see it even if you have not seen the first godzilla remake
Jun 6 2019,negative,unlike the monsters the humans lacked character depth and the plot was fuzzy and ambled all over
Jun 6 2019,negative,how many times can you have a giant variation of a creature rise from its depths while humans look on awe inspired the answer about 3000 in this repetitive dull poorly acted badly written excuse of a movie there are so many characters its hard to keep up with everyones name let alone care about them not once did i feel scared for anyone in danger and i didnt care when or if anyone died at the hands of the titans the film occasionally tries to break up the awful existential dialogue with terribly timed unfunny jokes followed by a code red the containment tubes are exploding on your six then a monster hits a ship helicopter truck i have never been so relieved when a film has finished and the kajus destroying the world seemed quite an inviting alternative than watching the film 
Jun 6 2019,negative,weak  when i was a kid what was so fascinating and unique was monsters as big as buildings  but after all of the fantastic special effects of so many movies that just seems humdrum now  i took my 10year old that has the same take on it as i do  i actually slept through about 30 minutes of it
Jun 6 2019,positive,awsome everyone favorite childhood memory is presented amazingly with stunning visual and well thought plot love the screentime on titans
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters blew me away its a big bold go hard actionpacked blockbuster with so many awesome battles between the monsters i grew up knowing and loving so not embarrassed to confess that i cried multiple times    the cinematography is mindblowing the effects are so carefully detailed that every shot could be a poster the scoring of the film compliments the movie spectacularly swelling when it needs to and leaning into the emotional moments just as easily    the human story is better than godzilla 2014 if you saw that and werent exactly blown away even if you are not a g fan the film is still an amazing spectacle that keeps entertainment at its core 2 hours of fun which is needed in this depressing era i recommend seeing this film in imax    long live the king up next kong v godzilla in 2020
Jun 6 2019,positive,this was exactly what i wanted from a godzilla movie  i cant love i even loved the nonsensical lines and premise of the human story  the entirety of this movie is a love letter to the old godzilla movies and i could not be happier  considering seeing it a second time in theaters and i really dont like going to the movies
Jun 6 2019,positive,amazing effects the monster fights are everything 
Jun 6 2019,positive,finally get to see ghidorah mothra etc in big budget movie the visuals and the actions are good not the best godzilla movie but its enjoyable it carries environmental message as well 
Jun 6 2019,positive, critics got it wrong yet again
Jun 6 2019,positive,its a monster movie what more can i say
Jun 6 2019,positive,ive seen this movie twice now i am a big godzilla fan and have seen every godzilla movie this is probably one of my favorite godzilla movies of all time there were tons of homages easter eggs and parallels to classic godzilla movies that fans of the franchise will truly appreciate this film was made by a true g fan who respects the classics and it shows my only complaint is sometimes it would do the 2014 thing of cutting away from the action to show the humans i think they did that to save on cgi budget and keep the grounded feeling consistent between films otherwise a perfect kaiju film anyone who loves big monster movies will love it
Jun 6 2019,positive,i understand that the story wasnt super realistic or believable but neither are giant monsters this movie was one of the most entertaining movies i have seen in years isnt that the purpose of a movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,epic titan fights perfect balance between action and drama unlike the first one where it was mostly drama and no zilla if youre a fan its a must see total fun for the whole family
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved the animation  the storyline was lousy  more monsters less people talking  making no sense
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved the movie it was great please show more of all of godzilla movies big fan
Jun 6 2019,positive,i really did enjoy godzilla the only thing i can say i was disappointed in was the fact that it didnt show the fight scenes fully when godzilla would be fighting it would cut to the humans and all of the drama with them sure a little drama would be okay but it cut to them a lot more than needed even in the middle of the fights which was kind of stupid i wanted to see the whole fight and not cut to the humans so much because the fights are awesome as fuck me and one of my friends were actually pretty upset with this its a godzilla movie because its about godzilla plus godzilla is supposed to be an asshole hes not really supposed to be a good guy towards humans either way i was super happy with this movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,deeply disappointing completely undos the momentum and mystery built up by the first movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,if youre a tokusatsu lover youll know that this movie gives more than your expectations
Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie was thrilling with new plot twists and more background info about the monsters origins
Jun 6 2019,negative,dumb seldom fun the kaiju action can be good at times but hampered by cutaways to the human characters providing unnecessary commentary on the unfolding battle further enjoymentdamage is taken by the too often dark visuals and quick cuts of cgi sequences for what its worth my teenage son enjoyed it
Jun 6 2019,positive,if youre expecting a complex story with deep motives perhaps you missed the giant monster on the poster of the movie its called king of the monsters not king of the seven kingdoms and you should be aware of that this is the kind of movie you go to see for the spectacle and by god does this movie provide spectacle at the visual and audio side of things this is one of the most jaw dropping movies ive ever seen and i fully recommend watching it
Jun 6 2019,positive,pretty damn good would have liked less people
Jun 6 2019,positive,enjoyed however could have moved a little faster in spotsbut overall a fun time at the movies
Jun 6 2019,positive,this film was a mixed bag for me but overall i thought it was decent here are the negatives the script for this film is absolute garbage the dialogue is so forced and unnatural that it makes you roll your eyes everytime someone talks which obviously is a large portion of the film the characters are also a huge detriment to the film they dont have any personality and are defined by their one character trait which is a running problem in warner brothers monsterverse unfortunately this one character trait robs the audience for feeling an emotion towards character deaths in the film some of the action scenes arent amazing also for some of the action scenes i cant tell what is going on or who is who because the camera is shaking around a lot one final thing is that i feel millie bobby brown wasnt great in this film i like her in stranger things but i felt like she just wasnt trying here are the positives of the film one major thing is that the sound design sound editing and musical score are phenomenal the film sounds amazing i believe that this film could be an early contender for best sound editing and best sound mixing at the oscars the musical score is just outstanding to listen to most of the actors do a pretty good job even though they were given a terrible script kyle chandler vera farmiga and ken watanabe were standouts from the film the other half of the action scenes are pretty good and its awesome to see huge monsters fighting each other most of the visual effects are really good especially the character designs godzilla ghidorah mothra and rhodan look incredibly lifelike the cinematography is good but its nothing special the tone throughout the film remains consistent and the film is paced pretty well it starts fast and moves from each scene quickly overall godzilla king of the monsters has some amazing sound editing editing and score with great visual effects but lacks a good script or compelling characters i give godzilla king of the monsters a 610
Jun 6 2019,positive,the quality of the movie as well as the battle were amazing however the few downside is not bringing more of the classic monster into this movie and introducing more of the history and origin of the monster overall its a great movie and i hope that there will be more of it in the future
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was just ok visually it was a very dark movie but that was appropriate for the impending doom facing humanity in the storyline  the visual effects were very good  the leading  cast members didnt fit the movie  they werent bad just not the right group in my opinion  the film needed actors with more gravitas and screen presence people who could more convincingly portray the characters and bring the drama i think its worth watching on video or at the discount theater im a godzilla fan and someone who enjoys the theater experience so ill watch the next one in the theater but for most of you watching at home would be fine
Jun 6 2019,positive,intense  godzilla is truly a strong king
Jun 6 2019,positive,very fun spectacle of a film see on the big screen
Jun 6 2019,positive,hands down my movie of the year  cgi was amazing  the fights were awesome   perfect balance of human and monster
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved this movie the action is incredible  the way they weave in the the lore of godzilla is seemless the humor works  the human element of the movie gets you emotionally invested this is what a godzilla movie is meant to be 
Jun 6 2019,positive,picture quality wasnt the best but it was very exciting the whole way thru
Jun 6 2019,positive,by far the best godzilla movie made to date i didnt think godzilla could be so entertaining while avoiding being overlycheesy solid flick the critic reviews giving it between 5060 are completely off deserves at least 80 on this platform
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters i honestly believe the critics were on drugs when they seen this movie in 2014 they moaned there was not enough monster fights now when a movie is full of it they still complain    professional critics i use that term  very loosely are as reliable as michael fishs downplay off a hurricane hitting the uk yet these professionals thought ghostbusters 2016 was the best thing since gladiator they wouldnt know a decent movie if it hit them in the face with an atomic breath blast    godzilla king of the monsters is a fantastic feast for the eyes not just for the monsters themselves but the cinematography as the kaiju or titans pummel each other into the ground    the fan service is incredible combining the showa and heisei eras from toho whilst bringing something new to the table for new audiences its not perfect but no movie ever is although the sheer spectacle alone is worth the admission price    forget what the critics have said the fans themselves are saying a lot different this movie is godzilla in his purest form a force of nature the restorer of balance in nature    long live the king
Jun 6 2019,positive,dont expect a deep story or thoroughly developed characters the monster action and tense moments of narrow escape are refreshing visually stunning a breath of fresh air after the marvel spectacular a couple months ago
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it so much better than the last one the monsters looked great more centered this time not perfect but a move in the right direction 
Jun 6 2019,negative,the kaiju sequences did not make up for a nonsensical plot and annoying characters the main cast was boring and the supporting cast was so large it was impossible to become invested in the side characters this movie could be a great setup movie to what could be an interesting direction to take the kaiju franchise but this installment was so tedious to sit through it was hard to stay awake that being said the kaiju did look impressive and were interesting enough to watch but the beautiful shots from the trailer were underwhelming in the context of the movie my kaiju loving brother liked it though so if youre a fan of big monsters smashing things this might be the movie for you
Jun 6 2019,positive,the story started off kind of interesting but then it had a really environmentalist preachy moment when the villain is explaining their reasoning they even had video clips spliced into their talk to make their point it literally felt like a youtube video on how we are destroying the earth dont get me wrong im proconservation but this was badly done despite that the visuals and fight scenes were stunning there are so many clips that could be used as art on a wall they actually captured some elements of existential horror as well showing how weak frail and tiny humans are in comparison to these titans i would recommend seeing it just for the visuals the story you can take or leave though
Jun 6 2019,positive,easily best godzilla movie ever made unlike godzilla 2014 the king gets plenty of screen time along with all most known titans spectacular in imax dbox and dolby 
Jun 6 2019,positive,i have watched this movie twice and this movie did not disappoint me this movie was made with the intent of honoring the previous godzilla movies while giving them a modernized easy to understand story this movie was fantastic the humans were great as they serve as our anchor to the world of the monsterverse the music was top notch and so much homage to the originals the monsters were presented so faithfully to their japanese sources and how things connect to each other with the right amount of exposition for us to simply understand the movie is just great this movie is a solid 5 stars
Jun 6 2019,neutral,it was good but not great special effects were wonderful human story line a little thin
Jun 6 2019,positive,this is the kind of action i like i love it
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved how they combined parts of past godzilla movies on this one
Jun 6 2019,positive,i thought i wouldnt like the movie but i did
Jun 6 2019,positive,solid b 8510 if youre a godzilla fan you will enjoy it the monsters and effects were great and excited for the next movies in the series with kong 
Jun 6 2019,positive,giant monsters stomping around the worldmovie delivers what was expected and was entertaining  a little dark in the cinematography department but that seems to be a theme with these types of movies
Jun 6 2019,positive,best cg  epic story  best actor godzilla
Jun 6 2019,positive,hollywood finally got it right this is the queen of hollywood kaiju movies and i couldnt be any happier about it the creatures are fantastic the fights are superb and the music thy goes along with them is up to par if youre one of the fans that had always wanted to see a real hollywood movie with top notch special effects about giant monsters murdering the hell out of each other then go and see it at once all hail the king baby
Jun 6 2019,positive,big ass monster fights
Jun 6 2019,negative,terrible movie plot lines everything  was ready to walk out
Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie was so amazing my kids loved it
Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie was action packed  in this one you saw plenty of monster fights unlike its predecessor ive already seen it twice if that gives you any idea of how enjoyable it was
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it great story line great action
Jun 6 2019,positive,good godzilla movie really expands godzilla verse and stays true to all the monsters lore  such 
Jun 6 2019,positive,for the out of touch elitist critics they can go screw themselves  they obviously dont understand what makes a good godzilla movie  i very much think this is the best godzilla movie ever made  mothra was very much a queen
Jun 6 2019,positive,folks this isnt meant to be hamlet i watch all kinds of films btw have been a godzilla fan since watching them on shock theater in the 60s this one is excellent with some great kaiju battles the human element is thin as was with most of the toho films in the day better than the toho stuff from the 70s for sure worth seeing as long as you go in with the right expectations
Jun 6 2019,negative,didnt like it at all the movie was to dark to see and to much fighting
Jun 6 2019,positive,amazing is a really good tribute to toho
Jun 6 2019,negative,although they listened to the problems from the last film about not seeing enough godzilla they completely disregarded everything else that the first film got right most importantly story and characters
Jun 6 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie ever
Jun 6 2019,positive,absolutely magnificent film best movie of the summer blockbusters thus far
Jun 6 2019,positive,while the human side of the story was a bit forgettable the giant monster fights were what we all came for i went to see godzilla take down other giant monsters and thats what the movie delivers if you like big ole monsters ignore the critics they dont understand the fan base
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it  i have been a fan of queen godzilla everyone forgets about godzilla laying an egg and having a son  nowhere in history does a male of any species lay an egg that hatched a baby anything  but i digress  the movie was all i expected it to be and more  the only thing that i didnt recall and wish had happened instead was the stupid looking skinny mammoth thing  what happened to the creatures that were on monster island  the one with the knife edge head the creature with a hammerhead those wouldve been far more awesome than an emaciated wooly mammoth trying to wreak havoc  that being said other than that excellent movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,really liked the movie it was better than what i thought it was going to be
Jun 6 2019,negative,the story line was very weak and i noted that several people in my group including me fell asleep at one point or another during the movie  i really didnt like it 
Jun 6 2019,positive,im judging this movie in comparison to the first godzilla movie that came out in 2014 wow has it been that long ago already    the sequel is heads knees and toes better than 2014s godzilla yet it has a 3985 critic to audience ratio where 2014s godzilla has a 7566 critic to audience ratio and was certified fresh    the critics are getting worse and worse     this is definitely a top 2 or 3 godzilla film where as 2014s godzilla should rank towards the lower tier
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it i disagree about the human characters i felt like the acting was as good as you could hope for in a godzilla movie action packed go see it in theaters
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters  an awkward disaster movie with astonishing visual effects
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was godzilla anybody that grew up watching the original godzilla movies know you are not expecting an academy award winning movie its godzilla he shows up hands out beat downs the end  so this movie was par loved it
Jun 6 2019,positive,we loved it godzilla fans from way back this ones a winner
Jun 6 2019,negative,first one was betterno real plot development this time it lost the cool factor
Jun 6 2019,negative,first one was better 
Jun 6 2019,negative,bad colossal waste of time  
Jun 6 2019,positive,excellent graphics storyline and action
Jun 6 2019,positive,i thought it was a really great monster movie sure it had absurd containment of monster the acting a times was a bit weak but when it came down to monster fights i was more than satisfied i felt like a kid again a kid clenching to the awe of the scale of the monsters
Jun 6 2019,positive,a lot of fun didnt know godzilla was a sympathetic character
Jun 6 2019,neutral,just an ok movie nothing special 
Jun 6 2019,positive,its was kinda of boring
Jun 6 2019,negative,movie dont know movie goes from where to where
Jun 6 2019,positive,wasnt bad couldve been better though
Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie was everything i had been hoping for in this ne era of kaiju cinema a must see for fans of the franchise
Jun 6 2019,positive,this is a fans movie and a deviation from the urge to be philosophically profound in that way id say it becomes profound anyway those who watched the originals will understand 
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla was off the chain great fun edge of your seat action with fully fleshed out world and lore that widened the story from the first one lost of easter egg callbacks to when i was a kid loved it
Jun 6 2019,positive,lotta hate going out about this movie but i was a fan of the order godzilla and other kaiju movies growing up and my kids and i both loved this movie seeing it again asap
Jun 6 2019,positive,action packed  great plot twist
Jun 6 2019,positive,it has all the action you would want and it just an amazing movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,like watching everygodzilla movie there ever was all rolled into one  just what any gfan wants in a movie great special effects with an ending that wheats your appetite for the next chapter  will godzilla fight kong or will it be an epic teamup
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved everthing about i am a great godzilla fan have been from the start hope they make more just as good
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was a great movie i watched it in 3d and it does live up to the hype even though i am not a huge godzilla fan it is still a great movie nonetheless
Jun 6 2019,positive,liked the monsters but not the people
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it nice plot twist
Jun 6 2019,positive,tye rushed plot the obviousness of the end the darkness of the film and the part where the wife died it was unnecessary
Jun 6 2019,positive,perfect just what i wanted to see giant monster fights its what i came for     
Jun 6 2019,positive,a giant upgrade from the previous 2014 godzilla movie  they listened to the audience of wanting more of the kaijus and they delivered beautifully 
Jun 6 2019,positive,i liked it  the trailers did a good job of screwing up your concepts of what happens in the movie  i thought the cgi was really good  there was 1 cheesy part and i think this version of rodan looked like a chicken but hey  he was huge  mothra was really cool too  king ghidora monster 0 had some seriously bad attitude  go see it  better on the big screen  imax would be pretty cool too
Jun 6 2019,positive,if you like simple straightforward special effects this one is the best
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie was as expected great cg made the monsters more realistic it told the stories of the main monsters but was a lil slow at times but then they threw the action in again the movie to me was worth seeing on the big screen for some of the epic battles
Jun 6 2019,positive,a good movie with a different twist  but you have to be old enough to know about the other monsters
Jun 6 2019,positive,too much time focused on the humans in the end but other than that its a great godzilla movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,a true godzilla fans movie the criticism of not fleshing out the human aspect of the movie is puzzling expecting to form an emotional bond with the fictional human charactersin a godzilla movieis laughable its a godzilla movie the majority of true godzilla and other kaiju fans would rather watch 2hr 12min of kaiju kicking the tail of other kaiju whether one on one tag team gang fight turning sides etc with no human interaction than to have any humans in it they are only in there to narrate   now if only legendary can only gain the rights to gamera
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it you need to stay until after the closing credits
Jun 6 2019,positive,the critics are idiots if they think people go watch this type of movie for the plot line  we just want to see some monsters fight each other and blow stuff up doing it this movie delivers  
Jun 6 2019,neutral,it was not the worst godzilla movie ive seen and not the best  parts were boring which for a godzilla movie is kind of hard to accomplish
Jun 6 2019,positive,the fight scenes were well done liked the portrayal of mothra and godzilla relationship was happy that the antipeople people were ultimately shown to be bad folks the main drawback was that despite a couple of passing neutral references to a divine being many times they were just vain name usage
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie was awesome i have never seen a better version of the classic monsters like ghidorah mothra and rodan the people behind this project clearly did their research and all of the big four monsters here are treated with care and respect the motion captures are amazing too it allows the monsters to have the range of expressions and emotions that i never expected them to have     overall a great movie the pacing was fast too and it really kept me occupied this is the movie that i can watch multiple times and can still get excited like the first time totally recommended  
Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie was epic defiantly seeing it again this time in 3d
Jun 6 2019,positive,you people need to stop with the hate because this movie was sooooo lit it had so many cool stuff it yall watch it for yourself
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie was phenomenal
Jun 6 2019,positive,super cool in imax like part 1 but part 1 was better
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla 2 king of monsters its a movie made for fans very good and brillant dont need an overdeveloped story
Jun 6 2019,positive,tons of action fun to watch story doesnt make much sense but that not a reason for anyone to skip this movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,non stop monster fighting action just what we wanted  critics dont know ht 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the action didnt disappoint
Jun 6 2019,positive,really good story  great monster fights
Jun 6 2019,positive,whats not to love had a great time and great spectacle
Jun 6 2019,positive,if youre into monsters that are big and annoying humans its okay i just wish they hadnt killed the characters i liked most the ending felt kind of sudden but i guess this is a part 1 of sorts
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was ok not great i expected more
Jun 6 2019,positive,i absolutely was on the edge of my recliner seat and couldnt take my eyes off the xd screen if the critics are telling you its bad then they are all wrong you will have a fun time from beginning to end every time a monster is on screen
Jun 6 2019,negative,this film was horrendous  always cutting away to the humans when an epic fight is about to break out  i didnt go to see a film about humans and their family problems i came to see monsters fight which we pretty much never see 
Jun 6 2019,positive,monster filled and exciting leaves you wanting more
Jun 6 2019,positive,great movie just needs more godzilla screen time and less screen time for humans 
Jun 6 2019,positive,idc about humans dramas its monsters film  not telenovela 
Jun 6 2019,positive,great popcorn movie special effects cinematography and sound are excell
Jun 6 2019,positive,the story and people i didnt really care much about bar a couple but i was going into it expecting that the visuals are stunning fighting scenes are great and overall was a great watch as long as you arent too invested in the storywhich isnt very hard to do switch your brain off and you will very much enjoy it  
Jun 6 2019,positive,went and saw this with my 7 and 9 year old sons we all loved it great special effects and lots of action
Jun 6 2019,negative,good cgi thats it everything else was dreadful 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie i loved i think if it was necessary the human drama otherwise would not have been possible to understand the story but had to be more moderate and focus more on the kaiju and their action scenes 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie was great fan service as we all came to see godzilla fight monsters and the movie does not disappoint i have seen 3 times now and well worth the watch 
Jun 6 2019,positive,some of the best special effects ive ever seen which goes hand in hand with this type of movie that being said after seeing kong skull island and the 2004 godzilla youre left wanting more from the narrative especially with their focus on the traditional kaiju lore
Jun 6 2019,negative,the makers of this film and its predecessor clearly to not understand the daikaijuu genre they dont understand that daikaijuu films are about big monsters fighting and the humans are incidental instead they spend most of the screen time on humans and the little time devoted to the monsters is visually obscured confused and poorly choreographed
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved godzilla king of the monsters it is pure exciting entertainment 
Jun 6 2019,positive,such a fun tribute to godzilla ive seen every godzilla movie thats come out since i was a kid 1991 and even some before and this is one of the best yet
Jun 6 2019,positive,sound was too loud and the movie plot was just okay
Jun 6 2019,positive,monsters fighting monsters with some pretty decent human interaction in the background everything ive ever wanted from a godzilla movie since i was 5 
Jun 6 2019,positive,it wouldve been a great movie had they not wasted valuable time with the family drama
Jun 6 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie action started right away and the monsters were awesome
Jun 6 2019,positive,so much fun good balance of monster battles and character drama the effects are passable even if its always nighttime but the action is good enough that you dont care
Jun 6 2019,positive,classic godzilla is back
Jun 6 2019,positive,all the good of the original japanese movies without all the boring drama which distracts from big monsters smashing stuff 
Jun 6 2019,positive,so intense wow watching in imaxxd made the movie feel truly massive felt like godzilla was roaring right into my ear awesome movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,only one thing long live the king    it was awesome on imax highly recommended
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla kicks so much ass fantastic fun and for die hard godzilla fans a love letter must see
Jun 6 2019,positive,how can you make an epic monster movie of this amazing scale without over acting  you cant 
Jun 6 2019,positive,action packed with a great cast 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the action was good but the story was flawed
Jun 6 2019,negative,it was ok the storyline needed some more work to put it lightly and at some points i was shaking my head in the theatre because of how unrealistic some things were
Jun 6 2019,negative,not worth the money my friend paid for my ticket  the verizon guy totally ruined the movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,it absolutely stunning a very beautiful movie and its everything that i wouldve expect from a godzilla movie but better
Jun 6 2019,positive,if you enjoy the shōwa aspects of godzilla youll enjoy this film greatly a great film for the fans
Jun 6 2019,positive,its simple monster fight what elise do we want seriusly like a lot of action movies the history isnt a big deal its enough to make you care about te protagonist monsters and thats it simpli but good enjoyable no doubt from me to go once more to see back the movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters did a beautiful job for the godzilla fans 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the cgi is great but the fight scenes were too long and there were too many this director doesnt believe a monster movie needs to have people who you care about in it he is wrong even for a monster movie i wouldve liked a great build up towards a great fight scene but not one that is so long that it takes up half of the movie and puts you to sleep i need to learn something new feel something for the characters and then the situation means something and carries me into it and im rooting for their success i gave it three stars because i like 3d movies and cgi if you like those things then this is a 3 star otherwise skip this one 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie ever
Jun 6 2019,positive,love the action i came to see monster on monster action thats my moneys  worth many times over 
Jun 6 2019,positive,remembering that this is a godzilla movie  it delivers exactly what it promises action monsters fun  ridiculousness i wasnt bored for a moment  was fully entertained  and would see it again
Jun 6 2019,positive,constant action good script
Jun 6 2019,negative,exactly what you get in a summer action film lots of action explosions and destruction  but the attempt by the writers to make us care about the atomic family get it feels maudlin and cheesy
Jun 6 2019,negative,how you manage to make a movie about 1000 foot tall monsters boring is beyond me but they somehow managed it while it does have some good  fight sequences spattered throughout you just cant help but be annoyed by all the human scenes save your money
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie ran dark could of cut out 45 min would of made it tolerable but still a fan no matter what
Jun 6 2019,positive,this film was more fun than engame it felt like an amusement park ride themed after godzilla with loops and sharp turns leaving you exhausted at the end but wanting more 
Jun 6 2019,positive,it shows that the director loves godzilla
Jun 6 2019,positive,the cinematography is at its best with the visuals shots and fights the acting is also really good but the condensed and cut down writing not so much this is a must watch in 4dx at the theatres and nothing will ever compare to it absolutely nothing rememer4dx
Jun 6 2019,positive,love it amazing and epic
Jun 6 2019,positive,monsters fighting its what i paid for
Jun 6 2019,positive,never watched any movie of those before but i really really liked it and my boyfriend liked it more
Jun 6 2019,neutral,let me keep this short and to the point     i agree with most here who say that when the monsters were fighting it was all gravy baby but the plot and the dialogue was bad i hope godzilla vs kong is better but i wouldnt exactly bet the farm on it
Jun 6 2019,negative,suck my balls it was the worse gorilla  movie ever 
Jun 6 2019,positive,ive seen most of the godzilla films and this one is my favorite there is a lot more monster action then the last film but they still used the beasts sparingly and made sure every monster moment had a wow factor i also appreciated that the human story lines were very focused on the monsters the humans had agency and effected the titans my family and i really enjoyed this film outstanding
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters it was a really good monster movie one of my most favorite scenes is the final battle with godzilla and king ghidorah going head to head and spoilers everything was looking bad for zilla and all of a sudden mothra one of my favorite character besides godzilla comes to the rescue and they both team up to fight ghidorah it was just awsome to watch 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie left me speechless it was so good that i cant say anything bad about it the critics only look at the fights and plot i look at the history of the hole franchise of over 25 movies and 65 years of experience they dont know anything about the franchise and dont listen to them the audience is that matters not the critics
Jun 6 2019,positive,pretty good movie lots of action the plot could have used a bit more development
Jun 6 2019,positive,this is a true and faithful adaption of godzilla the critics are entirely wrong about this film it is so much fun to watch and kyle chandler really carries this movie through to the end along with our favorite kaiju of all time godzilla it has its flaws but all movies do this is a must see
Jun 6 2019,positive,they dropped the fbomb with no good reason other than to make it not kid friendly or to try to perpetuate the poisoning of our childrens mindsstupid either way also had some really lame story issues prepare to ask yourself throughout why would they do that how are they not deadetc however giant monsters godzilla rodan mothrajust epic just bummed i cant take my kids to see it stupid hollywood
Jun 6 2019,negative,it sucked what the hell was that about not enough human drama it was 80 human drama 10 exposition with scans 5 explosions and 5 of monster action constantly and violently interrupted by human drama you dont care about metheorology scans and stupid dialogues youve heard a thousand times before in a thousand other movies it was a chore finishing watching it terrible movie 
Jun 6 2019,positive,awesome movie  lots of action we got chills down or legs 5 times 
Jun 6 2019,positive,great for the fights and kaiju story building everything else was pretty bad without the epic cgi monster clashes this movie is no higher than one star but luckily the characters can pass the time relatively fast to get back to the title character
Jun 6 2019,positive,full of action great story godzilla
Jun 6 2019,positive,too dark and cloudy but i loved the monsters
Jun 6 2019,positive,i love how it had more monster history and fights
Jun 6 2019,positive,best godzilla movie ever spoiler alert its amazing good job on the team everyone need to watch this i hope that this movie is a summer hit
Jun 6 2019,positive,was an excellent godzilla movie  lots of great monster fights  and the 4dx was frigging awesome for it 
Jun 6 2019,positive,amazing movie  definitely better than the first one  more monsterv monster action which most people are looking for  rather than the first movie  too much focus on the main character hero which is so boring and annoying where everytime godzilla is going to fight against muto the movie just cut it and go to the mc  which is stupid  soo i hop i can so more movies like this godzilla  king of monsters 5 stars
Jun 6 2019,positive,fantastic movie and spectacular kaiju history

Jun 6 2019,positive,loved the ending  godzillas end fight scene was epic
Jun 6 2019,positive,generally love all kaiju fight scenes human plot a bit pointless but it is typical hollywood this is hardcore godzillas movie and totally worth it for the fun im going to watch it again long live the king 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie is pretty intense the only thing i disliked about the movie is that some of the scene is hard to see due to dark scenery overall its a good movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie had a really good camera quality and it was really emotional i loved it
Jun 6 2019,positive,i do not regret going to see this movie  i have always loved godzilla and this just reminded me of that
Jun 6 2019,positive,special effects were superb editing was a little jerky so the story didnt flownasnqell as it could have noc to see all the old godzilla foes make cameos this one is better than the last effort
Jun 6 2019,positive,the monsters were perfect  best ive seen for godzilla plus love the storyline
Jun 6 2019,positive,what a fun ride mothra was adorable and monster zero was everything he was supposed to be i took a bunch of my friends with me and we screamed and laughed and clapped all the way through i have no idea what the critics are talking about this movie was a blast 
Jun 6 2019,positive,campy silly giant monster fight fun
Jun 6 2019,positive,exactly what i wanted from a monster movie blew my 6 year olds mind
Jun 6 2019,negative,the titan scenes were badass but all the scenes with humans were boring and not at all interesting except for the reviving zilla scene
Jun 6 2019,negative,the film has practically the same story end up debating a lot for the human side and forget the side of the fights between the monsters that would be the interesting story
Jun 6 2019,positive,smarmy scientist was off putting  and why do they only fight at night in bad weather  the explanation is not really stunning but we its a stunning summer cgi fest  i went in with absolutely no interest in the human aspects for the most part  and that thought process served me well
Jun 6 2019,positive,i wanted to love this movie but i just was okay with it loved the scenes with the monsters and that was it unfortunately it spent too much time developing the plot for the humans that i had lost interested on several occasions 
Jun 6 2019,positive,millie brown veras parts were frustratingly terrible but the king made up for it
Jun 6 2019,positive,first movie in 2019 that i didnt need to question if i enjoyed it nor did i have to make excuses for it for myself to even justify it  the human stuff is good and i really have no complaints to it and the monsters are freaking amazing  hands down as one of the best movies of 2019 for me and one of my all time favorites  at the end of this movie i had was left with no criticism that detracted from my enjoyment at any point of this movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,long live the king
Jun 6 2019,positive,great movie great action movie 
Jun 6 2019,positive,the acting was just ok but the action was great
Jun 6 2019,negative,i would of loved it but the acting of millie bobby brown was just awful her character was just unnecessary i would of liked godzilla fighting more than just one monster could of been better but was still good
Jun 6 2019,negative,terribly disappointed  i love godzilla movies   it entirely sure what happened here but dont waste your time
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved itjust dont expect a lot more than really cool giant monsters crushing stuff and fighting  for that its the best
Jun 6 2019,negative,where the heck was gamera  the plot was well ummm  the cgi was mediocre  the movie was meh  but yet there i was on a tuesday morning with my dad  i nearly slept through parts and i slept well the night before and had plenty of coffee to prepare myself  alas i left not let down not was i disappointed rather i went in not expecting much as got pretty much nothing fit through money spent thank god it was an early bird show paying full price would have left me requesting a refund  my wife lisa glover would put it best  ill never get those they abd a half hours back
Jun 6 2019,positive,appreciate the great monster battles
Jun 6 2019,positive,fun popcorn movieseen it twicesecond time better than the first great action throughout special effects were incredible with the monsters in cgi plot line and human character development was just ok but just enoughthe monstrous battles is why you go to this type of movie imo sets up well to kong vs godzilla in march

Jun 6 2019,positive,good action a little long
Jun 6 2019,negative,this movie no good

Jun 6 2019,positive,if you love to see giant monsters fight citys being destroyed and are just a godzilla fan this movie is a must see
Jun 6 2019,positive,i went only for my son he absolutely loved every moment of it i could see through the corner of my eye how he would get excited and get more involved in the movie once a fight scene came on or once other titans came on screen i also felt the adrenaline rush with the fight scenes and with seeing the titans in all their majesty the plot was a bit awkward thougheven a bit cliche at times but overall i thoroughly enjoyed the movie enough to recommend it to others and to watch again my son would give it 5 stars though hes turning 10 next week in case you wanted to get an idea for age but im giving it 4 stars out of 5

Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie was straight up badassif you are a hardcore godzilla fan youll love this movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,if you came to this movie thinking youd get more than just monsters fighting then you need to learn to read this is a godzilla movie and that is what you get you dont go to these movies for plot all the fights were amazing and the humans did a great job dreaming everything around those fights
Jun 6 2019,positive,amazing action packed godzilla movie  a must see for fans of giant monsters amazing
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was pretty good slow times for sure acting was decent not wow factor monsters for sure were very well done story line was ok as well glad i saw it with family as they enjoyed it as well
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was very dark so even in 3d it didnt stand out it was an ok movie

Jun 6 2019,positive,action packed great casting
Jun 6 2019,positive,big monsters big noises equals a good time  
Jun 6 2019,positive,i enjoyed the entire movie with the exception of the problem with the film flickering for the first 2030 minutes waiting until they fixed it thus missing a small section of the movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,its a monster movie that greatly delivers on its monster fights
Jun 6 2019,positive,did a great job of staying as close to true to the original with this iteration well done as a toho connoisseur this is fricking awesome as close to the best godilla from the 60s and 70s
Jun 6 2019,positive,everything i wanted and more
Jun 6 2019,positive,fantastic i loathed the 2014 movie and i went to see this after acquiring promo tickets for buying some new digital movies i figured if i loved itgreat if i hated itwell i had 2 movies i liked and barely paid for this one so win win  this movie was almost exactly what i wanted good pacing proper reverence to the movies that came before and a lot of world building for the things to come   i am reminded of the 1985 destroyah period  fun interconnected movies are to come im hoping for some redesigns of classic 1 hit wonders like megalon and jet jaguar
Jun 6 2019,positive,better than the previous film no masterpiece but entertaining for a night out at the movies
Jun 6 2019,positive,well put together movie loads of action
Jun 6 2019,positive,awesome i hated the last godzilla movie from 2014 but this one was fantastic the soundtrack i think was the best for this year
Jun 6 2019,positive,not as good as shin godzilla 2016 if youre looking for sheer kaiju monster destruction the family drama was unnecessary and shouldve had the typical herovillain roles we loved in these movies like shin godzilla the new powers godzilla and the other monsters have and which were not displayed in previous films are a welcomed addition additional coverage shouldve been given to the monsters we havent seen much of before such as the mutoscylla and behemoth all of which are only shown briefly i was expecting to see the plasma beam or the beams generated by godzillas fins in shin godzilla in this movie but they werent shown yet a nice cool power was very cool overall i was expecting to see plenty of goodole monster devastation and fighting but the lack of such allowed me to doze off three times id recommend waiting for its release on dvd and bluray
Jun 6 2019,positive,just the right amount of story and fighting
Jun 6 2019,positive,super fun and enjoyable loved all the destruction and monster fight sequences
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was entertaining  fun the story could have been better which is what takes the rating down the film was really well done in acting directing cinematography music  effects the story did delve into the cheesy afternoon tv godzilla story a bit by taking away the feracity of the kaiju by showing there is an intelligence and alion king hierarchy  thank god baby godzilla didnt appear in musical form singing the lion king songsaside from that this film delivers a good film it was heavy on the foreshadowing of skull island  king kong the human story is necessary and fun the human aspect wasnt great multiple soldiers die to rescue one unimportant girl as all of society is getting obliterated there needed to be more investment the science staff really should be off doing specific team oriented tasks  not popping up together at always the right involved time the kaiju reallyreallyreally should have been doing separate battles across the globe the director should have given viewers these epic battles  not cut away from much of the combat to show the ppl being worried like i like the idea of communication devices but it was utilized very lazy thru out the story the surfaced realization of ancient human societies was pretty stupid the story really does not need to delve into more backstory just keep it simple ancient creatures once dormant now awaken and humanity does stupid stuff but a lesson is learned 
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved this move when and saw it again today but in imax to show all my support of this film and what it stood for this a squeal and the old saying of them didnt happen at all if anything it just got better the music 1010 the plot 810 the and the action 9510 like if you hatted sw 7 and then was told to watch cobra kai to heal wounds and then we got sw 8 watch this 
Jun 6 2019,negative,thump what an overstuffed over complicated mess with terrible writing so many id4 calibre groaning 1 liners and terrible star wars logic logic leaving valuable things unguarded to be conveniently taken even for a monster movie talk about sequelitis more is not always better it feels like too much studio meddling gareth edwards godzilla wasnt great but it had a vision and a good feel this one just felt like a 5 year old smashing his or her trucks together repeatedly to a dizzying and numbing effect what a waste of some very good actors at least i didnt feel compelled to walk out
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie was very interesting seems like old godzilla put on some weight since his japanese days i also enjoyed the other monsters as well and finally it seems that the movies are all starting to marvelize at the end of the credits i enjoyed reading the credits especially the redrum and how the monsters all played as themselves
Jun 6 2019,positive,wow much monster so satisfied
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie is great but i dont view the humans character as a big part of the movie i think than the monsters have more emotions than the humans in this movie and this one are more charismatic than humans 
Jun 6 2019,positive,if your looking for kill or be killed monster fighting its a must see if plot details and story is your thing you will be disappointed overall good summer action movie with a weak story 
Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie gave me everything i was looking for in a godzilla film 
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it not a lot of human scenes which is cool because there was more godzilla and monsters this time and thats what i came for
Jun 6 2019,positive,this is a great movie for any godzilla fan that just wants to see monsters kicking each others ass the cgis were badass and the action was great i didnt come to this movie for a great plot i just wanted to see godzilla mothra rodan and king ghidora and i was not disappointed i cant wait for godzilla vs kong 
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved how there were more monsters but the direction of this movie made me mad there would be a monster fight and it would quickly cut to the humans running like i just want to see big monsters fight it out i dont care about the humans but i wish this movie was better because it couldve been
Jun 6 2019,neutral,not much story but cool to watch in imax
Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie rocks if you love seeing giant monsters kick each others ass this is the movie for you it gives what youd expect from a godzilla movie its a must see
Jun 6 2019,positive,listen its a godzilla movie did we really expect there to be an intellectual script or even a reasonable amount logical physics no we did not i went to see this movie because i wanted high action and good graphics godzilla delivered on what i wanted in a godzilla movie i was not disappointed
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is the american godzilla film weve been hoping and praying for as goji fans the broderick shitshow can be put behind us finally as the crown has been given to mike doughtery king of the monsters admittedly has horrid human characters but damn are the monster fights a sight to see ghidorah is the villain of the year and is threatening and evil 100 the films portrayal of rodan stays true with the neutrality of the character and while mothra deserved so much better and more when doesnt she she is a a force to be reckoned with but the king of the monsters as stated by the title is godzilla and man oh man is doughterys zilla perfect or what i cried i screamed and i jumped out of my seat but what more can i say you just gotta be a true goji and toho fan to appreciate this tomatogate
Jun 6 2019,positive,while the critics call the film bad everyone else watches a fun kaiju film and enjoys themselves
Jun 6 2019,positive,i thought this movie was great it has me on the edge of my seat so much action go watch it 
Jun 6 2019,positive,awesome movie just wish the king looked like the old toho studios version
Jun 6 2019,positive,the people who criticized the movie clearly dont know anything about kaiju monster japanese franchise this is by far the best godzilla movie for best fight scene and graphics the original soundtrack brings me so much childhood memories of godzilla series not to mention all the old rivals from original japanese versions 
Jun 6 2019,positive,as usual in godzilla movies the human story is not as interesting as the monster stuff but thats how it should be godzilla king of the monsters has a fairly simple plot which serves to exist for the sake of monster action that being said the human characters were not as cringy as i was expecting some pretty good performances and some decently funny jokes here and there that i actually laughed at and the monsters holy cow are all the monsters incredible the redesigns of each are stunning while still being recognizable as the monsters from the good old days king ghidorah the three headed gold dragon has never been more terrifying and rodan the pterodactyl like fire bird benefited the most from the modern special effects compared to past appearances the fights are giant and thrilling many moments where i chuckled for how awesome it was but the most important thing about this movie is that the film makers not only treated the source material with respect but are clearly hardcore fans of the series with the litany of cool easter eggs the hardcore fans will appreciate this is how a monster movie should be and this is how an american adaptation of godzilla should be wether your a fan of the old films or a new comer this is a must see long live the king
Jun 6 2019,positive,action packed lots of suspense
Jun 6 2019,positive,the action was absolutely astounding and the characters while not perfect where still pretty good an absolute must see if your a godzilla fanbut you knew that and recommended even if youre not
Jun 6 2019,positive,the emma character is really stupid but the others are decent and all the acting is well done the overall story is a bit dumb too but its really just there to fill out the runtime and give context for the monster fights and thats the real point of the movie great monsters having epic battles this movie does an excellent job of it see it in imax if you can its an oldfashioned monster movie spectacle
Jun 6 2019,negative,good for the most part but toooooo long
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it wish there was a little more monster scrern time but it was still great
Jun 6 2019,negative,cheap seats at our local theater is all i can rave about
Jun 6 2019,positive,bombastic action beginning to end
Jun 6 2019,positive,long live the king
Jun 6 2019,positive,thought it a was great godzilla movie  the storyline made sense and there was good balance between the monsters and humans  loved it
Jun 6 2019,positive,well in this case dont rely too heavily on the professional critics listen to the audience yeah the movie has weak human characters script etc but the action  visuals and godzilla himself more than make up for its shortcomings and results in a damn fun enjoyable time at the movies
Jun 6 2019,positive,trash storyline but big monsterssssss
Jun 6 2019,positive,i grew up watching godzilla movies i really enjoyed the 2014 movie i was little worried about how the story would go considering there were multiple monsters however it worked for me and i found the movie to be really enjoyable the best part was when i look over to my son and seeing a big smile across his face i would recommend this movie did anyone notice the map of monsters and tiamat was listed
Jun 6 2019,positive,awesome movie definitely will buy on disk
Jun 6 2019,negative,story was weird characters were paper thin and not enough monsters on screen 2014 was a better film
Jun 6 2019,positive,amazing visuals especially in imax with a strong story and the type of action i want from a godzilla movie  a lot of onscreen time for the monsters though less actual fighting than i expected from the early reviews  but the time spent with the humans carried the plot along beautifully in the buildup to the next encounters a bit disappointed with all the fights being in the rain though everything was still quite visible  just kind of depressing and not needed a couple of the characters were cracking jokes in the middle of a crisis which was annoying but they didnt linger on once made so they didnt do too much harm to the overall movie  the details to the monsters were fantastic giving them all their own personality with very emotive expressions  just wonderfully fun all around and i look forward to seeing it again
Jun 6 2019,positive,you wont be disappointed if you are watching for the monsters
Jun 6 2019,positive,the fight scenes were amazing and beautiful but the story just fell short
Jun 6 2019,positive,i felt like a 13 year old if they were actually seling merch in front of the movie when i got out i would have bought every single one
Jun 6 2019,positive,the story line was interesting and relevant the musical score was intense and beautiful the fx was stunning  it was full of action i am a huge fan and this was perfect
Jun 6 2019,positive,love it i watched it two
Jun 6 2019,positive,better than expected this time some scary moments and great effects and fight scenes
Jun 6 2019,positive,film critic too many monster fights obi wan thats why im here
Jun 6 2019,positive,the critics need to get over themselves dont listen to them go see it its a monster movie i dont expect an incredibly intricate plot or indepth character development there was enough meat to fill the scenes inbetween the monster fights and thats all we need i loved it and im a pretty tough critic myself see this movie on as big a screen as you can twothumbsup
Jun 6 2019,positive,the monster fights were entertaining and fun the story of mark russell and his family couldve used some work and i would say the music went well with the movie i also think the mythology was well done in explaining the origins of these monsters 
Jun 6 2019,positive,kaiju sequences a  human sequences and writing d    put humans in kaiju movies for a half hour and then for the remaining hour or hour and half let it purely be kaiju glory i back the nonnarrative approach to these movies just like the transformer flicks the writing for the actors is just bad luckily the glorious kaiju sequences are throughout and save the movie 
Jun 6 2019,positive,although the plot may be a little off putting remember that nobody watches godzilla for the human characters and story arc you watch godzilla for the action and monster sequences this movie is full of that
Jun 6 2019,positive,critics are so wrong on this one  its what a godzilla movie should be  full of action with big g at his best
Jun 6 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters delivers everything youd expect from a godzilla movie  and so much more the script was so well written that there was not a single stale moment in the story the pacing was on point well casted well directed and the score enhanced each moment     the monsters had so much personality and the humans in the film actually added a lot of depth in the storytelling     the terror and the sheer size of the monsters could be felt through the screen this was like watching jurassic park cranked to 100 it was terrifyingly awesome     for a movie about monsters who only roar i really have to give credit to the storytelling of the film it was a wild ride with crazy twists and turns and in the end makes you want to ride again     i highly recommend checking this movie out 
Jun 6 2019,positive,i thought it was very good better than the first epic giant monster battles
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved seeing godzilla finally regining as king of the monsters
Jun 6 2019,positive,the story development was a little sluggish liked some of the creature battles
Jun 6 2019,positive,whoa what an intense sequel
Jun 6 2019,positive,truly epic one of the best action movies i have ever seen when the first tomatometer reveal was released on twitter showing that it received 43 i was heartbroken how how could they lower the score down to 39 this was almost more epic than endgame each shot is so gorgeously vibrant its like something straight out of a painting they have brought back original characters from the 50s and 60s offered a nostalgic thrill ride they have even subtlety altered the dorsal spines on godzillas back to look more like the original what is more is that they have even brought back the original roar godzilla and mothra vs ghidorah and rodan critics are attacking the characters and the story yes the story of a godzilla movie it is a godzilla movie giant monsters are meant to fight in these kind of movies and the characters they are not half bad they have also brought much more humanity to the city crushing titans up to the point where you do not view them as monsters or even animals    you look at them as characters    one of the best movies of the summer dont let anyone tell you different
Jun 6 2019,positive,long live the king this is a sequel to the 2014 godzilla 2014 and it even has reference to the 2017 kong skull island  a standoff featuring godzilla and king kong is currently being filmed and will be released in 2020 are three movies enough to call this a monster cinematic universe    this movie is receiving mixed reviews some say its the greatest godzilla movie ever while others have been extremely critical of it saying it feels like the creators just created a bunch of fight sequences and then tried to build a plot around them im certainly no expert on the legends of godzilla king of the monsters but i got a kick out of it if you want to see monsters battle each other you wont be disappointed you can see my full movie review at movie review mom
Jun 6 2019,positive,thought it was a good godzilla move not sure what the experts were expecting  
Jun 6 2019,positive,i loved it  saw it twice and will see it again soon probably in 3d
Jun 6 2019,positive,amazing this just shows how much disconnect there are between critics who give high rating to movies no one likes and the public
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie is one hell of a monster crushing hit the story line and the effects are great one of the best movie for this year 
Jun 6 2019,positive,came for giant monster fighting the film gives us plenty of giant monster fighting was not dissapointed 
Jun 6 2019,negative,boring and uninspired fell asleep in various parts 
Jun 6 2019,positive,i give this movie 4 and a half stars because im judging it by what it is a godzilla movie if you go into the theatre thinking youre gonna see a godfather like plot youre gonna be let down but as a movie about giant monsters fighting with each other it doesnt really get better than this the action scenes with godzilla and ghidorah are simply breathtaking and the cgi is top notch the only problem is the characters and how boring they are but other than that its great this is arguably one of the best godzilla films ever made
Jun 6 2019,positive,the critics know nothing the kanji action is some of the greatest ive ever seen and the human characters are fleshed out as much as your typical secondary characters but thats the point theyre not the main characters the monsters are the main characters there also is not a single bad performance from any of the actors they all give it their a game
Jun 6 2019,positive,best godzilla movie critics are overrated
Jun 6 2019,positive,has quite a few callbacks to earlier installments but overall a great movie for godzilla fans
Jun 6 2019,positive,good old classic godzilla movie loads of fun honestly i dont think the critics understood what they were watching when it comes to this movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved the special effects the actors not so much
Jun 6 2019,positive,movie was amazing loved it 
Jun 6 2019,neutral,good story terrible script 
Jun 6 2019,positive,great flick not the best acting but action packed and a fun summer movie its a monster movie duh
Jun 6 2019,positive,all the monster action
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it  plan to buy it on dvd
Jun 6 2019,positive,i went into the theater a little skeptical but the movie turned out to be awesome i was moved the entire movie and the ending was intriguing im looking forward to the next one
Jun 6 2019,positive,this was the godzilla movies ive always been expecting
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie was a great addition to the godzilla movies despite what most of these professional critics say it was outstanding i do believe you have to be a fan of godzilla to fully enjoy the movie a lot of critics say they dont know what is going on half of the time in the movie which is quite ridiculous the entire movie is explained if you pay attention they explain the orca and they explain the thunderstorms that are brought with ghidorah the purpose of the orca is to replicate the call of an alpha and other titans if they wouldve listened during the first 10 minutes they wouldve known that ghidorah brings strong thunderstorms and hurricane like winds whenever it moves around thats why the action scenes were filled with storms the fighting was great not too much not too little the plot was also good in conclusion the critics reviewing this most likely havent seen any godzilla besides the 2014 one because half of the reviewers are apparently 20 years old and know everything about the lore and how to direct a movie definitely give it a watch if you want to 
Jun 6 2019,positive,it was great to see this pay homage to the classics this is the godzilla movie that was meant to be made the critics are so disconnected from what movies are about this hits every point of what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be
Jun 6 2019,positive,its like watching like the old godzilla movies but with modern technology
Jun 6 2019,positive,it felt more like an old godzilla movie compared to the last one
Jun 5 2019,positive,the humans pretty much annoyed the crap out of me the monsters sold this movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,an excellent entry into the godzilla universe all the call backs to the originals made it so much better
Jun 5 2019,positive,i thought it to be pretty good having watched these creatures growing up i was pretty satisfied
Jun 5 2019,positive,love the kaiju fight
Jun 5 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie if i could change anything i would change the focus around the humans it got prettt dry around mid movie but i was so in awe by the scale and size of the battles 
Jun 5 2019,positive,solid entry in the monsterverse the human story is better than that of 2014s godzilla it still isnt great but it works as catalyst for the movie and a motive for the humans kyle chandler is better human protagonist than at johnson    but the real stars are the monsters and the fights are good in all their destructive galore   the 2014s godzilla the destruction was mostly off screen   in king of the monsters not so this is an all out monsterfight smorgasbord  and this is why we are here the monsterfights    there are some flaws here a lot of the the monster fights scenes are from the humans perspective instead of grand wide shots of the monsters dukeing it out   as usual the fights are always in the dark and i found the nonimax version having issues with contrast making the monster fight difficult to follow the imax version is still dark but the contrast works a lot better in favour of the visibility of the monster fights  overall a highly enjoyable but very flawed entry in the godzilla universe
Jun 5 2019,positive,enjoyed this movie so much really impressive in my top 3 godzilla movies ever along with shin godzilla and godzilla vs destroyah
Jun 5 2019,positive,pure monster mayhem a perfect film for any godzilla fan bring the kids 
Jun 5 2019,positive,awesome movie its godzilla kicking ass and fighting other monsters what else do you want
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie was amazing it had the original godzilla theme song albeit not in the beginning only thing i didnt like about it was that when they make it to what i think was no spoilers they found that he was worshiped like a god
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved the monster battles love the plot line lots of thing blowing up
Jun 5 2019,negative,plot was spotty as hell not easy to follow great for 6 year olds who love dinosaurs and monsters and creatures a waste of time for the rest of humanity
Jun 5 2019,positive,what do the critics know nothing as usual i am old school godzilla fan from way back this movie rocks
Jun 5 2019,positive,what a fun movie  so many tributes to the old movies  of course the human drama was a bit silly but who cares they are just there to get stomped on anyway  have fun and dont take anything seriously
Jun 5 2019,positive,while the script is somewhat less than desirable the human plot works just enough to get a pass but youre not here to watch a 2 hour drama youre here for some epic monster action which this movie truly delivers the world of the monsterverse is greatly expanded and the lore is truly spectacular now onto the reason why people will buy tickets for this movie the titans godzilla has never been portrayed better since his 1954 debut he truly and rightfully becomes the main character of the film mothra rodan and especially ghidorah are spectacular and are done complete justice the action is the best of any monster movie to date and can compete with the excitement and thrill of avengers endgame if you go into this movie thinking you will get an artistic drama which seems to be the mindset of many critics you are delusional get a ticket grab your friends and sit back to watch cities get leveled by these spectacular beasts 
Jun 5 2019,negative,so out of the realm of belief
Jun 5 2019,positive,as a life long godzilla fan this movie delivered the perfect balance between monster action and the human story line
Jun 5 2019,positive,really good exactly what we expected my husband is a huge fan of anything godzilla and he really likes it a must see for big fans and everyone
Jun 5 2019,positive,this is the ultimate fan service from michael dougherty a good time to be a kaiju fan the movie is great badass monsters fighting definitely better than godzilla 2014 phenomenal cant wait for godzilla vs kong next year
Jun 5 2019,positive,im a big fan of godzilla in general but this movie took the cake graphics fight scenes and plot all very good
Jun 5 2019,positive,the monster fighting was great the cgi makes it seem so real the humans are always just meh
Jun 5 2019,positive,fight scenes and usage of cgi pretty cool
Jun 5 2019,positive,the perfect godzilla film
Jun 5 2019,positive,fantastic unbelievable how people are hating this movie the human element works so much better than its supposed to and the monster action is incredible a top 5 godzilla film hands down
Jun 5 2019,positive,great tribute to the original films this is the monster movie everyone has been waiting for
Jun 5 2019,positive,my son is a huge godzilla fan and loved this movie this is by far the best one they came out with in the last 10 years
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was a very fun movie to watch entertaining and the graphics are amazing it kept my attention for the whole movie and that is a challenge since i have adhd i highly recommend it do not pay attention to those old men critics they just love boring musical movies they are underrating this movie 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i thought it was a great smash em up popcorn flick doing take it too seriously and youll enjoy the film i like how they wife in kong skull island and stayed true to the brand
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is absolutely thrilling im shocked by the comments by critics that the characters were 2 dimensional and i strongly disagree i enjoyed this film more than the first

Jun 5 2019,positive,its wall to wall moster fights i expected nothing less
Jun 5 2019,positive,the best kind of monster flick
Jun 5 2019,positive,regardless of what critics are saying about this movie its still a good one it has great action set pieces and seems to set up godzilla vs kong for next year pretty well 
Jun 5 2019,positive,continuing the nowstatedfranchise with a different direction commanded by michael dougherty king of monsters surely enough delivers proper continuity and enlargement to the continuouslyexpanding monsterverse with depth and substance towards its monsters as well as some dazzlingly spectacular kaiju action unfortunately the human drama its neither enough interesting nor rich or invested to sustain the overall plot or the weak characters around it making this more dumbfun than smartentertainment
Jun 5 2019,positive,a little too much human drama while the actual monster fights are awesome subtracting the human drama and adding more monster battles would make my score a 5 star
Jun 5 2019,negative,worst movie ive seen this year plot was complete garbage a broken familys story is interlaced with a monster fight boooooooo
Jun 5 2019,positive,a must see film theres a good amount  of tension and fight scenes in this film godzilla is such a badass 
Jun 5 2019,neutral,them human nas hogged all the screen time stupidly too 
Jun 5 2019,positive,this is a solid godzilla performance the only thing i didnt like was that it was all over the place great cgi effects and monster fights
Jun 5 2019,positive,only cause i seen it in 4dx if i didnt 3 and half stars 
Jun 5 2019,positive,a little weak in the middle but the talking parts werent what i was there for  ts godzilla not shakespeare
Jun 5 2019,positive,the perfect godzilla movie a lot more godzilla 610
Jun 5 2019,neutral,to those who are following the oneyear holybibleperusing plan with me this year here did you know this motion picture came out very close to the reading of job chapters forty and fortyone yesterday 30th of may what a coincidence but i am unamused after seeing it    why more than just about titans fighting kaijus to see who would become king of monsters this movie is also battling for the title of the most calamitous flick on disasterinducing big creatures at the catastrophe of mature characters and a believable story    it is one monstrous wreck too many despite having an extra scene at the end that scarcely anyone catches it except me likely as its consequence and manifestation of how terrible it is my rating 255 stars
Jun 5 2019,positive,monster action was great but too much time focused on humans
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie was entertaining with a great cast good story and special effects
Jun 5 2019,positive,love godzilla always has been the king of all the monsters   with hints a kong and skull islandseems to been a hit at godzilla vs kong coming
Jun 5 2019,negative,not worth the price of a ticket save your time and support a better cause like whites for a better america or endisraeliteterrorism
Jun 5 2019,positive,full of action cgi is killer you will love it
Jun 5 2019,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the movie in my opinion one of the best godzilla movies out there definitely the best american made godzilla movie they got the action right this time they characters were more interesting and everything was essential to each other the characters all actually had a purpose and deep beliefs and thoughts action packed thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat
Jun 5 2019,positive,we came to see giant monsters fight and thats exactly what we get just enough human element to remind you they are there but in the presents of a godzilla they are nothing more then merely ants one of the best monster movies ive seen in a long time and definitly better then that excuse of a gozilla movie from 98
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is the greatest american kaiju film ever the scope and sense of scale of this film is mind boggling the sound oh my god the sound of this movie was monstrous watching this inside the dolby cinema put this movie on another level we could hear the titans walking and rumbling around us like we were in the middle of it   in regards to the new titan characters the world is introduced to three of tohos mighty titans   mothra she was elegant feisty and beautiful she does what mothra is supposed to do truthfully mothra is the queen of the monsters   rodan the fire demon rodans entrance in this movie was nuts and the scenes involving him and the fighter jets were solid rodans wings are so powerful he destroys cities within seconds to compare rodan is starscream to king ghidorahs megatronbut way bigger stronger and cooler   king ghidorah monster zero the terror from space the golden demise ghidorah  was sadistically evil in all aspects of this movie his evil grin when seeing humans right before he uses his gravity beams on them tells us his disdain for humans his overall design is the best in all of the series and he keeps his original roar ghidorah truly is the king of terror  godzilla king of the monsters godzilla is an absolute unit in this movie he bigger stronger faster and meaner compared to the first yes there is a ton more of godzilla himself and battling it out with the others we see a few different incarnations of godzilla i will stop there just know the king is here   the monster battles were epic and enough to leave you wanting more from next years godzilla vs kong   the characters and the story i had no problem with i think the biggest complaint were plot holes and i think the plot holes could be answered if we ever see the 3 hour cut of the movie and if you are not a fan of this icon that is godzilla and the toho chest set then i also take that in account for plot holes that could have been missed ie easter eggs millie bobby brown was playing eleven kyle chandler was playing action hero dad that needed to save the day vera farmiga was crazy insane she was all about the planets balance sound familiar ken watanabe portrayal of dr serizawa was beautiful and sad personally my favorite character oh and lets not forget tywin oh tywin lannister i mean charles dance honestly anything with charles dance    all in all this was a movie made by a lifelong godzilla fan for godzilla fans and based on word of mouth it seems as though it is starting to resonate with the general audience godzilla king of the monsters gives cinematic audiences the ultimate monster thrill ride that tells a compelling human story that is in line with past toho godzilla movies ultimately paying homage to each era in this 65 year plus godzilla franchise     long live the king long live the monsterverse    8510
Jun 5 2019,negative,the shittiest movie ive ever watched sorry for my language but thats all i can say about it
Jun 5 2019,positive,a great kaiju film not perfect and could be improved but easily a new favorite of mine
Jun 5 2019,positive,epic and amazing in every way cataclysmic battle scenes with the most incredible visuals ive seen for 2019 by light years godzilla is seriously the truth and the king whos not to be fcked with must see best godzilla film of all his movies by light speed seen it twice and cant wait for the blu ray long live the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a dramatic improvement to the previous 2014 godzilla  the previous movie featured godzilla for a total of seven minutes and had almost no monstermashing which lets be honest is mainly why we see these things  king of the monsters on the other hand does a better job balancing a good plot combined with epic monster battles  the toho kaiju are reimagined as being a part of a longlost ecosystem which i think is cool  the cgi is spectacular and all of the monsters were upgraded with respect to their original designs  as a godzilla fan i appreciated how they paid attention to the details  they have call backs to old stories and concepts lovely reimagining of the classic music and easter eggs right down to the twin scientists referencing mothras twin fairies  yes some of the characters are a bit bland  is this going to win an oscar  probably not  is it a triumph for science fiction  absolutely  dont let the grouchy critics stop you from giving this movie the credit it deserves    if youre a godzilla fan you will love this movie  and if you just consider yourself a scifi or action fan youll still be wildly entertained
Jun 5 2019,positive,action packed and not boring we loved it
Jun 5 2019,positive,the best action pack of the year amazing visual effects a solid script to enjoy with the family 
Jun 5 2019,positive,good monster fights human plot is nowhere near as bad as everyone says
Jun 5 2019,negative,monsters look to fake
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved it was a great movie and would see again
Jun 5 2019,positive,great movie  loved the monster action and soundtrack a definite must see
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved it yes there were hilariously bad clichéd bits in it perhaps not the best dialogue and acting at times but cmon its a kaiju movie theres not enough of them at all and the action was really very good so good to see all the different monsters out there and gojira going at them both me and a friend were buzzing at the end of it 
Jun 5 2019,negative,if youre a fan of movies that dont have a story then this is for you
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie was good but its just is another look at the mindset of whyt people that they think they are the ones to make decisions for the greater good of all humanity the narcissism of whyt people 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i thought the movie was awesome they did a really great job on mak
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved it much more action
Jun 5 2019,positive,now this is a monster movie done right
Jun 5 2019,positive,hey its a godzilla movie what do you expect
Jun 5 2019,positive,the visuals were awesome the movie dragged though with the human element one of the main characters was a mcguyver type that seemed to have the answer for everything and never a flaw the constant cutting away from the monster fight to the boring people with no character development the back and fourth was dull and took me out of the excitement how many times do we need to see the destruction of a city when you have 4 of the biggest titans battling it out overall not a bad film but after a 5 year wait could have been the biggest summer blockbuster after avengers endgame hopefully the next entry will learn from these mistakes and come back
Jun 5 2019,positive,just awesome i cant wait to see it again
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was awesome i absolutely loved it this was what a godzilla movie should have always been minor human element and mainly focused on the monsters themselves with epic brawls beautiful effects and stunning cgi that let me hanging at the edge of my seat whenever godzilla came on the screen the human side plot while initially necessary to propel the story didnt really matter  in the end to which i enjoyed immensely this is about godzilla his actions and the monsters that he faces not what humans have to think about it whatsoever i approve of how this movie went and hope that any continuations will keep to this formula keep the monsters first to the forefront and the conflict as well i do encourage whoever reads this review to watch the movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,of all the movies i have seen this year this was the most fun it was ridiculous but it was ridiculous in the best of ways and it just got more wild as the movie progressed of course there wasnt a focus on the human aspect nobody walked into the theater caring about the humans they wanted to see larger than life monsters   and they go just that again this was the most fun i had going to the theater all year the importance they place on the marvel movies and saturated pages of fan theories are really killing the movies for me i went into this godzilla movie not knowing what to expect and i was not disappointed
Jun 5 2019,neutral,typical  not bad but not good either i think godzilla looked ridiculous looks like a fat iguana
Jun 5 2019,positive,whats more can you ask for a monster movie it got action scenes right the plot has some problems but not half bad really enjoyed it 
Jun 5 2019,neutral,it was hilarious solid 3 stars
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was incredible what the hell are they smoking you dont go to a monster movie to see humans we want to see giant monsters that break shit     the effects wete incredible honestly it was awesome
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla is awesome i loved every minute of it
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla is back motherfuckers
Jun 5 2019,positive,pretty awesome movie definitely the best godzilla movie ive ever seen and this movie does justice for the whole franchise critics need to understand that the monsters can be humanized as characters with forms of language other than speech and thats what the director succeeded in doing
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie is the absolute perfect godzilla movie  that being said its a godzilla movie and not meant for everyone  i will be viewing this one many more times because i just cant get enough 
Jun 5 2019,positive,a nice action flick good portrayals of some of my favorite monsters however there was a lot of exposition and almost all destruction is done off screen which is an important part of a godzilla movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla is a very good boy
Jun 5 2019,positive,jizzzzzzzed in pants but im not sexually attracted to monsters
Jun 5 2019,positive,i saw it twice in our theaters cine1 mega theater i just loved it the monsters were classic and yet realistic with todays technology the acting and story were great loved millie bobby brown in this movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,i have respect for the visual elements for this film and being able to witness the classic toho monsters faceoff on the big screen the plot is both cliche and weak and most of the dialogue is just exposition and almost comes off as if the characters are trying to educate me as to what is happening with a powerpoint presentation while others seemed to be annoyed by this i found it comical plus aside from the 1954 gojira majority of these films have rather weak characters and motivations a lot of the plot didnt make sense but i understand the reasoning was so we could have huge monsters fight on the big screen although i think there have been better motivations prior to this film also there regarding the characters there is a lot of alluding to some kind of grief amongst millie bobby browns parents and her brother who i think were to presume is dead as a result from what happened in 2014 however this is totally glossed over and never really explored     another aspect that kind of bothered me was the insertion of the oxygen destroyer it comes out of nowhere in the middle of an action sequence has zero effect on the monsters except that it stunts godzilla for a moment then itc completely abandoned after that     overall it was an entertaining film the monsters looked amazing this fight sequences were terrific and the score was also great especially modernized versions of the godzilla main theme worth a viewing on the big screen 
Jun 5 2019,positive,epic sequel to the original more monsters more destruction more intense action more everything absolutely loved it will definitely watch over and over
Jun 5 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan u will love the movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,a lot of great fan service not so much great dialogue
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved it  we had a wonderful time
Jun 5 2019,positive,by far the best godzilla movie likely to date the human characters feel good the monsters feel wonderful this movie succeeds with fans of the franchise because it brings us back to that time when we were 10 years old sitting on the floor with a bag of popcorn and cheering for our favorite monsters the human characters never took a front seat in those moments which is why critics dont get it
Jun 5 2019,positive,great monster movie big amazing fight scenes cgi sex for the eyes 
Jun 5 2019,positive,a phenomenal sequel to the 2014 godzilla film while 2014 had a slow burn and build up to it fans were displeased with the fact that godzilla really only had time to shine in the ending in this movie fans will be very pleased to find out that godzilla is actually in this movie along with the big g himself comes mothra rodan and the infamous king ghidorah the effects are simply outstanding and the monsters have a good amount of screen time the human characters are also pretty interesting this time around a few moments were very heartfelt and emotional dont listen to half of the certified critiques on this site because after watching the movie myself im not sure if they watched the same movie that i watched godzilla king of the monsters is a great summer blockbuster and possibly the best movie i have seen all year go watch it
Jun 5 2019,positive,highly recomend if you like big battles with big monsters
Jun 5 2019,positive,just what i was hoping for from a godzilla movie monster action
Jun 5 2019,positive,i waited the best part of five years for this and was not disappointed you shouldnt expect shakespeare from a godzilla film and this isnt its a lot of incredible spectacle with dialogue thats not great but nothing like as bad as people are saying ive heard people say the plot is messy and hard to follow which couldnt be further from the truth a 7yr old could follow the plot with no problem   this is my favourite film of the year so farand i loved endgame it does exactly what it says on the tin and to expect more would be stupid  45 would recommend to anyone who enjoys spectacle and a must see for a godzilla fan
Jun 5 2019,positive,its a movie franchise older than dirt why do we always need an hour to two hours of exposition but the last 20 mins were amazing
Jun 5 2019,positive,if you have any love in your heart for giant monster films this movie will not disappoint i have read the critical reviews and yes this film is not oscar worthy but it is by far the top film of its genre need to bee seen in theaters to be appreciated preferably imax style
Jun 5 2019,positive,ive been a godzilla fan since my early childhood and this movie was unbelievable it catered to the godzilla fan base and thats all that matters as far as im concerned
Jun 5 2019,positive,finally the godzilla film that avid fans like myself have been demanding for decades has arrived great balance of human story arcs and dazzling special effects that deliver an epic movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,i recently saw the original japanese film and i loved all the references to it its hugely entertaining looking forward to what comes next 
Jun 5 2019,positive,fun and excitement on an epic scale  a mustsee for even the most casual godzilla fan
Jun 5 2019,negative,sucked just awful acting and terrible plot i only lasted about 40 minutes it just kept getting more stupid so i left dont waste your time or money
Jun 5 2019,positive,my son loves godzilla movies  hes waiting for king kong vs godzilla
Jun 5 2019,positive,screw rotten tomatoes the human drama sucked and the kaiju battles were awesome
Jun 5 2019,positive,that was awesome definitely recommend in imax remarkable how far technology has come
Jun 5 2019,positive,awesome the cgi fx were some of the best ever best godzilla pic ever epic battles go see it critics suck
Jun 5 2019,positive,a better story to justify the graphics would have been helpful
Jun 5 2019,negative,dumb and boring the plot and acting is so poor dont waste your time and money the special effects are the only things to speak of 
Jun 5 2019,positive,a lot of improvements compare to 2014 one a lot more monster fight and they are awesome dont know why so many people hate it i guess there are too many stupid critics now a day41 tomatometer vs 83 audience score
Jun 5 2019,positive,my kids loved it parents thought it ok
Jun 5 2019,positive,non stop action  glad to see the old titans back at work  godzilla  long live the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,its what you are expecting out of a godzilla movie if your a classic kaiju fan   awesome monster action   meh at best human stuff  but im there for kaijus fights not the human aspect and i loved it
Jun 5 2019,positive,ignore the critics if you are a godzilla fan this movie is for you tons of monster fighting and a hint of human element the plot may not be amazing but if you love godzilla going toe to toe with other monsters constantly go see this movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,excellent movie with amazing battle scenes 
Jun 5 2019,positive,its a monster movie with monster fights lots of explosions a movie for the fans that stays true to its origins ignore what the critics say 
Jun 5 2019,positive,the most epic monster movie ever
Jun 5 2019,neutral,just a movie to watch  blah 
Jun 5 2019,positive,monster stuff  great  human stuff  terrible  very cliche
Jun 5 2019,negative,so the issue from the first still plagues this one however i feel that the first godzilla just did it better they gave us a lot more of the monsters but again they tried to connect to a plot with humans that was laughable it broke the action between the monsters with these human segments that only served to distract from the massive scale battle that should have been occurring the monsters themselves were fun to watch however it felt like their scaling was off sometimes they felt like they were massive creatures that caused destruction everywhere they went and other times those same qualities felt downplayed over all i give the movie a 25 as any parts without the monsters felt extremely boring
Jun 5 2019,positive,seeing it in imax it was a bit loud but if your a fan of cinematic universes youll be able to ignor the horrible writing and enjoy the numerous easter eggs and cool visuals of this monster movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,amazing movie had a ton of great throwbacks to the old movies and did an amazing job with the monsters themselves
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie was an incredible experience as a godzilla fan what they built up in the first movie was brought out terrifically within this picture the dialogue sure has its issues within the movie unlike the emotional grounded dialogue of the first movie but the film makes up for it with its fantastic imagery composition and incredible musical score
Jun 5 2019,positive,was the best godzilla to date but i could of have more monsters fights and less people characterization   more godzilla too
Jun 5 2019,positive,monster fights were spectacular but perhaps also a bit unrelenting fun theater experience though
Jun 5 2019,positive,great movie for the godzilla fan
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved the sound effects it was super loud just like a movie of that much action should have
Jun 5 2019,negative,it was overly dramatic the dad just whispered the whole time
Jun 5 2019,positive,i loved this movie  its a monster fight movie plain and simple   as a person whos seen every single godzilla movie ever i can tell you from experience that the human drama usually overwhelms the movie and takes away from the experience ive never watched a godzilla movie expecting enlightenment i just want to see a 300 foot reptile dropkick an equally large robotic counterpart i will admit protecting the environment should always be the theme of these movies     ps i just made an account so i could support this movie after hearing the shit reviews it was getting from critics 
Jun 5 2019,positive,great monster battles dont see this one for character development but the cast is great see this one on the biggest screen you can find
Jun 5 2019,positive,monsters fighting no drama very nice
Jun 5 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movies we have seen in a long long time 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i thought was good not great plot is a little messy but the action shots and monsters deliver lets be honestyour going to this film for godzilla not the other characters i thought it delivered some beautiful fights and some interesting side history notes throughout you really have to focus and form your own opinion on the ancient history of godzilla and its not really hard to understand if you piece it together godzilla creates balance 
Jun 5 2019,positive,critics are severely bias they give a movie like john wick 3 a 89 rating when it has no story yet successfully has great action scenes john wick accomplished its purpose just like this movie accomplished its purpose the point of the movie is to stay true to the foreign originals and watch monsters fight if you enjoy those movies go see this movie its awesome
Jun 5 2019,positive,its a great summer blockbuster it pays respect to the source doesnt do any unnecessary subversions excellent visuals and awesome music theres some slower parts sure  but all worth it in the end go watch  especially for any g fans
Jun 5 2019,positive,awesome acting was dull but we came to see monsters and definitely got our fill no idea why critics gave such a low score 
Jun 5 2019,positive,action packed from start to finish saw in 3dxd and enjoyed every single minute of it
Jun 5 2019,negative,for a while 2014s godzilla was one of my favorite films and certainly my favorite monster film i know a lot of people took issue with the lack of the titular lizard in the film but i loved the slow buildup to his reveal late in the movie and the excellent performances namely bryan cranston on display godzilla set the stage for my excitement for legendarys monsterverse excitement that was dulled by the disappointing kong skull island however godzilla king of the monsters reinvigorated that excitement preparing me for a twohour spectacle of kaiju fights and destruction boy was that excitement misguided    king of the monsters picks up five years after the conclusion of godzilla opening with the san francisco scene of that film shown from the perspective of the main characters the russell family it follows the emergence of several other similarly sized monsters dubbed titans by the scientific community and their effect on the world through the destruction they cause these monsters include mothra rodan and king ghidorah among others and their conflict with each other and with godzilla accompanied by these creatures are a variety of human characters including the russell family kyle chandler vera farmiga and millie bobby brown of stranger things doctors graham and serizawa of the first film sally hawkins and ken watanabe respectively and alan jonah charles dance an ecoterrorist trying to reawaken the longdormant titans and by the way a bland and boring villain now these characters werent as underdeveloped or flat as other reviews had led me to believe but they were still poorly written and hard to connect with aside from chandlers and watanabes characters i found it difficult to care about any of rest of the cast including bobby browns who i thought would be a surefire hit in the film it makes much of the film which shows these people standing around in rooms and spouting off exposition rather uninteresting this is a shame since king of the monsters features an alist cast that should have knocked it out of the park    perhaps the biggest flaw of king of the monsters aside from the mediocre character inclusions is the muddled and messy plot one of 2014s godzillas strengths came from the focused narrative which concentrated on one family and their experiences with godzilla while also featuring the giant lizard battling the mutos king of the monsters struggles because it tries to do more than its script was equipped to handle this doesnt mean that the film is overstuffed but the plot is far more complicated than it needed to be making it hard to follow as a result for instance character motivations shift back and forth several times in the film without any evident reasons this includes the monsters as one scene shows king ghidorah nearly murdering rodan even though the two creatures fight alongside each other a few scenes later another example is a device called orca the macguffin of the plot whose purpose or capability is never clear the most clarity that the film offers comes in the form of scenes that are loaded with exposition which typically include characters standing around rooms and pointing at computer monitors or people talking to each other in video calls several inconsistencies arise in the film as well like the fact that monarch the monsterhunting organization included in godzilla unexplainedly operates dozens of multibillion dollar research facilities around the world and possesses an armada of aerial vehicles like vtols fighter jets and a massive flying wing that most modestlysized militaries would be envious of it seems the writers just wanted audiences to turn their brains off and sit tight for the monster fights speaking of    the main appeal of godzilla king of the monsters is the spectacle of massive animals in this case godzilla king ghidorah mothra and rodan duking it out in glorious fashion these battles which include three distinct types of shots sometimes deliver two of these three types of shots are spectacular wide shots that let audiences see the massive scale and full cgi glory of the combatants and shots from the human perspective that show how fcking gigantic and scary the creatures are unfortunately the third type  groundlevel shots that show the destruction upclose  are an absolute mess of explosions flashes and upheaval that made me dizzy more than anything it was stupidly hard to follow what was happening in these shots since there wasnt much coherence on the screen these moments held back the monster fights from being as entertaining or watchable as they should have been however if you exclude those shots from the film youre left with some pretty stunning and entertaining scenes    godzilla king of the monsters mostly succeeds at delivering the largescale bombastic monster v monster action that fans of the franchise want to see if thats all your expecting from the film and all you want to see youre going to get your moneys worth when you buy a ticket unfortunately when you look at the rest of the film youll find an incoherent plot uninteresting characters and a messy attempt at worldbuilding in the monsterverse franchise right now the future isnt looking great for the muchanticipated godzilla vs kong the filmmakers need to direct their efforts towards a focused and easytofollow plot that isnt bogged down by too much exposition or a muddled narrative as it stands im still excited for the next film in the franchise but this one was nevertheless a disappointment for me im giving godzilla king of the monsters 2 out of 5 stars
Jun 5 2019,positive,this film is absolutely underrated the must see for the summer
Jun 5 2019,positive,the monster effects were amazing and every time one of them was on screen i couldnt help but feel a rush of excitement  however the plot involving the humans felt a bit intrusive often interrupting what i actually wanted to see the monsters fighting each other    this movie should have taken a few notes from kong skull island and embraced the ridiculousness of the source material  theres a reason that kong was considered a better flick  another example of this could be thor ragnorak  where the first two films kept shying away from the larger than life concepts and magic      the writers for monsterverse need to take notes from marvel  embrace the source material audiences with eat that up i sure did    
Jun 5 2019,positive,cinemark great movie and very entertaining my son and i enjoyed it very much 
Jun 5 2019,positive,fun experience solid monster fights a bit slow at times but overall a solid movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,bad ass action scenes involving the monsters the criticism has been too harsh sure the human scenes are not everyones favorite but are a staple in the movie franchise its not like it was ever peoples favorite to begin with but the true fans know that this was definitely a solid movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,dont listen to these critics who as usual are only interested in spewing their own self importance over a movie which audiences are really enjoying godzilla kotm was epic and had some amazing scenes as well as being a welcome escape from the regular sjw garbage which is being chucked at us in other film universes many of the problems from godzilla 2014 have been addressed and while its not the godfather in terms of storyline who cares nobody is going to see godzilla for that if you are going for some epic action that is what you will get
Jun 5 2019,positive,they totally fixed godzillas last few films and made a very entertaining movie nicely done
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was well done i was very skeptical but my 7 year old grand son wanted to see i was thankful to him for suggesting it good graphicsstory lineacting
Jun 5 2019,positive,grew up on godzilla loved it
Jun 5 2019,positive,now that was a crazy movie i need more godzilla juice
Jun 5 2019,positive,minimal human dramajust enough to serve the plot mostly a giant monster movie exactly what my daughter and i wanted
Jun 5 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movies yet  a real pure monster flick been a fan for years i loved the soundtrack  just epic 
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was a wild ride the plot was ridiculous the characters were wooden the dialogue was insipid and the acting was not great there were some gems in the acting certainly but this wasnt shakespeare and you know what i didnt expect it to be    i expected this movie to feature godzilla shooting king ghidora in the face with radioactive lasers and baby this movie delivered it was a spectacle of monster fights and carnage from the word go with the plot and dialogue serving only as a thinly veiled framework to get these kaiju into a battle royale with one another and thats exactly what i wanted    in other words dont go see godzilla king of the monsters for plot and high concept dialogue because if you do you will be sorely disappointed instead go see it if you want to turn off your brain for a little while and watch a threeheaded dragon battle it out with a prehistoric lizard over the wasteland of boston
Jun 5 2019,positive,big godzilla fan all my life this is a film for fans cant recommend it enough
Jun 5 2019,positive,awesome movie lots of kaiju action plot great music call backs to the other movies in this 65 year old franchise loved it going to see it a third time probably this weekend
Jun 5 2019,positive,really good especially in 4d
Jun 5 2019,positive,great y should watch enjoy
Jun 5 2019,neutral,lacking a convincing plot is what detracts me from loving this kaijufocused sequel to the 2014 godzilla reboot    if the filmmaker could just spend more time on character development and explore the mythology behind the different kaijus more before diving head straight into unleashing hell on earth that would be really splendid    what i also dont like is the leads downright questionable action in the story i suppose its good that they had to minus her out of the equation eventually    a lot of the noisy battles cant even be seen clearly as the fast cut gets annoying very quickly in short this sequel is more for less
Jun 5 2019,negative,cheesy story line is unoriginal and action seems predictable
Jun 5 2019,positive,lots of monster action better than all non toho movies to date

Jun 5 2019,positive,it was an okay film action scenes were great but story line fell flat too many things going on and too many characters just keep it simple if youre in it for just the fights then this will be fun to watch 
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved it possibly the best version of godzilla we have seen having seen the 29 previous films i think i can only say gojira and shin gojira rival this film

Jun 5 2019,positive,it was great from the beginning and plus ive been a godzilla fan for years  i think this was better than the last godzilla movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,to be honest i expected more from this film the film has a very great moments of course all relationated to the titans the kaijus are presented in a fantastic way they are the best part of the movie the film has a lot of extraordinary fights among the titans the cgi is perfect the soundtrack is perfect the only weak part of this film are the humans and the plot charles dance deserved a lot more he is an amazing actor the eastereggs are sensationals if you are a fan from toho you will love this film its a love letter to every kaiju fan around the world 
Jun 5 2019,positive,whether you know godzillas past history or are first timer this movie was entertaining and worth the trip to the theater with the family
Jun 5 2019,negative,meh terrible script terrible acting decent fights scenes 
Jun 5 2019,negative,worse than captain marvel this movie is incredibly boring and way too scattered to follow the human element is awful not one of the characters are redeeming or likeable in fact there is not one good moment in this pathetic garbage it should be retitled as oddzilla because it seems odd that the human actors didnt realize that they had a stinker on their hands and just began hamming it up for laughs one of the worse movies that i have ever seen 
Jun 5 2019,positive,went on a whim on a monday night  it was worth the time  exciting action movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,story got boring action was great
Jun 5 2019,positive,so much action and thriller really enjoyed this movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,its awesome movie i like this movie too much because of giant monsters feeling so high 100 times better then end game
Jun 5 2019,negative,great special effects but a disappointing storyline that limited the movies potential 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i unabashedly loved godzilla king of the monsters easily one of my favorite movies this year its a perfect modern kaiju movie in every way    that being said i hate the disparity between the critic and audience score while i understand how critics go about judging movies i wish they would consider the type of movie it is im guessing if they saw all the toho godzilla movies theyd rate them poorly as well of course the story isnt going to be worthy of an oscar but when youre having 350 ft monsters battling each other i dont think it has to be or that it even should be    i love the movie for what it is an over the top monster brawl thats a love letter to the original movies and in that aspect the movie is a 1010 i dont think i could have left the theater any happier it made me feel like a kid again long live the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,i loved it the music and monsters were all on point for me all hail the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,this isnt just a monster movie it has a complete story with some additional twists and turns
Jun 5 2019,positive,two thumbs up if you dont appreciate it then youre not  fan 
Jun 5 2019,positive,rotten tomatoes critics that gave godzilla a bad review are idiots godzilla was nonstop action 
Jun 5 2019,positive,thank you godzilla can not wait for god vs kong 
Jun 5 2019,positive,outstanding movie humans are actually relevant and the monsters are well represented  epic battles and a monster ending a true godzilla movie 
Jun 5 2019,positive,perfect the movie is made for kaiju fans
Jun 5 2019,positive,if you love giant kaiju battles this movie was terrific    if you are into character development dont bother you shouldnt be watching godzilla movies anyway
Jun 5 2019,positive,one of the best godzillas movie to date
Jun 5 2019,positive,some cheezy lines but some exellent and intimidating graphics
Jun 5 2019,positive,very good movie and the graphics were amazing
Jun 5 2019,positive,enough monster fights to keep you interested from start to finish
Jun 5 2019,positive,although its mediocre and uninteresting human drama brings the movie down king of the monsters is an all out brawl of epic proportions and the cgi and kaiju moments are the best parts of the entire film the only problem is that the humans needed to be improved upon i found myself bored to tears while waiting for every kaiju sequence the only character i really cared about was dr serizawa and my advice for legendary is to model future humans after him  all in all this movie was fantastic but the human plots needed to be more investable
Jun 5 2019,negative,nope grew up watching godzilla and didnt like the story action was good but that was it
Jun 5 2019,positive,i think that godzilla is quite perfect so great
Jun 5 2019,negative,they could have cut 40 minutes from this movie godzilla is not the focal point some kid her nutjob mom and dad are i thought it was flat out bad with horrible writing fight seems have there moments but nothing great
Jun 5 2019,positive,i highly recommend to watch the animated trilogy on netflix before watching this one many things will make more sense and you will be able to see some of the action from the animated on the big screen it was exciting to see that and ill stop here to not give any spoilers the plot and overall storyline was very pleasing i had a great time watching this with my teenager daughter
Jun 5 2019,negative,its a horrible movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,its a kaiju movie so you want lots of monster action and this movie delivers godzilla 2014 had the bad habit of cutting away from the monsters fighting way too much this one also does that but not nearly as much critics need to realize that people who watch these movies dont want story they want monster fighting action
Jun 5 2019,positive,awesome movie with incredible graphics some parts were a little slow but still an awesome movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was perfect for what it was the special effects were masterful and the scenes with the monsters were great this is not the kind of movie you go to for intellectual stimulation plot and character development that being said the actors were fine and no one stuck out as being particularly miscast or annoying the monsters were the stars of the show and they were amazing
Jun 5 2019,positive,classic scenes  regardless of what others say youre going to see godzilla the reckless the dramatic the misunderstood the king not an oscar worthy movie unlike those this will keep you hooked to godzilla not the human drama trust me i really dint care about the human drama just the kings drama lol if you grew up with him this movie will not dissapoint ps word of advice sit close to the screen the closer the better
Jun 5 2019,positive,needs a lot less human boringness and a lot more monster fighting well worth the 1 i paid to see it
Jun 5 2019,positive,fighting sence and monster part is the best but the human is not best and not worstmediuem i think this is my best movie of month
Jun 5 2019,positive,i found this movie a great continuation from the last one as it explains more about the whole godzilla series and does add a scientific aspect to the show with still having great action scenes with drama added as well in my personal opinion my favorite part is when godzilla pops out of the water and shoots blue fire into the sky global warming dude
Jun 5 2019,positive,too long kids got bored
Jun 5 2019,positive,full of action packed goodness with monsters that you love long live the king
Jun 5 2019,negative,terrible movie no character development  no plot no good acting no purpose just a lot of nuclear flashes of light  made no sense worst monster movie made yet great disappointment 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i been waiting for a long time for them to do godzilla right for the most part it was better then matthew broderick godzilla which was disappointing and bad design of godzilla and this director did it right for how this movie should have went godzilla ghidora looked great along with mothra and rodan over all it was a long time coming and no onto godzilla vs kong
Jun 5 2019,negative,poor plot some good action overall it was a bad movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,great visuals exciting and fun
Jun 5 2019,negative,i know its about monsters but the acting in the movie i could not get past how bad it was
Jun 5 2019,positive,critics are delusional to expect the second coming of citizen kane from this movie while the trailers might have suggested that this movie could be more than a monster flick this movie is simply the old school toho godzilla flick this generation of godzilla fans deserve 
Jun 5 2019,positive,fantastic i grew up watching godzilla reminded me of my childhood for sure awesome movie
Jun 5 2019,negative,its not worth an essay but ill say that it is without a doubt one of the worst in the franchise
Jun 5 2019,negative,cool action boring ass movie otherwise
Jun 5 2019,positive,how many times did rodan die in the movie
Jun 5 2019,negative,dont waste your time or money
Jun 5 2019,positive,best movie of the year so far full of action and a simple plot gojira is back
Jun 5 2019,positive,  simply the best monster movie of all time his music makes you feel very strong emotions a great show for all your senses
Jun 5 2019,positive,best fight who cares the human character development when it is a monster movie 
Jun 5 2019,negative,if im going to see a movie about a classic kaiju film one would expect them to at least spend enough of the budget on the cgi to have a satisfying battle scene around every corner  unfortunately i found myself annoyed when they would constantly cut away from the action to show emotion on the shallow hollow of what perhaps couldve been decent characters given there were more effort put into this film  
Jun 5 2019,positive,i have always been a fan of godzilla even back when it was just little model cars and houses but now the things that can be done are awesome and loved this particular one
Jun 5 2019,positive,more of action scenes like it
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was a visually stunning movie that kept me on the edge of my seat what a fantastic nod to the original characters and movies the director did his homework and made sure original fans were not disappointed in bringing these iconic characters to the big screen
Jun 5 2019,positive,if for some strange reason youre coming to this movie to see what the humans do when the world is being attacked by monsters then you dont know the point of a kaiju movie and you should probably stay home     aside from valid complaints about showing too much of the monsters at night or in the rain or in the clouds this is a terrific and exciting movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,much better than the first monster vs monster action 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i like the movie but the did not have a good storyline for the human aspects of the movie the monsters and action scenes is what makes this movie good
Jun 5 2019,negative,this movie is all cgi with little dialogue the movie did not show me in anyway to care for these characters writing matters and it was not there
Jun 5 2019,neutral,way too much unnecessary character screen time
Jun 5 2019,positive,there was just enough human drama to be invested in whether they lived or died but this was def a love letter to the kaiju and their fans i liked the last one but there was so little godzilla in a movie about godzilla that i couldnt help but be a bit disappointed i def didnt have that issue with this one i grew up with the originals and i feel that it paid enormous respect while still feeling fresh and exciting
Jun 5 2019,positive,i liked it its a crazy mixed cheesy story but the action was great just the story line was a bit cheesy for me titans were phenomenal
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla is king great sequel a thrill ride start to finish
Jun 5 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics  believe the hype  long live the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,massively surprised loved it 
Jun 5 2019,positive,a lotta monsters the dialogues  not so great but ultimately a cohesive story  effects team was on point
Jun 5 2019,positive,i am 51 years old so i grew up watching the various godzilla movies on saturday afternoon tv   i absolutely loved this movie  so much better than the first one   and to my surprise i actually enjoyed the family drama  subplot in this movie  i hated it in the first one  the kid was not annoying to me at all and her behavior was believable  the monster fights were fantastic  yes the middle section of the movie seemed to be a bit drawn out  and the total mayhem on the ground at the end of the movie was rather overwhelming to the sense  not to mention  i laughed when certain characters supposedly survived certain things   but i still loved all the action and the monsters   updating and inserting godzillas own personal theme music was epic 
Jun 5 2019,negative,it is probably the dumbest monster movie i have ever seen in my entire life its sheer stupidity is insulting even the intelligence of a single cell organism 
Jun 5 2019,negative,a mess  dont bother
Jun 5 2019,positive,is a great movie with lots of action lots of thrills great cgis on the bad side transitions could have been better
Jun 5 2019,positive,too much monster fighting not enough human drama makes this the best kaiju movie of all time gidorah mothra rodan and godzilla himself are all on point with ken watanabe and millie bobby brown providing stand out supporting roles 3rd time is the charm when it comes to hollywood adaptations of this legendary character
Jun 5 2019,positive,i love it  amazing fights from godzilla and the titans i love it
Jun 5 2019,positive,i liked it its good old godzilla 
Jun 5 2019,positive,the best squeal to godzilla for show loved it have to see it again 
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved the movie if you liked the 2014 godzilla then this one is going to take you for another great experience in this genre  
Jun 5 2019,positive,this was the monsterkaiju movie ive been waiting my whole entire life to see ive wanted to see this film and now we finally got it and it was very much worth the wait kotm was better than fantastic it was utterly amazing to see these iconic kaiju in a believable setting the action was both innovative and classic even the humans were mostly watchable 
Jun 5 2019,negative,godzilla king of the monsters wasawful    likei didnt even have expectations for this i just wanted to enjoy some godzilla silliness this is the most joyless film ive seen in awhile the script feels like a rough draft with lines that come off like placeholders where better lines should be as a consequence of the terrible writing all of the characters are garbage whats really heartbreaking is this film is overflowing with talents like millie bobby brown ken watanabe charles dance sally hawkins and bradley whitford among many others but theyre given absolutely nothing to work with and stage presence will only get you so far when the things coming out of your mouth sound like they were written by a high school student that hasnt ever read a book on his own time    so basically the entire human half of this film is garbage and theres entirely too much of it this movie is a little over two hours and it felt like four as a result of the endless human drama    in contrast to that godzilla looks freaking awesome as do most of the other monsters many of the classics are back so longtime fans can see them all rendered in glorious modern cgi but that and the casting is clearly where all the money went    the plot structure barely holds together the writing is awful especially the dialogue and the movies pacing goes from glacial to sprinting and then back to glacial again theres no sense of urgency or stakes they barely even acknowledge there are other people living in this world besides the ones in the fishbowl talking about tracking down godzilla the whole thing is a big steaming pile of lizard shit if im being honest    310 epic fail
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was very good action pack the whole time
Jun 5 2019,negative,definitely closer to the 40 the critics gave it than the 86 from fans dumb storyline too much talking not enough fighting got very boring at points also was so dark in some scenes you cant see whats going on special effects didnt save it
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie kicked so much ass 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i dont know how people can be so harsh on this movie i dont think this movie was bad at all its just flawed 
Jun 5 2019,positive,this is an excellent movie  more action and monsters than the last one
Jun 5 2019,positive,this realisticthats fantastic
Jun 5 2019,positive,the story line was slow i think i fell asleep a couple of times
Jun 5 2019,positive,og godzilla fans must see this movie the human story has a really stupid plot point that is essentially thrown away at the end but who came to watch humans no no if youre here to watch huge monsters kick the crud out of each other with an amazing soundtrack to fit this movie will not disappoint
Jun 5 2019,positive,its a great movie for any godzilla fan and kaiju fan
Jun 5 2019,negative,horrible disappointing waste of time and money the scenes were so dark and confusing it was a struggle to know what the hell was going on this is another example of cgi run amok with little regard for any semblance of a script at some point the audiences are going to figure out that these kinds of cgi extravaganzas arent worth it compared to a quality script and cgi experience like wonder woman this doesnt measure up
Jun 5 2019,positive,great special effects overall i enjoyed this film
Jun 5 2019,positive,they could have given the moth more power and let it live
Jun 5 2019,neutral,millie bobby brown was fantastic movie was too long a little editing would have made it less boring too many godzilla clichs
Jun 5 2019,positive,if you like action or big monsters this movie is near perfect with plenty of loving nods to the japanese series of kaigu films this movie is full of action suspense and skreeonks
Jun 5 2019,positive,the king of the monsters has returned
Jun 5 2019,positive,i liked the graphics and storyline it kept me at the edge of my seat the entire movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved the special effects
Jun 5 2019,positive,the monsters were excellent with the best kaiju action ever created some of the actors were missplaced like ice cubes son who is suposed to be super secret military elite but they make him sound like an idiot 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i fully expected a bangin rock sound track to go along with this movie  but there was not one song throughout the whole thing til the end credits in which they played go go godzilla
Jun 5 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this godzilla the images were spectacular and it was super exciting
Jun 5 2019,positive,ignore all the hate this movie is worth seeing and imo is better than godzilla 2014  kongskull island lots of big battles and monster scenes just enough human plot to propel the story but its a godzilla movie its not meant to be a oscar winning deep emotional human driven movie its a big blockbuster movie about giant monsters existing in the world and fight it accomplishes what it set out to do and thats entertain and wow with great special effects great fights and awesome sound go see it
Jun 5 2019,positive,i went to see this movie wanting one thing great monster fighting and this movie delivered 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i came in expecting dumb monsterpunching fun and i got moderately intelligent monsterpunching fun if you like giant monsters stomping around causing massive property damage this will not disappoint
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was so freaking fire never a dull freaking moment i got chills constantly and cried tears of joy it was literally a masterpiece the best movie i have ever seen if i could hug the director i would anyone that says this movie is bad probably has 0 sense of adventure and never once let their inner child breathe i have not seen such greatness in theaters in a very long time and i watch alot of movies i dont intend to spoil the plot but if you do anything this year or in ur life watch this movie you can not pass on until u see this movie i can not even in human words describe the level of amazing this movie is like drop everything take off work i dont care you can not continue what you are doing without seeing this movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,being a long time godzilla fan this movie felt perfect it felt like an older godzilla film but with with a newer more modernized story with the kaiju action just being the most amazing part of the whole film they really did an amazing job making every one of the classic j  kaijus into complete badasses even mothra    overall 910  this is the godzilla movie ive always wanted
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was dope asf didnt care for the human characters but the monster scenes fighting special affects are insane if youre a godzilla fan and wanna see some monster munching mayhem you will def like this movie
Jun 5 2019,negative,this is among the worst movies i have seen  it ranks down there with the meg
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters it was fantastic time with all it references to the previous godzilla movies the monsters designs and a very simple plot to follow if you have a kid who  grew up on godzilla or have been a godzilla fan its fun cool and down right a good time here i just cant recommend this enough i also see a lot of people complaining about how theres not enough people in this movie as if they think there the main character but dont seem to realize it called godzilla and that there there to give you the reason why all this is happening in the movie and to move it forward 
Jun 5 2019,positive,the monsters were fantastic  visual effects great  there were a couple of sad spots  mostly an enjoyable movie to watch  
Jun 5 2019,negative,if you like ridiculous movies who take themselves too seriously youll love this one i think godzilla accidentally stepped on the script and the screenwriter just decided to use a random wwe plotline as a substitute 
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was a great movie liked that it had all the monsters in it godzilla showed them whose boss
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was ok fight scenes are there see it in a matinee time i saw it for 6 bucks lol not worth more than that
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was amazing as long as your going into it expecting a godzilla movie that is exactly what you get this is my favorite movie of the summer and it was quite obvious that the director truly loved godzillas rich history dont listen to the criticts they are very wrong on this one
Jun 5 2019,positive,awesome    cant wait for next one in series 
Jun 5 2019,negative,unbelievable waste of time and money  how can i get both back    dont waste your time its just another hollywood bomb trying to push an eco plant warming message of doom and gloom and naturally its the human races fault   and releasing monsters will correct our supposed mistakes yeah  sure give me a break
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved everything about this movie cant wait to see it again
Jun 5 2019,positive,i liked the kaiju battles i liked how the mother and daughter were the villains along with the ecoterrorists however the mother and daughter have character arcs i liked how the dad even has a compelling character arc however there is a lot of exposition i get that it helps explain the plot but show dont tell wouldve been better
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved all the monsters  we go to the movies to be entertained not spend the evening with people in their living room like so many tv shows  couple times was slow but overall a great fun movie  would go see it again
Jun 5 2019,positive,i thought this was a great movie i love godzilla he is king of the monsters
Jun 5 2019,positive,great action and the kids loved it
Jun 5 2019,positive,if your a godzilla fan go see it its not a flawless movie but its a blast to behold and im glad i took my kids to see it we loved it my son cheered for godzilla and sat glued to his chair for 2 hours my teens had a blast and we talked about it for hours afterwards if you enjoy king kongpacific rimrampage go spend 2 hours with godzilla you wont regret it
Jun 5 2019,positive, biggest godzilla fan this movie quences my godzilla kaiju battle thirst be also leaves me thirsty enough for the next one
Jun 5 2019,positive,i enjoyed the scenes with the monsters but the scenes with the humans alone were cheesy  predictable
Jun 5 2019,negative,the plot was good but the special affects were second grade humans cant be in the middle of nuclear explosions and survive
Jun 5 2019,positive,the action starts almost immediately
Jun 5 2019,negative,blech  the acting was atrocious  the action scenes between monsters were so covered by rain smoke fire clouds etc that is was pointless to try and see the monsters fighting  and who designed this latest godzilla  hes 390 feet tall and has a tiny head  it was not well written not well acted the cgi was too much to digest and the poor visual quality make me say bring back the rubbersuited guys  dont waste your money in theaters  not worth it
Jun 5 2019,positive,every godzilla fan would love this movie a person with no idea  of the big monster universe of godzilla would give this movie a 40 if you dont understand the movie or the history behind dont give 40 8510
Jun 5 2019,positive,suspense from beginning to end
Jun 5 2019,negative,neither for the kids nor the adults target audience are gorrilas i guess
Jun 5 2019,positive,one of the best i cant wait for another one
Jun 5 2019,positive,excellent plot excellent graphics a cracking great movie   im going to see it again
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was good not for everyone but good the acting was superb especially on millie bobby brown and vera farmigas side the story wasnt the best but this movie was exactly what it should have been
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla king of monsters or if you want to get technical king of kaiju or godzilla 2 has a lot action good cgi has an ok story but i liked it but it shows some emotion but not a lot it tries to show emotion but i dont really feel it and i think i know why look at endgame for example spoilers  when iron mantony dies you will get sad because there was 22 films and through out those 22 films they had chances to show his personality and they took those chances and did well they showed how tony grew as a person but in this film the godzilla movie lines has 2 movies 2 and they had 1 person die in the first one and now they show another important person in this one but anyway in the fights i noticed a lot of them where at night or really dusty and foggy and i think it was because the film makers werent confidant about the cgi and that theyd look like the cg ninja turtles but anyway good movie i wouldnt watch it in a theater again but maybe ill buy the blueray 4stars final score
Jun 5 2019,positive,there is no good story for humans but it is a good fighting movie of monsters  
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was better than i thought it would be it was like the first transformers and it has awesome special effects it is a little too long but it is worth it and stay tuned for a post credit scene
Jun 5 2019,negative,the story was all over the place yes humans are bad monsters are good so where does godzilla fit into all of this apparently once the main characters figure out if they want to be heroes or villains we can get a fight scene which was good but only if havent walked out yet 
Jun 5 2019,positive,best godzilla movie critics got it wrong everything is about giant monsters fighting and not just only about humans
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla forever truly the king of the monsters
Jun 5 2019,negative,so very very boring that i almost sleep in the theather
Jun 5 2019,positive,action packed with awesome characters play its everything you could ever want in a godzilla movie
Jun 5 2019,negative,that was a waste of my time boring and entirely too far fetched
Jun 5 2019,positive,monsters and special fx were excellent but 15 year old child has too much involvement
Jun 5 2019,positive,awesome in every way i cant wait to see it again
Jun 5 2019,positive,god damn nice epic fight
Jun 5 2019,positive,amazing tribute to the toho films
Jun 5 2019,positive,absolutely fantasticgreat family fun this movie was a legendary monster mashup for the ages my kids couldnt have been more thrilled and riveted for over 2 hours they actually forgot about their cellphones for once we felt like we were in the middle of the monster brawls as the whole theater was rockin and shaking including our seats and we didnt even order dbox seats bonus best action film ive seen in years this film recaptured the glorious moment i experienced watching godzilla for the first time as a kid tears of joy streamed down my face my family is going to see this masterpiece again but this time at an imax theater we cant wait to watch godzilla on an even bigger screen delivering an iconic tour de force of intense kaiju battles with the 3headed dragon ghidora to settle once and for all whom the true king of monsters is in the toho kingdomlong live the king

Jun 5 2019,positive,the monsters were both well designed as well as visually accurate
Jun 5 2019,negative,this movie is so bad i feel like this movie was a remake of two seven year olds playing with their toys
Jun 5 2019,positive,no title screen till the end and not as good as the first godzilla but it sure did have lots of cg action big explosions and monsters battling it out like transformers its best to see it on the big screen with good sound girl was just ok and the other characters were good too i was never a fan of the big monsters but if you are you would like this a lot it has very little dull moments and is intense during the battles give it a watch
Jun 5 2019,positive,you guys dont listen to the reviews from critics i just got home from watching it and it was epic at least in my opinion i really loved the spectacular fight between the monsters
Jun 5 2019,positive,amazing film must watch if youre a true godzilla fan
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movies was awesome
Jun 5 2019,positive,an action pack of the fight between monsters not much a good storyline but its still worth to see
Jun 5 2019,positive,there is godzilla in this movie a lot of godzilla and he is so badass  and tell me  the genius script in the kaiju monsters movie are you serious movie gives everything you expect and even more  and dont forget about the scene after the credits  ps hail to the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,i just saw the movie expecting big monstertitans fight and its just awesomewith music score literally giving goosebumpsi am waiting for the next movie in the monsterverse hoping more action with the titans
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie had interesting actionfight scenes however my biggest dislike was the subplot surrounding the 13yr old girl maddison it made the movie drawn out didnt add anything to the godzilla storyline and felt like a cheap commercial gimmick to get kidsteens to like the movie the movie respected king ghidoras powers and this came out very clearly 
Jun 5 2019,positive,in my opinion the best godzilla movie ever lots of new monsters epic fights great story line some touching moments too
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie does everything it sets out to do the human characters motivations are often weak or flawed but they set up the action and to see these colossal beasts brawl for the fate of the world from the perspective of survivors on the ground was awesome there is a consistent feeling of wonder terror fury power and beauty which accompanies the entire film leaving each scene a work of art in its own way and opens the gate for countless future visits back to this film and this franchise 
Jun 5 2019,positive,this was my most anticipated movie of the year but the monster fights were the only saving grace in it i just wish they were longer and werent shot up close and shaky the rest of the film is just okay far from terrible if they cut out some of the human storyline and stopped cutting away from the fights i wouldve give this movie a 45 i still recommend people see this film so they can form there own opinions on it
Jun 5 2019,positive,my grandson loved this movie  hes in the 6th grade a gamer and hard to impress im a long time godzilla fan and wouldve loved to have seen the two little girls who sing to mothra and a bit more screen time for mothra as well  i have to admit there were times when i didnt know the bad guys from the good guys  a great movie for 12 year olds
Jun 5 2019,positive,the human story was pretty dumb but everything else was awesome
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was amazing the focus was on the monsters which is what one wants to see in a movie titled king of the monsters the monsters design graphics and battle scenes were top notch also the entrance scene of each monster was particularly epically done way to go on this hopefully there are going to be more of godzilla movies like this
Jun 5 2019,positive,best godzilla movie ever made visuals were stunning my boyfriend and his brother are gz fans since the 90s and cried watching the film does the characters epicness justice im totally going to watch it again in theaters and i only did that for fellowship of the ring needless to say im definitely purchasing the film when it comes out in high resolution too 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i honestly genuinely enjoyed this movie very much my 5 year old and girlfriend also really had a blast in this film went in to see monsters fight and boy did they i recommend it if your on the fence
Jun 5 2019,positive,batman v superman  infinity wars best bit  best kaiju movie ever
Jun 5 2019,positive,this was one of the better movies centered around godzilla the storyline was vibrant and more relatable than previous ideas the cinematic journey through which i was privy was definitely stimulating without tugging too much on the heart strings i thoroughly enjoyed myself and would definitely recommend this feature presentation to others
Jun 5 2019,positive,im a huge godzilla fan and i loved this movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,if you like monsters movies or godzilla movies then this movie is a perfect choice 
Jun 5 2019,positive,yes  f everything  monsters fighting period
Jun 5 2019,negative,godzilla was the only good actor in this movie wdf millie i expected better 
Jun 5 2019,negative,started out looking like it was going to be good turned out to be a mediocre to bad movie the action was decent for the most part although i couldnt tell what was happening a lot of the time the same goes for the rest of the movie not just the action scenes it was sloppy wasnt sure where everyone was or what they were doing the human parts were pretty much garbage but were played by good actors which made it easier to swallow story stupid characters nonexistent decisionmaking questionable but same with kong skull island i should have been able to enjoy this as a mindless monster movie i enjoyed some of it but as an overall experience not so much and as the movie goes on the cheese and cliches come out from hiding movie makers should have a cliche team to catch any possible cliches doesnt make sense that they are still so prevalent 1 viewing      spoilers      biggest eyerolling moment in the movie they are driving fast the guy in the back seat says something like  he should just go home driver slams on the breaks what did you say guy in the back seat repeats everything he just says driver and passenger exspouses turn to each other and yell home to signify that they knew where there daughter was going s m h
Jun 5 2019,positive,wish they would have showed king kong at the end
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie was awesome
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie is great would watch again

Jun 5 2019,positive,kids enjoyed godzilla  godzilla movies will always enjoyable to bewitch
Jun 5 2019,negative,low grade acting and predictable cheesy lines
Jun 5 2019,positive,starts slow but then turns into an allout assault on your senses  acting is not great but the monsters are the stars  if you enjoyed the first godzilla you will enjoy this one
Jun 5 2019,positive,seeing godzilla return to glory brought great joy to my heart the mainstream media critics bashing his film are mere fools king of the monsters is good old fashioned giant monster vs giant monster action i cheered out loud as godzillas theme blasted through the xd theatre i saw this film in hail to the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,its great the fight clímax and the power that feels on the screen its great a wonderfull kaijus movie for the fans besides the visual effects are insane
Jun 5 2019,positive,tomatometer sucks not sure if they can accept a movie for the way its supposed to ve made you have to love it the way godzilla movies are always made its what makes godzilla movies great dont expect a marvel movie its godzilla if you enjoy it for what it is youll love it
Jun 5 2019,positive,cgi is awesome sadly broken ridiculous storyline hurt this movie also theres big awesome monster fighting but somehow we see way more scene of boring human than monster none of the character is likable could of been a great movie if only they focus on the movie instead of politics
Jun 5 2019,positive,if you like godzilla movies youll love this one on the big screen  tons of giant monster action and a passable plot for the human story
Jun 5 2019,positive,very entertaining movie with impressive cgi monsters and action scenes top notch acting by all interesting storylines centering around each of the three russell family members and the monsters and some very funny lines well placed made for a surprise godzilla movie  the best one yet  there were some surprises but many anticipated storylines  but the whole movie was filled with a lot of suspense thrills and even some emotional scenes to over shadow the flaws  my wife and i do not consider ourselves diehard godzilla fans but have been intrigued at the evolution of the character and improvement of the quality of his movies over the past decades and really surprised at how enjoyable this movie was
Jun 5 2019,positive,as a true godzilla fan i will admit im biased i find the mindless sheep like tearing down of this great installment the only thing that i dont care for about the movie every criticism and issues with this film was a gift from the director to the true godzilla fan from the the stories formula which is a godzilla staple to the characters arch that  guide you through the madness in true godzilla fashion we godzilla fans are not a jaded type we waited so long and this is the one that we wanted hail to the king
Jun 5 2019,neutral,another mindless monster fighting monster movie just borrow thanoss ideology 
Jun 5 2019,positive,honestly way better than i was giving it credit for lots of red pill disclosure for people 
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie started off slow but gradually got better every monster fight scene was worth the time and looked amazing only thing that disappointed me was godzilla didnt slam a nuke like a senior studying for finals would a redbull
Jun 5 2019,positive,honestly the only reason its not a 55 is that there was too much human drama its a godzilla movie i expect godzilla to have more screen time than a family with way too much drama
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie was amazing i absolutely loved it
Jun 5 2019,negative,i cant explain how empty every death in this movie was nothing was earned no characters grew or had loss the plot twist was not even revealed until 5 minutes into the movie and i was forced to watch godzilla vore an entire dragon im not kidding this movies half assed attempt at explaining its movie science actually makes me think the writers dont understand science at all i know its supposed to be for a different world than ours but it doesnt work also how does nearly every character teleport around the director clearly cant shoot any actively moving people in scenes because they prefered to just have main characters teleport even the cgi big bad evil guy teleported with godzilla in his arms seriously dont see this it was 2 hours i will never get back on this earth
Jun 5 2019,positive,classic monsters battling
Jun 5 2019,neutral,not sure why people liked it it lacks content and the script doesnt help
Jun 5 2019,positive,i loved the action and the plot to the movie long live the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie nodded to the classic films satisfied expectations of longtime fans and was epic enough to create new ones go see it
Jun 5 2019,positive,entertaining with lots of action
Jun 5 2019,positive,this newest edition of godzilla reminded me of the old school godzilla except with new special effects
Jun 5 2019,positive,this was great these critics that work here are so full of crap  spoiler the japanese guy should have given him the watch
Jun 5 2019,positive,was ok just missing a few elements tbh
Jun 5 2019,positive,the monsters were epic and didnt disappoint
Jun 5 2019,positive,in the kaijudepartment this movie delivers and it delivers hard epic battles of gargantuan scale between the different kaijutitansmonsters the cgi is phenomenal youll be enveloped into the movies story on the edge of your seat as if your own life is truly at stake this is kaiju welldone by america and the fanservice to hardcore fans of godzilla is amazing with great little nods spanning back to the king of monsters original 1954 japanese debut however the focus on battles suffocates the newly introduced characters from truly developing hopefully future installments will see a balance of the development of these characters as well as grand titan battles long live the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,amazing fights all the kaiju you could want and almost know human drama an all around win
Jun 5 2019,negative,so boring everything looked ugly and the sound effects loud and messy wth did i just watch
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie is exactly what i expected it to be  if you want to see the legendary japanese kaiju animated with the power of hollywood look no farther    is there a plot  maybe  i wasnt paying attention  i was too busy smiling and getting hyped for every single fight scene that happened    godzilla did what godzilla do and he did it against the single most popular evil kaiju of all time    want to enjoy the movie  treat it like a transformers flick  ignore what the humans are doing and watch what the giant fighting robo er monsters are doing
Jun 5 2019,positive,action packed a beautiful
Jun 5 2019,positive,a great movie i would see again
Jun 5 2019,positive,awesome action packed movie that gets the feels alittle as well

Jun 5 2019,negative,i couldnt believe how tedious and boring this movie was compared to previous ones   lots of action but the wrong kinda of action  i actually fell asleep several times  save your money  would not recommend
Jun 5 2019,positive,it definitely got us excited for kong vs godzilla next year
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was better than i expected this movie was absolutely epic i had to see it twice
Jun 5 2019,positive,great movie like all of the godzilla movies
Jun 5 2019,positive,so this score may seem high but the reason is because of all the monster action in this film which the 2014 one lacked
Jun 5 2019,negative,no storyline just angry monsters crushing things half of the movie worst of the worst
Jun 5 2019,positive,for a monster movie it was great fans everywhere godzilla you will not be disappointed for all the critics relax its a movie and enjoy it
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was the perfect godzilla movie it captured everything amazing about godzilla king gidorah was incredible too critics are out of their minds on some rediculous agenda 
Jun 5 2019,negative,i cant be in 2019 godzilla has a plot that is taken so seriously what a shame for godzilla fans
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved nearly every minute of this movie  2 hours of big monster destruction and lots of awesome godzilla nostalgia sprinkled throughout

Jun 5 2019,positive,heavy on fun and amazing monster action light on character development youll probably know if youre the kind of person who will like this movie
Jun 5 2019,negative,horrible movie waste of time and money predictable to the max and dragged on too much
Jun 5 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan you will really enjoy this movie  i dont know what certain critics are expecting to see out of a godzilla film but i had a lot of fun with this movie  
Jun 5 2019,positive,as a godzilla fan i loved it much better than the first  the best american monster movie to date  better emphasis on the monsters this time and the human side was good enough for a monster movie  this movie was clearly done by someone who was a fan of the godzilla genre
Jun 5 2019,positive,epic fights thats all i want from a godzilla movie 
Jun 5 2019,positive,good action but nothing special
Jun 5 2019,positive,while many people point out that the film lacks human drama i would like to point out that is what drug down godzilla 2014 this film succeeds because it is a monster film and everything is in furtherance of awesome monster fights
Jun 5 2019,positive,nostalgic dream that felt real every second
Jun 5 2019,positive,absolutely loved it a perfect monster movie with a thread of humanity woven through it enough story to warrant a film and not so much it takes away from the spectacle because if you go to this movie you probably just want to see a amazing monsters fighting and boy does it deliver
Jun 5 2019,positive,kaiju battling it out in classic godzilla fashion what else do you need
Jun 5 2019,positive,perfect godzilla movie great monster action  forgettable humans and a beautiful score
Jun 5 2019,positive,cgi godzilla and the rest of the monsters 1010
Jun 5 2019,positive,big monster fights enough said
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie is a fantastic love letter to the entire franchise that spawned it the movie stands on its own but is even better for long time godzilla fans tons of easter eggs and nods to previous iterations make this a movie that keeps you smiling throughout the runtime the human characters are fine and they arent the reason that someone goes to a godzilla movie but the cast gives a good performance with standouts by millie bobby brown and charles dance if you havent gone yet go see this movie in theaters as it was intended 
Jun 5 2019,positive,a faithful representation of godzilla that gave the fans exactly what they wanted let them fight
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla has never looked so good 
Jun 5 2019,positive,this movie was a great tribute to past godzilla movies and is a good movie even if your not full godzilla fan great story and action and even emotional scenes
Jun 5 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movie i ever seen  plus the fight scene of the giant monster was so amazing and well done
Jun 5 2019,negative,cant figure out how he was standing in the middle of the ocean and it was only ankle deep movie was eh
Jun 5 2019,positive,great godzilla action and a no sjw zone it even felt a little anti pro left with a warning towards the road to hell is paved with good intentions
Jun 5 2019,positive,liked its update version of old ones but had all the monsters in this version
Jun 5 2019,positive,absolutely slapped critics are cowards
Jun 5 2019,positive,i just love the movie ive been at godzilla fans fins the 70s and now my grandson loves godzilla i showed him the original godzilla movies and he just loves them
Jun 5 2019,positive,as a total fan of godzilla and monsters movies from japan this is a love letter for me this movie is just filled with epic moments if you are a godzilla fan you will definitely enjoy this
Jun 5 2019,positive,i love how it was more focused on godzilla instead of the humans also the teamwork with godzilla and humanity
Jun 5 2019,positive,lots of action made me feel like a kid again
Jun 5 2019,positive,such a fun summer spectacle anchored by great human characters and all the monster mayhem you could ask for
Jun 5 2019,positive,went in expecting a giant fighting monster movie and loved it not a huge story but enough to frame why things are fighting go in expecting something fun and ridiculous and youll be pretty happy with this film
Jun 5 2019,positive,i loved the movie to death it was overwhelming and gave me massive anxiety cause i was so scared godzilla was gonna die the whole time lol i was so nervous and i teared up a lot cause i was excited  1010 would watch again a million more times go watch it ignore the critics
Jun 5 2019,negative,over produced  over actedcgi fest
Jun 5 2019,negative,i expected epic monster fighting and less dialogue and story lineswhat we got was exactly the opposite  too much bs and not enough fighting among the monsters   what a surprise another disappointing godzilla movie  shame on me for thinking this one was going to be different
Jun 5 2019,positive,i loved ever moment of it 
Jun 5 2019,positive,amazing movie i would say that the graphics were not as good as the last godzilla or kong but that was kinda expected from it being such a big movie the movie was still amazing even for the quality which is why i really hope the next movie they give it a larger budget because the movie would be just that much better
Jun 5 2019,positive,good special effects no need for the young girl to even be in the story line the cast was weak and not very convincing
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was a great movie better than the first one
Jun 5 2019,positive,honestly dont understand why the rating was so low it was a fun movie and i think the critics need to stop taking life so seriously 
Jun 5 2019,positive,they brought back a few of the monsters from the old japanese low budget awful tv shows this movie was fantastic i was thoroughly impressed
Jun 5 2019,positive,finally a monster focused movie i just wish the fights woudnt cut off for human nonsense
Jun 5 2019,positive,this is a giant monster fighting movie the plot is secondary
Jun 5 2019,positive,as someone who grew up loving godzilla films this film was an absolute blast  it has everything i fondly look back on  the cheesy lines the paper thin character development and the awesome monster fights    my fiancé and i actually watched this in 4dx and for anyone with the chance to do this i highly encourage it  would i have loved this film as much had i not seen it in a carnival ride atmosphere  yeah probably      as long as you dont take it seriously and ignore the plot holes time warps and amazing hubiris of scientists who expect to get everything right on their first attempts you will enjoy the spectacle that unfurls itself before you     personally i love a good bad film and i laughed constantly throughout this one at the cheesy lines and ridiculous choices  but just as often i was smiling and looking over at my fiancé who also was having a blast  basically if you are watching a godzilla film expecting macbeth you will be sorely disappointed but if you go in hoping for a far more impressive version of the godzilla films you grew up on this delivers like no other  one of the most fun movie experiences ive had in awhile 
Jun 5 2019,positive,its a monster movie with monster fights what more do you want idiots
Jun 5 2019,neutral,not a lot of fighting
Jun 5 2019,positive,i honestly think the critics have lost their minds this was a godzilla movie through and through as someone obsessed with all the original japanese films this was a gift 
Jun 5 2019,negative,over the top noise and nonsense  bad story line  weak lead roles
Jun 5 2019,positive,amazing fighting and music a must see
Jun 5 2019,positive,lets be honest no one is going to see these movies to see oscar nominated performances or even for a spectacular story your going for the special effects and all the monster action and with that it delivers enjoy it for what it is
Jun 5 2019,positive,at the end of the movie i heard claps and it shows that people really like the movie and there is no need for an individual person critic to doubt on that and thats why there is huge difference between audience and critic score one mind can only think one side
Jun 5 2019,positive,it causes eye oragasms
Jun 5 2019,positive,great and amazing experience
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved this movie i was pumped watching it 
Jun 5 2019,positive,fans of the original godzilla films will enjoy it the effects are great and the fights are cool casual people probably wont enjoy it as much
Jun 5 2019,positive,very great cant wait to see it in 3d
Jun 5 2019,positive,i got what i wanted giant monsters fighting other than a few cheesy scenes i was fine with the screen time the people got lol
Jun 5 2019,positive,amazing movie  great visual effectscgi  monsters looked great and fighting  watch this movie on the biggest screen possible  also rotten tomatoes dont know what they are talking about  go watch this movie and support it
Jun 5 2019,positive,if your a fan of the old godzilla monster movies then you will enjoy this even as you are reminded that no one ever went to a godzilla movie because of the quality of the acting  the environmentalist social commentary is also a bit over the top but if you can get past the drivel and just enjoy seeing all your old monster favorites  its fun
Jun 5 2019,positive,kaiju greatness the only complaint is that there isnt enough godzilla kicking kaiju butt oh and also the actors jokes arent really that funny to be honest overall great movie
Jun 5 2019,negative,this is a straight up 5 on the stink scale it was terrible
Jun 5 2019,positive,stupid human dialog against the backdrop of awesome monsters fighting
Jun 5 2019,positive,pretty good movie the kaiju designs are cool godzilla fans will enjoy the easter eggs i like where the story could go in the sequel but some of the fight scenes were hard to see because of extreme weather happening in the movie reminded me of the battle of winterfell but not as bad and i havent seen a girl with so much plot armor since aria at kings landing 
Jun 5 2019,positive,outstanding  explained a lot of the monster history processes etc  great plot great fightsim seeing it again
Jun 5 2019,positive,terrible acting and plot holes tight monster fights
Jun 5 2019,negative,not great but somewhat entertain
Jun 5 2019,positive,lots of action and great special effects much better than the first one
Jun 5 2019,positive,if you were fan of the creature feature movies of the 70s and 80s youll enjoy this
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie is really good if you are fan of the franchise you are going to join it
Jun 5 2019,negative,watched the whole thing and still dont know what it was about  pure garbage
Jun 5 2019,positive,if you like big monsters fighting this is a movie for you
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was a fun summer movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,good for godzilla tough to make a movie from a primitive plot i grew up with these movies 
Jun 5 2019,positive,so good saw it twice in one day
Jun 5 2019,positive,really liked the sequel looking forward to godzilla v kong
Jun 5 2019,negative,honestly the most retarded script i have ever seen i was rooting for the monsters to win humans were beyond stupid and so many laws of physics were conveniently ignored so much for godzillas innocence as they portrayed him on the edge of evil dont waste your money or time 
Jun 5 2019,negative,good lord this was one of the funniest movies ever except i dont think it was meant to be a comedy
Jun 5 2019,positive,the action scenes and visuals are amazing the best part about the film are the monsters for sure go into this film looking to have fun and watching monster eye candy 45 stars
Jun 5 2019,positive,went and saw this movie with my girlfriend it was fantastic super hype for the next movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,i dislike that the dad just knew that it was his daughter as a godzilla movie over all it was fantastic
Jun 5 2019,positive,great fun a little to long though
Jun 5 2019,positive,best american godzilla film yet critics are clueless special effects monster design and film score are all perfect it scratches the kaiju itch spectacularly with breathtaking monster fights and provides great fan service   the plot is totally fine and serviceable the story is an homage to classic kaiju films and is very appropriate and masterful in that context the only weak spots are a few bad bits of dialogue and bad acting by the father character    this is a must see film listen to the fans
Jun 5 2019,positive,lots of monster action loved it
Jun 5 2019,positive,awesome movie undermined by poor acting and a foul mouth from leading lady millie bobby brown in addition a story revolving around the idea that mankind is a virus upon the earth is trite and offensive
Jun 5 2019,negative,feel asleep during the movie first time that happened
Jun 5 2019,positive,always been a huge fan this movie was everything i hoped for
Jun 5 2019,negative,omfg what a waste of money i feel sorry for millie and mothra
Jun 5 2019,positive,everything i wanted to see even threw in a twist to keep you on your toes
Jun 5 2019,positive,great monsters but too much talk
Jun 5 2019,positive,a lot more monsters with a lot more action in this one setting up the battle of kings for the next one
Jun 5 2019,positive,fun movie the story is ok but the movie is fun
Jun 5 2019,positive,a strong follow up to the 2014 godzilla and features more and grander action sequences the third act proves to be strong again but the lack of screen time of godzilla is an issue that stems from the first film i again liked the human characters so didnt mind spending so much time with them however the best elements of the film were still the monster fights godzilla vs kong should be well worth the wait 
Jun 5 2019,negative,the acting and direction of the movie was terrible the movie couldve been cut shorter at least by 30 minutes to save us time of this awful film the second act was complete unnecessary the third act didnt make sense at all with so many flaws no king kong appearance all others were there but no kong eleven from stranger things was a typical on screen rebel child using foul language because thats who she is i guess the acting felt extremely fake
Jun 5 2019,neutral,the plot was all over the place the directing was slightly better than awful the action makes up for most flaws
Jun 5 2019,positive,great movie and the kids will enjoy it godzilla king of monsters go kick butt 
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was great dont listen to the critics the action scenes were over the top and very well done i also felt that the story was very well written it would make toho proud
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla was a bit weak
Jun 5 2019,positive,this is a godzilla movie it seems some people have forgotten that in past films over many years godzilla has demonstrated his ability to fly as well as turn himself into a magnet so any talk about or expectation of reality is hogwash here really the studio promised us a godzilla movie and they delivered brilliantly lets appreciate this film and this franchises existence its not supposed to be real its not supposed to be believable its supposed to be fun and so is the next one where kong undoubtedly will go all spider monkey on godzilla get me a good seat and pass the popcorn hang on tight honey were goin for a ride    
Jun 5 2019,positive,if you want that wow experience the kind the puts you on the edge of your seat bite ur fingers and forces you to hold your bladder for a ridiculous amount of time then this is the movie for you so much action and effects  that its impossible not to be in awe best movie of the year and definitely better than the first
Jun 5 2019,positive,epic never a dull moment even when there werent monsters on the screen one of the best movies weve seen
Jun 5 2019,positive,definitely delivers fullon monster action with a serviceable plot i grew up watching godzilla movies as a kid and my daughter can now share in the excitement
Jun 5 2019,positive,one of my best movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,exactly what i paid for long live the king
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla king of kings and queens of monsters that takes a licking and keeps on ticking  great family movie ignore the fandangians that gave this a bad review
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was great but i hoped they focused more on godzilla and other monsters instead of the humans story godzilla only came to the screen to save the day most of the time
Jun 5 2019,negative,a lot of noise drivel humans destroy the earth brainwashing mantra  need for reducing the population hogwash that made transformers jurassic world and other movies of its kind bearable youll also get a kickliterally in the genitals when the mythical judeochristian references to the very big lizard  moth are allegories for jesus mary savior king and god forcing the calvary cross scene cgi looked a bit rushed in a lot of phases throughout the movie you might want to bring a pair of boxing gloves because youll be punching the air hoping that one of your strikes would hit any character making i counted 100 a stupid decision that cost someone their lives too many lives lost and sometimes youre cheering for the monsters to kill off the main characters and not just unfortunate cities dang bostonvenezuelawhat did you do too piss off the director
Jun 5 2019,negative,horrible the story arc was prolonged and the characters had to relatable qualities that could be shared with the audience the movie is predictable and shouldnt have been made in the first place if you make a movie with a predictable ending then why make a movie at all
Jun 5 2019,positive,amazing spectacular the godzilla movie we have been waiting for out whole lives so coolll
Jun 5 2019,positive,movie was a great throwback to the old toho films all these idiots complaining about the human factor in this movie have never obviously watched a classic kaiju film mostly millennials that are angry that there wasnt a homosexual monster i guess
Jun 5 2019,positive,the balance of power with the use the titan creatures also known as godzilla and the others made this otherwise dull movie into a very interesting storyline the 3 headed dragon reminded me of hydra that was frozen in antarctica the sacrifice that several characters did in the movie was touching things come at a price im glad that i saw it in the big screen nature will one time in the future rid of humanity not by monsters but by a virus through an epidemic the sound of earthquakes special effects were very good 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie has good action and good cgi the characters are all rather enjoyable except for one in my opinion but i would definitely go watch it again
Jun 5 2019,positive,if you like seeing godzilla stomp dick in the dirt them go see it
Jun 5 2019,positive,an absolute must see if youre a godzilla fan it takes what little the 2014 movie got right and builds up on it way more kaiju action and its all pretty stunning has themes of environmentalism and humans shouldnt play god buuuuut if youve ever watched a godzilla movie or know anything about godzilla at all thats to be absolutely expected     go see this movie  
Jun 5 2019,positive,all of the monsters and the action including them are spectacular with nods to many previous films in the godzilla canon only true godzilla fans will get them of course so a lot of things will be lost on the casual viewer and apparently most film reviewers being published  the human characters are rather thinlydrawn with not much emotional investment but lets face it we see godzilla and other kaiju films for the monsters and their storylines the humans are incidental  mothra in particular is beautiful so beautiful in fact that i actually cried when she first appeared and again when she died  i will go see this at least two or three more times before it goes away
Jun 5 2019,neutral,the plot of the people is pretty terrible and theres a lot of judicious sacrificing but this movie also does a ton of cool stuff for the lore and plot of the world which was crazy good
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie is amazing i love it  is made to the public not for the critic the drama was ok but the action excellent  and the ggi damm good work  
Jun 5 2019,positive,incredible fighting monsters
Jun 5 2019,positive,the monster action was phenomenal the script couldve been betterbut was i really there for that no this movie kicked ass
Jun 5 2019,positive,was awesome was a lot better than i expected had a great story to it
Jun 5 2019,positive,i personally think that the cgi for mothra in the beginning was not the best however the cgi for godzilla more than made up for it
Jun 5 2019,positive,great movie that pays so much respect to the history that came before it
Jun 5 2019,positive,i loved the movie way better than the first one in 2014 the action between the monsters is incredible and what real fans want to see the lack of human drama is not a bother to a lot of people especially to the fans i really enjoyed this movie and would like for the next one to be similar to this one with a lot of monster fighting action
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved it action packed and great special effects godzilla vs king kong will be hard to pull off unless they team up against other titans
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved it  as a godzilla fan i feel like it fit into the universe really well  the cgi was amazing  you really got a sense of the size of each kaiju  the fights were awesome but i thought there would be more of them  the acting was pretty good as well
Jun 5 2019,positive,i enjoyed it more than i thought i would
Jun 5 2019,positive,the plot is silly and there are too many human characters but the special effects and cinematography are awesome when the monsters are actually fighting which is quite a bit
Jun 5 2019,positive,best godzilla movie by far  my wife and kids loved it
Jun 5 2019,negative,completely pathetic in every way if it wasnt for the comfortable chair i was sitting in i would have left in the first 35 minutes id like my money back in fact id like to pay double to have this movie removed from cinema altogether
Jun 5 2019,positive,very nice visuals and effects and good action scenes but the story feels a little bit rushed
Jun 5 2019,positive,personally all around great movie i loved that they tied the original godzilla movies into the movie i definitely recommend this for anyone who loved the original movies and if you can see it in 3d with 4dx features if optional
Jun 5 2019,positive,watching it in a rpx theather was awesome i was born in the fiftys so i grew up with godzilla
Jun 5 2019,positive,an amazing movie true kaiju fans will love  yeah i think were all aware of how unreliable critics are when it comes to a movie especially a franchise such as godzilla whose following isnt the average watcher  is it perfect  no  nothing is but i dont have to tell you to distrust the critics you already understand that  ive seen it twice already and im in love  cannot wait for its release to bluray
Jun 5 2019,positive,great scifi movie if youre into the genre
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla king of monsters was entertaining largely because of an interesting cast  the dark look made the special effects difficult to see and the monster fights hard to follow
Jun 5 2019,positive,i loved every single second of it it is feel with suspense drama and actionpack all in one i recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch it
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved it monster fights were phenomenal must watch
Jun 5 2019,positive,glad to see the film is more focused on godzilla and the other beast than the people highly recommenced
Jun 5 2019,positive,a fantastic follow up to the 2014 goji and a remarkable kaiju smackdown its full of glorious moments chocked full of spectacle and all accompanied by a fantastic score     this isnt shin godzilla but it is a fantastic godzilla flick 
Jun 5 2019,positive,you would be a fool to come to this movie expecting some great themes or some deeper meaning this film is for entertainment and thus i was thoroughly entertained
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters brings a thrilling experience especially if a fan of the original pieces although many describe it lacking in story if we connect it with its prior two relating pieces godzilla 2014 and kong skull island we can see its growing anticipation as any mcu movie would if you are not interested in such information the action and sequence of events in the movie is great for a weekend viewing 
Jun 5 2019,positive,a fun movie with plenty of eastereggs and callbacks to the long history of the godzilla franchise plays out like a loving tribute to mid to late showa era and heisei era godzilla films
Jun 5 2019,positive,yet another modern day film proving yet again that critics nowadays do not have the slightest idea what audiences actually enjoy and are in fact in all likelihood brain dead
Jun 5 2019,positive,loved it go see it in the theater
Jun 5 2019,negative,liked the monsters human characters were not well done every scene the actors played as wonderjoyterror repeat very flat
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie was awesome i love the godzilla king of the monsters 2019 
Jun 5 2019,positive,godzilla was awesome characters not that fleshed out and made most of then forgettable
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was awesome if you are a godzilla fangeek if you dont know godzilla well you may not be able to appreciate it as much
Jun 5 2019,negative,generic and predictable this movie is filled to the brim with action flick cliches and a bad storyline
Jun 5 2019,negative,the monster part was ok but whats wrong with the human part ruined the film making it a stupid family drama
Jun 5 2019,positive,rt new measurements to control audience scores to satisfy the studios are now entering into racism when they invalidate everyone outside the us  now this movie is the reason why you must ignore critics and see what you want  also the studios should have ignored criticsthose extra human drama scenes are necessary  let them fight 
Jun 5 2019,positive,big monsters fighting each other a 10 plot about a 4 overall a 6 out of 10 for me not the worst movie ive seen this year but not much more to say 
Jun 5 2019,positive,no spoilers reviewi enjoyed the movie as it was a great call back to the classic toho movies  i understand the critics many of whom have never watched many godzilla movies or some even one will call this movie bad but it simply is not  godzilla movies are more than the human drama or giant monster fights they are movies centered around the earth and how humans affect the planet directly or indirectly for good or ill  simply go and see the movie and enjoy yourself
Jun 5 2019,positive,movie was pretty good lots of good cgi and various monsters from godzilla storyline
Jun 5 2019,positive,a lot of action the movie flowed quickly
Jun 5 2019,positive,best movie ever 10 out of 10
Jun 5 2019,positive,go go godzilla wow what a movie loved every minute toho has done it again
Jun 5 2019,positive,its better than most reviews are saying monsters fighting  are awesome has nostalgic music from the original series and has a couple jump up from your seat moments
Jun 5 2019,positive,go watch this movie it was awesome im not sure what critics want anymore
Jun 5 2019,positive,giant monsters fighting
Jun 5 2019,negative,solid cgi effects and interesting concept squandered by an extremely dumb script full of characters with weak or nonsensical motivations that all seem to serve a single purpose get giant monsters to fight each other however the giant monster fights are not even all that prevalent in the movie only making up about 1520 of the film the other 80 is essentially just characters in various war rooms yelling at each other about what to do nobody really develops or changes throughout the story and most characters are just onenote stereotypes that have zero sense of selfpreservation and are constantly putting both themselves and the lives of millions of people at risk just to stage another monster fight
Jun 5 2019,positive,great special affects story line was ok im old school godzilla fan of the originals
Jun 5 2019,positive,a true fan of big g will love this legendary sequel to the 2014 film best to see in imax
Jun 5 2019,positive,big monster fights great
Jun 5 2019,positive,came strong with the origin did what tanaka said they would eventually do tell a better human story
Jun 5 2019,neutral,this is the type of movie where you wait for all the godzilla fight scenes to be uploaded to youtube the humans in this movie besides ken watanabes character are completely forgettable i cant remember a single name of any of the characters and they spend a lot of time on these humans to the point that they still interrupt godzillas fights with human nonsense let godzilla fight uninterrupted to the viewers eyes godzilla does get a lot more screen time which is why i still recommend seeing this but be prepared to be bored while waiting for the action because the plot is soboring
Jun 5 2019,positive,this was another great film from michael doughtery 100 times better then the last godzilla film by a long stretch so long as you suspend your disbelief about survivable situations and hold out through the human characters the fight scenes and monster effects make it worth it
Jun 5 2019,positive,so much better than endgame 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i fucking loved it 
Jun 5 2019,positive,character build up was very blah but movie was okay more of a wait till it releases on streaming type movie
Jun 5 2019,negative,it was the worse of the last 20 godzilla movies i have ever seenand the previous ones were really bad
Jun 5 2019,positive,i expected a movie where i got to see godzilla fight other giant monsters and you know what i got what i paid for this was a good kaiju movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,sure its not the most smartly written plot or dialogue but theres plenty of nods to past goji movies and it gives all the smashmouth kaiju action youd want sometimes its okay to embrace your inner 8 year old
Jun 5 2019,positive,great visuals old time monster movie all the big name monsters were there
Jun 5 2019,positive,this was an one of the wildest things ever put on film the best godzilla film ever made i enjoyed every second of it walked out of the theater feeling like a kid again bring on godzilla vs kong
Jun 5 2019,positive,this is what gfans like myself have been waiting for this movie gives us some of the greatest fight scenes in any godzilla film ever
Jun 5 2019,positive,hollywood finally got it right this godzilla packed the right punch with the top 3 nemises that the old school preached the hidden easter eggs were a nice touch if you watched the original godzillas you get it  if not your probably looking for some bleeding heart story line that some chick flick could equally give you godzilla brings it this time earth splitting sky ripping bone crunching bring on more
Jun 5 2019,positive,not as bad as the critics mention i dont mind the human dialog and plot at the beginning but towards the end we need to see more monster fighting and less humans who just get in the way and why is godzilla so fat trim him down the effects were really good but dark if your a fan then definitely go see it sets you up for next one 
Jun 5 2019,positive,its a great movie great story love it will see it again soon
Jun 5 2019,negative,the story was stupid
Jun 5 2019,positive,great popcorn flick the kaiju king is back kong v godzilla lets go
Jun 5 2019,positive,i have no clue what some of these credits are talking about the movie is really good with combination of people and monster fight the monsters look freaking awesome and the story is good i really enjoyed this movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,definitely good lots of action
Jun 5 2019,positive,did not disappoint monster action was top notch and the lore of the creatures was well done in an homage to the original films
Jun 5 2019,positive,king of the monsters is full of thrills and wild visuals the human side plot is silly and dumb which is enjoyable to laugh about throughout the movie    gives you time to breathe in between fights and is interesting enough to watch with or without knowledge of this universe     if youre into monsters explosions and dastardly villains both human and animal look no further    i had a lot of fun and so will you
Jun 5 2019,positive,i absolutely love love love this movie nonstop action
Jun 5 2019,positive,fantastic kaiju movie epic battles top score loved the cast so many cool easter eggs and call backs from the classic godzilla flicks see it on the big screen
Jun 5 2019,positive,the movie was everything a godzilla fan could ask for if you are a fan of the old movies you must go watch this movie
Jun 5 2019,positive,dinosaurs and laser beams what more can you ask for
Jun 5 2019,negative,it was a messthe plot was muddy and plodding  it was waaaay too long for the content  if i could go negative stars i would  the cgi was impressive but thats about all that was  the talents of the cast were wasted on this movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie for anyone who felt there wasnt enough of godzilla fighting action in the 2014 movie the 2019 movies plot is something toho would have actually used so its a great adaptation for the american audience excellent remix of the original godzilla theme that pays homage to the icon something left out in the 2014 movie and mothra ghidorah and rodan were all done very well and look great the cgi was great and never felt like it took me out from the movie dont listen to the critics who walk into a monster mash movie expecting godfather level writing and acting nobody watches a godzilla movie for the human story but even still this movie makes you care about the sacrifice of a particular character 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i thought it was a little slow with the storyline but when the monsters fought outstanding
Jun 4 2019,positive,monsters killing each other 
Jun 4 2019,positive,not enough time on the monsters and too much time on the humans it was a good movie that brought back thoughts of my childhood and toei studios made this movie made me smile even harder
Jun 4 2019,positive,a love letter to the kaiju films of the past an absolute must see for any godzilla fan
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie  nonstop action  too much plot and people as always but lots of monsters  just a bit strange that godzilla fought no one other than ghidorah
Jun 4 2019,positive,this is why you go to the movies see it on as big as a screen as you can spectacular action and has set a new standard for scale and visual effects story was slightly mundane but overall interesting and am excited that these characters will be returning for the sequel 
Jun 4 2019,positive,all i can say is that i was very satisfied with this film if you are going to see this movie for action pack fighting and explosions and roars you will absolutely enjoy it
Jun 4 2019,positive,not the biggest godzilla fan went with friends  was a good monster movie and our friends seemed to really enjoy it
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie is good but too many plot twists overall the movie is perfect and has a 
Jun 4 2019,positive,prefer the older movies to the cgi
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome experience the correct correlation between human interaction and dialogue and other world creature action scenes highly recommended
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was well made enjoyed the homage to the old movies great cast and good story
Jun 4 2019,positive,why did this movie do poor at the box officewho knew that it was out   i go to the movies 3 times a week every week i only saw one trailer in imax  at a showing of shazami didnt see anything on tv till the 31st and that was on unkown cable channel there was alot online if you googled godzilla but lots of people dont do that anyhow i loved this movie people were on the edge of their seat with their hands to their mouths at times plenty of smiles when the original toho music played see it in dolby or imax
Jun 4 2019,negative,big disappointment  worse plot in movie history 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved it clearly 60  of the pro reviewers have no idea what a godzilla movie is supposed to be i mean this was a like a love letter to godzillakaiju fans
Jun 4 2019,negative,this was the worst movie i have seen in the theater in years
Jun 4 2019,positive,great us godzilla movie finally godzilla is alive and well and is shown in the first 5 minutes of the movie please do not miss scene after credits
Jun 4 2019,positive,i thought it was great  we cant wait to go watch it again 
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was fantastic if youre a fan of classic godzilla from your childhood this is the movie for you  king of the monsters is exactly that a mpvie about who the king of the monsters is dont come to this film expecting a religiously compelling story its about the kaiju
Jun 4 2019,positive,humans are okay but the monster action is phnomenal
Jun 4 2019,positive,people complained about not enough monsters in the last one then complain about the human characters in this one maybe if everyone could make up their minds about what they want in a giant monster movie the studio could make something for everyone      like most of the audience who went to see this i had a great time the only mistake of the film was centering the film around the stupidest adult woman of all time played by vera rather than the intelligent and potentially much more compelling dr chen character every character in this suffers from a lack of backstory and motivation to make the audience side with them    only dr serizawa or dr chen were sufficiently interesting enough but at least the fights were jawdropping especially in dolby    too bad the political subtext layer in this film will be lost on most people who dont take the time to connect the dots
Jun 4 2019,negative,reminded me of the saturdayafternoon blackandwhite movies id watch on tv when i was a kid  the monsters were definitely the stars and the human actors should all be nominated for razzies  the only movie i can think of that felt as campy as this is howard the duck  i bought my ticket at the theaters regaledwards box office
Jun 4 2019,positive,this is a spectacular kaiju movie not filled with human drama  but i did not go see this opening night and again on sat for the humans 
Jun 4 2019,positive,the best way an american adaptation could have come out reminiscent of the originals whilst keeping with the new flavours added by the 2014 film it succeeds all the monsters are perfectly displayed and given their moments to shine the humans are not as focused on but thats not why you come to a godzilla film
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie was awesome better then the first one you should definitely go see it
Jun 4 2019,negative,i thought the special effects in 3d were ok  story a little slow
Jun 4 2019,positive,phenomenal everything i wanted from a godzilla movie and more great performances from the cast and kaiju i cant wait to see it again and i cant wait to see more from the monsterverse
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie i like how it went with the more mystical side of the godzilla lore if you are thinking about seeing this film whether you are a fan or not go see it and judge for yourself stop listening to negative reviews
Jun 4 2019,positive,pure adrenaline fueled monster mayhem
Jun 4 2019,negative,dear god please save me from this havent seen this awful a movie in years terrible confusing boring and 2 hours too long 
Jun 4 2019,neutral,cool graphics weak story line super weak dialog
Jun 4 2019,positive,good overall story need more monster fights
Jun 4 2019,negative,absolute disgrace i will never get those 2 hours back 
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was good but not great acting was good go vera
Jun 4 2019,positive,ive seen all godzilla movies since i was a child they made the reboot of this movie awesome im waiting for godzilla vs kong movie
Jun 4 2019,negative,too over the top inappropriate cursing
Jun 4 2019,positive,lots of action and creatures  our family really enjoyed this movie
Jun 4 2019,negative,disliked some horror scify movies rely on darkness for intense scenes and that was true of godzilla unfortunately when done so much there are very little quality tines of seeing the star attraction i would not recommend this movie i would suggest that one would enjoy the guy who played godzilla in the rubber suit back in the 1970s
Jun 4 2019,positive,ministers were great it overcame the human part but ghidorah was excellent
Jun 4 2019,positive,absolutely what godzilla fans wanted the cgi is fantastic the plot really hits home for fans of the original godzilla fans
Jun 4 2019,positive,purely epic been a fan of japans kaiju toho monster movies since the 80s  im pleased with the creativity  environmentrelated themes shown in the conception of this movie a mustsee experience my personal rating is 810
Jun 4 2019,positive,this is a monster brawl movie and an exceptional one  straight to the action decent plot good actors a little humor and lots of destruction  
Jun 4 2019,positive,a cool giant mosters movie everything you would like in a godzilla movie  if you want a movie abot humans instead of monsters you can go to the 1998 version
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved all the monsters and how the head grew back on the dragon but i didnt like that motha died
Jun 4 2019,positive,tons of action great fight scenes
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the whole movie
Jun 4 2019,negative,this movie does not dare to be great or good  i think it shouldve tried  
Jun 4 2019,positive,fell asleep three times
Jun 4 2019,positive,action action action if you dont love this movie for its fun and atmosphere you probably dont love anything
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was amazing one of the best ive seen this year 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i am a huge godzilla fan im 52 years old and i grew up with godzilla this movie is most definitely better than the last one that hollywood tried to produce the united states have come a long way trying to produce godzilla films but we still take a back seat to the japanese when it comes to making godzilla films
Jun 4 2019,positive,seeing movie in a dolby cinema made the whole experience a must see movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,the poor story telling and mediocre acting took away from the movie would have loved to see less story and more action the visuals were remarkable and the fights were badass the monster battles and visuals are the only thing that made this movie entertaining
Jun 4 2019,positive,only taking a star away because the mom was pissing me off lol good movie tho 
Jun 4 2019,positive,the cutaways to human drama during the monster fights really killed the excitement of seeing two big creatures slug it out
Jun 4 2019,positive,a love letter to godzilla and the monster movie genre 
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome movie i love it
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla proved he is the king of monsters all the monsters where top notch there is human stuff in there but do you really care i mean seriously the story was better put together this time long live the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,monster fights and a good amount of them
Jun 4 2019,negative,special effects were good but it was inconsistent and just too absurd at times
Jun 4 2019,positive,all that and godzilla    absolutely spoton commentary although its not a perfect film gkotm is a truly remarkable godzilla film anyone who is remotely a fan of the decadesold franchise should adore king of the monsters imho the myths are finally real larger than life and radiationfired just like spiderman and the incredible hulk the men in the rubber suits and the folks pulling tailwires can take five and grab a coffeedanish because 21stcentury cgi wizards have made destroy all monsters look as marvelous and believable as avengers 14 or the average disney star wars film    yes its that good and the special effects are effectively special    but not a whit better dont go nuts at the end of the day this is still a godzilla film but far better than the 2014 outing  or the average outing  and ultimately i have to say its glorious stupendous even right up there with gojira and shin godzilla gkotm definitely delivers the goods for those who are into this kind of thing the personalitybrimming kaiju are spectacular and the movie speeds along right from its exhilarating start decent pacing and poignantenough consideration for its environmentalist theme and 25dimensional characters and then theres godzilla mothra ghidorah rodan and friends have i already said stupendous epic mythic magnificent maybe not all of those but its easily one of the most stupendous godzilla films ever made
Jun 4 2019,positive,i dont know if its the fact that i saw it in 4dx but this movie is stunning to watch
Jun 4 2019,positive,not sure what the critics were wanting or expecting but any godzilla fan will enjoy this lots of good godzilla action and stays true to the spirit of the old movies 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved this movie in so many ways they truly captured the personality of each kaiju and the battle scenes were superfun the use of the monsters theme music was perfect to elevate the moments and the flick wasnt dragged down by human storylines  which to me is important and was the downfall of the 2014 godzillla people go to godzilla movies to see kaiju battles stomping and smashing and this one delivers i absolutely plan on seeing it again really really enjoyable 
Jun 4 2019,positive,for me its the best 2019 movie 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie immensely im no critic but if you want to watch some giant monsters fight or if you love older godzilla movies go see this
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters best godzilla movie imo the kaiju fights were amazing its what the people asked for and the directors listened to us i highly recommend you seeing it
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you are looking for a monster slugfest this is your movie if you are looking for easter eggs galore this is your movie if you are looking for tie ins to kong skull island this is your movie   the plot borrows from previous godzilla movies especially godzilla vs biollante with ecoterrorists releasing a specific monster godzilla and ghidorah duke it out for title of king rodan which side will he join mothra what will she do several of the cast return from the previous movie and get to do the same from the last movie a family is involved again but they have more interesting complications   i enjoyed the movie bring your earplugs it gets loud the music at the end is a blast from the past
Jun 4 2019,positive,very good specialeffects took me back to the old days
Jun 4 2019,positive,i was on the edge of my seat for most of the showgodzilla didnt disappoint
Jun 4 2019,positive,complete turn around from the last godzilla many more monster fights more characters i care about and in the end an over all satisfying film exactly what i wanted to see 
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie took transformers and pacific rim plus king kong and created a visual masterpiece    giant monsters versus giant monsters    if you expected story the heck ist this your first godzilla in a forty year old franchise
Jun 4 2019,positive,i am a long time godzilla fan so the review could be slightly biased although i will try to keep it level headed     godzilla movies have always been about 1 thing and 1 thing only mayhem and giant monsters battling it out     on that note this movie delivers plenty of action sequences around every corner exactly what you expect from this sort of monster mash the fight scenes were awesome and the monsters all looked as good as they ever have godzilla definitely becomes someone you want to cheer for and at one point feel sympathetic towards     however the one thing these movies have never been about are well thought out storylines and again following with tradition while personally to me the storyline wasnt awful it also was not good     also just like the 2014 movie this one has way too much human screen time the plot centers way too much around the human characters and their actionschoices which personally i could care less about just keep feeding me the monster fights     at the end of the day i thoroughly enjoyed the battles actions scenes and seeing godzilla show why he is the king however for upcoming movies i hope they focus more on the monsters and less on random human storylines that i could care less about espeacially when the writing does nothing to make me feel like i should care about them     just keep feeding us the monsters
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved the entire movie and despite the movie critics saying there less humans to the movie it was more then the first godzilla movie it also gave a small history lesson throughout the movie of the titans
Jun 4 2019,positive,as a fan of the godzilla franchise i greatly enjoyed seeing a fully realized american godzilla film that clearly respects the source material
Jun 4 2019,positive,worth a watch entertaining but probably not worth the ticket price in hindsight id have waited for netflix or cable
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it the character story isnt what i went for so im not fussed i dont think you can have a character story in a movie like this but what they did have was good looks like they listened to the fans following all of godzillas 10minutes of screen time in 2014    well done to legendary for chucking it all together for the fans fast paced lots of action great fx and adding to the ever expanding monster verse  one for the fans
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you liked kong skull island youll really like godzilla way better than the 1990s godzilla 
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the monster fights but unlike all the critics saying theres to much fighting and not enough dialogue was a lie there was a nice balance to it would see again
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a masterpiece great movie and godzilla the main character is well developed and has more screentime in his own movie the visual are breathtaking best cgi in a movie so far and dont eve start in the sound quality simply awesome 1010
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it  curious about what happened to giant butterfly still
Jun 4 2019,positive,amazing stop reading this and go see it
Jun 4 2019,negative,as a godzilla fan my whole life has been dominated by the king of the misters as a grown man i have many godzilla action figures decorating my house after reading critic reviews i decided  to go into this movie optimistic and forgiving however i had the overwhelming felling that the badass fight scenes could have been done much better they simply didnt live up to the potential the critics were right in about the direction writing and acting all of it was just hot garbage outside of that if you are like me an extremely huge godzilla nerd that is just gonna say screw it i dont care im gonna see this movie please dear god listen to me director michael dougherty proclaims himself to be a kiju grows twice the size of godzilla holds him down and viciously rapes him it scarred me for life and the cgi was only soso
Jun 4 2019,positive,the action was pretty awesome  i think some of the acting was a bit off at points
Jun 4 2019,positive,when i was much younger i watched all of the great monster movies godzilla rodin the gargantuans and more i was very excited to see the new godzilla and this movie did not disappoint
Jun 4 2019,negative,this is the most boring movie i have ever seen if there is an option of giving 0 stars i would the plot is ridiculously childish i felt humiliated after sitting in the movie theatre and watching it from the beginning to the end it feels like the plot is purposefully extended to suit the need ofi dont even know what 
Jun 4 2019,positive,phenomenal special effects
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla never disappoints  exactly what i was looking for  bigger and better than 40 years ago  still awesome go go see godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,the fights were good anyone who said the fights were too dark need to go an eye doctor or theater with better projectors
Jun 4 2019,positive,was the best movie to date for godzilla blew the last one out of the water cant wait for godzilla vs king kong
Jun 4 2019,positive,the critics do not understand what they are talking about the human drama was really good everything was very visible exposition dumps about meaningless technobabble were only a handful of words per subject and the lack of human presence reflects the cosmic horror that these creatures represent we are but ants to them utterly inconsequential
Jun 4 2019,positive,i came to watch the kaiju fights and got the best ones 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i thought it would be corny but my son wanted to see it so of course we went actually pleasantly surprised well done
Jun 4 2019,positive,everything youd expect from a monster movie action drama and lots of cool effects sets up the next big film godzilla vs kong
Jun 4 2019,positive,pretty good  my son and husband enjoyed he movie  always a fan of godzilla movies
Jun 4 2019,positive,would not expect less bow down to the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,all out monster action
Jun 4 2019,positive,um its a godzilla movie its a good godzilla movie if you enjoyed the old godzilla movies youll like this just good godzilla fun plenty more battles to be had
Jun 4 2019,positive,definitely for godzilla fans loved the fight scenes mothra was amazing story line was a bit boring but who cares it was all godzilla
Jun 4 2019,neutral,super fun action definitely more godzilla which is what we asked for ghidora cgi was terrible human characters were just the worst didnt hate it but not much to love
Jun 4 2019,positive,very impressed with the visual effects story line kinda fell short but the titans were unbelievable and exactly what i was hoping to see
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a fantastic monster film amazing effects and amazing action however i would not go into this movie expecting a good story this movie is primarily about the monster fights and it delivers a mustsee for any godzilla fan
Jun 4 2019,positive,very good popcorn movie i liked it 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i enjoyed it turned my brain off and watched a good monster flick the human family stuff i could of done without but godzilla made up for that crap
Jun 4 2019,positive,there were 17 titans awake and only 4 made it to film
Jun 4 2019,positive,as an avid godzilla fan seeing all most every godzilla movie made this film was fantastic mothra was absolutely amazing rodan was great king ghidorah was terrifying and godzilla was just amazing and spectacular the plot was ok the humans were  a bit boring but its a godzilla movie so much more focus on him then in the 2014 movie if you truly want to see godzilla in all his glory you will love this movie 
Jun 4 2019,positive,just art compairing it with thw first one or the shin version
Jun 4 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this movie general audiences and kaiju fans will both love it the theater i saw it in had a great time so go see it in imax with a big crowd
Jun 4 2019,positive,its good  id recommend it its good  id recommend it
Jun 4 2019,positive,big monsters cheesy story but those monster fights and visuals were awesome
Jun 4 2019,positive,remember the stars of this movie isnt the actors  its godzilla and the monsters  the critics dont get it  godzilla movies are built around anti nukes and godzilla being the anti hero  the other monsters were represented perfectly and there are a ton of easter eggs that only godzilla fans will notice   twin fairies mothra stuff  i dont wanna give anything away here but if you know the storylines for these creatures you will be happy with how it was done  they also managed to keep the themes with bear mccreary not changing them too much  best american version of godzilla and you wont be disappointed
Jun 4 2019,positive,an awesome movie with great action everything you could want out of a godzilla movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,anything involving the human story
Jun 4 2019,positive,if youre in for the kaiju fights then its all good all though it was kinda an epilepsyfest but the acting was meh and the story and logic of the story didnt make sense sometimes but lets be honest you mostly came for the big monster fight and thats all good on that note movie delivered the cgi was amazing and the fights were pretty good overall a nice movie to watch
Jun 4 2019,positive,much better than the first movie in 2014 loved the music from many of the original movies  godzilla mothers and rodan
Jun 4 2019,positive,weak story good action
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie is a fun monster romp with a few minor underlying themes  i loved the vfx and the personalities the monsters displayed  go see it and enjoy
Jun 4 2019,negative,awful human characters and some decent action nothing to write home about i wanted to see more monster action than i got the focus on the cardboard human characters lets down the movies entertainment value
Jun 4 2019,positive,good fun long live the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,hail to the king baby what were people expecting the godfather part 2 of kaiju movies the whole concept is b movie through and through and this is a 150 million dollar b movie absolutely baffled at the bad reviews take it for what it is entertaining brainless popcorn nonsense it doesnt aspire to be anything else and delivers on that premise oh and it looks fantastic 
Jun 4 2019,positive,the action and visuals were very good and in my opinion the best scenes were the ones that included mothra and rodan the human story is pretty bad with tons of plot holes and there are a few shameless callbacks to older godzilla films done wrong it is a good watch and i had fun with it otherwise cant take the story too seriously for a godzilla movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,captured the ridiculous spirit of the original toho films with great sense of self awareness taking what is in essence a b movie plot which is all you can reasonably ask from a monster movie and giving it the stunning visual effects required to deliver a film better than its 2014 successor in every possible way 
Jun 4 2019,positive,brings me back to when i used to watch the movies when i was a child it brought the presence back into the monsterverse with the beautiful and detailed representation of each monster
Jun 4 2019,positive,greatest godzilla movie ever
Jun 4 2019,positive,monsterkaiju stuff amazing humantroped to death family drama stuff in the middle of the world falling apart some of the most cringe inducing moments i can recall in recent cinema      before you say it yes i am aware no one goes to monster movies for the human drama but this ish is inserted into so much of the film and it just ruins the vibe the film had going for it i got all teary eyed when one of the kaiju was taken down i felt nothing for the human counterparts sacrificealthough they had one that was almost perfect up until the actual moment and then ruined with a michael bayesque explosion     if you want to see beautifully rendered over the top awesome kaiju fights do yourself a favor and go see this in cinemas  
Jun 4 2019,positive,way more monster fights than the first one while the cgi can be iffy once or twice its an absolute romp the human bits can be dry and boring but even a few of thrm were really good an absolute movie for the fans dont miss the afer credits
Jun 4 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movies yet my son loved it and has seen it twice
Jun 4 2019,negative,it was entertaining but the dialogue seemed poorly written to much talk and to few scenes with the monsters i thought they did a good job pay homage to the original godzilla films by playing some of the traditional godzilla music id recommend seeing it though after all it is godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,dumb movie but in a good way
Jun 4 2019,positive,great effects fabulous development of the monsters human character development on thin side as usual mothras contribution to saving the planet goes underappreciated
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved and enjoyed every single minute of this movie critics reviews are overrated
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it  could use less human screen time though
Jun 4 2019,negative,as predicted put me to sleep so left after 45 minutes
Jun 4 2019,positive,as a child of the 70s i loved watching the titans duke it out on saturday mornings  to see them as an adult in full glorious cgi beauty is a sight to behold and will thrill the kid in you  however the story of the people interwoven within the story leave a lot to be desired  but for sure thrill factor it is an adventure worth taking  and now im ready for next years ultimate throwdown on skull island
Jun 4 2019,positive,great film for long time godzillakaiju fan love the monster designs
Jun 4 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics their reviews are total bs  this movie is amazing and the cgi is breathtaking they really took their time on this movie  im going to see it again forsure
Jun 4 2019,positive,i was hoping for a big monster brawl and i was pleasantly surprised when i actually got that godzilla should always be the main character and humans should be side and supporting characters who are put after the supporting monsters the movie actually treats godzilla like a main character and the humans didnt ruin the movie like the 2014 one where they decided to barely show godzilla at all i had a lot of fun and as for reviews saying it was too loud its a giant monster fight movie not a quiet place its going to be loud and it was great
Jun 4 2019,positive,the human story is kinda boring and honestly disposable but the monster part os amazing and really worth the ticket 
Jun 4 2019,positive,just what i wanted in a godzilla movie monsters and battles 100 improvement over the last movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,we finally got the godzilla theme song back i am blessed  but honestly this one felt so much better than the 2014 godzilla it was more enjoyable there was less of the stupid human drama although it still existed and more of the giant monster battles we actually came to see the movie for some of the monsters were tweaked from their original designs and sounds but honestly after having seen almost every single godzilla movie from the era of the men in suits this movie was wonderful it had so much more of the original godzilla soul to it it felt more like they cared about this one  im glad with all the changes they made im happy they acknowledged the source material and im happy it wasnt all just focused on freaking california
Jun 4 2019,positive,better then the first
Jun 4 2019,positive,great battles between the monsters kinda long brake after fights would watch again
Jun 4 2019,positive,what an awesome movie with godzilla facing off against some scary monsters and you cant help but get caught up in the edge of your seat fight scenes and godzilla laying the smack down on the three headed monster 
Jun 4 2019,positive,the reviews on this film are nothing short of a hit job 
Jun 4 2019,positive,honestly what are these so call critics looking for this is a monster movie and a good one by far not citizen cane or gone with the wind type movie cant wait for the next installment king vs god
Jun 4 2019,positive,freaking awsome so many great moments the soundtrack and cgi was great the humans werent as bad as people say dont listen to the critic score and watch the movie you will not be dissapointed
Jun 4 2019,positive,it is a very big movie classic characters fill the screen good rollicking fun
Jun 4 2019,positive,this is your down and dirty big monster fight and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that if you are a cinema snob dont bother and go back to your french love dramas that make zero sense if you like action and a good movie here ya go
Jun 4 2019,positive,my son and i loved it  my son is a huge godzilla fan  he has watched all the old godzilla movies and knew all the monsters names  he loved this movie and wants the blu ray for christmas already so he can watch it again
Jun 4 2019,positive,exactly what a kaiju movie should be a lot of fun to watch and i love that they brought back the proper godzilla theme dont listen to the critics go watch the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,epic movie and if you watch it go big watching it at a   regular movie theater does it no justice  see it imax baby
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was ok for what it was
Jun 4 2019,positive,boy godzilla has beefed up great monster movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was awesome loved the special effects and the storyline too
Jun 4 2019,positive,it could have more kaiju battle action and less human forgettable story
Jun 4 2019,positive,very exciting kept me watching to see what was coming up next
Jun 4 2019,positive,critics arguing that the human characters feel weak in scope to the pure monster insanity have clearly never seen any other godzilla film besides the 2014 and 1998 american versions the series is well known to have some of the weakest human subplots known to man with the exception of a few films in the franchise ex the heisei series the film offers what many fans were missing from the 2014 film proper monster action the film offers a great escape that just keeps on pulling dont expect a casa blanca or citizen kane of giant monster films to come out of here just go watch godzilla 1954 or shin godzilla if youre looking for passable human characters
Jun 4 2019,positive,good story and action although the scene with the monsters can get a little blurry at times with all the action
Jun 4 2019,positive,first off let me say that the critics were unnecessarily bias towards this movie in their refusal to simply have a good time  there is more depth and scope to characters and plot then what they would lead you to believe and it wasnt the so called jumbled mess of a plot that they claim it to be  its not perfect nor is it as bad as the critics say  its a godzilla movie and a good one not shakespeare  for crying out loud  they story did move along at a nice pace and character interactions did in fact add to the over experience  all the creatures were perfectly rendered and distinctive in their roles   the visuals were astounding  
Jun 4 2019,negative,horribly written and clumsily acted  the first one was so good  what happened  way too cliche and frankly boring even with all the cgi monsters you could ever dream of  too bad
Jun 4 2019,negative,so the complaint about the first godzilla in 14 was too many humans and not enough monsters fighting guess what the studio doubled down on that premise in the sequel and the humans are worse in this one this movie in one word disappointing
Jun 4 2019,positive,critics arent lying  the human drama isnt great but as a lifelong godzilla fan cheesyrobotic dialogue and somewhat silly plot elements are the least of my concerns when going to see a godzilla film the monster action isnt flawless as there is still a lot of cuttingaway to human antics and sometimes the endless hurricane murkiness can be a bit much but i nonetheless found it extremely satisfying they did these creatures justice and they have come a long way from rubber suits though those old toho flicks will always have a special place in my heart the cgi is excellent the setpieces are exciting to behold and the final battle brought out my inner childish glee and reminded me of what sparked my love for these films in the first place there are certain things such as framing the monsters from a humans pov that gareth edwards did better in his 2014 version but overall i found kotm a more satisfying overall experience the monster action was paced pretty well and bridged with exposition scenes lots and lots of exposition scenes go into this movie with the right expectations that the monster parts will be great and the human parts merely bearable and you will most likely have a blast
Jun 4 2019,positive,the nuke scene didnt make a lot of sense
Jun 4 2019,positive,this was easily my favorite movie go see this movie for yourself dont listen to what haters say they are not fans of the franchise
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie was amazing i wanted to see a movie about giant monsters fighting and i saw a movie about giant monsters fighting the sound design and special effects were top notch and because i saw it in imax whenever godzilla roared i felt it in my bones which was amazing they really took the biggest criticisms from the first godzilla movie to heart both the fact that the first movie was plagued by too much human drama and the fact that you couldnt see much of the actual giant monsters fighting and they fixed it in this movie you got to see the monsters fight very clearly and they cut down on the human drama
Jun 4 2019,positive,really enjoyed it finally a fun godzilla movie made in the usa
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you are after a compelling story with a great narrative and to be emotionally invested in the human characters  this isnt the movie for you if you like big monsters epic fights and destruction this is the perfect kaiju romp for you you dont go to a godzilla movie for the story it isnt without its flaws but its pretty damn close to being a perfect western godzilla movie in my opinion 
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie awesome monster action best godzilla movie yet
Jun 4 2019,positive,one of the best movies ive seen by far
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla kotm is what it promised to be and more is that so wrong throughout the history of this icons run in pop culture muh story was never a focal point in regards to analyzing these films of course the movie shouldnt be just a 2 hour monster wrestlemania show i understand that but this movie is much more than a monster mash the unnecessarily expository scenes are very much the opposite we complained about there being no depth to the last films protagonist aaron taylor johnson but here when the main human characters have valid reasons to do what they do and compelling motives its still bad are we watching the same movie here there isnt a single lackluster performance from anyone in this film the monsters portray so much emotion through their facial expressions and body language that it blew my expectations out of the water as much as i love this movie it is not without its faults yes if were going that route story isnt spielberg levels of intricate certain plot points seem to be rushed and vanish just as quick as they came mothra for example couldve used a lot more screen time and build up to what she does at the end but that is a minuscule nitpick in the grand scheme of things speaking of grand the visuals and musical score in this film is outstanding its one thing to listen to it online its a whole other ballgame to see the action accompanying it brilliant score breathtaking visuals and cinematography excellent performances and a simple yet satisfying story gives this film the praise from the fans it deserves long live the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,it delivered what i was looking for  the titans were well done  not a deep movie but was never intended to be
Jun 4 2019,positive,one of the greatest monster movies of all time they did godzilla justice  the critics are a bunch of negative nancies and doubtful are godzilla fans if you are a fan of giant monster movies fan of godzilla you will be satisfied with this movie the action is great with a solid story line i always want more godzilla but im content
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie was dry  too much fate fighting with the animals
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters improves upon the gareth edwards 2014 godzilla whilst still retaining some of its beautiful visual elements having recently watched some of the wellknown showa and heisei era gojira films certainly elevated my enjoyment of this one     the titans themselves are beautiful awesome and inspire fear and hope they are elemental forces of nature imbued with rawness and yet are evolved they are true to the spirit in a way that the japanese films treated them but were found to be a little wanting in terms of having their own personas like godzilla does at least this is a welcome change i felt from the more recent monster movies like pacific rim jurassic world and their respective sequels indeed the films hesitancy of calling them monsters itself is telling of their representation    many kaiju movie fans i know are unhappy with the secondary characters but given a long laundry list of useless secondary characters weve seen in recent blockbuster movies involving largescale destruction  the most egregious offenders being jurassic world  fallen kingdom independence day resurgence the hobbit trilogy pacific rim uprising to name just a few even guillermo del toros pacific rim and the previous monsterverse film kong skull island had quite terrible secondary characters with the latter having a completely phonedin performance by the amazing brie larson indeed the secondary human characters in kotm are at par with its better japanese counterparts if not better or worse    in some of the interviews director michael dougherty and composer bear mccreary have clearly expressed a fondness and respect for the original movies especially the iconic scoretheme composed by akira ifukube and boy does that show in this film again this works to elevate the vision edwards and composer alexandre desplat had with the 2014 movie    so all in all i think the monsterverse and kotm specifically are surely part of the zeitgeist thematically culturally and cinematically
Jun 4 2019,negative,worst movie ive seen since attack of the killer tomatoes which was supposed to be bad
Jun 4 2019,negative,god this movies a stinker
Jun 4 2019,positive,fun special effects  plot made zero sense  the ending even less
Jun 4 2019,positive,amazing wild ride from start to finish i literally have nothing bad to say about this movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome action and great story line i loved it
Jun 4 2019,positive,absolutely loved the movieheck we wanted more monsters and we got exactly that  cant wait for kong vs godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie sound a little over the top but all around great cant wait for godzilla v kong
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was very good you didnt know if godzilla was going to win and the humans lend a hand to defeat the evil monster from outer space it was pretty cool 
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was great brought my kids and their friends and we all loved it   is there some issues  sure but this is a movie for the fans  if you arent a kaiju fan then maybe you wont like it but for those of us gfans who have that acquired taste this is a godsend  
Jun 4 2019,positive,spectacular monsters and exhilarating kaiju fights which need to be seen on big screen that said all the human crap is nonsense with the exception of ken watanabes dr ishirō serizawa who continues his arc from the superior 2014s godzilla and what a waste of sally hawkins who might as well be a glorified extra in this film i would have panned this film except the amazing monsters and their terrific set pieces elevates it to an ok if long and frustrating summer flick
Jun 4 2019,negative,the script and characters are like something from the bold and the beautiful  the over acted dramatic scenes for no real reason ruin what could have been the perfect crossroads of modern cgi and modern movie making  instead you sit wanting for it to be over so you can go home early 
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you watched the old godzilla movies you will love this movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was great as a lover of monster movies i enjoyed it immensely
Jun 4 2019,positive,beautiful movie loved it
Jun 4 2019,positive,the critics are idiots this movie is way better than the 2014 version we dont come to a monster movie to get preached to we came to see giant monsters wreck stuff if you want a human drama there is plenty of garbage out there to consume 
Jun 4 2019,negative,it felt like the movie could have been made shorter a lot of unnecessary scenes  a very noisy movie  should have waited for it to come to redbox or cable
Jun 4 2019,positive,i am an original fan of the franchise by toho kingdom the movie was exactly the way the old movies played out which by that means more attention to detail on monsters than humans which is the entire point they kept some of the iconic roars and hisses of the kaijus and some classic music 10 out of 10 what i dislike is that rotten tomato critiques did not take the time out of their day to comprehend what a true toho kaiju film is meant to be they complained too much monster action and that they were unable to distinguish characters that is what makes me mad learn about it before you critique it thats like saying oh i hated john wick because i thought the name was stupid because i dont know what it refers to and there was too much shooting because i dont know how much shooting theres supposed to be whatever those saltines at rt can eat a
Jun 4 2019,positive,the godzilla franchise reboot was off to a great start with the 2014 movie and this latest remake of the 1956 movie is a knockout we saw it in imax and it was fantastic
Jun 4 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan you gonn have a blast     the cgi its incredible it feels so natural something that shouldnt be the monsters perfectly demonstrate their feelings and you get to feel what they feel anger fear etc     the soundtrack its masterfull bear mccreary its showing again his great composition skills giving old themes a fresh new coat off paint while maitainig the essence of the originals always with a sense of scale as it should be     the weak point for me was the plot some scenes were kinda strange like when godzilla stands in the middle os the ocean and fires its atomic breath the human characters are boring but not because of the actors they did a fine job with what they had to work    my only wish its if we have to spend in the next movie significant time of the film with humans characters they get some of the attetion to detail that the monsters have not to steal the show but to make the overall plot feel more entertaining and not just be waiting for the monsters to kick each others butts     i0m happy with the outcome but still can be better 
Jun 4 2019,negative,disappointing i love monster movies and enjoyed both godzilla and kong skull island and was looking forward to this however terrible characters and a lack of purpose make the titan fight scenes dull and weightless despite looking impressive there was never enough riding on the outcome to make me care about the result
Jun 4 2019,positive,pretty good story lots of intense action
Jun 4 2019,positive,great action and special effects entertaining from start to finish
Jun 4 2019,positive,excellent story great massage great sound awesome movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,it focused more on people than godzilla and the monsters
Jun 4 2019,positive,im not sure anything about the plans orchestrated in this movie made sense but if you cast kyle chandler as the good guy and charles dance as the bad guy you automatically get a leg up only a few scoff but the rest was big ole monster fighting fun
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was a good movies its was better then the first one because it gave the audience more action between the titans and it was a enjoyable movie to watch 
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie was for the fans i appreciated it 
Jun 4 2019,positive,absolutely one of the best godzilla movies ive ever seen clearly made for fans of godzilla they brought back the old songs of the original movies and gave them a modern face lift i cant wait for kong vs godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,i honestly didnt care for the acting in this movie but the fights scenes between the monsters were really good
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie is great when i walked out of the local movie theater in 2014 mildly entertained by godzilla i thought to myself this has potential to be good i hope this makes enough money so that we can get sequels and they can find their footing     this was exactly what i envisioned in 2014 it perfects everything that the first movie legally couldnt and gives us so many classic characters monsters that are just as important to cinematic history as they are to the fans     and i find myself in the same position i was in walking out of the theaters in 2014 but with a slight twist walking out of godzilla king of the monsters i was thinking to myself god i hope this makes enough money so that they continue this franchise     not very often are critics just blatantly wrong everyone has an opinion but this goes beyond just opinions and the critics are blatantly wrong and there are no two ways about it     i have no idea why critics would band together to try to tank this movie franchise maybe because its not marvel or maybe its because it isnt some little artsy indie film with a fauxe purpose the purpose of godzilla king of the monsters is to entertain you with big monster fights while also getting you invested in these monsters this isnt some character drama this is godzilla and it shines like i never could have imagined in the year 2019 in american theaters
Jun 4 2019,positive,good monster movie with some plot holes but it godzilla so you get exactly what you expect
Jun 4 2019,positive,amazing visuals and nonstop monster action everything a godzilla movie needs
Jun 4 2019,positive,i guess i didnt know what to expect but it was entertaining to say the least
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie was everything that a godzilla fan could have hoped for 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i thought the movie was really fun but had a bit of a slow pace also this has nothing to do with the movie but if you want to see it please dont talk throughout the film and kick the chair of the person in front of you though this should be common information the family behind me didnt seem to understand this
Jun 4 2019,positive,dont go in expecting an engrossing story you will not find it go in with a clear mind and just watch and enjoy the visuals and cgi is amazing to look at a film to have a great time watching just not one to think too critically about
Jun 4 2019,positive,definitely a explosive and entertaining movie the story fit a godzilla movie and i would say it was better than most comic book movies big disconnect between the critics and the audience score again one would think disney has all the critics in their pocket
Jun 4 2019,positive,as a lifelong godzilla fan this film understands what godzilla as a franchise is truly about the human characters and their stories are superfluous compared to the monsters qnd their battles they are the true stars of the film and the central four of godzilla king ghidorah mothra and rodan are all breathtakingly grand gorgeous and truly awesome this film made me feel like i was a kid again bringing to life the film i have wanted to see ever since i was 5 it was well worth the wait
Jun 4 2019,positive,i started watching godzilla movies in about 6th grade when they were black and white showing my age this movie had godzilla most like the original and sounded most like him the story line was good i always like it when kids are involved they are usually sympathetic to godzilla or another monster  i didnt know all the monsters but mothra spelling was wonderful i really liked this movie very much and will definitely go see a squeal
Jun 4 2019,negative,people were leaving during the film in bulks saw some asking for money back at the box office
Jun 4 2019,neutral,gorra 2 the king of monsters has no lightning evaluation  the plot  human line 4  a lot of logic is unreasgorra 2 the king of monsters has no lightning evaluation  the plot  human line 4  a lot of logic is unreasonable to ignore the emotional line is weak to ignore but the monster plot has a full classic restore    monster line 85  the restoration of many classic scenes is actually enough it has awakened the longlost feelings in fact it is not so fascinating but many childhood scenes have been touched    feet 4 there is no obvious problem with the first race to reduce the problem but most of them have obvious sense of the foot string and the analysis of the foot color will be thunder    average 55    before watching the movie you can watch the movie review website the department is biased towards monster fans special effects sound and light orientation childhood with cogira companionship and people who want to see big scenes  
Jun 4 2019,positive,2 huge ass creature on da ring means serious entertainment   feels disappointed g didnt fight all the awaken titan   gidora give no fuck to the big bomb but feel threaten by missiles form fighter jet wtf
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome just what i wanted 
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters delivers fantastic sequences of cgi battles but lacks in the story  if you bought a ticket expecting anything less then you have been fooled
Jun 4 2019,positive,i enjoyed the action
Jun 4 2019,positive,very entertaining i completely loved the action and drama with both the humans and titans i live in a small west texas town and have never really listened to big name critics they have their opinion of said movie but i would rather go and watch the movie and judge myself this movie is definitely worth a watch if you like action and giant monsters battling it out 
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome loved it always down for godzilla movie     i remember being very ill one week in 1978 and my grandmother made a tent over my bed with sheets and she put the little bw tv in there with me when i stayed home from school and i watched monster movies all week every day there was at least 1 godzilla movie good memories     this movie was killer monster zero was clearly the highlight of the film for me very well done all around
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you want to see giant monsters throw their entire bodies at each other see this movie if you want a story from a human perspective while giant monsters throw their entire bodies at each other see this movie if you want a good story from a human perspective dont see this movie i wanted to see this for the giant monsters and exceptional sound design and was extremely pleased the story wasnt super great but the acting was pretty good millie bobby brown was fantastic at her part but anyone elses comedic relief seemed forced about 75 or the time i would recommend seeing this if you are willing to not care a lot about story
Jun 4 2019,positive,really entertaining movie lots of action 
Jun 4 2019,positive,critics are jufging it as an american drama this movie has enough monster fights to make me happy but they dont have the mental capacity to understand what a godzilla movie is about specifically monsters fighting
Jun 4 2019,positive,my grandson loved that all the old japanese movies were incorporated into this one of course mothra is my fav
Jun 4 2019,positive,love it best godzilla movie that ive seen in a long long time
Jun 4 2019,positive,best godzilla movie tons of monsters fights
Jun 4 2019,positive,the storyline was weak at times but this movie was straight monster porn i really enjoyed it all hail the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,1010 lots of nostalgia in the movie not to much dialogue between ppl which was perfect the movie is centered around godzilla the king my gf who hated the godzilla movies growing up saw it yesterday and went on to buy all the old movies and new 
Jun 4 2019,positive,there wasnt enough monster screen time everytime i excpected to see godzilla kicking some but the movie would cut into the starnger things girls fat head if i wanted to her fat head k would have stayed home and watched netflix
Jun 4 2019,positive,ive never been so excited to see a movie and the homage to classic godzilla was a nice touch too
Jun 4 2019,positive,all im going to say is that this was definitely one of the best movies ive seen
Jun 4 2019,negative,i dont know where to start the failed ridiculous plotting the corny cliche dialogue the use of loud noise and flashing lights to make it seem like something is happening when its just dull dull dull the fake ominousness this is a movie full of sound and fury signifying nothing skip it
Jun 4 2019,positive,action packed beautiful cinematography and full large scale scenes perfect for the big screen its exactly what you want from a giant monster movie a true summer blockbuster are there corny lines yes but that didnt stop my enjoying it
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic i can tell the people at tomatoes arent long time fans and obviously miss the intricate details that were laid throughout the entire movie that made it so amazing  so well done 
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was excellent but dragged a little wish we got to see godzilla a little more
Jun 4 2019,positive,best movie of the year godzilla is back and better then ever 
Jun 4 2019,positive,well paced and executed the monsters are primal intense and dynamic the actors for the most part sell the films plot with being earnest despite a rather limited script this film is a dedication to the films of the past reconstructed for a modern audience reimagined and lovingly shot the directors indulgence with his vision is replete with nostalgia and i will not question his motivations the better conceived human characters unfortunately are mired within a large ensemble cast making their performances shine just a bit dimmer go for the spectacle the sound and the score enjoy this film in a modern cineplex with its tiered plush stadium seating    and better quality sound system
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the action great movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,they did a good job to keep old characters involved with this and the action was great  loud as to be expected but i would recommend
Jun 4 2019,negative,as i was watching this movie i just wanted it to end 
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you from the time when growing up the big show creature feature was all we had or you look at this as the power rangers of our time youll enjoy the movie 2014 was a setup for this and yet to come critics will have the opinions but the fans usually have the last word the worst godzilla movie to me was the one with matthew broderick besides that everything else is good old fashion godzilla go see it imax
Jun 4 2019,negative,i did not like this movie at all  i could actually see the people dressed in monster character costume  the only special effects animal sounds were elephants horns  this movie was awful  the only good character was the young girl played by millie bobby brown
Jun 4 2019,positive,a solid godzilla flick enjoyable to the last brimming with toho love
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked everything  wished theyd showed more of mothra
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie is forkng amazing  screw this snob ass critics this is the best monster movie ever

Jun 4 2019,positive,lots of action  pretty much a replay of the first one
Jun 4 2019,negative,fantastic cgi effects  monster fights were pretty good looking on the screen  the rest of the movie was rubbish  acting was weak plot was terrible
Jun 4 2019,negative,not nearly as good as i expected very disappointed with the outcome of this film i dont know the lore of godzilla and it feels like you had to know it in order understand these film the mothers motive made no sense as to why she wanted to release the monsters her reasoning were very weak and insane made it hard for me to take this movie seriously
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla is the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,totally fun it is exactly what it is meant to be imho enjoyed these growing up and they have stayed true to the original feel and concept but with much better effects of course dont forget to stay for the postcredits scene
Jun 4 2019,neutral,the graphics were great but the storyline with a little weak
Jun 4 2019,neutral,basically what everybody else is saying dont expect a good story for an action movie but what was dissapointing was that the story seemed to get in the way of the action at times and just sort of ruined the whole experience for me
Jun 4 2019,neutral,gareth edwards incarnation in 2014 was highly anticipated mostly due to the monstrous bomb that was roland emmerichs creation this time however the wow factor is lost the effects are great but studios must realize by now that great cgi means nothing without a great story another negative was none of the funny lines were funny
Jun 4 2019,positive,really enjoyed my time at the movies seeing godzilla the king of monsters the movie has great action the monsters are epic and the story kept me invested plenty of easter eggs for godzilla fans recommend seeing this on the biggest screen you can
Jun 4 2019,positive,should have drawn it out but it was still a godzilla movie
Jun 4 2019,negative,the fight scenes with the monsters are great and well made but they are too many on the other side the severals humans caracters are just empty and uninteresting i left the cinema with a headache
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was straight fire 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved all the monster action  the movie was action packed
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie was awesome awesome the balance between human and monster was perfect the timing of the action during some of the human scenes was perfect the titans showed real emotion godzilla is a hero this movie was never made for some old tight underwear having reviewer that never saw or heard of godzilla before this movie it was made for fans of monster movies and especially godzilla fans this movie is superb i had a smile on my face 90 of the time the other 10 was sadness from the story being told and unfolding in front of you watch it guys this movie is 100 worth it
Jun 4 2019,positive,i thought it was a good action monster flic
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie fun to watch and story adds well to franchise to the upcoming movies cant wait till the next one 
Jun 4 2019,positive,best monster movie but human plot make me sleepy it should be full of minster fight in 2hr
Jun 4 2019,positive,acting was solid story was a bit off but overall the fight scenes between the titans is what brought your jaw to the floor your eyes wide and the joyful rush of excitement to your heart
Jun 4 2019,positive,too much chit chat and story but great fight and there was godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,really cool and beautiful effects
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was filled with a lot of action both my son and i loved the movie
Jun 4 2019,negative,though the action and visuals were entertaining and fun to look at it doesnt make up for the movies bad story and unlikable characters i would probably watch this film again but would only skip to the action scenes
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was only the best godzilla movie of all time  ignore the critics and pay attention to those user reviews that appreciate this movie for what it is and are the true fans  this was the most well rounded fun godzilla movie to date think cabin in the woods type fun  with the amount of characters they had to put in this show the director did a great job  definitely watch on the xd or big screen youll not be disappointed
Jun 4 2019,positive,typical godzilla film nothing spectacular but not bad
Jun 4 2019,positive,go see the dam movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,love the fights love the special effects
Jun 4 2019,positive,during the scenes with the monsters it is fun to watch but when the monsters are away the story shows its weaknesses wished it could have been better
Jun 4 2019,positive,graphics are beautiful the story line is well written overall i loved this movie i cant wait for zilla vs kong
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie the visual effects were nuts it was way better than the first one 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved it mothra was by far my favorite kaiju my only wish is that they would have included more anguirus megalon or gamera overall though it was a fun destructive romp
Jun 4 2019,positive,dont listen to critics its awesome movie watch only in theater
Jun 4 2019,positive,first and foremost you have to be one of those godzilla fan from the original and this one that included all of the monsters with godzilla destroying the main leader  monster zero aka 3 headed monster  to show all monsters im still king of all monsters  i loved it
Jun 4 2019,positive,big monsters hit each other real good
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was much better than we expected long live the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,is amazing a love letter to godzilla and the fans
Jun 4 2019,positive,i dont need a much of a plot when im watching a godzilla movie all i need is monster fights with awesome visuals and sound effects and thats what i got they also did an awesome job on the classic monsters in the movie rodan was my favorite bad guy monster and it was cool to see him again
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved all the monster fight
Jun 4 2019,negative,i was worried they pulled a clue and gave everyone a different version with how much people are loving this movie when they kept ruining the fight scenes  godzilla may have more screentime than the 2014 but that doesnt matter if you dont see him doing anything theres lots of kaiju fights but hardly any kaiju fight scenes its like the directors were saying people know what a monster fight looks like when it starts lets focus on the people drama  it had some amazing effects great concepts and some wallpaper worthy scenes but i need more kaiju and less drama
Jun 4 2019,positive,special effects  scenes
Jun 4 2019,positive,i love this movie if you are a true godzilla fan this is for you
Jun 4 2019,positive,well done we are fans from way back first one will always be the favorite
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked the plot but the fx was a bit much in some scenes
Jun 4 2019,positive,i have been a fan all my life i love the new designs for the original monsters kaiju great godzilla scenes and great bills for the next movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,here for the monster fights and thats what i got had a great time 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved godzilla king of monsters and recommend everyone to go and see it the movie was a lot of fun to watch with very creative fight scenes between the monsters the cgi was great and did not get in the way even though the main monster characters are all cgi so congrats on that the human stories were fine nothing spectacular but just enough to have a believable plot around the real reason that we are all in the theater which is to see godzilla lay some smack down on gidorah i absolutely cant wait for kong vs gozilla next year i may go see king of monsters a second time since it was so much fun    ps what is up with this verify my ticket thing i bought mine from landmark cinema i dont see an option for that
Jun 4 2019,positive,thats successful monster fight fuck critics long live the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,as a fan of the toho godzilla movies that have come along over the years i really thought that this movie followed their formula pretty well sure the audience is expected to buy into some off the wall ideas but those ideas werent nearly as bad as initial critic reviews had me believing the monster action was incredible and took my breath away more than once especially the first showdown between godzilla and ghidorah if i had any complaints it was that rodan and especially mothra did not get showcased as much as i thought they would 
Jun 4 2019,positive,very solid writing 
Jun 4 2019,positive,this is an amazing movie forget what the critics say listen to the real audiences they are loving it its a great balance between human story and kaiju action there is a subtle subtext of environmentalism but its light and is glossed over for the benefit of this movie as it gives it more time to focus on what people really come to see the monsters     forget the critics they just get paid to crap on good movies and try to trick you into seeing garbage of a train wreck movie like booksmart     if you like godzilla you will love this movie go see it
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved everything about the movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,critic reviews is a joke
Jun 4 2019,negative,other than a couple decent battle scenes with the titans this movie was completely underwhelming subpar plot horrible acting and indigestible dialogue one of the worst movies ive actually paid to see 
Jun 4 2019,positive,does exactly what it says on the tin
Jun 4 2019,neutral,it was okay very technical not like the old godzilla movies
Jun 4 2019,positive,its like watching a movie with a very large individual sitting infront of you blocking your view full of potentially epic fights that we werent allowed to see if youre going to show us a monster battle show us the battle in its entirety as far as the story goes meh didnt go to for the story anyway went for the battles
Jun 4 2019,positive,the derector broke godzilla but he also rebuilt it this movie is full of love for the original japanese godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,i think it was great a lot of references to older movies a lot of screen time for the monsters and i enjoyed most the way characters acted would watch again
Jun 4 2019,positive,the graphics and cgi were fantastic
Jun 4 2019,positive,lots of action and also great storyline graphics were extrodinary keep in mind monsters arent real so there are moments that arent perfect  but overall very amazing work
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked the actions scenes but the story line needed work
Jun 4 2019,neutral,it was a good movie but better for a rainy day movie on tv kind of movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie is again another proof for movie critics making fools of themselves do not trust them at all this is a godzilla movie people want to watch a godzilla movie to watch a big monster fighting other big monsters nobody except for the squad of mentally retarded critics goes to the cinema and watches a godzilla movie to watch human story not enough human story in  a godzilla movie is like saying there is too much fighting in a fight club movie i would even go so far that there is still too much human story in this movie    now towards the movie the monster battles were amazing the light effects were amazing the only issue i had with the movie was that lots of the monster shots were very concealed behind snowstorms rain darkness etc people want to see the monsters battling it all out under clear skies so everyone can see the full fight in all its epicness
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla was amazing good story convincing cgi good action sequence entertaining this movie has fair share of human and monster drama good supporting cast also the monsters were godly 
Jun 4 2019,positive,good actors kind of knew the outcome it was ok
Jun 4 2019,positive,the writing is weaker than godzilla 2014 but americans finally got a proper godzilla fight monsters movie i would see it again
Jun 4 2019,negative,there was too much action  there were times i couldnt figure out what was going on  the movie made it clear in its opinion that godzilla was the king of beasts which in included mothera a giant moth a threeheaded dragon rodan a big bird an unidentified wooly mamouth a giant spider or crab etc  there were multiple mentions of skull island but none of its famous inhabitant and only giant primate of the bunch king kong who as a primate has more intelligence than a reptile bird prehistoric elephant arachnid or crustacean put together  to even suggest that a prehistoric crocodilean type of reptile has enough intelligence to surpass that of a giant primate to be king of the monsters is ludicrous
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved it  plain and simple
Jun 4 2019,negative,save your money very corny and predictable 
Jun 4 2019,negative,horrible acting and lame animation
Jun 4 2019,positive,a heavy hitting monster action with beautiful score and massive cgi one of the best movie of 2019 so many insight into the source material a fitting sequal to godzilla 2014 and cant wait for the next instalment from this franchise a must watch for godzilla fans the foundation is strong for godzilla v king kong which releases next year hope wb handle it well 
Jun 4 2019,neutral,fight was good acting was stupid the little girl from stranger things basically said mom and dad 100 times in the film sometime right after one another the script is lazy and boring and just plain stupid
Jun 4 2019,positive,i and my wife love it
Jun 4 2019,positive,true godzilla fans will love this movie casual fans will enjoy the monster fights
Jun 4 2019,positive,the human element feels more relevant this time around but its still a distraction against the monsters that are or should be the stars of the film ken watanabes vocabulary increased beyond let them fight which is a nice attempt to make him more of a character and the oddball bradley whitford is a welcome change of pace from the grave demeanor of other characters  the monsters look great and those being reintroduced to the cinematic universe retain their classic looks a nice nod to the original designs fans looking to see ghidorah should be excited as the beast is a force to be reckoned with still the film suffers from placing this golden monstrosity on a backburner to return the focus to the tiny humans  the movie is at its strongest during the epic monster battles and thankfully there is a good amount of screen time for them unlike the 2014 godzilla kotm makes the fights the focal points in the progression of the movie the sense of scale of both the battlegrounds and the destructive kaiju will please fans of the godzilla series as a whole as well as fans of epic fights godzilla king of the monsters moves the kaiju universe a strong step forward and serves as a positive swing for people who wanted to let them fight
Jun 4 2019,positive,i like it very much hope they make more movies like this one in the future
Jun 4 2019,positive,brings back memories of when i would come home from school and watch godzilla on tv
Jun 4 2019,positive, must see in imax this movie is a monster movie masterpiece if there is anything bad about this movie it is the story and to that i say who cares i didnt go to see a godzilla movie for a good story i came to see a godzilla movie where all the story is meant to be is a reason for these monsters to go crazy and have godzilla come out on top and for it to look as good as it did i give this movie 5 stars and that ending was all i could have asked for
Jun 4 2019,positive,a great monster movie the only slow times were when they focused on the humans but that was maybe 20 minutes of the total runtime
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it best one yet
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie is perfect visually and narritively you have great nihilistic villains who seem to team up with hopeful humanitarians to scheme up what becomes the mother of all monster fights to this day long live the king
Jun 4 2019,negative,horrible is an understatement  atrocious writing acting and unintended absurdity collide to make this one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Jun 4 2019,positive,if your in to big monsters fighting each other
Jun 4 2019,positive,the kaiju scenes were awesome and this time you can actually see them unlike the 2014 film  the plot device of the gonebad monarch scientist was disappointing though
Jun 4 2019,neutral,way too much unnecessary dialogue tons of unanswered questions half the action was shown in trailers
Jun 4 2019,positive,all in all i enjoyed the movie despite the many lulls at least theres an account for some of the other characters that never get their recognition mothra radan etc
Jun 4 2019,positive,an amazing way of story telling and bring back the meaning that godzilla was first brought to be
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie was good but overly silly and unbelievable even for a godzilla movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,me and my family loved it
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved this movie going to watch multiple times
Jun 4 2019,negative,the story was very lame and we get thrown in and dont know any of the actors so there is no connection to their story they are more annoying than they are worth watching
Jun 4 2019,positive,felt like a 60s godzilla film in 2019 it was fun epic and stupid the monsters were amazing the fights were good and the human storyline was kinda trash which is almost standard for a fightfilled godzilla fan
Jun 4 2019,positive,great visuals and fight scenes human plot is preposterous an poorly written
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was very entertaining though human characters were lackluster and didnt build as much tension as 1st one
Jun 4 2019,positive,if youre an old school godzilla fan  you will love this movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,what a great movie love all the monsters specially rodan hope to see mothra again
Jun 4 2019,positive,the special effects that the story was leaning towards the original story
Jun 4 2019,positive,great and entertaining film especially if you grew up as a godzilla fan some part in the middle i fell asleep because there was a convoluted dialogue sequence that had to have taken up at least 25 minutes of the film overall a great film and if youre a ny yankees fan let me tell you you will be pleased with this films battle aesthetic
Jun 4 2019,positive,all im going to say is its a godzilla movie  geez if youre looking for story and human elements youre not looking for a godzilla movieif youre looking for a great godzilla movie maybe the best one everhere you go
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie made me relive my childhood just a happy kid watching a guy in a rubber suit destroying a model town again but this time the monsters were real the mood the music the majesty legendary delivers with this film and i cant wait for more
Jun 4 2019,positive,some of the dialogue was thoroughly laughable but hey it is a godzilla movie special effects bonanza and i enjoyed
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was fun going to see it again
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was really goodi gave it 810 i took off points for reaction of those in trouble who waited around to see what was coming instead of trying to get to safety and only 4 of the monsters battled but they said there were a total of 17 otherwiseit was an awesome movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,not a huge godzilla fan but went because my hubby is from his feedback there were unknown mysteries about godzilla that were answered in this movie so that is pretty cool
Jun 4 2019,positive,you must see godzilla kom in a theater that way the sheer awesomeness of the monsters can be truly appreciated and are guaranteed to almost make you forget about how absurd the plot is or how dumb the human characters are even my 8yearold daughter was like why are they so stupid daddy and im just hey look its a giant moth fighting a 200ft pterodactyl
Jun 4 2019,negative,  review spoiler alert i have been a godzilla fan my entire life watching the old black and white movies as a kid was wonderful the last godzilla movie was much better than this one sadly i almost walked out it was that bad but dropping 16 bucks for my imax ticket kept me in my seat the writing was terrible the plot was beyond stupid i could not believe how bad this movie was godzillas vital signs were being tracked and he was in sinus rhythm at one point then flatlined in another the dialogue was painfully slow and boring most action scenes were comparable to the late 1969 star trek tv shows the plane ships subs all had the same pattern of shaking this movie made the disastrous 1998 the second worst installment dr zachakawi from the last movie sacrifices himself to turbocharge godzilla with a nuclear bomb lots of buildings being crushed millions of people dying strange that you saw that only twice the young lady maddy the movie centers around magically manages to escape a monarch containment facility with the secret weapon that was left unguarded the ridiculous scenes were just way over the top mothra the glowing moth monster somehow sprinkles radiation dust on fallen godzilla as she dies this revives the king for one more round he becomes covered in nuclear lava that strengthens him the villain threeheaded ghidorah is thawed out from ice in antarctica and unleashes death and destruction one lame scene after the other the movie ends in a destroyed boston with the surviving monsters kneeling before their king then a version the 1970s blue oyster cult song godzilla wraps up this dismal movie save your money hardcore fans like me will be disappointed hollywood ruined predator now this seems good movies are fading away 
Jun 4 2019,positive,finally a godzilla movie with a lot of godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,so much monster action this movie is amazing
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was amazing never a dull moment
Jun 4 2019,positive,too fictional  the first movie ever was and will always be the best one unable to top that movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,the new godzilla rules literally and figuratively some of the human element would have benefited from some finetuning  but the rest of the movie more than makes up for storytelling flaws you get what you pay for here fun 
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla ii is not a movie about story if youre looking for story youd better spend your money elsewhere however if you are a reasonable person youll be aware godzilla is a movie crafted for the big action sequences you wont be disappointed the only thing i find off putting is the way these sequences are filmed camera angles are fine but dont line up right with each other to be particularly satisfying   great action movie go see it for some epic godzilla moments
Jun 4 2019,positive,some parts were to drawn out but other parts lacked explanation i still like godzilla movies so i overlooked that
Jun 4 2019,negative,so dull boring and a big waste of time went with friends and we all hated it save your money
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the movie  great monster action reminded me of the godzilla movies from the 90s to the 2000s
Jun 4 2019,positive,i was instantly taken back to my childhood and left in awe by so many great moments  as a lifelong godzilla fan this was simply the godzilla film i have always hoped to see
Jun 4 2019,positive,the monsters were amazing and the effects were great the cast was great and charles dance is always fantastic but the script was childish and silly
Jun 4 2019,positive,best movie experience ever it really felt like i was there
Jun 4 2019,positive,i had such low expectations for this movie because i hated the last one but this movie was awesome didnt care much for the story but visually the action was phenomenal
Jun 4 2019,neutral,bad movie only good thing was the monster fights everything else was poor would not recommend to any
Jun 4 2019,neutral,this is not gojiira that i know  
Jun 4 2019,positive,if youre a fan of the godzilla franchise then youll probably like this lots of cgi fighting but it looked very well done
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie especially for godzilla fans
Jun 4 2019,positive,mindless entertainment perfect summer popcorn flick
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the monster fights gave the fans what they wanted
Jun 4 2019,positive,its a big monster fighting thats the end of the story
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the fights hated the people
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie felt a little long probably too much concentration on the story from the human perspective that could have been cut back some the monster action was great and worth the cost of admission
Jun 4 2019,positive,another entry in the 65 years of godzilla movies    this movie is one made for the fans    beautiful monster effects fights and decent monster screen time  filming perspective of humans to monsters was done very wellmade the monsters seem so grand and massive   monster voice sounds were spot on and done well  military action was great  city destruction was done well  fantastic score this was very impactful to making my viewings much more enjoyable  human interaction and acting was better than most for the godzilla series  this movie was well paced and had your attention throughout  plenty of easter eggs and end credit information for future movies  if your a godzilla fan you will enjoy this new entry with repeat visits to the theater
Jun 4 2019,positive,dont understand all the criticism  this movie is everything a godzilla fan would want  yes the humans in the movie are kinda boring but the kaiju action more than makes up for it  this movie was obviously made by a godzilla fan plenty of easter eggs in there as well  the actors all perform pretty well even though the story doesnt make a lot of sense and the dialogue is average at best its a movie about big monsters fighting each other so what would you expect  the cinematography was pretty good with some pretty memorable desktop wallpaper worthy shots of the monsters  its a godzilla movie from a godzilla fan for godzilla fans  if you like kaiju films you will love this  if you dont you probably wont like this one either
Jun 4 2019,neutral,millie bobby browns character had maybe ten lines in the whole film in every scene she looked worried upset or was crying  what a mess the film also tried to push an agenda that humans were the cause of the chaos the answer according to the scientists genocide thanks for ruining a childhood film
Jun 4 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie i can highly recommend this if you like beautiful movies with big monsters i can recommend going to a imax or some kind of special theater i saw it in 3d and in a isense theater that has 4k larger screen better audio and better seats
Jun 4 2019,positive,much better than i expected well acted and brings back memories to the old films with a new twist
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome special effects for godzilla and the other monsters
Jun 4 2019,positive,its a fun movie if you like the classic monsters 
Jun 4 2019,negative,plot line was so weak i wanted to walk out after 10 minutes  the wanton killing of american soldiers was disgusting  if this movie is still showing after one week it would be a cinematic miracle
Jun 4 2019,positive,i love that we finally got to see more if godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,non stop action and faithful homages to the monsters introduced from classic godzilla movies you wont be disappointed
Jun 4 2019,positive,great action epic fights funny one liners amazing special effects and great plot twist and entertaining  story if you want good action movie with an easy to understand story and something thatll keep your attention for hours this is a great movie great movie overall i personally think those who rated this movie poorly just came in with the wrong expectation those who wanted to come watch a drama or strong romance movie or a movie with lots of tricks and confusing moments that make your brain think hard than no this isnt the movie for you but if you like strong action in great detail and just want to have cut loose movie than this is perfect for you because thats what a monster movie is supposed to be it supposed to just be some good old epic fights and some great one liners and also as bonus the themes put with every monster were perfect and made every scene more epic so if you like action and you to laugh but also just have some cut loose fun than youll love this great movie and i for one cant wait to come back for godzilla and kong
Jun 4 2019,positive,pay no attention to the critics this movie was lots of fun to watch and the sound and detail in the monsters expressions was amazing its a must to see in imax
Jun 4 2019,positive,in some places more like a james bond movie then a godzilla movie  monster fight scenes were great
Jun 4 2019,positive,such an amazing movie as a big fan of japanese godzilla movies myself i must say that king of monsters delivered everything i wanted in a western godzilla movie and im not a going to theater person last movie i saw in cinema was kong skull island i feel unconfortable around crowds in close spaces but kaiju movies makes me surpassed my fears and i never left the theater unsatisfied and always with a big smile on my face 
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie godzilla fans will love this movie  loads of fun great blockbuster if you are looking for engaging dialogue go see another movie i cant believe people go to this movie expecting sophies choice it is just a great godzilla movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,this was by far and away the best godzilla movie ever made  the story line was contemporary and the creatures looked and acted like living beings thanks to the miracle of cgi it was an hour and a half of non stop edge of your seat action the whole theater adults and kids alike  cheered godzilla and booed gidora and rodan  it did just what a godzilla movie is supposed to do yank you out of your every day life and workaday world and drop  you squarely into his world want to escape from a bad day  go see this movie want a good day  go see this movie  long live the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,would have rated it 5 stars except for the foul language
Jun 4 2019,positive,best movie of the year for me i loved everything about it the one thing i could suggest would be less human time and more godzilla time
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you came to see the actors in this movie you went to the wrong movie its just big fun with big monsters
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the movie  godzilla rocks  bow to the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,i dont really understand why a lot of people said it didnt live up to the hype as a major fan of godzilla i had the best time of my life watching this movie from the fight scenes to the cinematography to the acting to the amaaaazing visual effects to the soundtrack ive watched it twice already and ive got my tickets for another round  critics and other people will say whatever they want to say but you be the judge of that yourself
Jun 4 2019,positive,great action didnt care about the people
Jun 4 2019,negative,a lot of hype it couldnt live up to wasnt great
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it  monster mayhem with just the right amount of human interaction  the callbacks to earlier films will make you giggle with glee  seeing the big four on the big screen together gave me chills all hail the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,as a lifelong godzilla fan i consider gkotm a mustsee for godzilla fans overall i was disappointed with the story as much of the fighting seemed gratuitous saw it in imax 2d and it was overwhelming due to the sound glad i saw it but  after all the hype  it doesnt even come close to avengers endgame perhaps not a fair comparison but thats what i thought as i left the theater
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the overall action involving not only the monsters but the military as well the jets firing off their missiles lots of military sequences awesome music throughout the moviemy only dislike and i hope that with kong vs godzilla or with the next godzilla movie that they allow the monsters to fight just a little longer like john wick fights that are extended for the full effect rather than starting the fighting then cutting away to the human element then going back again to the almost over ongoing fight and this movie was a prime example of this  i can understand the budgetary situation but come on u dont stop a boxing match in the middle of the round and then listen to boxing analyst then go back to the fightingi did enjoy it and now i cant wait for g vs kk next year and the next godzilla movie in the future i am a godzilla fan 100 and all i want is for the studio or directors to give me my moneys worth and enrich my godzilla experience for many years to come
Jun 4 2019,positive,one of the best monster movies i have ever seen and worthy addition to the godzilla canon
Jun 4 2019,positive,great graphics and audio the story line could have been a little bit better
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it  gonna see it again  the visuals alone make this movie worth seeing again but loved the story also cant wait til next year kong vs godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,absolutely loved the film fantastic monster fights great cgi and a refreshing take on tohos legendary kaiju sound track and effects were amazing
Jun 4 2019,positive,its a good godzilla movie nothing more nothing less if you are a godzilla fan watch it right now if not watch it tomorrow great movie with some flaws but its watchable unlike star wars the last jedi 
Jun 4 2019,positive,dont know what got the critics panty in a twister but gkotm was exactly what i expected from a godzilla movie the kaijuus gave of an awe inspiring sense of scale and weight and it was action pack for most of the story   the cut to human perspective is still a thing but it was an improvement over the 2014 film in 2014 there are cases when the fight would start then it would cut to a totally unrelated bunch of human in a peaceful and unrelated area cutting us off from the tension completely here the cut tend to be toward people within the immediate area and help paint a picture of how insanely powerful these creatures are    that said there are still what id call human filler in which the screen time was devoted to human level event that was not necessary to sell the big picture or further the plot like when the film focused completely on a random soldier saving a random kid then their evacuation chopper breaking down and the main characters had to focus on saving them this kid and these soldier contributed zero to the bigger story provided zero development among the main cast and was just there to pad out the time without showing use rodan fighting king ghidorah    overall i highly recommended fans of kaijuu film to go and see gkotm support this film to tell them that we wanted more awe inspiring kaijuu in our popcorn intake
Jun 4 2019,positive,looked forward to the film disappointed in the human story in it felt it overwhelmed the reason for the film godzilla and his adversaries whats the plot point at the end with vera farmiga she unleashes death and destruction on millions of people and in the end i felt the movie is giving her redemption whats that about  the human aspect was a distraction stay for the full run of the credits it sets up the next film if you pay close attention you can figure out the plot for it
Jun 4 2019,positive,action and a solid story
Jun 4 2019,positive,if youre an old school godzilla fan this is the movie youve been waiting for
Jun 4 2019,positive,i had been anticipating this movie for some time and i gotta admit i probably overhyped myself watching trailers and trailer reactions for it anytime i could i finally got some vacation to come visit family and went to see kotm with them and im gonna say it proudly i loved this movie while ive given myself time to calm down from all the excitement i had during the movie so i could view it objectively rate character performance cinematography and all that i realized something why should i i just wanted to enjoy a cool monster movie with the king of the monsters and you know what thats what i did yes there are many things they can do to improve this movie but at the end of the day i had the time of my life and no doubt will again when i go see it another 30 times to all the people who worked on this movie you did a fantastic job
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was a giant monster movie that delivered just what you expect i just wish there was mor emphasis on the monsters and less on the people
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it movie was good loved the ending
Jun 4 2019,positive,i came to learn to never trust reviews by rotten tomatoes i dont know where they base what is and what is not a good movie from i however found my satisfaction on most movies almost congruent to audience score godzilla king of the monster was immensely entertaining for a movie of its kind dont be deterred by the rotten tomatoe review which i find baseless on its criticism of the movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was ight lots of cool fighting tho
Jun 4 2019,positive,love godzilla from start to finish
Jun 4 2019,positive,monsters beating the sht out of each other with more than enough emotional human scenes for a film about kaijus despite what critics may think
Jun 4 2019,positive,a must see for monster and massive action fans clearly my favorite of the monsterversefilms you want monsteraction you get monsteraction breathtaking visuals and sounddesign with new twist and tricks while honouring the toho background  the story parts with the humans fall flat compared to the action filled monster parts but they are not a mess some critics describe them to be less human characters more focus on personal stories while slimming the humanplot 10 minutes down would have made the plot even more tense but still my favourite godzillafilm up to date
Jun 4 2019,positive,as a lifelong fan of the godzilla series i can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the first well done american version of godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,this a a great movie for godzilla fans as a generation xer i felt like it was saturday morning monster matinee
Jun 4 2019,negative,disappointing the acting was good but they sacrificed good writing for special effects
Jun 4 2019,negative,boring  no real plot  stupid premise
Jun 4 2019,positive,eberything you can hope for in a godzilla movie one of the few to be able to balamce human drama and big monster throwdowns feels like a call back to the heisei and milenium era excluding final wars 
Jun 4 2019,positive,what you see in the trailer they deliver in spades you come for monster fights and thats what you get get your popcorn ready and over look the human element of this movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,typical godzilla formula no more no less effects and sound very good though if you like every godzilla movie youve ever seen this is for you few risks takes with the formula fun film overall
Jun 4 2019,negative,yeah the giant monsters were great but the long stretches in between those moments were dreadful the 2014 reboot was much better
Jun 4 2019,positive,the monster fighting part was really gave me chill and epic the most well doned monster scene ive ever seen it is so realistic the human part is a bit boring and okay at best
Jun 4 2019,positive,its a monster movie it did what it was supposed to do entertain
Jun 4 2019,positive,action packed from beginning to end
Jun 4 2019,positive,just seen this tonight and omfg it was amazing  visual fx where on point story was good acting was good and everything else fell into place ignore the critics rating and see it
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome the movie delivers made me feel like i was a kid again watching old school godzilla movies 
Jun 4 2019,positive,the king of monsters has returned in full glory
Jun 4 2019,positive,we dont need human dramas on monster fight films
Jun 4 2019,positive,great godzilla movie must see in imax
Jun 4 2019,positive,fun as hll nice balance between monsters and humans even the minor characters like some of the soldiers i cared about the human story was interesting but didnt drudge down the story the score and vfx were absolutely fantastic this was a fun movie and better than i thoughtwere led to believe
Jun 4 2019,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters has all the monster action you need but the characters are as flat as a floor and boring as watching your clothes dry in the sun fans who have a problem with the last movie gets what they wanted more godzilla and more action but at the end godzilla king of monsters is a fun movie to watch still a bad one
Jun 4 2019,positive,could have been better if it had alittle less people drama these movies are about the monsters a step in the right direction from the last movie 
Jun 4 2019,positive,picking up where its 2014 predecessor left off godzilla king of the monsters presents a world where humanity must reckon with the reality of monstrous beasts returning from their dormant state to dominant species roaming the planets surface in the ashes of the closing sequence of the 2014 godzilla a new human conflict threatens to exacerbate the consequences of this reality as these radiationsoaking beasts spark a process of natural regeneration of any place they destroy they pose a great interest and opportunity of ecoterrorists concerned with the longterm effects of manmade climate change and pollution    in this absurd worldframe godzilla king of the monsters oddly enough brings forth a timely dispute between the pragmatic nuanced concern of moral rationalists with the antihuman strains of green movement radicals with an alarmist penchant for disregarding the everyday lives of humans in pursuit of a sustainable planet shown in plans that would cull the population or eliminate its necessary resources this conflict nested inside of the tragedy of familial loss and breakup provides a springboard for the rather unusual embrace of the supernatural within the spiritual tradition with this godzilla king of the monsters aligns the roles of head heart and soul    still godzilla king of the monsters is noisy bombast that owes more to stock characterization genre tropes and audience expectations making for a typical modern movie experience as such godzilla king of the monsterss thematic ambitions are not served well by the inability of its authors to indulge entertaining spectacle and substantive storytelling at the same time nonetheless one must give credit for at least trying
Jun 4 2019,positive,i watched godzilla in the mx4d at the liberty bb theater and i must say i felt as if i was in the ring with godzilla simply because i lost a hair clip a diamond earring a shoe and my purse a couple of times lol the movie alone was beyond whatvi expected but experiencing it in the mx4d was exceptional  godzilla is a must see
Jun 4 2019,positive,i thought is was a great film with the biggest message from it being dont mess with nature it was a beautiful looking film and had good pacing 
Jun 4 2019,positive,best godzilla movie ever   loved all the titan screen time  mothra was beautiful as ever
Jun 4 2019,positive,its what youd want and want youd expecta good monster summer popcorn movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome loved it saw it 3 times
Jun 4 2019,positive,genuinely great action film my mind was blown the entire time i felt like i had to hold my mouth shut the storyline could use a little work sometimes it felt a little to convenient but who cares the action was incredible i thoroughly enjoyed this film  
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome movie total action
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was good they should make more dolby theater the experience was great
Jun 4 2019,positive,great action love monster movies
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla was very entertaining and action packed from start to finished best godzilla movie ive seen ti date highly recommend it
Jun 4 2019,positive,too many story lines which deserved more detail either passed over after being introduced or received just one or two lines to explain the intricate back story
Jun 4 2019,positive,non stop suspension and action packed from beginning to end
Jun 4 2019,positive,i thought it was better than the 1st one and the story was decent too the cgi was awesome and every monster looked great i think if you are a fan of godzilla then you should enjoy it unless you are overly critical like most people are now a days good flick
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie is good although dragged down a bit from lack of recourses godzilla has all the elements that make a good movie and it also has excellent creative execution  godzilla is dragged down from lack of recourses the movies 170 million budget is clearly not enough to adequately portray some elements of the titans however the movie still looks amazing overall  although the movie may not have had the adequate budget to execute its all its creative ideas the movie does have all the elements that make a good a movie it is well written it has great emotions it has great actors amazing visuals and sound etc its not the best movie in the world or most memorable but it is good  on top of having good movie qualities godzillas creative aspects are executed excellently through great execution direction and imagination godzilla takes the audience to an incredible world for 2 hours personally at some instances i felt moved by the image of godzilla and i really felt like he was real it was amazing  godzilla suffers a bit from its budget but overall the movie has no real outrageous downsides its a good movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked everything about godzilla graphics were amazing plot was good especially that all creatures were apart of earth i really enjoyed how much monster time was put in and the jump scare with the 1scene with godzilla underwater been a fan since the 80s and this was a 5 star
Jun 4 2019,positive,not perfect but what the first basically should have been
Jun 4 2019,positive,best monsteraction ever
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it classic kaiju action
Jun 4 2019,positive,i like the movie a must see
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla is beatiful and epic 
Jun 4 2019,positive,the family side story was completely unnecessary im pretty sure we can all agree that on both sides there was bad parenting all because of the death of one of the kids how in hell is that relevant to monsters fighting for the fate of the world monster fights though did not disappoint i cant wait to view the future projects of this franchise
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked the incredible features of the characterization that godzilla and the titans  brought to the screen
Jun 4 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan and you want to see an epic battle that includes godzilla king ghidora mothra and rodan then youre in for a treat if you were expecting an oscarwinning drama like 60 percent of these critics who reviewed it here and gave it a negative score then i dont know why you bought a ticket to see this movie speaking of buying tickets what happens if i bought my ticket at a kiosk at the theater is there anyway to get that verified because this verified audience score thing sucks if the only way to get your review to mean anything is if you pay fandango the extra money by buying your ticket through them
Jun 4 2019,positive,best experience ive had at the theatres absolute chads  go go godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you wana see a movie about giant monsters battling it out this is the movie for you if you wanna sit and watch a movie about people talking about giant monster fighting while the actual monster fights happen off screen fucking go somewhere else
Jun 4 2019,neutral,the movie would have been 75 better and proper length without    1 needless mythology  2 needless ecoterrorists  3 needless orca  4 needless atlantis    this is a movie that could go from meh to pretty darned good with editing alone there is too much extra junk in it totally unneeded and it forced bad dialogue    kaiju have never had to be awakened they just wake up it would have been better if ghidorah woke up on his own because of global warming and that triggered the other kaiju let the humans react not orchestrate with unbelievable tech that a kid can operate
Jun 4 2019,positive,gojira is awesome live the king can wait to see kong vs gojira 
Jun 4 2019,neutral,it was definitely action packed but a little chaotic worth seeing though if youre a fan of the series
Jun 4 2019,positive,soundtrack and the way the movie is cut cant compare to shin godzilla in fact this movie all the parts with the giant monsters were awesome and beautiful but theres way too many scenes of the humans and their faces looking at the destruction and monsters we want to see the titans lackluster soundtrack no crowning music of awesome but its still a visual spectacle when the movie focuses its entire attention to the monsters the human plot is nothing entirely unnecessary but drags way too long
Jun 4 2019,positive,i really enjoyed it the acting was not amazing throughout and the dialogue was quite cheesy at times but thats not really what people go to kaiju fans go to the movies for the plot godzilla and king ghidorahs territorial dispute over earth very cool the human side of things was lacking the best actors in the film were definitely ken watanabe and millie bobby brown they played their roles best as they could despite a very cliche script    the thing that redeems this movie most of all is the fight scenes the effects on ghidorah and godzilla were very masterfully done the entire score and audio effects were amazing the choreography of the fights had me very engaged i had chills when godzilla was engulfed in flames i cried tears of awesomeness when godzilla ripped of ghidorahs heads    would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good fight scene and doesnt care so much about the plot i am definitely seeing godzilla vs king kong
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome movie good monster fight scenes good special effects humans are not very important but they contribute to the story i love it
Jun 4 2019,negative,the monsters looked great and effects were well done but the script was awful the dialogue was painful and the story was trite the best emotional moment was between godzilla and the head of monarch the rest of the relationships were 2d and a waste of some really great actors i far prefer the old films with the camp and bad dubbing constantly been disappointed by attempts to recapture the charm of the original godzilla maybe they should stop trying and move on to something else yeah do that
Jun 4 2019,positive,as a huge godzilla fan i have to say this movie was epic  so many nods to the classic japanese movies godzillas atomic breath was more powerful than the 2014 movie and plenty of monster fight scenes that really packs a punch  watch the end credits for a little teaser of the next installment in this seriesi cant wait
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was amazing dont know how im gonna beat him next year
Jun 4 2019,positive,big monsters fight what else do you want
Jun 4 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics on this one the movie is a blast and any fan of monster movies will enjoy it
Jun 4 2019,positive,i saw it in imax at a regal theater i thought the movies very very good for godzilla fans i love how  michael dougherty is opening up the monster verse to be getting more and more monsters i cant wait  the storyline was good  music felt like i was a kid again listening to it this time the humans were better than 2014 godzilla the monsters were amazing   i am going to watch it again
Jun 4 2019,positive,dont think about it too much and enjoy monsters fighting
Jun 4 2019,positive,im not sure what going on with the critics my wife and i really enjoyed it i felt the human characters were better acted than the previous godzilla film and other recent monster movies like jurassic world but the focus is on the monsters which were great i felt like a kid again watching skyscraper sized monsters fight the effects were great a bit hard to see and like the first movie did cut away from fights still a great movie and unless you have a chip on your shoulder or hate anything fun youll enjoy it 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i have no problem with this version of godzilla or any of the characters i thought this was an outstanding movie it hit the nail on the spot the only downside i have about this movie is three key characters were killed off two of them i can understand the third i have a problem with it they make it sound like hes the only person that could do this and i find that hard to believe other than that loved everything
Jun 4 2019,negative,storyline was wack action was just ok the movie was all over the place
Jun 4 2019,positive,great flim would have wanted to see more of the other kaiju but it is called godzilla lol
Jun 4 2019,positive,had kool monsters i remember watching growing up fighting scenes with monsters kind a shot but movie was ok
Jun 4 2019,positive,this has got to be the best visual and sound design i have ever seen in a film to date the scale of the film and level of destruction is a beautiful sight to see in it    as a godzilla fan this is basically everything you want in a modern godzillamonster film its something to really nerd out on they kept it true to the originals you only dream marvel dc star wars treated their universes as such    if youve never been a godzilla fan but can appreciate a scifi flick then youll fall in love with this monster verse and the kaiju in it    must see in an imax theater    ignore rotten tomatoes critic ratings could not be any further off and out of touch
Jun 4 2019,negative,so boring too long
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie just the right amout of human interaction and then all monster fights
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie is what i expected yes it got panned for a lack of a story but weve already had two movies with enough story to go around at some point youve had enough and just want some hard hitting action if not youre in the wrong movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,i grew up with godzilla movies i was hands down so impressed by the portrayal of my childhood favorites this one does justice to the legacy of the king of the monsters
Jun 4 2019,positive,best movie to start off a great summer
Jun 4 2019,positive,listen if you are a critic who is going into this movie knowing that you wont like it because its a godzilla movie then guess what real godzilla fans are not interested in your paid opinion because it is not valid for real godzilla fans this movie pushes the fast paced huge scale monster action that you are coming for the human drama is easy to follow and feels more like necessary segues between the monster action rather than lowcost filler critics can judge our need for fun enjoyable movies from their ivory towers but those towers will fall in the face of godzilla because those towers are built on a foundation of bribes and unfulfilled crushes on college professors not true love for film or true understanding of the medium from a creators perspective
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie ton of monster fights with just a smattering of human interaction what i remember godzilla movies to be 
Jun 4 2019,positive,great film the effects were awesome the only improvement i could ask for would be for them to have more monster screen time
Jun 4 2019,negative,human acting messed up movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie was awesome i never got bored it was a rollercoaster from start to finish oh and no sky portals
Jun 4 2019,positive,nice visual effects  very entertaining for the eyes  but the script is silly
Jun 4 2019,positive,such a great movie from start to finish
Jun 4 2019,positive,a bit confusing at first but got better
Jun 4 2019,positive,everything you want in a godzilla movie great fights great monsters complete destruction good story with the human characters too but they didnt over do it like last time awesome that they didnt spend the whole time focusing on the people like last time  totally exceeded my expectations and made up for the last one left me super excited for the next one i hope they make a hundred of these
Jun 4 2019,negative,laughable plot  i got really bored lots of good actors with nothing great to do but at least the special effects looked cool
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters gave us what we wanted in the 2014 film monster fights godzilla actually has decent screen time and when he shows up its awesome all the monster fights are entertaining as hell i dont care too much for the human characters i felt the motivation for the villain was just stupid good thing i went to movie to see godzilla and not them 
Jun 4 2019,positive,brilliant and wonderful humans are fodder monsters rule the world it was brilliant i cared about the humans just enough to stay awake through the entire thing 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i enjoyed most of all seeing more of godzilla in this one than in the first one absolutely wonderful movie will see it again
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it tons of nods to previous films for the long time fans to recognize  sure its not 100 a toho godzilla movie but it is a very entertaining american version that updates but still incorporates many original themes from the previous 30 movies  its not supposed to be shakespeare its a godzilla movie so just enjoy it    ps im guessing all the critics who seem to love the 1954 version but hate this one saying it has too many dark scenes need to go back and revisit the original as most of the godzilla attack scenes in that movie took place at night too  i guess they forgot
Jun 4 2019,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ever i have enjoyed godzilla movies my entire life this movie had everything i could have wanted
Jun 4 2019,negative,return of the titans who are the star people hummmm
Jun 4 2019,positive,it started off kind of hoakey but the whole plot begam to make sense once the storyline got going the special effects were good it was an enjoyable film
Jun 4 2019,positive,lots of action great movie to watch in theaters
Jun 4 2019,positive,great special effects and action  its a must see on the big screen  i hope to see a sequel
Jun 4 2019,positive,great godzilla movie  i liked better after seeing it a second time  cant wait for the bluray so i can pause some of the scenes
Jun 4 2019,positive,as good as the old films i liked it a lot but king kong should have played a bigger role
Jun 4 2019,neutral,most of the movie looked gorgeous but very little story thats one of the main problems with shark and monster movies these days they focus too much on the actual monsters didnt feel suspense or even care if the main characters were in danger just didnt have any connection
Jun 4 2019,positive,terrific i had so much fun watching this movie from start to finish 
Jun 4 2019,positive,hugely entertaining spectacle with jawdropping visuals just dont think too hard about the plot
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie hooked till the end 
Jun 4 2019,negative,graphics  amazing plot and acting  horrible
Jun 4 2019,positive,awww man the nostalgia of it all long live the king 
Jun 4 2019,positive,paid tribute to the old ones great flick of your into this genre
Jun 4 2019,positive,4th viewing of the film and honestly i loved every part of it one of my personal big movies of the year critics have a valid reason to be fairly critical with this film but if you take it in the context that this is a love letter to the fans of the original japanese films then it succeeds where most adaptations of films fail
Jun 4 2019,neutral,while the lackluster and uninspiring human elements drag the film down godzilla king of the monsters is a sight to behold from its glorious action to the mesmerizing visuals and portrayals of its titular kaiju and company setting up for the inevitable showdown with the king of the jungle that hopefully could be an improvement from this tad of a mishap 275
Jun 4 2019,positive,everything is improved from cg the most noticable lore story even the amount of show time that the monsters show up
Jun 4 2019,positive,far from greatbut not bad
Jun 4 2019,positive,a true love letter to the movies of the past do not sleep on this movie youll regret it
Jun 4 2019,negative,visually great but whoever wrote the dialogue for this should be asham
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved it i jumped a couple times  i didnt know there were so many monsters and to see them on 1 screen was awesome looking forward to seeing the 2020 version king v king  lovelivetheking welltakeit
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie lots of action and even some sad moments
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved it had a good storylinegood guys bad guys monsters17  godzilla looked like godzilla pretty close
Jun 4 2019,positive,the monster fights as always were incredible and the best part by far
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie will see it again 
Jun 4 2019,positive,the best movie ever  my favorite highly recommended
Jun 4 2019,positive,i can feel the soul of those kaiju
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked all of the movie i didnt even get up once until it was over thats how much i enjoyed godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,seeing these titans fight on a massive scale on a huge imax screen was truly something
Jun 4 2019,positive,it is a fantastic film the fights in this film are really marvellous although there is a little problem in storywise but it is really worth a watch
Jun 4 2019,positive,i may be biased towards this film in particular because i grew up watching godzilla vs mothra on a weekly basis it was my favorite godzilla film and probably still is i was thrilled to see them on the screen together once again if youre also an avid fan of mothra and godzilla this movie manages to deliver very well despite juggling a slew of other kaiju motifs from mothras original score and a motif from godzillas original theme are also used very pleasingly in the soundtrack like a jolt of nostalgia    the beginning is slow but doesnt drag too much there was enough vagueness and even a few red herrings in the terse family dialogue to keep me guessing at what was going on under the surface leading up to a reveal for which ample groundwork had been laid out a lot of exposition is covered as efficiently as it can be for the fact that it spans the 5 years of new monarch discoveries since godzilla 2014 it doesnt feel like exposition either    rodan mothra and ghidorah have all been updated nicely and at times ghidorah is genuinely terrifying the visuals were stunning atmospheric and dizzying at times i absolutely enjoyed this movie     if you want big monsters fighting it checks the boxand does a little more on top of that
Jun 4 2019,positive,for those who doesnt familiar with godzilla and probably stucked in its 1998 version this movie would came with lots of surprise theres a dilemma about godzilla role as a protector or destroyer theres a depth on the story not so much generic like its previous series    one thing that bothers me is how the hell godzilla able to stand and walk in a sea thats deep enough for a submarine to dive
Jun 4 2019,positive,very exciting and lots of action just loved it
Jun 4 2019,positive,one of most beautiful movies i ever seen godzilla is the protagonist simply as that the movie never trys to be better than the first godzilla movie gojira 1954 as godzilla 2014 did it respects a lot the original material from music to visual effects and plot if the screen were less chaotic and with a little more of logic my review would be 5 stars 
Jun 4 2019,positive,this was a fine movie it had to much people crap and needed more monsters fighting if anyone expects a monster movie to have substance beyond that then they need to check themselves out of whatever drama ridden crap they are used to monster movie should be that big monsters fighting period
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it best movie of the year hands down so much action and excitement keeps you jumping in your seat dont listen to the negative reviews go out and watch it 
Jun 4 2019,positive,really good movie i grew up watching godzilla movies so this was awesome i
Jun 4 2019,positive,like the new story line
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla movie is a best movie in monster world like story action and full family can enjoy this movie and i cannot wait for next part   when kong and godzilla will fight together
Jun 4 2019,positive,a true love letter to fans of godzilla and a must see for any godzilla fan humans characters are par the course of a godzilla movie so not good but more tolerable than the ones in the previous film monster action is the best in franchise history and more than makes up for any other short comings the movie had
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved this movie  the action was great  the story came nicely full circle for certain characters when compared with the 195456 original  thematically it stuck to concepts that are proven in previous godzilla lore
Jun 4 2019,negative,disappointing story decent action
Jun 4 2019,positive,back to old school monster fighting a movie for the godzilla fans
Jun 4 2019,positive,took my nephew to watch this since it was what he wanted to see was surprised at how good it was good movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,the best nonstop action monster movie ever made  loved every edge of your seat minute
Jun 4 2019,positive,good movie fun to watch
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie was visually breathtaking from scenes that make you feel the fear and wonder like youre right there next to the big guy to other scenes that expand past anything your could have attempted to imagine on your own in artistic intricacy there were many references to get fans even more pumped as well as being straight forward enough where people who dont know much about the franchise can still thoroughly enjoy the film and development of the kaiju waited very eagerly for 5 years for this movie release and it was well worth the wait cant wait to see what they do with the next movie 
Jun 4 2019,positive,wow i dont know whats wrong with the critics but this movie was awesome they did ghidora so well and to be honest the only thing i didnt like about this show is i was hoping thered be more fights between the other monsters too
Jun 4 2019,positive,very good as a fan of the franchise as a whole and the originals they did a really good job
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie is breathtakingthe titanskaiju are present most of the movie which is definitely a change over godzilla 2014 the multiple fights between godzilla and ghidorah are awesome the cgi is almost flawless  this review has no spoilers but i just want to say that godzilla and ghidorah fight a total of four rounds in this movie  the story about the humans is justified because the whole narrative is seen through the eyes of  this characters   there is also a battle between rodan and mothra even if you miss the entire movie just this sequence is worth the price of the ticket imagine the other fights  a must see
Jun 4 2019,positive,beautiful all monsters looked amazing loved it 
Jun 4 2019,positive,best movie of 2019  long live the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,most of the general audience and critics will not observe or understand the many references to the great history that is godzilla and all his previous films a magnificent film for true godzilla fans of all ages 
Jun 4 2019,positive,great special effects but just too much of too much
Jun 4 2019,positive,as a true godzilla fan and nerd i felt it necessary to leave this review to keep the score honest against idiot critics gfans asked and legendary answered 
Jun 4 2019,positive,its without a doubt one of the best godzilla movies ever a very good addition to the monsterverse the giant monster battles are absolutely awesome
Jun 4 2019,positive,45youve got to be a godzilla fan to love this movie perfect setup for godzilla vs kong
Jun 4 2019,positive,i was really excited for godzilla but it wasnt what i had hope for i was thinking king more of a battle royale or even the chance of seeing him fight with more monster but he basically fought with that one and only so that really left a bad taste in my mouth the definitely enjoyed the first movie a lot more as a result of this big disappointment did they not think it through when throwing all these monsters out there that godzilla should be fighting a few of them but nope
Jun 4 2019,positive,the big g is back all hail the king of the monsters
Jun 4 2019,positive,amazing monster fights exactly what a godzilla fan is looking for the storyline of the humans is absolute garbage however and really just distractd from the beauty of the monster designs and fight scenes
Jun 4 2019,positive,well worth the watch  not expecting it to be as good as it was
Jun 4 2019,positive,the kaiju battles and homage to the older films was a delight i enjoyed the music and visual effects love ya ken watanabe
Jun 4 2019,negative,over the top snd that was its best quality   predictable stupid and boring
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic for a godzilla movie it was far better than the first one and the critics are wrong so watch it
Jun 4 2019,positive,the critics need to be fired 
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie like other godzilla movies but the monsters were more realistic than in rubber suits like the japanese version  if your a fan of godzilla movies you would enjoy thisaloha

Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome movie the best movie ive seen in a long time
Jun 4 2019,positive,fantastic    very well done sequel all while paying homage to the original godzilla   no spoilers   the original music and the end credits with the dedication to the original creator and actor    well done well done
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was very entertaining and a bit predictable needless to say my 10 yr old son loved it
Jun 4 2019,negative,executed poorly in every aspect of filmmaking the dramatic beats were amateur the script was awful the visual effects were goofy and the majority of the  shots were too tight the scale of the monsters was often lost  even in the theater with the biggest screen in north america
Jun 4 2019,positive,yay no visible fishing line boo there wasnt any oriental singing twins for mothra
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the monsters too much human story wish there was more on monster 0 being an alien like in the old school movies
Jun 4 2019,positive,great graphics loved how they brought it all together as far as why all the different monsters as well as how they worked together
Jun 4 2019,positive,enjoyed the computer generated images the fight scenes were great didnt get into the human side of the story its a godzilla movie there to see the monsters battle
Jun 4 2019,positive,the plot is so dumb it makes you feel like a genius if you can at least read at a fourth grade level and thats exactly what i paid for godzilla is cool too
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie is a kamehameha wave of action and endearing character motives blue sub six meets dbz with the good things from pacific rim so glad i ignored the critics ratings rt the inaccuracy of some of the plot summaries on the site make me think an algorithm is writing them ill remember to invert all rts future ratings
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you like monster movies well duh  this is what youve been waiting for great homage to the old creature double feature movies and you still want more  lots of twists and monster lore woven in i loved it
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie fun to watch
Jun 4 2019,negative,the acting was horrible the characters were obnoxious godzilla was the only cool monster
Jun 4 2019,positive,it delivered exactly what i went to see i went to see godzilla and other monsters fight and destroy cities they delivered a movie that did only that
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was an amazing monster movie best ever cgi was incredible and godzilla truly is king
Jun 4 2019,positive,for a godzilla movie this was a solid 55 typically the human story is uninteresting and unlike the last one this is actually somewhat engaging and the monster fights are so good as a long time fan im very happy
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was too much story line not enough titan fights i started to doze off
Jun 4 2019,positive,this the best godzilla movie since final wars
Jun 4 2019,positive,perfect movie monster fans of the series  human was there to keep the movie going      good watch
Jun 4 2019,positive,screw the critics its worth the watch 
Jun 4 2019,positive,well i wasnt disappointed but i think that the classic toho films are so ingrained in my psyche that i have trouble letting anything else in  it was enjoyable with some good monster action  would have preferred a bit more and i will say in the early films despite the obviously miniature towns and villages that godzilla and his tribe sundered in their epic battles i and i suspect many of my preadolescent number gleefully suspended disbelief because the battles were so so entertaining  lengthy wild throwdowns with train cars tossed power lines eaten body slams and tail spins you name it  wwf for the the giant lizard set  the battles in this movie are fun enough but as with so many actionthriller movies these days murk prevails  i like to have some idea whose on top whos in trouble and its hard to tell at times  but the cast is game its nice to have godzilla back and its great to have all the other monsters of monster island back in the saddle  3 12 out of a possible 5 dougs  the 12 is largely for sentimental reasons
Jun 4 2019,positive,my opinion on that movie it was awesome and im going watch it again
Jun 4 2019,negative, spoiler alert red sox fans will not be happy    i looked forward to this film and was disappointed on several levels the writerdirector got so carried away with monsters that there are 17 of them and only a few are dealt with and he even brought back the radiation monster that got destroyed in the last godzilla film oops good mom turns bad mom turns hero mom and oops we dont care as i see it the director was like the crazy designer on project runway that tries to put every accessory and design into their piece and it turns into a mess he even put in the sunken lost city of atlantis give me a break extra convoluted story spend your money at your own risk on this one
Jun 4 2019,positive,best godzilla movie  lots of monster action loved it cant wait for godzilla vs kong
Jun 4 2019,positive,well its no academy award movie but i liked it because its exactly what i was expecting pure adventurous full of action  epic picture i enjoyed it rotten critics sorry rotten tomatoes  fail to sometimes  remember that summer movies are exactly that just pure entertainment that rein supreme over all others growing until the adult that ive become today i still look forward to these epic movies exploding on the big screen long live the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it major godzilla fan and im beyond thrilled with this beautiful interpretation of the story cant wait to add it to my godzilla collection

Jun 4 2019,positive,great fights good monster actions the human story could be shorter so call critics dont know what they are talking about a must see
Jun 4 2019,positive,an awesome movie a must see movie again and again
Jun 4 2019,positive,entertaining but the ridiculous plot was so asinine it was irritating realize that plot line is not the reason for these movies but it was not only thin and improbable as are most of this genre and expected but just plain out grating  they could have cut 60 of the stilted idiotic storyline  wanted more titan action and less family story stupidity
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the movie great on the big screen
Jun 4 2019,positive,epic monster battles what more do you want also i liked the story

Jun 4 2019,positive,as my 8year old son said when all the people were finished talking blah blah blah godzilla was awesome
Jun 4 2019,positive,im a big fan of the godzilla genre
Jun 4 2019,negative,bad no writers present during the script process and the lead was always doused in rain but showing up dry sometimes only seconds apart in different locations but thats kind of funny and earned it 1 star
Jun 4 2019,negative,movie run time 2 hours 12 mins  monster screen time 30 mins    this was a syfy channel quality family drama it had a bad plot full of holes it had bad acting title should have been millie bobby brown reacts to occasional monster fights while her mom plots ecoterrorism and her drunk dad blames godzilla for everything even though godzilla saved the world seriously 2nd worst godzilla movie ever made
Jun 4 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan this movie will not disappoint
Jun 4 2019,neutral,good action flick typical implausible plot items inherent in a fastpaced scifi story  not going to win any awards except for the great special effects
Jun 4 2019,positive,my brother and i were raised on the old monster movies  my dad loved godzilla and he passed away 3 years ago  he would have loved this one we saw it in memory of him 
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was a lot better than i thought it would be action packed pretty much from the start
Jun 4 2019,positive,were not worthy long live the king
Jun 4 2019,negative,not good at all story line didnt even really make sense i was so excited to see millie bobbi brown in her own movie but was extremely disappointed
Jun 4 2019,positive,much better than the last one kind of disappointed to only see kong for 2 seconds and it was his back what a tease 
Jun 4 2019,positive,just saw this flick today and after seeing the disparity between the rt critic and audience scores i can honestly tell you the audience got this one right i enjoyed the 2014 godzilla and wasnt sure what to expect from the sequel but you know it has a good look the story is linear just enough mix of ppl v monster scenes and the music was great to me its a much better version of rampage with the rock from last year i really cant think of anyone i know that wouldnt at least be entertained while seeing it
Jun 4 2019,positive,this moving is amazing it focuses more on the monsters than humans its called godzillaking of monsters not human development ft monsters keep in mind 2 things the movie is drastically loud in the beginning so be aware of that also there is a post credits scene
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was dumb loud and awesome loved every minute of it
Jun 4 2019,positive,omg it was everything i prayed to vhs godzilla it would be monsters everywhere and all of the hints to go back to 1 special godzilla movie ill stop here that way i wont spoil anything go see it
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the homage to the monsters and rogues in togos franchise while the plot seems predictable there are some twists that you dont see coming witness the clash of titans on a breathtaking scale that only imax can deliver

Jun 4 2019,positive,movie was awesome would see it again and honestly i wanna get the dvd i love godzilla the special effects were off the chain and everything looked so real everything was done properly
Jun 4 2019,positive,this was hands down the best modern godzilla movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was a epic experience and stayed true to the core of the series and its monsters mike dougherty made a film for the fans and he did not disappoint bear mccrearys score brings new life to akira ifukube original theme and makes it feel like the films of the showa era this film brings more details and lore to this cinematic world of monsters and myths the cast is fun and lovable given the circumstances they face overall this film is a nod to the classic series and gives up a cinematic titan
Jun 4 2019,positive,really critics saw it today in imax and it was great huge monster fights 
Jun 4 2019,negative,really disappointed  i didnt like it kids didnt like it husband didnt like it truth be told i fell asleep several times  and the rest of the time was just so disappointed
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic so well done and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time i was so fascinated with how they corresponded the story line with the legends of the titans so cool and makes sense love it highly recommend
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved all the action
Jun 4 2019,positive,i dont know why the critics panned this one it delivered on the type of movie it was get to see godzilla much more than the first one and the fight scenes were very pleasing to the eye the script had some decent humor and just enough to keep the plot going for better or worse i recommend it to anyone who likes this type of destruction eye candy genre 
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the graphics and fight scenes
Jun 4 2019,positive,9999999x better than the fking trash endgame
Jun 4 2019,positive,i would like to see the other monsters they introduce but thats my only real negative everything else i thought was perfect for gfans
Jun 4 2019,positive,really great movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was so awesome and its total monster showdown
Jun 4 2019,positive,definitely for a fan pays homage to the classic godzilla movies of the 60s and 70s would see it again
Jun 4 2019,positive,fun well paced popcorn munching good time yes the main fights are at the end and humans are a tad goofy a must see for anime lovers and obviously gojira fans
Jun 4 2019,positive,the critics are absolutely wrong this movie freaking rocks it finally gets what a kaiju movie is about i am not going to this movie for a human drama i am here to watch monsters rip each other apart and this movie delivers    this movie has absolutely stunning visuals the monsters look great and the fights rock the sound and music is fantastic it sets the tone and fits everything perfectly    i highly recommend this movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie was true to what fans of godzilla love  it hit every note perfectly  so many great reveals  we went back the next day to see it again
Jun 4 2019,positive,excellent movie a lot of action
Jun 4 2019,positive,marvelous and epic the titans are back
Jun 4 2019,positive,ive loved godzilla from a very young age and this movie did a great job i loved all the monsters that were in the movie and the ending was great
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the seats and the movie was great 2nd time seeing it the price should be cheaper doing it online and reserving the tickets and seats
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie was an absolute blast showing  respect to the original monsters and creators while putting a more modern realistic take on the movie    first off the action was amazing and cgi so realistic it makes the avengers hulk look like a toy story character as for critics saying it had a messy plot or no plot at all or a hard to follow plotif you couldnt follow or understand it the public school system failed you it was amazing and perfectly intertwined with the battles      the battles were justoutstanding even my wife a non godzilla fan thought the action and plot were very well done my only gripe is almost all battles were done in dark stormy weather which still makes sense as king ghidora could generate small storm fronts but still kind of a bummer     other than being in such a dark setting the movie was fantastic the first movie had to much human elements and this one has to littleand some say it still has to much these days no one can ever be satisfied as for certified critics little internet outfits run by 20 something millennials shouldnt be considered critics spoiler im surprised there isnt a metoo for vera farmingas character dying
Jun 4 2019,positive,i couldnt tell you what the story is but this is an absolutely spectacular cinema experience a aweinspiring gaspworthy visual treat 
Jun 4 2019,positive,the first one was boring there was too much human dialogue and not enough godzilla this one is better than the first one since it had a little more monsters and less humans the fight scenes could have been a little longer but they are an improvement over the first snoozer i would have loved to see some of the other monsters create some havoc but they skimped on that overall i liked it and would watch it again
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla is still the king of monsters
Jun 4 2019,positive,again the critics are out of touch with the audience this movie made my jaw drop many times truly awesome
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked everything about gozira
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved that there were many nods to the original japanese monster movies  looking forward to the continuation
Jun 4 2019,positive,the monsters of course great story
Jun 4 2019,positive,you know i was really looking forward to this movie because the godzilla from 2014 was what got me into godzilla so i was extremely excited to see original toho monsters in this i have to say in this movie the monsters do not disappoint the monsters cause the most spectacular shots in the film but heres the thing about monster movies you cant have it completely made up of monsters you need some human characters heres where the movie really loses me they had spent 50 of the film wth these characters so you should expect at least a decent amount of character building yeah that doesnt really happen i understand that you dont go to monster movies for human characters but when you spend that much time with them it becomes important but the movie doesnt deserve a 39 thats blown way out of proportion maybe it was done for attention but i dont know some of the size representation is really good throughout the film and it varies greatly from ground level to monster level camera height while this movie does have some very noticeable flaws it is majorly a good sequel and a strong addition to this franchise 
Jun 4 2019,positive,original theme need i say more
Jun 4 2019,negative,fucking awful  17  10   story sucked  corny  cheesy  made no sense   dont waste your time on this
Jun 4 2019,positive,probably one of the best godzilla movies it has the perfect mix of mindless monster fights and human drama if you are looking for a big fight this is definitely for you this also has absolutely stunning cgi i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,lots of over the top monsters fighting monsters secrete government organizations and nonsense technology and they use blue oyster cults song its a masterpiece
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was the godzilla i grew up with a great popcorn movie that i greatly recommend forget the negative press because when or why do you need a  great human story with a fun movie like this it was a visual tour de force
Jun 4 2019,positive,the cringy script and some bad choices arent enough to kill the fun big dumb fun is still good fun will see it again in 3d where the visual potential seems endless during the amazing monster battles wish the director was half as good at directing humans
Jun 4 2019,positive,this is the movie ive been waiting for since i fell in love with godzilla as a kid its absolutely perfect the critics have it all wrong there is exactly the right amount of human interest but who goes to a godzilla for the storyline anyway if you love kaiju do yourself a favor and go see it
Jun 4 2019,negative,special effects awesomestory telling awful
Jun 4 2019,negative,terrible  cgi was pathetic 3 year old wrote the script
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesomemust see   if you are godzilla fan
Jun 4 2019,positive,took what made the first godzilla good the monster fights and cranked it up to 11 this is what a good godzilla movie is a whole lot of monster vs monster action
Jun 4 2019,positive,we took our grandchildren to see this and we all liked it
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie is really gripping the audience would be on the edge of their seats most of the time its an amazing experience to watch these huge monsters fight definitely a good sequel we have a lot more screen time for godzilla and other monsters as well looking forward for more
Jun 4 2019,positive,a fun bmovie kaiju fans will enjoy it but may be more hitormiss for more general audiences

Jun 4 2019,positive,good movie  lots of throwbacks to classic godzilla films  i would have liked to see some more of the staple characters but otherwise a great entry into the canon
Jun 4 2019,positive,a great action packed movie that will never leave you bored its a monster movie about the actual monsters and not focusing too much on the human drama just the type of monster movie we need
Jun 4 2019,positive,excellent modernized version of one of the monster movies destroy all monsters that i grew up with some added twists and yet another good performance by millie bobby brown
Jun 4 2019,positive,much better than the first one  
Jun 4 2019,positive,i freaking love it lots of action explosions and monster king fights i bought the 3d ticket by accident but it was so worth it this film is beautifully cinematic and the scenery was gorgeous now the plot was totally predictable but the monsters fights with the sound sounds made this movie if you like a good movie with great visual effects and great sounds this is the one godzilla the king of the monsters
Jun 4 2019,positive,entertaining yeah  in the true spirit of godz  not really   one of the scariest things about original godz was his eyes  you could barely see them here
Jun 4 2019,positive,i grew up on godzilla so its a different experience for me
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you want weak plot but awesome monsters this is it  the quentisential monster movie
Jun 4 2019,negative,what a freaking shit show

Jun 4 2019,positive,a fantastic additional to the world of godzilla plenty of kaiju action and inspirations from the toho originals for any hardcore godzilla fan
Jun 4 2019,positive,its great a multi kaiju movie done right  it does have its low points but over all it is amazing  forget what those critics are saying they really dont get what a kaiju movie is about
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie and script see it on the big screen
Jun 4 2019,positive,so much better then the first
Jun 4 2019,positive,my wife and i thought it was a bad a movie loved it
Jun 4 2019,positive,im really not much of a movie goer  in fact im a 52 year old grandma with little interest in godzilla  however my husband and 22 year old son dragged me along to the theater with them i was pleasantly surprised  i thought the storyline plot and special effects were all very good  i was thoroughly entertained  i will probably rent it when it comes out  well done    
Jun 4 2019,positive,best monster movie ive seen in a long time well worth seeing in the theater
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters features some of the best cgi effects i have ever seen  its story is good and the film overall is a hit
Jun 4 2019,positive,this was just fun not trying to be anything big your inner 8 year old will be jumping up and down with excitement
Jun 4 2019,positive,less storyline mothra should have had more badass moments
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome just awesome  majestic retro godzilla fight music mixed with modern  great performances by ken wan mbb kyle chandler vera f   sets up showdown with kong
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was ok it was entertaining but the story was nonsensical and all over the place it seemed like they came up with 4 different story ideas and went with all of them
Jun 4 2019,positive,badass lots of action 
Jun 4 2019,positive,human characters have their own reason to be there they have crazy thoughts which may not be reveal much on why they become like that and you have to think and find theory to fill the blank unless that you may not enjoy their arc for me theyre very forgivable and i dont find that its hard to accept them in the story  plus the aspect on our main monsters godzilla mothra rodan and king ghidorah are perfect you can feel their facial expression personalities and epic monster battle a must buy popcorn movie 
Jun 4 2019,positive,film editing is kinda bad but the scene is so amazing the theme music and roar are from original godzilla movie always be a kaiju fans and i really enjoyed the movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,its what you expect from godzilla not the best acting and its a typical zilla movie so you already know what your gonna get a lot of monsters and a ton of action not something you need to see but its a nice entertaining movie so it does what it was meant to do
Jun 4 2019,negative,2 hour film felt like 4 hours should have been 1 hour so much exposition that basil would be proud it played like the worst of the dceu movies with relentless crashbang wallop pointless plot development excuses for logic unanswered mystries just to move the film forward actors good script and plot not so much monsters good story arcs or dead ends bad
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the movie as a diehard godzilla fanatic only complaint is i wish they wouldve not cut away from the monsters so much the godzilla vs ghidorah ocean scene couldve been amazing
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved it the acting was better than the first one the monsters are amazing the special effects were gorgeous and the plot was straightforward but provided some important societal commentary critics are going to hate but its easily the best godzilla film since giant monsters allout attack and it isnt jsut a great godzilla movie its a great movie period
Jun 4 2019,positive,i like the movies was happy that they put godzilla old theme song in the movie 
Jun 4 2019,positive,one of the godzilla movies of all time
Jun 4 2019,positive,fantastic godzilla movie any fans of the toho films will appreciate all the love put into this film the music actually uses classical themes plus some new ones the composer did a fantastic job the humor felt out of place this would have benefited if it had the same tone as the first one the monsters steal the show they gave each monster such a unique personality and every moment spent with them is memorable while this movie is better than the first it has the same issue of cutting away from the fights to focus on the humans there should have been more focus on the monsters ken watanabe should have been the main character otherwise a great monster movie stick around after the real credits
Jun 4 2019,positive,so much action and loved the movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla rules the roost
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you love godzilla you will love this  if not then maybe you wont but thats irrelevant as this movie was clearly made for godzilla fans and as far as godzilla films go this one is the best
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome movie good soundtrack and lots of actions
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was a great monster movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it all and beautiful homage to the og godzilla movies
Jun 4 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed seeing the monsterverse getting updated to the modern era  as always a great way to kill a few hours with some mindless fun  the story was better than your average godzilla flick from toho which lets be blunt are never about the human element in them but much more about the monster battles and the fights in this movie were really really good
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved this movie was awesome all the professional critics are just plain wrong this was far better than the 2014 movie which i liked also king of the monsters has a far better script acting and lots of awesome kaiju action it blew away kong skull island another film i enjoyed  i really dont understand all the negativity surrounding this movie go see it especially if you are a godzilla or scifi fan this movie was fast paced the 25 hours flew by this wasnt a cheesy monster flick there were true moments of fear and dread plus the return of the classic godzilla music was awesome this is my favorite godzilla film since the original
Jun 4 2019,negative,utter gobshite godawful acting stupid lines mediocre cgi dumb af plot line stay away 
Jun 4 2019,neutral,i had great hopes for this flik i love godzilla movies which is the only reason this got the extra 12 star  the cg was great the monster battles were great  the stupid drama between a family and an over emotional mother to want to reset the earth to 10 was dumb  as was the comparable marvel comics superplane  i wish someone would consult a military analyst when doing such scenes for some resemblance of dignity  instead they ask their 8 yrs old what they thought would be cool  there was zero military realityabsolutely zero
Jun 4 2019,positive,really enjoyed this movie for the action the script could have been better but it was good overall 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i am a godzilla fan and have been fo over 50yrs i have seen all the godzilla movies that have been made  i loved this new version   there was a lot of action and screen time of the monsters   the story line was a little weak but it did not make me love the movie any less  i give it 5 stars for the action i plan on seeing it again
Jun 4 2019,positive,its like the critics know nothing about why fans like movies    if you are a true fan of the toho godzilla movies you will like the new movie    the critics complain about he human characters but praise the monster action um well godzilla is the main hero of the movie some also say theres a weak plot hello its a godzilla movie its like these people have never seen any of the previous 30 other godzilla movies these critics are the same ones who said last jedi was a good movie then attacked the fanboys thats funny because if lucasfilm would have done with the new trilogy that godzilla king of the monsters did with this movie there would have been no solo boycott and disney would not of had to put on hold all there other star wars movies    or maybe its really is all political last jedi was praised by the critics because if its diverse cast and strong female lead godzillas antagonist is an ecoterrorist
Jun 4 2019,positive,action and monsters from the beginning to the end some cgi problems but thats something normal in this type of movie other than that everything is above average
Jun 4 2019,positive,its a typical classic godzilla movie with special effects that toho studios didnt have back in 1954 17plus confirmed pay attention giant dinosaurs fighting each other over puny humans
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie had all the monsters from movies i grew up with  rodin mothra godzillaetc it was action packed
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is probably the first american godzilla to really get the 90s japanese godzilla movies it had better monster fights humans who didnt have too much screen time over the monsters and better score with the actual godzilla theme     go see this movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,its as good as endgame
Jun 4 2019,positive,its big it sounds great its a little dumb but its pretty fun
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it just as good the first godzilla movie the monsters were amazing
Jun 4 2019,positive,one of the best movies of the year for me a great godzilla fan will enjoy this movie and if you are new to the godzilla universe give it a try
Jun 4 2019,positive,if you love godzilla movies you will appreciate the special effects storyline and monster battles in this film
Jun 4 2019,positive,lots of action  almost too much to focus on at times was very nice to see the tie ins from the movies of my childhood  the nuclear explosion ending left something to be desired though
Jun 4 2019,positive,the movie was epic even my mom who isnt a fan of this kind of movie enjoyed it very much i dont know why the critics are giving it such a hard time i read some of their reviews and honestly didnt understand shit 
Jun 4 2019,positive,never disappointed with these movies
Jun 4 2019,positive,a great movie i enjoy it every second waiting for the next one 
Jun 4 2019,positive,pretty good all around movie great action but less than stellar performances
Jun 4 2019,positive,amazing loved every bit of it
Jun 4 2019,positive,daughter convinced me to go much better than i expected great action go see it trust the audience score
Jun 4 2019,positive,this is not the kind of movie you can go into looking for a deep perfectly developed plot this movie is for the monsters and we know its for the monsters while critics are going to give it relatively bad marks for the plot and such it really is a smash thatll carry you throughout the summer and into your homes with the home release please go and enjoy
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it as always lots of action i really liked the monarch stations very creative and it course godzilla and the other monsters were great looking forward to the next godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,a great love letter to the fans truly a great movie for fans and nonfans alike
Jun 4 2019,negative,it was bad the script and acting was bad the action however was surprisingly good overall the movie needed a lot more work done on it very disappointed to say the least 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved the movie it was great
Jun 4 2019,negative,poor story forgettable characters godzilla is defeated over and over
Jun 4 2019,positive,the scale of this film was unbelievable the story wasnt that bad the visuals and action were off the charts incredible and this entry is one good setup for godzilla vs kong the remake this thing is a monster 
Jun 4 2019,positive,much better than the 2014 godzilla
Jun 4 2019,negative,what edwards carved out in the previous chapter is thrown out and they are starting again this was a big mistake    godzilla king of the monsters    dougherty is neither answering nor raising the questions oddly enough the director michael dougherty is also responsible for this chalky screenplay that he cowrote with zack shields but why would they work hard if clashing towering mythological creatures painted by a bucket full of mashed cgi could make its audience drool and fill the pocket of the banner with tons and tons of gold maybe this was too much at least the makers wont be able to judge someone by that after what they have pulled off in this latest installment of a long going franchise but i sincerely want to go through this what is it that makes us giddy up for more of this monster debacle    is it the inner child in us that sees the world with such one dimensional view or is it that stereotypical punching bag feeling exerting rage for a cathartic release that we have been piling up for the whole week and are about to take it all out on a popcorn bag it is not the smash smash smash as much as it looks like it is not for unlike mcu they are not focusing a lot on the choreography of the battle it is still dull but id hardly blame the so called true king of the monsters    it is the humans i find it difficult to bear on screen we are told over and over again to go through the same rigmarole of run run run the pitched in emotions are shallow ergo the entire track of unnecessarily long cast gets thrown off in the garbage so there must be something they have got it right yes there is claiming it to be mythology which it is not of that subtext at all the fanboys are going to have a time of their lives as all their suffering if they consider it to be over the ages is about to come alive in the form of godzilla king of the monsters roaring with his heart out in a gargantuan imax screen
Jun 4 2019,positive,total throwback to the original lots of action and devastation plot is soso the sequels should hopefully tell more of a backstory to the animals
Jun 4 2019,positive,excellent monster fights godzilla is the awesome
Jun 4 2019,positive,i loved it ive been watching godzillas movies since i was a young girl
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was a pretty good movie the effects looked very real and the sounds also sounded very real the overall plot of the movie was pretty good as well and i love the way they implemented the different monsters and characters into the movie without it seeming too forced
Jun 4 2019,positive,a very god movie lots of monster screen time could see the fights the human story line was okay standard disaster family workings   they had little nuggets of info and action that paid homage to the many godzilla movies   are there some flaws yes but who cares its godzilla 
Jun 4 2019,positive,liked it so much i saw it twice in one day millie bobby brown vera farmiga and ken watanabe were great the cgi of the monsters were awesome watching it in imax was amazing and watched it again in 4dx which is best way to watch a movie like this because it is a literal thrill ride of a movie in that format hopefully more 4dx screens become available soon so more can have that experience
Jun 4 2019,negative,too much family melodrama not enough monsters fighting let the monsters fightlet the monsters fight leave the family melodrama on the cutting room floor
Jun 4 2019,positive,intense monsters throughout the whole movie well worth it
Jun 4 2019,positive,i would wait til it comes out on dvd to long and they were dragging it the end was the best part
Jun 4 2019,positive,watch godzilla king of monsters its a very fun time visually stunning conceptually engaging and by all means everything fans of godzilla could have hoped for i dont want to dwell on critic opinions for too long but its a crying shame that for whatever reason theyre too shortsighted to understand how much of a triumph this film is     insofar as making a movie that brings tears to your eyes or makes you stop and ponder your place in society sure king of the monsters may fall short however this was never the intent in a film hefting multiple kaiju around there is absolutely no way to inject an oscarthirsty plot without loosening your grip on the performance and general intimidation factor of the beasts everyone in the audience came to see this latest installment is not the holy grail of movies but it is easily one of the top tier entries in all of kaiju cinema    kotm is a thoughtful and loving apology for the 2014 film which attempted to haul the weighty narrative surrounding its human characters moreso than it carried its lead beasties this new addition to the series gives us fresh takes on all the most popular creatures from kaiju movies past and each of them gets their own heartpounding and aweinspiring time in the spotlight the tension is delicious and the directing is fantastic nothing is done without a purpose here or in other words no one encounter stands out as the good part its all the good part every scene in the movie is masterful even if somewhat predictable beautiful to look at and a hell of a fun time to watch i wont just tell you its good ill ask you to please go see it yourself    to ignore this film is a mistake and to believe its poorly made based on the cold mechanical opinions of critics whove entirely forgotten why people care about godzilla is a tragedy some critics are even saying this movie is preachy or gross for having an environmental messagelike have you ever even seen a godzilla move thats the whole point    watch godzilla king of monsters its a very fun time
Jun 4 2019,positive,amazing movie with so many little easter eggs to the old movies listen to that score people
Jun 4 2019,positive,per usual the human drama was meh but the kaiju action and fan service was fantastic a few parts got glossed over that i thought would help flesh out the universe a bit better but it was still an enjoyable movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,very nice and science fiction film
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was the best everything was awesome except could do with comfier seating
Jun 4 2019,positive,the monster fights were awesome i wish there was more of them and some of them needed to be longer i understand having the human aspect of the movie but i would be okay with less of the humans 8020 monsters overall i enjoyed the movie
Jun 4 2019,positive,back in 2014 we complained that there wasnt enough godzilla they listened so the human side of the story was sacrificed a little its a kaiju movie and we came to see kaiju action this movie delivers
Jun 4 2019,positive,critics need to learn their place
Jun 4 2019,positive,whats not to likemonsters monster fighting monsters fighter with super powers great cast great movie perfect summer popcorn film cant wait to see more
Jun 4 2019,positive,this movie more closely represents the toho godzilla series than any other american production yes the plot is outlandish and goofy but it is very tonally similar to several heisei era films like godzilla vs king ghidorah the monsters are wonderful characters and there are plenty of surprises even for big fans of the series
Jun 4 2019,positive,not enough time on the king of the monsters to much time a the puny humans
Jun 4 2019,positive,cool looking creatures long live the king godzilla
Jun 4 2019,positive,best american godzilla movie by a light year or two
Jun 4 2019,positive,liked the action  effects  and no subtitles  the bad was the movie jumped all over the place and some poor acting and storyline weak  wish camera the turtle was in it as well as kong 
Jun 4 2019,negative,movie was not unbelievable  totally disappointed
Jun 4 2019,positive,the graphic depictions of the monsters were amazing the music retro was insane the fight scenes were epic the easter eggs were many and great to see and figure out the path this new monsterverse is taking is going places next stop skull island  i will however  be very disappointed if this director give king the win there is no way that should have happened in the first place and this time around it is impossible
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked this version it wasnt great by any means but it was entertaining for me anyway i do admire good cgi and special effects i thought this movie did a fine job in both those categories id  say its worth going to the movies and watch the acting is subpar but hey we just wanted to see the monsters anyway
Jun 4 2019,positive,everything about this movie is wicked awesome i loved seeing it in 3d i want to see this movie again the action was outstanding i want godzilla king of the monsters on bluray 3d
Jun 4 2019,positive,too dark  noisy and didnt like the storyline
Jun 4 2019,positive,absolutely phenomenal film definitely worth the 5 year wait
Jun 4 2019,positive,very excitingaction was great
Jun 4 2019,positive,if youre a true godzilla fan you will absolutely enjoy this movie ignore what the critics have to say once you see these monsters in their modern form itll be easy to overlook the flaws the critics attempt to magnify 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked the monster action as you go to a godzilla movie for the action and not character development i didnt like how the movie was missing some toho classic monsters
Jun 4 2019,positive,if u are a true godzilla fan way back when the feature creature hour was on you will love this movie 
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome movie with really great graphics and effects
Jun 4 2019,positive,by far the best movie ive seen in a very long time i loved endgame but this one tops it to me super heroes are great but these monsters are larger than life the way the director laced pieces of pop culture  urban myths like hollow earth  and how all titans in the end pay tribute to the true king  also this is a definite rewatch i feel there is so much info and possible easter eggs in this one that one watch simply wont due  they also pay homage to japans godzilla several times in the movie but one in particular is the soundtrack towards the end  all in all godzilla king of the monsters was everything i could have asked for and then some well worth the 5yr wait  oh and btw there is a post credits scene
Jun 4 2019,positive,the monster fights are great and so are the visuals but anytime theres no fighting youre left with weak characters and a weak story that make you want to get back to the fighting so depending on what you come to the movie for youre either going to love it or be bored with it i came to the movie wanting to see godzilla fight monsters and i got that but more than half of the movie is with characters that are not interesting and makes anything besides the monster fights a little boring but i think some people wont really care i cant say i didnt like it but i cant say im not a little disappointed
Jun 4 2019,positive,this was a great movie to see  i have been a fan of godzilla since i was little  im amazed on how the special effects have improved over the years  the movie is one i will go back and see again
Jun 4 2019,positive,awesome a ton of heated criticism is being fired at this one yet i fail to see what all the fuss is about regarding the supposedly worthless human characters the dominant reason for the mixed reviews truthfully i agree  i did not genuinely care about anything that was happening to them yet i also did not genuinely care about anything that was happening to the humans in the 2014 godzilla thus here it felt more to me as an establishment of continuity for the human characters rather than a decline in their quality and i have no problem with that some of the dialogue is unnecessarily silly as well but it shouldnt be taken seriously it could have been much worse and it never lingers too long thanks to the movie charging forward at such a breakneck pace as for another substantial issue that arose from these american kaiju flicks the human presence sadly outweighed the monster presence in the 2014 godzilla however this newest monsterverse installment favors what feels like an even balance between the two more godzilla  less humans  much better in the end it is possible for engaging welldeveloped human characters to exist in a godzilla film the 1954 japanese original pulled it off with poetic poignant brilliance however considering that the king has over 30 movies to his name only one of which has legitimately credible human characters it seems rather unrealistic to expect the humans in this film to aspire to such a compelling caliber the humans serve their purpose following the standard story arc by releasingawakening the monsters for some scientific curiosity andor belief the monsters fight the humans slowly figure out whose side they are on etc and all while not being overly annoying this is perfectly fine id even say its above average for the humans in a godzilla movie the important aspect of this film emphasis on the word important is the monsters and they do not disappoint whenever the camera shows the goods it is utterly spectacular  epic in every sense of the word godzilla adorns every frame given to him gloriously with all the power and might his legendary name has come to embody rodan is magnificent and grand ghidorah is frighteningly intimidating and every bit as formidable of an opponent as he should be and mothra astounds with beauty awe and ferocity my only nitpick a small one it is is that mothra felt underused she deserved more screentime overall this movie may turn out to be undeservedly underappreciated because of the critics it really isnt that bad godzilla has been the one true monster king in my book since i was five years old and he has yet to be beaten just grab some popcorn relax dont think and enjoy some mindless gratuitous thrilling monster violence and with fists held high and fires scorching the blistered night sky arise to the heavens oh proud bellowing cries long may he live forever may he reign hail to the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved the movie it was awesomem
Jun 4 2019,positive,i really enjoyed it if youre a fan of the classic films then this was made for you 
Jun 4 2019,positive,more action less family drama would have been nice but the zilla story built up nicely
Jun 4 2019,positive,monster scenes were awesome but the movie was slow in the first half and the film focused too much on the humans which we dont care about
Jun 4 2019,negative,awful graphic and storyline  very disappointed
Jun 4 2019,negative,total waste of time and money
Jun 4 2019,positive,godzilla was awesome long live the king
Jun 4 2019,positive,after detective pikachu warner bros once again proves that they know how to make a fun movie just by virtue of respecting the intellectual property theyre working with godzilla king of the monsters is a proper kaiju movie through and through critics seem to have preferred the 2014 movie but id argue that those critics dont even understand the genre theyre reviewing a kaiju movie doesnt need to try to be clever it doesnt need to be 90 humans talking at each other about how to solve the monster menace pacific rim needed either far less plot or far more work done on the plot yet critics loved it this movie has everything you need monsters beating the everloving fuck out of monsters you probably need to know a thing or two about gojiras 65year history in film to fully appreciate everything that goes on but if you love tohos original franchise you will absolutely want to see this movie before it leaves theaters
Jun 4 2019,positive,im happy to see an influx of kaigu type movies and this one was definitely better than its predecessor i would have liked to have seen more long shots camera wise of the fighters and perhaps a bit more time spent discussing each of zillas main opponents  but overall i loved the movie  millie did a great job and she could have been utilized better she got cranstoned  the movie was quite entertaining and held my attention well  it had some laughs and some nostalgia looking forward to seeing gvk
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely loved it best godzilla movie that i have seen in years cant wait for godzilla vs king kong
Jun 3 2019,negative,very disappointing battle scenes were so dark you could hardly see anything and the human characters were poorly written and acted i dont blame the actors for this as weve all seen what theyre capable of so clearly it was the writers and director at fault on this mess

Jun 3 2019,positive,action from beginning to end
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie is awesome the fights scenes are very well done and the godzilla plot is fantastic and straight to the point however the human plot is a complete and utter mess its a straight up failure that makes little sense and gives little reason to care about any of the characters this movie ran about 2 hours and 12 minutes but should have ran at least 3 hours to give time for the plot to develop and for us to emotionally connect with the humanside of this movies plot
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie a must see for godzilla and kaiju fans
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla is a guilty pleasure that demands imax if you like big things destroying bigger things  this is the movie youre look for also bear mccreary kills it again with the music

Jun 3 2019,positive,best godzilla yet ghidorah rocked it
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is one of those kind of movies that you see once and you dont care whether you ever see them again i wouldnt pay full price to go see it
Jun 3 2019,negative,entertaining but fell way short of the first two

Jun 3 2019,positive,it was so so good great action from start to finish
Jun 3 2019,positive,no one wanted to like godzilla more than i  indeed there are many spectacular scenes and compositions in it  the movie is made absolutely intolerable with the human factor  i heard the humans got in the way and i thought the comment silly but in fact its more than true  the needless frenetic editing is also to blame  i noticed the needless rapid editing at the beginning during the human speecheswhy cut so fastto make up for the utter lack of substance  this is a godzilla movie not a meaningful dramait should have just been a fun roller coaster ride that didnt do anymore than have monster fights  that is what i paid for but did not exactly get  the mix of actors was out of whack as well the verizon sales guy classically trained actors and competent supporting cast reduced to looonnnnggg ridiculous expository and rationale   i didnt want to write this but it deserves it
Jun 3 2019,positive,im not a movie snob i loved this movie and so did my son
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of monsters is the movie that visually is better than the previous one the battles of the titans are very well done and the human plot is not bad it does not get boring the two hours and eleven minutes that the appointment lasts
Jun 3 2019,positive,the graphics were amazing
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it its far better then the first and i have no clue why people would claim this isnt a good movie besucase of dialogue and plot lines no one goes to see godzilla for plot lines you go to see godzilla go berserk to see amazing visuals and insane action and this movie didnt disappoint
Jun 3 2019,negative,disappointing i think the movie was more about how many dazzling computer displays they could accommodate with scientific jargon than godzilla i really wanted to like it and it had all the rudimentary hallmarks bringing a new twist to the mothra and other monsters stories but in the end the overriding story the kid hero blah blah blah was just unremarkable
Jun 3 2019,positive,exactly the godzilla movie that needed to come out action comedy and more dont believe the idiotic critics this movie is a summer hit that id recommend for everyone
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome and love the way the story line is
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie a lot of fun to watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,i really liked the movie just wish they had stuck with monsters fighting more than the human drama
Jun 3 2019,positive,very entertaining and the visuals are at the top of the list the best recent godzilla movie and now one of my favorites ill be seeing it again most likely and buying the 4k when available i took my son and he enjoyed it too i saw the 3d version and the one thing id say maybe bring some headphones or ear plugs just in case for the kids it was very loud in a good way but some kids might not like it
Jun 3 2019,positive,solid movie brought back the classics in new form
Jun 3 2019,positive,not a deep nuanced movie but a fun romp with some of the all time great movie monsters fighting each other which was exactly what i wanted out of this movie  good looking cgi good monster vs monster action
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing effects and good segue for the next one
Jun 3 2019,positive,sound  and special effects
Jun 3 2019,negative,it had some good parts but mostly was too long
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was great i really did enjoy it me and my wife
Jun 3 2019,positive,very well done and stayed with the action all the way
Jun 3 2019,positive,action pack from the starter to the end i love the movie it was like being a kid again godzilla king of the monsters great movie

Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved the movie the entire movie was amazing ive followed godzilla since i was a kid and this has been the best one yet most certainly will be viewing it again
Jun 3 2019,positive,for a casual fan of godzilla monster film this movie was perfect  great to see godzilla better in the night shots awesome soundtrack and special effects were just wow  there were some questionable comedic timing elements but overall good acting  
Jun 3 2019,positive,love letter for die hard fans of godzilla movies 
Jun 3 2019,positive,we loved the whole thing the plot the monsters the sound the end credit music  everything
Jun 3 2019,positive,i dont see why every critic is giving this movie negative reviews there is both human action and monster action there is also more monster screentime than the last godzilla movie it reaffirms that america can make great kickass monster movies 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie the humans could have had a better storyline
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely amazing for old fans and new ones highly recommend
Jun 3 2019,positive,as a true godzilla fan from the early 1960s when the movies 1st started you truly appreciate this as you try to guess which monster is crawling out of the earth    the actual story line  was good as a tied into the several the movies    was it worth an academy award of course not but was it worth popcorn and a soda and a saturday night out definitely
Jun 3 2019,positive,good special effects but the writing was just embarrassing also was too long
Jun 3 2019,positive,its exactly what i wanted to see from a godzilla movie i will look forward to watching it again
Jun 3 2019,positive,graphics were great
Jun 3 2019,positive,was it everything i wanted nnno but it was hella cool some things i wish werent there but ultimately i had more of a connection to this movie than any movie by the mcu or other cheap unfeeling disney rehashes dont listen to rotten tomatoes they almost always have no idea what theyre talking about    i can buy tomatoes at the store just as easily as big wigs can just go see the cool kaiju monster movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,coming from someone whose has grown up watching godzilla this movie was more than what i was expecting i highly recommend any and all godzilla fans to go see it and for the non godzilla fans i still recommend it because it is visually a beautiful movie with fantastic cgi and while i admit the humans are forgettable theyre not completely useless and they show promise and character development thatll make their parts interesting but the monster are the true main cast for the movie and they show more than enough character for being mere cgi animals
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved all the monster action godzilla was as awesome as ever ghidorah mothra and rodan were great as well all the character were pretty darn good as well and just the whole movie was a amazing spectacle
Jun 3 2019,negative,very poorly written
Jun 3 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie a lot it has action from beginning to end  not boring at all 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i saw the movie and will see it again its a godzilla movie and my expectations of a giantmonsterromp movie of plot quality depth  acting were exceeded visually the film is a masterpiece the scenes are like works of art king ghidora is honestly one of the top3 iconic monstersvillains in film or literature  a giant 3headed golden dragon which breathes atomic fire and modern cinematic did him and the eponymous king of the monsters proper justice     theres even a postcredits scene like the good ole avengers arc but thats a ripoff you might say the criticism is hollow  people criticize  the ford fusion for looking like an aston martin like thats a bad thing yes it took some visual cues from a manufacturer known for making gorgeous cars and so godzilla used the postcredits to hype a sequel a fun bit of titillation proven successful as a moviemaking technique     the critics can sod off like so many beta kaiju and hail to the king the audience has spoken and have given you lot a matching middle finger to take the piss out of your expert opinion to compliment the inverse of these scores with the last jedi 
Jun 3 2019,positive,as a godzilla fan i have 2 words     yeah
Jun 3 2019,positive,when a movie such as this you have to go in to the film suspending reality to an extent this is due to the fact that it is a movie entirely about 50 story lightning spewing monsters the size of walking skyscrapers fighting just to see who would win but in this suspension of reality you have to also accept that to achieve the intended movie it may not flow or hit the same points and story archs that characterize the now standard movie experiance but instead follows something new and different something intended to serve the sole purpose of maxamizing on the particuler qualitys that this uniqe set of characters has in doing so they have created not only a stunning visual masterpiece with a grand sence of scale but a unique movie unlinke any other it sets the theme and characters extremely early on though they never pushed the feelings emotions and ideas of the human characters to heavely because this move it was never about them it was about tiatans from a time long forgotten fighting for absolute reign over all the air land and sea and that they achieved from the 3 unique personalitys of king gidorahs heads to mothras fierce awe inspiring beauty each titan was crafted to be uniqe and powerfull in their own way and through out the movie they seem to prove there dominance over one and another in what seemed to be the movies climax but then they topped themselfs over and over again in locale after locale leaving me excited and waiting for more the movie had a more than satisfactory conclusion and a fantastic ride to get there ive seen it once already and am planning to see it again and recommend you do to
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic movie that keeps you on edge and brilliant twists to the plot
Jun 3 2019,positive,i thought this was very well done compared to that flop godzilla 2000  i only wish they went with the original godzilla 60s or 70s dont care for the one they created for the tristar toho project with matthew broderick
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie will watch it again
Jun 3 2019,positive,a great kaiju film but the human acting was kinda a blur and not really memorable
Jun 3 2019,positive,action and visuals were great storyline was not acting was mostly decent
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was really fast paced at times you hadto really wonder who was who in land of monsters overall it was a good movie i took a 17yr old and a 10 yr old and they enjoyed it very much it wasnt full of alot of bad language or too scary
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was awesome just didnt understand why they didnt have all 17 monsters fight in one huge battle thats the only thing that woulda made it better maybe theyre saving that for godzilla vs kong so heres to hoping that happens lol
Jun 3 2019,positive,a fun ride with plenty of action and lots of easter eggs for fans of the japanese godzilla films biggest complaint is that most of the action scenes with the kaiju are filmed with the shaky cam technique often zoomed in close to the monsters and filmed at night in a storm this makes it very difficult to follow the action and to enjoy the kaiju battles which is a real shame because thats really why were going to see this movie right otherwise a silly but good movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,ive read the critics reviews and i definitely understand why the movie is scoring so low  i never rate movies i just enjoy them  the thing is that at some point you really have to look at things for what they are   i grew up with godzilla on sunday afternoons and sick days in bed while growing up  even then i thought they werent the greatest but hey they were fun  now im in my 40s i watch movies to be moved or to feel something that was unexpected  but i always enter those first credits knowing what im in for  what im sitting there watching  and my opinions weigh on the premise  today i saw godzilla and not the english patient or moonlight  i went to see what i watched growing up as a child minus the rubber suits and i was throughly entertained  were there plot holes yes  but the acting was good the effects immense and at times down right beautiful and the movie as a whole was fun  i go to see horror movies to be scared dramas to feel moved and godzilla movies for the fun and i had fun 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is good godzilla movie shut up
Jun 3 2019,positive,okay so lots os monster action as promised human story was alright at best monthra has zero development and hardly any screen time big build up in the beginning but payoff fell flat and felt inconsequential mothra felt like a flash in the pan rodan was better with more army fight sequences ghidora seemed to be the main focus and had most screenfight time ghidora gave godzilla an awesome fight godzilla has always been cool the most disappointing aspect of this movie are the dormant titan designs that look unimaginative or unoriginal some giant spider looking thing and a weird looking mammoth knockoff no exciting designs did enjoy movie but felt empty with all the build up with other titans c rating
Jun 3 2019,positive,best movie to watch full of act
Jun 3 2019,positive,the previous movie was a big disappointment but this movie more than makes up for it terrific fighting scenes a few plot holes but the movie overall was exciting 
Jun 3 2019,negative,plot was awful  went on for an eternity
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it not too much story filler the fight scenes are epic finally a great godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,negative,should have had more monsters  the human side was just cumbersome all those monsters and none really got used
Jun 3 2019,positive,great action movie and only that straight action from beginning to the end if you want a wholesome movie than this might not be for you but if you want action to excited and from start to finish than you do not want to miss this
Jun 3 2019,positive,great action throughout
Jun 3 2019,positive,everything related to the humans are bland and boring but that doesnt not matter in the slightest because were watching a godzilla movie which they delivered with the best kaiju sequences ever on the silver screen
Jun 3 2019,positive,the only thing i hated was the gd
Jun 3 2019,positive,could have been great if1 they did not spend sooo much time on the humans 2  the soundtrackmusic would have been a bit louder  3  the other monsters joined the battle  king kong has a quick cameo  would have like to seen gamera  beautiful cgi with mothra and rodan  loved that they went into godzillas ancient background that his race use to be an intelligent species with their own society makes sense if anyone remembers son of godzilla being able to speak  go see great for the kids no gore or swearing
Jun 3 2019,neutral,the action scenes were good the acting was ok but the story and explanation on why its happening is terrible
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved the action it was everything i couldve hoped for the story made perfect sense and the acting was great ill see it again in 3d
Jun 3 2019,positive,wasnt terrible but wasnt mind blowing still definitely worth seeing in the theatres though since youll really get sucked into the battle sequences
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic movie best of the giant monster flicks ive seen so far most action in a movie ive seen this year so far too 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie fixed everything that was wrong with the first one and massively improved every aspect that it got right the amount of focus on the monsters was amazing and there was a great balance of story and action ive never seen a movie that i genuinely enjoyed as much as this one the critics reviewing this have no appreciation of the magnificence that is a real kaiju movie 
Jun 3 2019,positive,went to see monsters fight it delivers in that regard human element was lacking but its a decent watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,for true godzilla fans and definitely a good continuation of the godzilla 2014 movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,the critics are crazy this is awesome the effects are fantastic and while the acting wont win any oscars it was still awesome movie fun great monster movie to the say the least sit back and enjoy the ride 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i really liked this movie  lots of action and background story  looking forward to the next one with kong 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is a godzilla fans dream every kaiju is a work of art and the soundtrack was to die for the critics have no idea what theyre talking about this movie is a blessing to fans of the genre and an entertaining monster mash for audiences who love a lot of action easter eggs and character development you can really tell that director mike dougherty really cared about the source material 1010 should go see this and then on the biggest screen possible
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was ok  action was good but movie was too long  dragged in the middle  movie did not have much of a plot  zero ending  special effects were good
Jun 3 2019,positive,great action epic battle sequences worthy of a dolby theater watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,what an amazing movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,a godzilla movie that goes back to its original toho roots definitely a mustsee if youre a true godzilla fan
Jun 3 2019,neutral,just average terrible human characters
Jun 3 2019,positive,a love letter to the toho fans and a great kaiju movie  i thought it was a fantastic godzilla movie  cant wait to see again
Jun 3 2019,positive,exciting sequel to the first installment this film opts for the exact opposite structure and tone to its predecessor instead of a dull human story leading up to one major monster bash as in godzlilla 2014 this film doubles down on giant monster action set pieces within a straightforward structure the mythology is fleshed outand hurried a bit too much the characters human story is decent enough but kyle chandler and millie bobby brown are truly excellent in their roleseven with occasionally clunky predictable dialogue the underlying messaging is on point if also a little obvious and heavy handed it does miss a major element concerning any reactionat allto the villains origins    the biggest flaw in the film is the times where the dialogue seems to be reaching for marvels insouciance and witand failing    overallit is an absolute mustsee film on the big screen these monsters are meant to be experienced at scaleand only a movie screen will do    fun exciting fanservice galoreif you know the history of these films you can easily tell the entire cast and crew come from a deep level of love and knowledge for the source material    and bear macrearys score wow
Jun 3 2019,negative,movie was slow and really dragged on i kept checking the time to see how much longer was left the flow of the movie doesnt work even when you suspend your beliefs the movie still has some scenes that make no sense the fight scenes between the monsters where ok this by far could be in the running for the worst action movie of the summer i felt so cheated about this movie i created an account just to post how bad it is 
Jun 3 2019,positive,super good the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesomebest one  loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,the story was decent but i didnt really need an oscarworthy performance from the human actors when the monster spectacle was so so righteous
Jun 3 2019,positive,wnder what movie the critics saw  i enjoyed the movie thought it was better than the first one  updated versions of the monsters from back in the day
Jun 3 2019,positive,excellent movie human characters have the charm necessary that they dont detract from the monsters all of whom are given great personalities the fights are great and the callbacks to the japanese movies particularly via the soundtrack are delightful 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i think the critics dont get the genre or are over analyzing it i thought this godzilla had one of the best stories of the entire genre it had a few twists and a clear coherent story the battles were great and my only complaint was that i wanted the other monsters to be involved more this is one of my favorite godzilla movies of all time and im a lifetime fan which also makes me highly critical of doing the series justice they did ignore the critics and if you enjoy movies like this you will enjoy this movie 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was awesome it was a great tribute to the japanese movies and so much more rt is clearly wrong with their rating 
Jun 3 2019,positive, i thought this movie was great i know that the professional critics have complained that there was too much time for the monsters on the screen but any real godzilla fan would love the movie or the fact that we didnt have all th drawn out dialogue and cutting from the monster fights to more drawn out dialogue the movie was damn near perfect 
Jun 3 2019,positive,back to the big daikaiju wars much fun no shakespeare sorry critics 
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved the movie  enjoyed how the plot played out with the whole planet being involved in the melee  will see it again too hopefully a a drive in  the only drawback was the selection of seats i madewont make that mistake again
Jun 3 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan u will love iti loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,extremely entertaining  there are a few quirks in the plots surrounding humans but this is a popcorn eating summer flick anyway not shakespeare in the park  the monster fight scenes are incredible
Jun 3 2019,positive,what an awesome movie totally blew my mind a must see
Jun 3 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,perfect movie for dbox and friends

Jun 3 2019,positive,if your a fan the movies they keep getting better and better 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i do like the film a lotbut i can see what others are saying about the human parts of the film just to loosely tie the better monster parts together may be the 3rd part will even it all out

Jun 3 2019,positive,if you love monster movies and godzilla then this is the movie to see
Jun 3 2019,positive,great monster action and thats all i really came to see even though i feel the characters couldve had a little bit better dialogue and reasoning 
Jun 3 2019,positive,really good will watch again
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is the kind of movie you go to a theater to see plenty of bigger than life action good story line a good old fashioned monster flick with modern special effects godzilla is the ultimate movie monster of my childhood and this version did not disappoint the only thing missing was the dialogue matched the japanese actors lip movements hahaha
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic movie tons of fun and the monster fights were awesome 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this latest godzilla movie this film has most of the monsters from the toho studios kind of a battle royale the only monster missing is gamera but otherwise it is a fun movie to watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,back in 2014 godzilla was reintroduced to the west for the first time in years and was created with a careful amount of respect to the world renowned monster now in 2019 the sequel has arrived and is now made as a love letter to all godzillakaiju fans the amount of lore and effort they placed within the film is fantastic and beautifully crafted  
Jun 3 2019,positive,what a monster movie is supposed to be screw the know nothing critics
Jun 3 2019,positive,i saw it for the 2nd time today love it even more one of my favorite godzilla movies definitely going to watch it for a 3rd time go godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic kaiju fighting lackluster plot but still a fantastic addition to the godzilla movie franchises 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the special effects were great but the story was kinda weak
Jun 3 2019,positive,im a life long godzilla fan and i thought this movie was great  would have liked a little less tallytalky and a little more fightyfighty but eh its hollywood  the script was on par with usual godzilla scripts but one doesnt go to a godzilla movie for thought provoking dialogue  over two thumbs up  go see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it everything i want and expect from a godzilla movie  cant wait to see it again at least one more time  cant wait for godzilla vs kong  awesome movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you are looking for a good old fashion kaiju movie youll love this one
Jun 3 2019,positive,not as much monster action as i wouldve liked to see  there were a couple of scenes that reminded me more of the 1950s movies versus todays cinematography
Jun 3 2019,positive,true monster movie so refreshing
Jun 3 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie  simply stunning
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it fights and lore were amazing a must see
Jun 3 2019,positive,popcorn movie fun i didnt go here to see hamlet and i dont go to shakespeare in  the park to see giant monsters crush everything in sight in the middle of a massive battle royale   this had lots of the latter  if you like the latter you should go see this  if you dont dont see this
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie awesome action  
Jun 3 2019,positive,the monsters looked great it was exciting
Jun 3 2019,neutral,spectacular cgi and action when the monsters are actually on screen boring and stupid when they are not

Jun 3 2019,negative,not enough monster fighting
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing godzilla movie action made up for what the story lacked
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is the definitive american godzilla movie its everything ive wanted to see since i was a kid for two hours i was an eight year old again and its rare that s movie does that
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic cinematography strong logical character development for the monsters weak nonsensical human character development in short the monsters are believable while the humans are not 
Jun 3 2019,positive,excellent an absolute must see for godzilla fans and just plain fun for action fans in general everything from the designs to the audio to the imagery is a love letter to the franchise none of the criticism holds any water just go have a good time
Jun 3 2019,positive,66100 first half was good and had a natural flow but towards the end it started to drag on it felt like the movie was 2030 min to long but the ending was epic but the pace leading up to the finale of the movie almost ruined it for me but the last 5 to 10 mintues was an epic ending
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was big dumb fun looking forward to the next one
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved every scene 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ive ever seen and as a giant monster movie only pacific rim has it beat i was genuinely surprised its as good as it is its about 5000 percent better than the last one
Jun 3 2019,positive,fabulous dumb fun the plot is hot nonsense the performances are campy as hell and the monster battles are awesome where it stumbles is overestimating the audiences investment inpatience with the characters but silver lining these moments are great for bathroom breaks 
Jun 3 2019,positive,pure hot and steamy monster on monster action
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla was outstanding im an old school fan so this was the best remake yet i cant wait to see the next one
Jun 3 2019,positive,way better than expected
Jun 3 2019,positive,i saw it two times and i can say that this movie is for the fandom its for fun not to be criticized on realism or characters 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this was one of the best godzilla movies ever you critics do not understand godzilla movies sometimes the plot does not really matter when you have good monster action this was written for godzilla  fans and pays homage to all the previous godzilla  movies this movie is great entertainment for godzilla fans to bad you just dont get or understand it 
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was good the kid loved it definitely recommend seeing this movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,an actual godzilla movie we did it guys it felt like a real godzilla movie perfect balance of human to monster and excellent campmelodrama throughout never bored great call backs to the toho movies while doing great new stuff it will be hard to top this one
Jun 3 2019,positive,good flick not as awesome as the first one but entertaining  the only problem is that the main characters are too weak that became totally unnecessary to the plot 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i waited for the signature godzilla roar for the first ten minutes of the movie they were by the way the slowest of the twohour long movie things are a bit predictable but not so much that they cant let you have some fun my only problem is that the movie theater only had two times for the show and both were difficult for my wife and i to make i blame disneys aladdin for hogging up all of the time slots
Jun 3 2019,positive,this was a blast and a fun popcorn moviei loved every minute of it its a must see in imax
Jun 3 2019,positive,derails wear great compared to the original destroy all monster movie mothra was fantastic thanks
Jun 3 2019,positive,i just got back from godzilla king of the monsters it was glorious and so much fun the monsters look so badass i loved it so much   
Jun 3 2019,positive,once again movie critics prove that they should not be paid to do what im doing right now this movie while not perfect is worth 20 captain marvels in a world where every marvel movie is considered fresh there is no reason for why this movie is considered rotten theres plenty of great acting from the cast a plot with actual consequences and above all big fucking monster fights 
Jun 3 2019,negative,blurry flash flash flash poor story line unbelievable characters nobody to cheer for original 50s version had better special effects
Jun 3 2019,positive,i dont know why the critic rating is bad because of lack of human drama the main character of this movie was who it should be godzilla besides the drama and plot that was there was better than any this franchise has put out to date this movie is an amazing theater experience and i would encourage all fans of amazing movie special effects to go see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,please avoid the critics 
Jun 3 2019,positive,we wanted monsters and we got it the first and king of the monsters are equally great they werent kidding when they said this was the paper view of monster fights the human dialogue was enough in my opinion whether it was less than the first or not i dont understand how people can complain about not enough monsters and then too many monsters make up your minds people
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was awesome so full of surprises and love all the action our kids enjoyed it too
Jun 3 2019,positive,giant monsters fighting thats all i need to say
Jun 3 2019,positive,its good for what it is
Jun 3 2019,positive,this gave me a feeling of the classic godzilla films a good blend of human and kaiju scenes although i think still think there needs to be more monster scenes a full fight with little interruption but not sacrificing the human scenes they did their research with this film and i highly recommend anyone who likes godzilla to see this you should not be disappointed it
Jun 3 2019,positive,just a fun summer movie great action some great characters and fun storyline dont listen to the critics listen to the fans
Jun 3 2019,positive,long live the king loved that this movie had much more kaiju action and less human drama this time it was all in focus and front and center im here for the title character godzilla not some ecoterrorists flawed logic in my opinion mothra is the real mvp i look forward to seeing the the other kaiju in a future movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you like godzilla youll like the movie if you dont like godzilla you may not get it
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was amazing just plain old monsters fighting each other to death might sound dull but in this day and age where everything is plot heavy this is a welcome change this is what pacific rim part 2 shouldve been
Jun 3 2019,positive,best monster movie since the last godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was just ok definitely not my favorite of the genre im glad i got to see it on the big screen im also glad i didnt have to pay full price

Jun 3 2019,positive,this is the godzilla fans have wanted forever not a terrorizing destroy everything creature but a benovilant one that brings balance to the planet when necessary
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is the godzilla film fans have been waiting for ignore the negative reviews from critics
Jun 3 2019,positive,great godzilla fun i felt like i was 10 years old again i saw my first godzilla movie in theaters back in 1970 and this thrilled me as muck as that first one did
Jun 3 2019,positive,my daughter and i thought the movie was great  it is a movie for godzilla fans  lots of action with only a few dull spots in between  we do agree with the critics that the story could have been a little better
Jun 3 2019,positive,several scientific issues assuming the premise of the existence of titans is to be believed radiation would have destroyed anyone who came close to godzilla  characters were constantly too close to the action to have survived not very scientifically sophisticated for a scifi movie in 2019
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie lived up to the billing cant wait for the next movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was exactly what i was missing in the first one and wanted in the second one monster action 
Jun 3 2019,positive,all the people were stupid but the monsters were amazing
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it go see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla and his monster crew are always a fun time on screen unfortunately the poorly fleshed out human characters take up the majority of the screen time
Jun 3 2019,positive,ive pretty much seen all of the godzilla movies  from the original black and white ones made in japan up to now  this movie by far topped all previous godzilla movies period  wow wow just wo
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was so good im going to watch another three times definitely recommend
Jun 3 2019,positive,great visual action lighting and fast paced  this is a giant monster movie and the best one ever made    the monsters were created extremely well    except for some jokes to keep it from being too dark the movie took itself very seriously and executed the scenes dramatically and powerfully    great action movie and best kaiju movie hands down all time
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved this movie i thought it was gonna be below average because of a review i saw before but halfway through i realized they didnt know what they were talking about 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the story is weak as youd expect but as long as the monsters are on the screen and godzilla its awesome
Jun 3 2019,positive,epic awesome marvellous 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was good  i did not like sitting in the old seats since we paid for the 2d imax show  this show was expensive
Jun 3 2019,positive,great special effects to match an interesting story and good enough acting a must see in the theater to get the great sound of the movie good summer movie and the kids will love it long live godzilla king of the monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,very enjoyable a godzilla fan since young whats next
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie especially if ur s godzilla fan cant wait for the next one to come out and oh yes its coming  
Jun 3 2019,positive,im a fan of the godzilla movies my family and i really enjoyed it thank you
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie need not say more
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved it i was literally watching in awe do yourself a favor and go see this beautiful film in imax
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie lived up to the hype for the most part visuals were amazing and the fights jaw dropping the only thing that keeps this movie from being the perfect monster fight movie is the humans yes i know the movie isnt about the humans but that doesnt mean the human scenes doesnt bog the movie down while some parts were interesting and enjoyable like powering godzilla with the nuke other scenes seem to drag and drag and drag to add icing on the cake the majority of the shots for the monster fightthe focal and best parts of the movie are more often then not viewed through the human perspective cockpit views upward shots etc if the humans and the monster were more balanced out or if the monster fights werent shot from the perspective of humans i would give it a 5 star 100 the best parts of the movie is when its just all out monster fighting with camera shots that are at their level so my final verdict is that king of the monsters is right on the brink of kaiju monster fighting perfection
Jun 3 2019,positive,better than i expected the bomb
Jun 3 2019,positive,love it im a big godzilla fan the monster fights was awesome cant wait to see king kong vs godzilla in 2020
Jun 3 2019,positive,enjoyed it more than the first
Jun 3 2019,positive,how did the critics get this so wrong thoroughly enjoyable
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was good critics care about the story and characters but that doesnt matter this movie has everything a godzilla movie should have monsters fighting
Jun 3 2019,positive,great fan service to long time godzilla fans
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you love godzilla youll love this movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,a very fun and exciting movie to watch exactly the kind of entertainment i expect to see at the theater during summer break the kind that creates fun summer memories
Jun 3 2019,positive,i felt this movie was epic had me on edge and was a great monster movie i recommend seeing this one in the theater
Jun 3 2019,positive,this was probably the best one out of all godzilla movies made as time progresses the graphics and special effects become more outstanding which in turn makes movies even better aside from actors i cant wait for the next one
Jun 3 2019,positive,i saw this movie twice in 3 days its a fun and well done movie for any die hard godzilla fan full of action and more godzilla as we were promised 
Jun 3 2019,positive,couldve set the monsters loose sooner and made it a shorter movie but all in all it was pretty good
Jun 3 2019,positive,i thought this movie wasnt going to be good  but for my surprise it was really good  you need to come see it 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i thought that there would be more scenes with rodan and mothra   but i enjoyed the movie overall and for once the battles were not in the dark
Jun 3 2019,positive,it delivers really well on giant monsters beating the snot out of each other it looks amazing and theres plenty of audiencepleasing moments of mothra godzilla et al being awesome the writing on the other hand my god the family dynamic and vera farmigas character in particular is abysmally handled there is one scene in particular a plotcharacter motivation dump that made me turn to my friend and say this is so f stupid to which he nodded in agreement ken watanabe gets some good scenes though and get out dad is fun even though he gets about twice as many oneliners as the movie needs
Jun 3 2019,positive,entertaining movie a little too much focus on the humans though
Jun 3 2019,positive,i like that it was explained how the monster came about cant wait for more to come
Jun 3 2019,negative,the only reason this movie gets as much as 2 stars is because visually the monsters look cool otherwise this movie is a mess they gave a recognizable cast nothing but cookie cutter characters  a generic overused script other than seeing godzilla early on rather than waiting an hour like the last one he still didnt get a lot of screentime and somebody forgot to do their homework especially with godzilla and mothras history
Jun 3 2019,positive,great monster movie wonderful references to classic kaiju lore
Jun 3 2019,positive,this film is so good its not perfect but it gives you everything you want from a monster film just go and see it 
Jun 3 2019,negative,i love godzilla but there was so much wrong with this film that it left a bad taste and just straight out bummed me out the film was overall boring the sound effects in the film just didnt fit the scenes the cgi was borderline okay and the fight scenes were just a big blur the characters did not have 1 ounce of chemistry both as actors and in the story the scriptdialogue was cringy and cheesy the acting was flat out awful not that any of these are bad but it just didnt work out  a real step back in the godzilla franchise a plain ole popcorn flip that barely keeps you awake 
Jun 3 2019,positive,if youre a old school godzilla movie fan you will probably love it like i did but if you pick apart movie details like radiation exposure you may have some issues witt this one
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved the monster brawls and even the human story aspect i would have liked a little less humans and more monsters such as mothra as she was so beautiful and bad ass so that is my only complaint this is a wonderful love letter to the toho franchise and especially the fans i loved the easter eggs throughout the movie and mike doughertys interpretations of the titans or kaiju as known in japan were very impressive bear mccrearys score incorporating iconic toho music such as mothras song was a joy to hear dont listen to what the critics are saying they obviously expected some sort of kaijushakespeare mash up and have no idea how to critique a film such as this this film was made for the fans and also to help bring new fans to the franchise the movie is visually spectacular and a joy to watch especially on an imax screen i will be seeing this movie again and it will be in my collection when it is released for home viewing again run do not walk to your nearest theater and see this movie on the biggest screen possible its a total summer blockbuster and you wont be disappointed 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was what godzilla andor kaiju fans want regardless of what professional critics want  
Jun 3 2019,positive,ive been a fan of the godzilla franchise for over 20 years and this movie was exactly what a godzilla movie should be like lots of kaiju action with just the right amount of story to balance it all out lots of references that any godzilla fan would understand and a lot of things that even took me for surprise
Jun 3 2019,positive,i enjoyed it  the monster were great and there is plenty of action but the humans are not very interesting  might have been a better movie had they cut about 30 minutes of plot and just let the monsters do their thing
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla coudnt be more awesome
Jun 3 2019,positive,beautiful action sequences with highly impressive cgi it didnt disappoint and the storypace had a knack for pulling me into the titans chaotic world 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great action great monsters stuff especially godzilla great characters but that girl from stranger things had a bad haircut
Jun 3 2019,positive,it had giant monsters fighting and destroying things which is exactly what i wanted to see
Jun 3 2019,positive,dont believe the critics im not an oldschool godzilla fan but i loved the way they did the first film and came here looking for monsters fully expecting everything else to be at least passable     and boy were my expectations exceeded the human characters are twodimensional but less irritating than the first movie so its a win in my book the monster fights are breathtaking and on a gigantic scale  the sheer force of any particular movement makes you feel like the insignificant ant you would be to these behemoths     such a titanic movie is not without titanic cheese however and some scenes spread that cheese on real thick but still all in all id go see it at least a few more times 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i saw it last thursday and it was terrific the homage to the kaujus were very well done forget the human story and just have fun
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic film more kaiju action than the previous one  visually insane and the music is incredible  the human drama makes more sense here than in the 2014 prequel  a must see
Jun 3 2019,positive,gojira at his finest  the new monsterverse is looking good  i really enjoyed the movie and my boys could not keep from discussing every aspect  while the critics may pan the movie  i do not care as they have the i am the critic and you do not know any better  i had a great time and will see it again in the theater
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely fantastic update in line with the fun sequels of the 70s
Jun 3 2019,positive,visually stunning  sequences and transitions were amazing  story was good enough to pay respect to the originals however some things felt choked or forced into the film   left it open to continue expanding on the monster verse   will definitely see again
Jun 3 2019,positive,a little slow in the start but when the action kicked off it kicks hard
Jun 3 2019,neutral,monsters were cool but plot and acting soso
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was amazing and brilliant but theater was not too good i will rewatch it in amc theaters
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it must see movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,critics are toxic af  watched it first the best movie that i ever experienced
Jun 3 2019,positive,forget what these idiot critics think this movie is awesome make sure you see it in the cinema i cant wait to watch it again
Jun 3 2019,positive,honest opinion is that i actually cried every time there was a monster battle the acting was alright but thats not that important to me i came to see the movie for awesome special effects and godzilla fights and it did not disappoint me
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is a real godzilla movie  reminds me of the movies i grew up with
Jun 3 2019,positive,i think it was wonderful a love letter to fans more kaiju than human drama more destruction and kicking ass all these critics of the movie can suck it is it a good godzilla movie yes it is criticizing this movie on different term than that is just asinine
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was absolutley amazing even better than the 2014 remake gkom combined so many classic elements that makes the older movies great and added a modern twist the critics are so wrong godzilla movies never have that much human drama and i think they added enough into the movie godzilla is all about the action packed adventure
Jun 3 2019,positive,nice one   best cg work  worth movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic long live the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,improved story and characters from 2014 still not enough giant monster fights but still an improvement from 2014
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was one of the best godzilla movies to date my only complaint was that they focused a lil too much on the terrible characters to give this movie a low score because of the characters is a real childish way of rating this kaiju film it is my favorite godzilla film to date
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome godzilla he is
Jun 3 2019,positive,an amazing action packed film worth a repeat watch loved the story and the monster fight action the human drama was great also and worked well
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is godzilla not the godfather this was made for godzillamonster movie fans thought it was well conceived with enough of the human element to provide a context for the battle royal of monsters was delightfully surprised as i enjoyed some of the characters interactions as with other godzilla movies it is ridiculous at times and people say corny things it is a movie about a giant lizard so what do you expect  loved the references to earlier godzilla movies thoroughly enjoyed the movie in imax recommend to any fan who has an interest in monster movies long live the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,do you like giant monsters beating each other up do you like godzilla do you enjoy epic scores then this movie is definitely a must watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,really awesome movie  i dont know what the critics are expecting from this film  most of us are just expecting monsters fighting and mass destructionwhich the film delivers  it really sets up any future films well with the hollow earth theory and mentions of skull island  i am looking forward to the next installment 
Jun 3 2019,negative,i have watched most godzilla movies i think hollywood forgot it is about monsters fighting and destroying cities during the biggest battle they decide to focus on the actors and the fight was a side thing then godzilla wins using some over powered move such a cheap way to win maybe the director needs to watch an actual godzilla film before wasting a year creating this garbage 1 star because it is godzillalol
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla kicking butt what is there not to love fights scenes were great i thought the human element was good
Jun 3 2019,positive,i absolutely loved every second maybe there are certain human characters that dont add that much to the plot but that wont ruin a great kaiju fight movie in the end thats what every godzilla fan is waiting to see definitely a must watch besides what critics say
Jun 3 2019,positive,while the less than grounded story as compared to their two previous movies godzilla kong skull island does hamper the overall tone of the movie earthshattering monster battles accompanied by iconic music turn a mediocre scifi movie into a must see battleroyale
Jun 3 2019,negative,garbage pacific rim was on to something these guys didnt take notes no one cares about the stupid human stories ffs
Jun 3 2019,positive,it truly did feel like the godzilla movies i remember watching as a youngster except with better visual effects and better acting the monster action was intense and the visuals were breathtaking a must see for every fan of the franchise or anyone wanting to see a good scifimonster movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters has a premise giant monsters battling each other for the title of king and on that aspect it delivers perfectly the main focus of the movie is the conflict between the monstrous titans which unlike the previous movie are shown to us in their entirety without blueballing us from the intense action much like pacific rim the movie does provide with some human drama but on a same level it provides us with raw savage action every moment the titans are on screen is deeply cinematic with ghidorah  the threeheaded main antagonist  practically stealing every scene its in watching him do battle against godzilla is deeply satisfying and it most definitely scratches an itch any fan of giant monster movies has been feeling ever since pacific rim granted that the story itself falls short with its many holes and inconsistencies such things can be ignored when you realize you didnt come to watch a realistic movie nor did you come for the human drama you came to watch epic giant monsters battling for dominance and if thats what you want you will not leave dissatisfied especially if you want to see the big trio of monster movies  godzilla king ghidorah and mothra  brought to life with some fantastic gorgeous cgi that we wish japan would emulate truly a treat and a gem for any fan of the giant monster genre the type of movie where you can shut off your brain and simply appreciate the nonsensical over the top spectacle given 
Jun 3 2019,positive,classic godzilla loved it  wish we saw more of the other titans in action though   a couple slow spots but very entertaining childhood memories came rushing back
Jun 3 2019,positive,the artistic detail of the monsters was phenomenal ive been a fan of godzilla movies since i was a child and have seen them all  this is the best one yet and i look forward to godzilla vs kong
Jun 3 2019,positive,kyle chandler was terrible there is a reason hes nowhere in the trailer fortunately the rest of the movie was very good
Jun 3 2019,positive,this really delivered exactly what i wanted and expected  lots a big monsters lumbering around wreaking havoc everywhere  and the human focus was on a core family of estrange husband wife and daughter  the actress who played the daughter an alum from stranger things was fabulous  godzilla the monster deserves an oscar  dont know why it wont register my rating but i would give it four stars
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome monster visuals  mothra is amazing  could care less about the humans and their story as it only takes away from the monster battles  you still have to see it in theaters for the size and sound alone  this wont be the same on your tv
Jun 3 2019,positive,5 stars if more of the 17 mentioned monsters fighting vs mostly just ghidorah and godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,the cg was stunning the story line was a and the action was nonstop probably the best godzilla movie ever made
Jun 3 2019,positive,great special effects awesome battles
Jun 3 2019,positive,story was pants but i got what i came for monsters kicking the crap out of each other very enjoyable
Jun 3 2019,positive,if any movie is deserving of being seen in imax its this one the third time really is the charm for americanmade godzilla movies this one is a true love letter to longtime fans of the series while also being very accessible to viewers who have never seen any other godzilla movie unlike the 1998 and 2014 offerings this movie does not act like it is embarrassed of the source material both the action and human storyline are much more well done and engaging than they were in the 2014 movie which i found very underwhelming anyone can tell that the director of this movie michael dougherty takes the godzilla franchise and characters seriously and treats it with the respect it deserves after 65 years the previous two american godzilla movies fell flat because the directors tried to take the godzilla brand and mold it to fit their own ideas of what a godzilla movie should be godzilla king of the monsters stays true to the style and feel of the japanese movies and thats why it works so well do yourself a favor and see it in imax
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was above average for this series i still want longer fight scenes and less plot interruptions with scientists and military folk save each other 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i thought it was pretty good there were many ideas from the japanese series that they brought into this one and i appreciated that i feel like the ratings should have been better
Jun 3 2019,positive,freaking awesome saw it twice this movie was made for the fans 
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a godzilla movie yay
Jun 3 2019,positive,  it is an excellent movie of kaiju the excellent confrontation scenes and as a secondary history the problems of the family and how the government see them as a threat or very good weapon
Jun 3 2019,positive,you can not go wrong with huge monsters fighting the only negative is humans still take up a ton of the run time
Jun 3 2019,positive,best godzilla great action and great effects
Jun 3 2019,positive,great action movie and a continuation of the 2014 flick  some parts of the interpersonal story are not particularly believable but the monsters brought their a game
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was a lot of fun and i cant understand my these so called biased critics are ripping it apart it had some issues for sure but it doesnt merit the constant hate its getting if you look at critics reviews its obvious that there are those who want to see this movie tank big time dont listen to these smell their own farts intellectuals its a fun popcorn movie that im sure youll enjoy
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie the human part is kinda boring but the monsters part wow excellent combat scenes
Jun 3 2019,positive,luv the movie true godzilla fan stupid critics dont know what there talking about
Jun 3 2019,positive,that was a fantastic godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,its exactly what you want from a godzilla movie giant lizard smashing things and a little human drama bullsht no one cares about
Jun 3 2019,positive,popcorn flick at its best
Jun 3 2019,negative,terrible you know the end after 13 of the show asian guy died just like any other western movies at least 3 last second saves its just so cliché 
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely awesome movie about the classic icon godzilla though some parts are left hanging the monster fight scene are mind blowing
Jun 3 2019,positive,really cool graphics mediocre dialogue destruction porn and monster fights typical godzilla basically wrestling with huge monsters what else could we expect   also we stan queen mothra
Jun 3 2019,positive,its the monster fight goodness that weve been waiting if youre a fan of godzilla and kaiju fights you wont be disappointed the music also scores the film excellently
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is everything i was wanting especially as a long time fan my grandma who got me into godzilla and passed before we were able to watch this together would have loved this movie as well 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it gets godzilla right and also adds to the mythoa in a welcome way  the scale is huge its beautiful and the soundtrack is epic
Jun 3 2019,neutral,predictable is the best way to describe this movie this is good for those of us who grew up with the 1970s version of the movies but for the newer generation i dont think theyll be able to grasp the slower action of this action scifi monster movie i did like that a lot of the old school sound effects where used with the monsters and the old movie scores what i didnt like was the adaptation or hint to mothra and godzilla having some type of love connection stop trying to make an action movie into a love story we payed to see action and monsters stay focused on that all in all as an older person i got the movie as for my kids teenagers it almost put them to sleep
Jun 3 2019,positive,great effects and good storylines
Jun 3 2019,positive,as a godzilla fan this movie was down right amazing if you arent a fan of him then dont watch it
Jun 3 2019,positive,a summer popcorn movie that does exactly what it sets out to do is the plot nonsense yeah but who cares thats not the point its the monsters that matter and thats where this movie gets it right the main question when rating a movie should be did i enjoy this movie an i certainly did i cant wait for more
Jun 3 2019,positive,too much action for me but loved millie bobby brown
Jun 3 2019,positive,great giant monster battle action
Jun 3 2019,positive,the plot was good imo monsters had a lot of time on the big screen i think next movie they should do less cutaways for the fight scenes just for the newcomers of monster flicks
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a fun and exciting movie that will keep your attention youll just need to ignore some nuances 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved the movie the ending was awesome i felt as if the story in the movie was a bit rushed and lacked a bit but lets be honest youre here to see monsters fight and theres plenty to go around 8510
Jun 3 2019,positive,the godzilla movie i have been waiting for
Jun 3 2019,positive,regardless of what the critics have said which incidentally is just the opposite of what they complained about when the first film released in 2014 this film is absolutely gorgeous the cinematography the cgi the music by bear mccreary the amazing respect to the franchise that fans will appreciate it is the ultimate love letter to godzilla fans and no matter your age it will make you feel like an excited 12 year old watching godzilla for the first time do yourself a favor ignore the critics and go see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,everything i hoped for in a godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,negative,terrible acting by the leading man poorly set up joke attempts writing was awful  at least the story progressed i fell asleep at one point and frequently thought about leaving
Jun 3 2019,positive,im not sure what movie the critics saw   were they expecting schindlers list meets godzilla   this movie was insane so much fun so good  if you are a fan of godzilla  hearing that original score will give you chills    just remember these same critics hailed black panther as a masterpiece    fool me once 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is awesome truly one of the greatest and epic kaju movies ever made   the battle scenes were beautifully shot and gave a large sense of scale a must see
Jun 3 2019,negative,absolute rubbish i love monster movies i enjoyed the first godzilla and skull island but this was dreadful from the acting to the imbecilic storyline to the lack of tension or excitement some of the monster fighting scenes were fine but give this a miss 
Jun 3 2019,negative,the story was slow not enough monster time i didnt care the the environmental aspect its supposed to be monsters fighting not about the ecosystem its a redbox rental at minimum
Jun 3 2019,positive,strictly as a godzilla movie as we are a odd bunch lol it was very good good story and godzilla was well done other than lack of his theme music 
Jun 3 2019,negative,terrible movie end of story 
Jun 3 2019,positive,despite below average storytelling and less than engaging characters godzilla king of the monsters manages to endure and entertain thanks to the aweinspiring action of its many larger than life beasts 
Jun 3 2019,positive,while the humans are incredibly cheesy and a bit annoying at times the kaiju are awesome enough that its tolerable if you like kaiju its worth seeing on as big a screen as you can find
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla movie done right its not about the humans and shouldnt be
Jun 3 2019,positive,wish they stopped cutting away from the kaiju battle every 2 seconds to show humans looking scared
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is amazing
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a spectacular movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,what do you mean no story no seriously a godzilla movie only needs minimal plot but i thought it was far beyond the standard what more could you want its a freaking glorious monster movie 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the visuals and cg were incredible
Jun 3 2019,positive,the kids loved the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie with good fighting scenes for the monsters the human story wasnt bad either it was an overall great movie and will buy it when it comes on dvd

Jun 3 2019,positive,its godzilla need i say more   i loved the movie but ive been watching godzilla for as long as i can remember hell i even watched the cartoo
Jun 3 2019,positive,this may be a fanservice movie but if you are a fan you will be serviced lots of great og 1954 callbacks as well as other references throughout the franchise
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla fighting giant monsters
Jun 3 2019,negative,it takes a very accomplished pen to walk this improbabilityact of rope balance this it aint 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the only thing that would have made the movie any better is if they took out all the human actors  for a long time godzilla fanthis film had me smiling ear to ear i cant stress enough how much i loved this movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,somewhere there exists a balance between the artistic vision and direction of gareth edwards 2014 godzilla and the entertaining but slapdash kaijufilled debauchery of 2019s king of monsters the plot is the weakest point of the film but its made up for by the 4way battle royal that the trailers have promised
Jun 3 2019,positive,best action movie i seen in a very long time
Jun 3 2019,positive,it has everything a godzilla fan could ask for the soundtrack was incredible the noises the kaiju made were very reminiscent of the originals and the monster brawls were breathtaking any godzilla fan will be giddy with excitement from start to finish
Jun 3 2019,positive,adding more fighting scenes has proved sincerity
Jun 3 2019,positive,its ok the battle was good but should have enjoyed more in 3d 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the monster scene were enjoyable i honestly did not notice the actors much none of them really stood out
Jun 3 2019,negative,wow real real bad just let the monsters fight and get rid of the humans the story was comically bad 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was entertaining but long kong was better my 11 year old son fell asleep during the final fight scene
Jun 3 2019,positive,about time they got it right
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is an absolute must see for any godzilla fan it will also satisfy any summer movie buff it offers the best kaiju fight scenes ever put to film there are also plenty of easter eggs for gfans everywhere 
Jun 3 2019,positive,big monster do the big tussle
Jun 3 2019,negative,worst movie in a theatre for me
Jun 3 2019,positive,its exactly what is wasa monster movie starring godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,boring near the end and too many explosions 
Jun 3 2019,positive,is it fair to judge kaiju films by different standards than other films maybe but goddammit that is what i am going to do the performances are solid allaround though not particularly noteworthy the visuals work pretty well here too providing some visual oomph for a number of enjoyable kaiju sized battles though the filmmakers clearly leverage the night scenes to ease the burden on the cgi department the script is fine i mean it clearly isnt a great movie but it is competently made and genuinely enjoyable if you are looking for an entry in this very specific genre if you are just looking to watch a great film and you dont really care about the kaiju genre then this score should probably be a two and a half out of five however if you want to see very large monsters punch each other godzilla king of the monsters is a good time and worth watching 
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved the original roars theme music and all the action 
Jun 3 2019,positive,some of the critics say it was an unnecessary remake  maybe but entertaining for what  it is nonetheless  godzilla was showing his age though
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie is a fantastic monster brawl they made sure the monsters were front and center fans of the godzilla franchise will love the care put in to the soundtrack and cinematography to make a faithful adaptation
Jun 3 2019,positive,the plot is paper thin but a fucking great time regardless 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was a disjointed mess that kept jumping back and forth between the monster battles people came to see and humans no one cared about  poor and lazy writing all around  the mother was unlikable and the daughter seemed okay with genocide as long as it was done slowly  hollywood should either stop making godzilla films or at least hire a director and writers who understand the genre
Jun 3 2019,positive,my eyes were glued to the screen
Jun 3 2019,positive,its not one of those films that you go to for the writing thats for sure but all in all the kaiju battles were glorious fun to watch and the performances were decent a good summer popcorn flick
Jun 3 2019,positive,i like that we saw a lot of the monsters  i loved the characters and the story line ive been a godzilla fan my whole life and this movie gave me all the emotions i wanted to feel
Jun 3 2019,positive,super fun and enjoyable movie all the critics bashing it were probably to busy smelling their own farts to enjoy it awesome monster movie with a coherent and well balanced story the battles were epic
Jun 3 2019,positive,full of monster fights just like i wanted
Jun 3 2019,negative,the monster fight scenes were cool but the rest of the movie was boring couldnt really make any connection to the human characters and was just waiting for more monsters to fight
Jun 3 2019,negative,the fights were okay but werent amazing the characters sucked and the writing was awful 
Jun 3 2019,positive,that was one great movie i really enjoy watching it
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely amazing great kaiju action way more than in the first film more screen time more fights more monsters king of the monsters is the perfect follow up to godzilla 2014 
Jun 3 2019,positive,likes  best kaiju battles  4dx is run ride  the alpha angle is an interesting subplot  godzilla at the end is beast    dislikes  human story lacks depth  need better characterizations  oneliners gotta go  kaiju battles cut to human too much  deus ex machina all over the place  i know theres a hollow earth but does the humans teleport too
Jun 3 2019,positive,entertaining and by far great special effects
Jun 3 2019,positive,very good movie lots of fighting which always is a good thing for a godzilla movie storyline worked 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic brought everything it promised and more you go see godzilla for the monster battles not for the human development that is exactly what this movie brought
Jun 3 2019,positive,the fights were amazing wouldve preferred less humans but the film was still good to watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a fun dumb summer monster movie blockbuster dont go into it expecting an avengers movie just go in have fun and watch giants beasts go at it 
Jun 3 2019,positive,thrilling and action packed highly enjoyed
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you love the classic godzilla films you will love this monster fest i loved hearing the themes for each character the interaction between godzilla and humans is represented better than any other past film the movie is called godzilla he is the main character  is the dialogue cheesy yeah so is every godzilla movie ever made and its fun and you can laugh at it best summer movie this year  chad t
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie isnt going to win an oscar for the script or for anyones performance maybe for specialist effects though but if youre going into it expecting a great monster movie you will not be let down if you want to see a movie for the pure enjoyment of the experience or always wanted to see a godzilla movie that respects and loves the men in rubber suits but shows you what your childhood imagination always pictured this is a movie for you i cant recommended it enough
Jun 3 2019,positive,epic monster fights great cast highly recommend seeing this movie in imax you will not be disappointed   ps  get ready for godzilla v kong
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movies godzilla is the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,we all just went for the monsters and we werent disappointed 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i would say best godzilla movie to date bringing the big g mothra rodan ghidorah on this awesome kaiju fight also a recognizable soundtrack that might bring nostalgia would recommend this if your a fan of past godzilla movies
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was a very fun movie i went in expecting to be disappointed but was pleasantly surprised godzilla wasnt a chump  he may be a bit thicc but it works for him there were some cgi and story issues i had  but those really didnt take enough away from the movie i have been watching godzilla since i was little and am pleased with this movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,there are some scenes in this film ive waited my entire life to see delivers tons of action with a story straight from the godzilla cannon
Jun 3 2019,positive,a movie with huge spectacle and action sequences it never ceases to entertain and delivers what godzilla fans are searching for in a movie probably some of the best kaiju fighting in film history that being said the critics are correct in their assessment of the writing and acting what prevents this movie from being great is the utter ridiculousness of the story and some cringe worthy acting moments that being said this is what you sign up for when you go to watch a movie about giant monsters battling each other it is good for what it is just dont expect a film that aims to be more than a straight monster fighting movie  
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was great from beginning to end it was even better for me because i had watched kong skull island  godzilla in that order prior to this movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,freaking phenomenal 1010 ign lol must see in imax will definitely give you a run for your money with how in depth the sound and vivid colors are no to mention thoe bomb behind fights yerrrrrrrr
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved this movie michael dougherty and team did a fantastic job ive been a fan of godzilla for over 40 years and will be till the day i die loved it from start to finish loved the cast and storyline but my absolute favorite was the monsters and the epic fight scenes go go godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you are looking for a masterfully crafted movie with flawless story dialogue and acting then you may want to look elsewhere on the other hand if you are looking to have a lot of fun and watch giant dinosauresque beasts beat the crap out of each other and stunning special effects then you came to the right place my only gripe is that the trailers were so well put together that i was convinced this installment would have the same level of complexity as the 2014 version but instead it was a lot more in your face action fun nonetheless
Jun 3 2019,negative,i wasnt expecting much but a mindless neat cgi to remind me of the old movies of my childhood the old movies were better  my girl friend fell asleep during this and i was envious of her
Jun 3 2019,positive,its good for a godzilla movie 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this was a beautiful movie every scene was epic and stunning the human story was a good vessel for the monster action and the monster action couldnt have been done better there were many nods to the og fans and plenty for the casual movie goer to enjoy 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the little kid in me was bouncing off the walls dare i say that i even got goosebumps loved that the script went unveiled a deeper look into godzillas origin story mothra would have been a great member of the original star trek away team  always dies the new titans were a nice touch and yay the mutos are back 
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome hah critics complain about the storyline sucking really who goes to watch godzilla for the storyline  its all about monster matchups
Jun 3 2019,positive,exactly what godzilla fans want some really cheesy dialogue aside couldnt ask for anything better critics are just flat out wrong about this movie go see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters pvc review 6319    pros  serving as a direct sequel to the 2014 godzilla film godzilla king of the monsters takes a leap of faith by honoring all the weirdness and mythos of the classic godzilla films but also working to expand the monsterverse in such radically different but extremely welcome direction than one might expect this movie feels like the classics except instead of rubber suits and miniature cities we have a hollywoodgrade budget which is properly used to provide a passionate loveletter to the toho films and fans who have supported this series throughout the many decades the franchise has existed as such choices that you thought they wouldnt make to keep it from being as ridiculous as the days of old they do make and it opens up the monsterverse to being so much more exciting as the possibility of things to come is limited only by the imagination of the director i have so much love and appreciation for this because the world they have now built expanding off the last two films is something so intriguing and begs to be explored even further thats my biggest praise i believe the wonderful tradition and lore honoring world but what i also just adore is the respect for the monsters unlike the first film in the monsterverse series the monsters have time to be developed and their personalities learned because just like the toho classics the monsters have genuine personalities the personalities are never fully outright expressed but if you pay attention to the actions of these creatures you can notice they have genuine emotions and are essentially characters all on their own they dont need a human to speak for them in this film they speak for themselves just by how they act and more likely than not you will be feeling a strong connection to one of them this fact alone is a huge stepup from the 2014 film but the pros are still not over the soundtrack is beautifully composed with respect of the original themes the human and monster elements are nicely balanced the monster action is aweinspiring and the story while overall overthetop and ridiculous feels like one of the showaheisei era classics before someone says that the human and monster elements dont feel necessarily balanced it should be said that every human scene is in direct relation to the monsters how to deal with them or what their story is if its not that it is further explaining the world or making indepth callbacks to the toho classics while the monster scenes always have humans in the midst of it all trying to survive and come up with a plan i could gush about each aspect of the film and explain further why i think certain elements are a lot better than what people are giving it but the review must go on and with that we must dive into the cons      honors the toho classics with love and respect   the monsters are welldeveloped and are given respect   intriguing world and lore that begs to be explored further   human elements always are in tangent with the monster elements and monster elements are always in tangent to the human    jawdropping shots that leave me in awe   an amazingly done soundtrack that completely respects the original themes of the monsters   overthetop story that keeps it feeling like a classic gflick   expands the monsterverse in bizarre new ways that makes me excited as a kaiju fan   incredit shots and after credit scenes build excitement for the next installments   monster designs are topnotch   countless easter eggs and references   the final kill tops all else   some great character moments    cons  while this movie still excites me even as im writing this it is far from perfect and its flaws should be noted my biggest complaint with this film is the disallowance of seeing a full fight without returning focus to the humans for periods that i deem too long and leaving me wanting to see even more fight however while this is my biggest complaint in the film it is leagues better to how 2014 approached the fights as the humans are always in the middle of the destruction or extremely close to the rampaging gods themselves but both movies have a problem just letting the viewer watch the fight without the brakes on it the second problem i have with the film is the writing itself typically with the dialogue while it is passable and never impacts the entertainment of the film i cant help but roll my eyes at some of the lines given which was heavily the same with the 2014 one but what makes it more entertaining is the subject matter itself the lore and again world building which seems to never quite slow down the movie too much where it exceeds in boredom its always interesting hearing what they are saying about the situation but the writing to deliver more interest in it is sadly lacking theres also other small things like the redemption of the villain not landing the cgi not always looking as good as the past monsterverse films simple jokes not landing or the tone being a bit too serious at points for the overthetop kaijuness these things dont always take away from the enjoyment of the film but they are noted to show that improvement could be done and its a shame for theres such a wonderful world and intriguing story that they are presenting but it is being overlooked due to issues stated above      fights are put on brakes too much   writing for dialogue is heavily lackluster   cgi can lack in certain shots   some jokes not landing   can be a bit too serious at times   the villain redemption doesnt land but it does provide one of the cooler lines of the film nor is there any emotional connection to her    overall  godzilla king of the monsters is hands down the best americanmade godzilla flick yet with a genuinely amazing world that i want to see more and more of it is handcrafted with so much love for the classics both in story and world with so many memorable moments that left me with a huge smile on my face it both feels and acts like one of the older era films that has a level of lovable charm to keep it in my memory forever and to feel like i am once again a child excitedly waiting to see where the biggest influence of my life is going next if the flaws of the film are accounted for in the future installments of the franchise then we genuinely have something amazingly special and perfect on our hands that i would gladly choose over all newer movies in other cinematic universes this is the biggest step for the franchise towards perfection and i genuinely love it to death for all that it is doing thank you to all who were involved in reimagining these classic characters for the modern day it makes me happy to see the big g so relevant again long live the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie acting was a little weak but still the bet godzilla movie ive seen  critics are way too harsh  definitely worth seeing in theaters 
Jun 3 2019,positive,excellent soundtrackscoresound amazing visuals in many parts the story was okay but had to really want to pay attention to follow the details not what you want from this type of film too many human characters and too many cut aways to human characters during the kaiju fights still loved the movie and recommend it but expect a action monster movie not high drama with lots character development and it is very enjoyable  saw it twice already 
Jun 3 2019,positive,my godzilla journey started way back in son of godzilla this movie is an instant classic i like so much im going to buy it when it comes out on disk i need more regards dpk
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie full of monster battles exactly why you go see this kind of movie for the action
Jun 3 2019,positive,monster stuff is exceptional  people stuff is meh  overall enjoyed the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i have seen every godzilla movie there is over and over and this is perhaps the best rendition of the classic battle of rodan mothra godzilla and the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was good lots of action cant wait to see the next film
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved this movie so called movie critics are clearly not in touch with what avid fans of this genre love about godzilla and kaiju in general
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was an awesome popcorn flic  we really enjoyed the movie  the action scenes with the monsters were incredible  i took the advice of other people and saw the film in imax which i usually do no spend extra for  the human characters were good not great but for a giant monster flic you should no that going in  i have been a godzilla fan since i was a little kid and saw godzilla vs king kong on tv in the 70s  since then i have seen almost every godzilla film even the bad ones  my only complaints were that there are very few scenes where the camera pans out and you get to see the full monsters doing battle and i will try not to spoil a early plot twist one of the characters wanting the monsters to destroy the earth was a bit mottled and unclear  the only agenda pushed by the movie was the environmental one and that has always been part of every godzilla movie  the cast is diverse like real live is but nothing is in your face to distract you from what is really going on giant monsters destroying everything  i you want a deep meaningful sjw movie go see that unicorn movie on netflix this movie is complete escapism and is what we need more of from hollywood  
Jun 3 2019,negative,even my twin 11 yr olds who are easily entertained were bored after an hour  save your money
Jun 3 2019,positive,they did some research into even the books written in the 90s that nobody really cares about they did fan service right with great action for the average movie goer youre seeing a monster movie expect action also godzilla started as a commentary against atomic usage and eventually environment but it wasnt downyourthroat like say the last jedi now its worth it
Jun 3 2019,positive,mothra gets blasted by a super energy ray and then godzilla abosrbs mothra but mothra isnt dead im confused  other than that this movie was fantastic
Jun 3 2019,positive,this was a cool movie but too many parts were slow and not a lot of action
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was good just very dark in color wouldve seen more details if brighter   millie bobby was great but she did give me lots of thought on stranger things because her acting was somewhat similar more in the face expressions
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved this movie  it played out like a love letter to both the godzilla franchise as a whole as well as its fans the kaiju were all treated with the love and respect they deserve although rodan couldve used a bit more screen time  it is bascially a big hollywood version of destroy all monsters with stuff from g v destroyah and other movies peppered in  it felt like a toho movie cant wait to see more from this universe
Jun 3 2019,positive,an awesome experience i loved the action the human element wasnt as bad as i expected i will watch it a few more times 
Jun 3 2019,positive,its an excellent movie of monsters go see it  
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla has come a long way since the 50s  this is by far the best version ever
Jun 3 2019,positive,great monster movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a monster movie its far fetched but a good watch lots of monster fighting which is what you came for lets be honest
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a godzilla movie monster action was great acting was good but there were litlte things in the script and dialog that bothered me hence the three and a half stars the first godzilla2014 was great always seems hard for a sequel to be as good unable to verify ticket because i bought mine through cinemark and that option isnt available yet
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is the first american made godzilla film that really felt like a real godzilla movie  it was fun exciting and kinda silly in all the right ways  but this is the kind of movie that is truly about the spectacle of it all  i saw it in imax and would recommend that for anyone who can see it that way  is it a great plot by no means but the actors knock it out of the park with their sincere portrayals and really sell it as they are truly apart of all this madness  kyle chandler is excellent in the lead milly bobby brown shines with sincerity and ken watanabe steals the show with a truly amazing scene that is touching tragic and a truly heartfelt homage to the original 1954 film that truly shows the creators love of these films  it is the kind of non stop spectacle of a film that will have you leaving the theater with huge smile and a genuine feeling that you have seen something truly special and that sense of fun and wonder truly overrides any other criticism because at the end of the day that is what a movie is supposed to do  if you are in any way a fan of the original films this is a must see  if you are just looking for a genuine great time at the movies then that is exactly what this movie is all about
Jun 3 2019,positive,excellent film the critics be tripping on this one 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was well put together  as a young teen i watched the originals and this was so much better  it was a delight to watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,excellent balance between human action and monster action the movies pacing was well timed the soundtrack was the absolute best part not only as a godzilla fan but as a movie goer     forget the negativity and negative reviews go watch the movie for yourself 
Jun 3 2019,positive,first all godzilla movies are bad but some are not fun to watch godzilla 1998 and shin godzilla where bad and they sucked godzilla king of  the monsters was bad but i had fun watching it the cg was hit or miss at times
Jun 3 2019,positive,i liked that they brought back so many old monsters they did a great job with effects and the monsters were similar to their original versions
Jun 3 2019,positive,great monster movie nobody cares about story and characters in a monster movie go see it if you like giant monster fights 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i thinks its ok to think that most people dont go to a godzilla movie expecting a deep intelligent plot or great character development from things that only roar and that the humans on screen are not what were here for     if you have this mindset when buying a ticket for a godzilla movie i think you will have a blast watching it the fights are amazing the monster are so cool and the movie itself is very entertaining i even think that the social commentary is well done here
Jun 3 2019,negative,hollywood whitewashed garbage they literally forgot why this movie series was made cool cg is he only redeeming quality i assume youre taking your kids to this they will probably be entertained far too stupid and brain dead for a grown person to appreciate
Jun 3 2019,positive,thought it was a great movie its a godzilla movie monsters fighting what more do we need 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it is a good sequel and meets all the tallies  expands the universe  has an impactfull sequence on the story  btw godzilla movies arent about the human drama its a bout two gigant monsters sometimes more ducking it out with their own powers not about the wolf lover drunkard and his broken marriage
Jun 3 2019,positive,dont listen to certain critics that absolutely do not understand the concept of kaiju movies since way back these movies were as simple as it can get awesome giant monsters fights and little to no real story this in japan but still pretty awesome and godzilla king of monsters tries to capture that essence awesome fights but they could have been longer and a little story because hey this is america the movie is a must see for tokusatsu and giant monsters fans the story itself is a little dull but nothing that gets in the way of what fans really want
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is the definitive godzilla film of this generation the monsters the acting the spectacle all of it was well thought of by michael dougherty he put the god back in godzilla its a must see film i dearly recommend seeing it on the biggest screen possible please please please watch it this will warner bros legendary and toho more reason to continue the monsterverse
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was freaking awesome it grabs you in the opening scenes and doesnt let go until the credits start rolling this is everything a monster movie should be
Jun 3 2019,positive,it had a good story line creations effects and sound effects
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was sick i wanted tons of monsters fighting and got it 
Jun 3 2019,negative,wasnt an interesting story at all avengers endgame cabin house visually awesome but in every other aspect boring i would rather have watched this at home
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie with excellent visuals and sound was fantastic too
Jun 3 2019,positive,same as most everyone  its a godzilla movie  and it has mothra rodan and ghidorah so as far as godzilla movies go its pretty top shelf  i only took one start off because its way too long for a godzilla movie and the plot holes really are very dumb  even for a godzilla movie  but still the monster battles are all that matter and they were great    basically high audience score and low critic  ie  its a fun movie that a lot of people will enjoy but its not fried green tomatoes so the critics hate it    if you want a movie that the critics rated high try high life 83 critic approval  you can impress your friend that you go to artistic movies  of course the first 30 minutes of that movie is a baby screaming as loud as she can into the microphone and the rest is just boring
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie gave more back story on godzilla and some of the other monsters much better plot and character development worth a watch good graphics
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a great  giant monster movie if youre expecting the kings speech youll be disappointed but if you are in the mood for 2 hours of awesome action youll be happy
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was amazing the cg was so good with the expressions from the titans and the story was decent enough worst part of this movie in my opinion was the mother daughter villain plot i mean what did you think was going to happen if you unleashed giant monsters everywhere do they let the animals run lose in zoos but over all i give it 495 
Jun 3 2019,positive,plot is a bit messy but way more monster action this time
Jun 3 2019,positive,exactly what i had hoped for out of a godzilla movie best movie ever nah but best godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved itthe fight scenes amazing
Jun 3 2019,positive,liked the movie having more mosters and grafics were great needed lot more 3d action to pop out of film needed king kong
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic movie  felt like a toho film  goofy humans and fantastic monster battles  only real complaint would be that we needed more monster battles and less cut away to puny humans  i hope the bluray has lots of additional content
Jun 3 2019,positive,rating is for the visual effects story could be better
Jun 3 2019,positive,bad acting but good action movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,did not warm up to the human roles in the movie   there was a big disconnect
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was awesome i love how they picked up where they left off at and how it started off already in beast mode
Jun 3 2019,positive,it is one of the best monster movies i have seen in a while
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was great and loved seeing the monsters fighting it out i still dont really like godzillas body design because his body is too big and his head is too small
Jun 3 2019,positive,no idea how the critics gave this such a bad score because this movie was phenomenal maybe not perfect but just about right to make it an enjoyable movie
Jun 3 2019,negative,sorry but this was a horrible movie i would have left in the middle if i wasnt with someone else dont waste your money
Jun 3 2019,positive,great monster fights
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie did a good job of its focus primarily on the monsters which should be the case it pays homage to many if not most of the more prominent kaiju surrounding godzilla thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if given the chance
Jun 3 2019,positive,good middle movie leading into the king kong vs godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,this exactly what you want when you buy a ticket for a godzilla movie pure popcorn and probably the best godzilla film in decades
Jun 3 2019,positive,after reading the reviews from the critics i was very happy i went to see the movie peoples complained about the first onenot seeing godzilla enough and now its too much lol people make up your mind as a godzilla fan this movie was awesome more than what i expected it just seems now a days critics just want to make a ruckus 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie lots of action
Jun 3 2019,positive,the visuals and sounds were absolutely amazing the theater was rumbling with some of the explosions and the monster scenes were incredible
Jun 3 2019,positive,i did enjoy it it is what a godzilla movie is supposed to be fun collateral damage big action and cheesy dialogues good movie 
Jun 3 2019,positive,we love godzilla as we grew up with these movies  really enjoyed the movie on imax  liked the storyline they came up with
Jun 3 2019,positive,we liked it very much  audience applauded at end screw the critics the audience score on rotten tomatoes was 86 last time i looked its a godzilla movie its a genre in itself critics who dont like dont understand or are unfamiliar with the genre shouldnt review it or should at least offer a disclaimer    they said the lighting made it difficult to see sometimes we had no problem seeing the effects were the best of any other godzilla movie    they complained that there was too much action and not enough plot but they complained that the previous one had too much plot and not enough action screw em if they wanna see the english patient they should go see the english patient this movie was very well researched in terms of godzilla lore spoiler ahead even to the point where mothra sacrificed herself to save godzilla and how she did it many many other elements indicated that theyd done their homework    its like critics who complain about rom coms girl meets boy they break up they get back together so unoriginal blah blah blah dude thats what a rom com is    if youre sick of the gdemc chord progression dont review rock music its the genre    as far as godzilla movies go this was stellar imho the visuals were amazing the plot was more than enough for a godzilla movie the production values were through the roof screw the critics
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it glad that we seen more of godzilla as opposed to 2014 hope there will even be more visuals in godzilla vs kong
Jun 3 2019,neutral,satisfactory movie wasnt what i expected
Jun 3 2019,positive,typical action movie for this genre
Jun 3 2019,positive,while the human story is so sothe monster battles are epic
Jun 3 2019,negative,i was excited to see the movie it was underwhelming
Jun 3 2019,positive,the godzilla movie started a little slow but the action picked up and was nonstop the storyline was good and moved along well with the action would recommend this film for families
Jun 3 2019,positive, in case you dont make it to the end of this post just know now that there is an after credit scene lol     wow what a ride if you thought godzilla 2014 was boring and didnt have enough monster action and then youre in luck this movie has memorable engaging characters and nonstop monster destruction and fighting this movie is a spectacle and a half with absolutely gorgeous monster fights     vera farmiga and kyle chandler bring some heart to the movie as they process a family tragedy in two very different ways with millie bobbie brown being the connective tissue between them ken wantanabe is much more efficiently used in this film then he was in godzilla 2014 he has important things to say and a genuine impact on the film he doesnt just stare the entire time again i promise lol bradley whitford and thomas middleditch provide a lot of the films comedic relief i disagree what are reviews ive seen calling the movies jokes more miss than hit i actually found myself laughing fairly often and really appreciating bradley whitfords wry comments i think the best thing i like about the human characters is the fact that the majority of them have something to do with monarch one of my frustrations with the first film was how little of this organization we saw well that isnt a problem this time and that was a great choice    monsters you can tell director michael dougherty loves him some godzilla the designs and sounds of the monsters are fantastic the updates to godzillas design make him all the more imposing rodan is elemental and primal mothra is beautiful graceful and is not in the movie anywhere near as much as i would like her to be she has some real spinoff potential and i was picking up on the ground work they were laying for that providing toho rehashes the rights after 2020 king ghidorah is fearsome not just because of his terrible visage but also because he seems to have genuinely dark intentions and a certain malevolent curiosity i really appreciated the character that they put in each of his three heads and the ways they interacted with one another and things around them ill also add that the animalistic behaviors they gave ghidorah are incredibly interesting as well and a welcome addition to the character    the score of the film is something else and bear mccreary of stargate and god of war 2018 fame does a fantastic job with it he paid excellent homage to original godzilla movie composer akira ifukube at least three of his iconic themes are sampled at various times throughout the film and they are used to excellent effect     also quick shoutout to the visual effects team this was some hard work especially ghidorah and mothra 
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of fun great to see the new godzilla reimagined and so many monsters
Jun 3 2019,negative,it could of been alot better 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie and have watched godzilla since i was a kid in the 70s   excited now for the final movie kong vs godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was exactly what every godzilla fan wanted less human interaction and more monster madness will be watching again
Jun 3 2019,positive,great monster movie  action throughout and the visuals are awesome  especially in the imax  nods to the old godzilla movies of the 80s that i remember watching on saturdays and sundays which was very cool to see  its going to be interesting to see where this series goes from here  cant wait
Jun 3 2019,positive,entertainingbetter than what i thought it would besound was alittle too loud  did not like the use of bad language god dn or the fk words  would be better if hollywood didnt have to resort to those words in every movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you are a die hard godzilla fan its was awsome
Jun 3 2019,positive,with exhilarating effects and visuals fun tangents to its monsterverse counterpart kong and an admittedly lessthangripping storyline godzilla 2 may not work as a thriller or human drama quite like its 2014 predecessor but its more than satisfying as the actionpacked monster battle everyone expected and hoped it would be
Jun 3 2019,positive,i have to admit  it didnt wow me in the theater  being a fan of the genre  i knew another go was inevitable im glad it occurred  i was reminded why i enjoy these movies  cheesy acting and a rapier thin script are a part of the package  were here to see monsters destroy and dominate the monsters were well thought out and updated beautifully  rodan mothra ghidora are now formidable adversaries for g the humans are the subplot and im not looking for the academy nod all in all a great ride
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie very entertaining epic fast paced tons of detail lots of homage to old godzilla series
Jun 3 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie good movie to watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,long fan of godzilla and its clear that this movie was made for og fans dont listen to the normie critics this movie is amazing this movie made me feel like a little kid again full of action great visual effects and left me wanting more 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was awesome one of the top three godzilla movies ever made period  not sure why the critics are so tough on this movie its a monster movie not a serious drama  if youre a godzilla fan youll absolutely love it including the music if youre a casual movie goer who likes action and destruction youll like it a lot if youre the type who critiques every little detail in a movie instead of just enjoying the ride then youll find enough issues not to like it this movie is a must see
Jun 3 2019,negative,this movie was a major disappointment  now only was the acting subpar but the special effects were not nearly as good as was the last film  i cannot recommend this film whatsoever
Jun 3 2019,positive,when hollywood stops making movies by focus groups and explores the darker themes of a potential like godzilla we might start having classics    here are the ways this movie failed  1 too many human characters frequently together in one room stereotypes etc none of them interesting none  2 plot point about controlling the monsters was a disappointing cop out  3 too many scenes of aforementioned human characters shown in pulsepounding action sequences trying to escape from monsters that suddenly have an interest in humans at the individual level    this movie shouldve been bleak and apocalyptic for humanity but hollywood doesnt know how to make a classic anymore so we get godzilla action suspense thrills emotional soft landing     i liked the monsters i hated every thing else
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a good movie for all those people who enjoy this genre have impresionant visual effects 
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely has a story but it puts the human in the backseat for the movie because thats almost how it should be it shows how nature truly takes over no matter what and how humans can live along side it just needing to see it nearly kill humanity to push it forward 
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it best nonjapanese film of its saga i wish it would have been more kaijus and fights but the sfx is awesome
Jun 3 2019,positive,keep the politics out of the movies i am sick of it
Jun 3 2019,positive,i love the older godzilla movies  the human story was always secondary to the monster action  this movie addresses that  was the human story silly  sure but no more silly than what i saw in the japanese godzilla movies from the 60s and onward  i much preferred this to the 2014 godzilla  if you like the older films with massive monsters fighting each other you cant do much better than godzilla king of the monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome brings out the trill of the titans battlefield onscreen worth to catch on big screen has watched 3 times in cinema
Jun 3 2019,positive,good movie a little tacky at the end 
Jun 3 2019,positive,while its not a bad movie it is not a great movie either average is the best word to describe godzilla king of the monsters the movie sort of bounces all over the place in terms of the plot becoming predictable towards the end while the movie does enough to keep your attention it never does anything to keep you on the edge of your seat some critics have said that the movie contains too little drama from the human side of the film i would have to disagree the film at times focuses too much on the humans something that 2014s godzilla also got wrong yes we do get to see godzilla and the other monsters a lot more than the 2014 film it still puts too much focus on the humans the movie is called godzilla for heavens sake not disgruntled husband and military featuring godzilla i will say the visuals are well done and at times jaw dropping the action is a mixed bag when we see the monsters fight up close and personal it is fantastic but unfortunately most of the fights are seen from the humans point of view at ground level with the monsters fighting in the background as i said the movie is not bad just not great either 
Jun 3 2019,positive,an action blockbuster like this may not be for everyone but in summer we all need big scale action in its two hours king of the monsters never loses momentum and keeps the action coming at every turn this latest epic stands out for tying all its action to the story of a torn family mourning the past the film always ensures it takes its time between action with fun and engaging dialogue that may not add jawdropping depth but thanks to strong performances and a wellplanned story godzilla ends on an emotional and satisfying high 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the critics are clueless  as always  it was a lot of fun to watch  plenty of kaiju action  worth the price of admission
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was full of action loved the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was excellent not a dull moment great special effects
Jun 3 2019,positive,monsters are great there are more monster battles here and they are epic when they show them unfortunately like the first they dont keep the camera on the monsters but a good portion of the fighting is in the background while the camera is focused on the humans on the ground doing stuff which was disappointing the mothers and human villains motivations and why they  release the monsters is so stupid and by far the worst part of the movie but they payoff at the end is huge and the final battle btw godzilla ghidorah rodan and mothra is absolutely amazing and worth the price of admission alone
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of fighting like old godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,this was the monster movie i always wanted as a kid it was just beautiful all these critics judging this with oh but the subplot was just so subpar the subplot doesnt matter this movie was about one thing and one thing only godzilla beating the everloving crap out of ghidora i couldnt care less about the humans in the movie they exist only to push the main plot forward i cant even tell you any of their names thats how little i cared about them i dont care why godzilla is fighting i just want to see him fight
Jun 3 2019,positive,while the film may be a little thin on plot it more than makes up for it in huge and gorgeous imagery the monsters are in their full glory with massive fight scenes ghidorah impresses and mothra does not disappoint and godzilla rules them all any fan of this monsterverse will love it ignore the critics and go have a great time at godzilla king of the monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,too much drama with the humans and tbh the mother deserved no redemption she should have had the most brutal death  it wasnt even shown 
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of great monster action fun nods to the franchise
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is a really fun monsterkaiju movie i tend to look at critic reviews before i watch a film concur with them for the most part but since the last jedi came out i would get hyped but just wait to see the actual film    this is another the last jedi situation when i just dont agree with most critics  yes the human development arc wasnt the best although i did like them more than the last film other than bryan cranston hes just flawless and the cgi and the kaijus in the film are just outstanding the score is incredible the kaiju on kaiju action is superb huge improvement from the last film  a lot of winks to og godzilla fans  if you really like monster destruction action movies in general i would really advice to give this movie a try    i did like this movie more than than the first more kaijus less humans  thats the only reason i want a godzilla movie for godzilla for our boi to be battling other giant sized kaijus not to watch humans and less if we want human development
Jun 3 2019,positive,huge godzilla fan so biased this could have hammered home so much more lore  kaiju but over all amazing the final battle could have been a tiny bit better but it was understandable how it went out they could have made godzilla feel more like the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,pure godzilla destructo porn watch this on imax it is an absolutely jaw droppingly amazing kaiju fight across the world
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was a perfect monster movie i went with my dad and we both loved it i will be seeing this again a few times 
Jun 3 2019,positive,seriously the tomatometer is garbage always has been always go by the audience score no shilling there    godzilla was amazing since 2014 wb has done amazing things with this ip
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome no gargantuan     while there are still some issues with the movie like heavy exposition and lackluster character archs it over all delivered exactly what i wanted in a godzilla film     godzilla himself has become larger than life with his lore and abilities expanded upon rodan morhra  ghidora all play an important part in the mythos of this new monsterverse or perhaps titanverse the human element added much needed explanation at moments but still couldve been worked on line wise     either way the film itself in an imax setting had beautiful painting like art as the highlight of the movie every shot while some still too dark for my liking had elements of a world so much larger than the story allows to be seen      i can not wait to see the next throw down between titans in godzilla v kong it should be a fantastic reimagining if the original king kong vs godzilla 1963 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie loved how they incorporated the old music but with a modern sound movie was put together very well
Jun 3 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it didnt have the annoying all action occurs in the background problems of the first movie this is godzilla not dawsons creek after all    i was disappointed they didnt show all the kaijutitans fighting and only mentioned kong but i suppose that is what sequels are for
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is exactly what a godzilla movie should be and was clearly made with real love and respect for the classic japanese films absolutely amazing with what they were able to do     original 1950s theme classic monster sounds and a legitimately great and diverse cast     please do not let this site dictate the movies we see and dont see it may not have fit within their view but this is a fun movie a scary movie and a breathtaking one   
Jun 3 2019,positive,outstanding kaiju action
Jun 3 2019,neutral,stupid  a waste of time
Jun 3 2019,positive,this was by better than the first by far the visuals were stunning the story well who really goes to godzilla to see the story its a giant lizard do yourself a favor see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you ever watched the old godzilla movies you will appreciate all the references to them the monsters were very well done and the battles were excellent actually could have used more of them ignore what the critics are saying because most of them dont understand godzilla movies if you are a fan its a must see
Jun 3 2019,negative,story line was terrible   effects were good   not worth the money   i would wait if you really wanna see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,really liked the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was great action packed never a dull moment my 5 yr old sat in awe
Jun 3 2019,negative,dont get me wrong  the monsters are absolutely the highlight of this film the cgi is well done and the fights are epic each monster is designed wonderfully and have a great opportunity to shine the music in the film is a wonderful love letter to the old toho films however the positives stop there the humans are one dimensional directionless random and incredibly cheesy the dialog is cringe worthy and barely attempts to be more than oneliners or exposition the main villain is a waste of charles dances talent as he has barely any screen time and incredibly vague motivations this movie is barely a step above a michael bay transformers film its astounding how much thought and care went into the monsters but little else i wouldnt recommend this movie and i cant see myself watching it again its not worth slogging through 1 hour and 45 minutes of horrible human mess to see 20 minutes of great monster action
Jun 3 2019,positive,cgi was great and the movie was enjoyable
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing job at capturing the toho style of a godzilla movie critics who hated it obviously havent seen previous godzilla movies and have no idea what theyre talking about 1010
Jun 3 2019,positive,its the story of a giant monster that destroys cities to all those cinema experts what do you expect from a movie with this history in cinema it delivers what i expect to receive when i payed my ticket
Jun 3 2019,positive,great special effects and monsters looks like there could be a sequel id probably see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,the visuals and sound
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a monster movie loved it  godzilla was great   
Jun 3 2019,positive,as a long time godzilla fan this is everything i wanted  the critics that are giving rotten scores have obviously never seen a godzilla movie  was the human plot fantastic no it was decent but not great  but thats not why i came to see the movie its not about the humans but the monsters  and the monsters delivered
Jun 3 2019,positive,dont listen to the haters the actors are much more memorablethan the 2014 version youve got insane giant monsters battles a fantastic score and callbacks to the original godzilla movies this is everything a godzilla film should be
Jun 3 2019,negative,per usual great fx but lackluster story and character development
Jun 3 2019,positive,good i liked seeing the other monsters we knew growing up other than godzilla  con they also put in more worthless monsters no one knew of like the 2004 movie    over all great to see how far the godzilla movies have come
Jun 3 2019,positive,as a godzilla fan it was so good i literally cried not from the drama or sad moments or anything but just because it was so damn good loved this movie so much
Jun 3 2019,positive,just a nice little reminder to all those pretentious self important down voting professional critics nobody watches a godzilla movie for the human drama all we godzilla fans ask for is city destruction and monster battles thats it and this movie provides plenty of that if youre looking for an art school thesis this is not the movie for you
Jun 3 2019,positive,brought me back to my younger years big godzilla fan
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you have seen old japanese ver godzilla or you like pacific rim 1 you will def love this one
Jun 3 2019,negative,miss the guy in a rubber suit destroying cities   miss the godzilla music   cgi godzillas dont make it
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of action maybe too much godzilla was great
Jun 3 2019,positive,bigger than life itself i love how the camera shoots him and emphasizes how imposing a figure he is hes my boy and he came through again you dont beat superman you dont beat king kong and you dont beat godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,that kotm rates 4 stars with a train wreck of a story is a testament to just how impressive the visuals the monsters the monster fights and the few bits of good characters and treasure trove of godzilla details and easter eggs are most frustratingly all the necessary bits of good story are present but are inundated with unnecessary characters and too many divergent story elements theres enough story for two movies here or more and it feels like it was all mashed up into one movie almost haphazardly
Jun 3 2019,positive,great for both old and new fans of monster movies it had the perfect blend of human element and monster throw downs the plot was different than any other godzilla movie but as an old school godzilla fan i truly enjoyed this take on the king of the monsters it definitely needs to be watched on the big screen but its a fun movie regardless of plot if you like big monsters duking it out youll like this
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie rocked the house 
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you want to see monsters punch things this is it the human drama isnt anything memorable but it also isnt obtuse 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was glad i gave it a chance even after local reviews were less than positive those who accompanied me also enjoyed the film even though they were not fans going in it had the feel of the original films because of the similar look of godzilla to the original even though its cgi as many contemporary films are pushing it tackled environmental issues in its own unique way
Jun 3 2019,positive,entertaining plenty of action and the new versions of the monsters hold true to their original likeness also lots of elements from godzillas history some more obvious than others
Jun 3 2019,positive,get your kaiju fight action here
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was just phenomenal
Jun 3 2019,positive,i didnt come here to see a story i came here to see big monsters fight and destroy buildings and thats what i got monsters were big and buildings sure did get destroyed good movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,ive seen it before and knew what was going to happen  i did like the effects
Jun 3 2019,positive,an awesome movie if you dont think about it too hard
Jun 3 2019,negative,poor writing average acting cliched characters terrible dialog  felt like it was four hours long
Jun 3 2019,positive,i went in expecting kaiju fights and i received exactly what i wanted this is a movie for the fans by a fan and i could not have been happier 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the monster fighting is amazing the visuals are fantastic the plot is so so but overall it is amazing movie i would recommend there is also several easter eggs in the movie for people who have seeing the original godzilla like the japanese ones
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved every second of it the cgi is really good gave me goosebumps loved the exmachina twist truly made me cry best part the screams of the monsters were so loud i couldnt even here the annoying brats behind me cry in fear 1010 would recommend
Jun 3 2019,positive,amaziiiiiing  godzilla 2014 was a better hollywood film but this was a better godzilla movie great job looking forward to king vs king
Jun 3 2019,positive,really fun but most important kept mom interested  so interesting my 11 year old kept asking what if and wouldnt it be cool and you should be a scientist mom  both boys really liked it and so did mom
Jun 3 2019,positive,great monster action and fun story
Jun 3 2019,negative,it was way too long for the story it provided which i thought there was very little of one even if the last fight scene was good it was not enough to sit through 2 hours
Jun 3 2019,negative,didnt really like it
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was awesome i was expecting it to be pretty bad but even my wife thought it was good we saw it late and she was on the edge of her seat and not asleep
Jun 3 2019,positive,the story was wonderful in the fights were epic
Jun 3 2019,positive,i liked this movie  thats all it was a nice movie visually but it did not have the thrill and suspense like 2014 godzilla had i would have loved to see aaron taylor johnson back in this film but when a film tries to continue a story without the original cast of a previous film the story feels like it is missing something but they were two returning actors so that wasnt the worst thing ever    this film had too much screen time with certain monsters  which was the opposite of what made me love 2014 version the titans were a special sight there this is a film for someone looking for a monster movie but doesnt focus on characters look to the original 2008 cloverfield my love directed by matt reeves for the best top of the line monster film with characters you genuinely care about
Jun 3 2019,positive,very good story line
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was a great time at the movies the special effects were fantastic and for once the human characters were interesting enough to justify their screen time i would certainly recommend this people especially those who are godzilla fans there are several nods to the original toho movie that are fun to see
Jun 3 2019,positive,gave me everything i wanted from my godzilla movie plus i love how they use the old music in the score during the major battle scenes i felt like a kid again
Jun 3 2019,positive,i have been watching godzilla movies just about all my life i so loved this movie the chaos that follows him her is outstanding depicting that nature can be very violent and turn out good in the end was a great story line cant wait for the next movie they referenced skull island enough to not need any introduction as to whats next popcorn and drink in hand already for that one
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you went into the theatres expecting shakespeare youre at the wrong movie godzilla was dope a sick gaiju battle the story i really dont care about the battles were really dope go to the movie and just enjoy the anarchy this movie was fun 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i enjoyed the film took me back to a time when i used to watch godzilla on tv as a kid maybe there could of been a bit more focus on the human characters but lets be honest i came for mayham lol
Jun 3 2019,positive,its really good story wise cinematography visuals and scoring 
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of action and a good movie worth seeing ending could have been better imo
Jun 3 2019,positive,maybe doesnt has they bestia humanos carácter but is a completely homenage to original godzilla franchise with amazing efects collosal battles and beautiful creatures bringed to big screen
Jun 3 2019,positive,i love the graphics and production of it storyline of  it all so much action and destruction love the creation of all the monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome from beginning to end
Jun 3 2019,positive,great action sequencing the plot was there which for a kaiju film is better than most lots of throwbacks for fans of godzilla overall a fun film and i highly recommend it
Jun 3 2019,negative,visuals and monster fights dont make up for the abysmal writing and randomness weve made a new weapon that destroys oxygen btw itll impact in 30 seconds 
Jun 3 2019,negative,desapointed nothing special lots of big loud noise
Jun 3 2019,positive,i thought it was one of the most exciting godzilla movies id ever seen  i plan to see it several times more
Jun 3 2019,positive,i am a huge godzilla fan so this is more a review of the cinematography than the movie itself   the cinematography was just soso some scenes were almost too dark and others were bouncing around too much for my taste   i liked the plot and thought the movie itself and acting were great   looking forward to the next one
Jun 3 2019,negative,no plot terrible writing i was looking forward to monsters fighting but there was very little of that save your money
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was a great movie would see it again
Jun 3 2019,positive,solid godzilla movie a good plot with a ton of excellently rendered cgi creatures a must see 
Jun 3 2019,positive,honestly this movie was almost exactly what it needed to be big monsters beating the hell out of one another one of the more well known complaints about the movie is that there isnt enough human drama what movie were these people watching there was plenty there was enough there might even be still too much if you went to see this movie expecting human drama then well whats wrong with you otherwise this movie was fantastic absolutely a must see for godzilla fans
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic monster movie with some unnecessary people drama godzilla was amazing and beautifully made monster and i would like to see more of these kind of movies that focus on monsters and not the humans 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is a godzilla movie and just like any of the other past godzilla movies it is about the monsters and getting them to fight  it is not a deep ground breaking movie but the special effects were great the monster design was awesome and it was a very enjoyable movie  if you are looking for a simple action movie to enjoy with giant monsters check it out
Jun 3 2019,positive,dark good acting bad dialog
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is a film by and for godzilla aficionados in the opinion of this lifelong fan of gojirasan this film was everything i had hoped it to be nonstop kaiju action epic battles punctuated by goofy humor firstrate actors not trying to steal the show from the monsters we came to see myriad references to classic godzilla lore ignore the critics  they do not get this genre see it on the big screen and enjoy the roller coaster ride
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie should definitely be seen if you wanna see a good movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,decent popcorn flick good cast great effects the big guy looks awesome wish they could have added some more familiar monsters from the toho days
Jun 3 2019,positive,all the action you can think of
Jun 3 2019,positive,action from beginning to end fenomenal
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of monsters and mothra was cool
Jun 3 2019,positive,before i begin this movie is about giant over the top monsters with that said if you enjoy have been a fan of or grew up watching godzilla movies this movie will satisfy your inner geek and kid    whats great about the movie  balanced story and monster interactionbattles  great monster designs  plenty of homage to the older godzilla movies  last but not least plenty of godzilla    what i didnt like  people are always doing dumb stuff  plenty of arrogance involved  did i mention that people do a lot of dumb stuff lol    despite everything good and bad it made for a very good interaction even if some things didnt make sense then again its a godzilla movie much better than the 2014 movie and certainly better than that microlizard zilla movie of the 90s    the story is interesting enough to keep it from being boring but its really all about the monster interactions and you get plenty of it
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely loved it the human parts of the movie were enough and not too much of a distraction from what i was really there for huge ass monsters fighting which it delivered on more than i could ever hope for cinematrogrophy was amazing so many beautiful shots and as with the previous godzilla 2014 the sound in itself is worth a visit to the cinema for this one
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was awesome critics tend to forget why we go to the movies to be entertained if you like monster movies you will love this tired of the 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was great fun  the effects were great and you got a great feel for all the monsters  acting was as expected for a monster movie but still had its good moments  definitely recommend
Jun 3 2019,positive,if your a godzilla fan your going to love this movie story has always been secondary in these movies besides the 2014 movie that had more story and less monsters this movie is the opposite a lot of battling they could have done a few things differently but overall good godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a monster movie nothing more and nothing less a nice follow up in the franchise that definitely left the door open for a follow up besides a shallow plot and lack of a lead this movie is a nice start to summer 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie if you like monster action
Jun 3 2019,positive,way too much talking and not enough action for an action movie it was way too much plot 
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved the movie  saw it on the big imax screen at bob bullock museum  the sound system and huge screen matched the incredible visuals
Jun 3 2019,positive,epic dont  listen to the critics godzilla king of the monsters was the best movie ive seen this year as an old school godzilla fan it brought me back to the late saturday night  creature features it was the perfect blend of the 2014 version and old school godzilla movies a must see for any fan of the creature features
Jun 3 2019,positive,epic movie great fight scenes great action some of the writing is rough at parts but overall a very enjoyable movie and my favorite of the year so far
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you love the technology side of movie creation then you will love it 
Jun 3 2019,negative,worst movie i have seen in 20 yearsterrible cgi horrible plot no interest in characters not even a good fight scene between godzilla and others worthless waste of time and money
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie neverending action many stars and villains throughout the movie hopefully we wont have to wait to long for the upcoming zillakong movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i really liked this movie  thought it was fun and the monsters were cool looking  reminded me of the old godzilla movies
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie had good intense action scenes and was fairly faithful to the overall lore of godzilla this movie also opened up the universe of godzilla that i hope to be explored more
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie knows what it is  with a straightforward plot this loud fun filled monster movie that requires you to watch it in the biggest screen possible to witness all the destructive and cgi goodness modern day entertainment at its best if you want a definition of a modern summer movie look know further than godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was exciting and exactly what any godzilla fan would want
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is an awesome action movie even if you arent a godzilla fan already out of the 33 movies that godzilla has been in so far this one beats them all
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it from beginning to end for being a reboot to the entire franchise it cant be exactly like the original it is its own story and does not disappoint
Jun 3 2019,positive,i grew up on godzilla and have watched every movie out there and this one did not disappoint it is what i hoped for in a godzilla movie epic fights gorgeous looking kaiju and a human plot that isnt overly campy is the movie perfect no it could have used a bit more kaiju smackdown but we will get that soon the movie has set that up the plot has some weak points but what action movie doesnt these days its still as strong a plot as any marvel movie and i enjoyed this movie far more than any of the latest marvel movies this is a must see for any true godzilla fan and an enjoyable ride for any new or casual fan
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,the action plot and pacing were all great a long with award winning special effects its what a summer movies meant to be

Jun 3 2019,positive,outstanding definitely worth the extra money to watch it in imax
Jun 3 2019,positive,the story line was ok but thats not what you go to see in a movie like this as far as awesome giant monster fighting it delivered with a bang cgi was improved from the last godzilla and the climax left nothing behind it was amazing
Jun 3 2019,positive,monster action scenes were great the plot and lack of character development on screen made you kinda want it to just be all about godzilla and the other mechas best godzilla movie so far though
Jun 3 2019,positive,too much side story not enough godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,so much action fr beginning till the end we want to watch it again in theater
Jun 3 2019,positive,exactly what you would expect from a godzilla movie great monster fights and a human story that explains things but doesnt bog down the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved it because i got what i perfectly expected  zero amount of typically hollywood cliches epic fights of the titans
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was a descent movie needed a lot more monster battles than human also mention of king kong was ok however shouldve been in the movie as well as other godzilla allies still a good movie to pass the time
Jun 3 2019,positive,totally enjoyed the whole movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,its was a fun time
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was amazing did godzilla justice and the legends monsters come to life was great visually mind blowing i do not have anything bad to say hats off and round of applause to the ppl involved in making this come to life thank you
Jun 3 2019,negative,200 million budget weak
Jun 3 2019,positive,an excellent kaiju movie made with obvious love and reverence for the genre you can feel the power scale and adoration for the original toho godzilla films in every scene if you want an epicscale spectacle with giant monsters fighting for supremacy watch this movie it looks gorgeous the score is fittingly groundshaking and it embraces the source material like no american adaption has before i cant believe they made me care about these giant monsters let alone gave them distinct personalities a triumph
Jun 3 2019,positive,it wont win a academy award but it was the movie that i had hoped to see its godzilla vs ghidorah to be the king of the monsters lots of action it was fun to see
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is an amazing movie and a strong addition to the franchise king of the monsters has everything that i could ask for from a godzilla movie the critics dont know what theyre talking about
Jun 3 2019,positive,i saw this movie opening weekend and again just over a week later i have to say that i enjoyed it much more the second time around i loved it the first time but  going in knowing what some of the issues are and knowing what to expect actually made it more enjoyable     i was able to catch more easter eggs and other nods that i had missed during my first viewing i said in my other review that there are obvious weaknesses to the film but as a lifelong godzilla fan this is an incredible gift to the fans and my favorite godzilla film of all time     if you didnt care for it the first time try watching it again for me i knew what to expect but was just hyped to see certain scenes again so i think that helped with my enjoyment levels the second time bring on kong
Jun 3 2019,positive,action was fantastic and especially satisfied someone who has seen every other godzilla movie the dialogue was cometely useless and actually took away from the emotion of the monsters 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great graphics and scenes acting was good storyline a bit like an older movie but good
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was epic  2 have it end up in boston  was awesome dopewars
Jun 3 2019,positive,yes the characters were a little bland but the fan service the respect to the lore while creating and expanding on a new cinematic universe and all the fights were perfect 
Jun 3 2019,positive,good monster action settingfilming was a little too dark and jittery too many plot lines clearly a set up for the sequel but not the best stand alone plot chandler and millie bobby brown were good others less so
Jun 3 2019,positive,best movie in the series only true godzilla fans will appreciate this movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i  wish that when we were just getting into the meat of the fight scenes that the director didnt cut back to the humans
Jun 3 2019,positive,a film made for godzillakaijū and monster fans  the film respects the origin of these monsters and pay homage to them but modernizes them  true spectacle and awe   
Jun 3 2019,positive,the monster fighting scenes were outstanding major improvement from the last godzilla movie however the dialogue and comic relief were cringe worthy at times it seems as though they left the script writing to a 10 year old 
Jun 3 2019,positive,totally epic movie such respect shown to the original movies
Jun 3 2019,positive,an excellently done piece detailing how humans effect the world they live in and how the solution to a problem doesnt need to be destroy this there was plenty of human screentime and plenty of story the movie hit all the points it could and did it well and the monster fights were good see this movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,overall it was okay      good action and somewhat entertaining for the kids however i strongly do not recommend bringing any younger kids even with my 13 year old watching i felt the pg13 rating should have been r  there was a lot of senseless killings in the movie ie shooting people in cold blood for no reason right in front of the camera  and we wonder why we have so many mass shootings in this country       and a lot of curse words in movie being used for no reason    but this just my view as a parent of 2 teenagers     enjoy
Jun 3 2019,positive,better than i expected

Jun 3 2019,positive,not a deep thinker but a whole lot of fun  it was a great ride
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a fantastic film with excellent cinemataography and visuals a stellar soundtrack and most importantly incredible monster fights the plot and writing is lacking and makes no sense at times but can be easily overlooked as an enabler for the fights which are beautifully shot and framed

Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was great for me i am fan since i was a child 
Jun 3 2019,neutral,jokes werent funny and there was too little screen time of the monsters also there should have been a longer intro of just how aaron was so significant to the movie the last godzilla was out awhile ago
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie lots of action and the monster battles were amazing tries to pay way too much into the movie and feels a bit chaotic but that is the movoe as a whole

Jun 3 2019,positive,the fights between godzilla and the other monsters was amazing  plot could of been better
Jun 3 2019,positive,the effects were awesome this needs to be seen on the big screen the only downside it was a bit stretched out still recommend it
Jun 3 2019,positive,𝘭𝘦𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮 𝘧𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵    godzilla king of the monsters is nothing like the critics say it is not perfect but is any film perfect kotm does exactly what it needs to do deliver amazing visuals of giant monsters pummelling each other it pays homage to the godzilla that came before and most importantly you can tell it was made by a fan for the fans that is what this movie needed to do and it done that and more the human storyline might be distracting and annoying at some points but it is all worth it to experience such an amazing piece of pop culture that makes me even more excited for legendarys monsterverse

Jun 3 2019,positive,good plot and non stop action from beginning to the end
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was fine the storyline was okay the action was alright the special effects were good the movie felt like it was all over the place and trying to fit too much into the movie you felt no connection to the characters which is what makes you feel more invested in the story it was just okay i didnt hate it but i didnt love it
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie my daughter and i loved it she couldnt stop talking about the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,55 for long time godzilla fans still bitter from the 1998 disaster    as a pretty much lifelong godzilla fan starting back in my childhood when that foot tall action figure just was the coolest thing ever the release of the 1998 version i personally have been begging for a kaiju movie that was pretty much like this  throw away human characters hell yes its got it  multiple kaiju duking it out hell yes its got it  loads of classic references to the older franchise hell yes its got it  going full on these crazy theories that are impossible fuck it they are real here moments hell yes they got it    this movie was clearly made for fans of the godzilla franchise the 2014 version deffo fell short on what the fans wanted and this one pulls it almost straight clear enough that the next installment in the monsterverse should not be overlooked    from the start even with the human plots thatwelllets be honest you really are not here for they do make a fine balance of showing enough of the kaiju in between the human drama    and everyone that has seen it and liked it the scene they end the movie on proves once and for all  there is only one king of the monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,great fun movie with awesome visual effects

Jun 3 2019,negative,it seemed long and drawn out  it seemed so fake the movie never drew me into it i found myself anticipating the end

Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie godzilla fans wanted
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie is great no its not an oscar winner but its the best of what you expect a godzilla movie to be epic monster fights great special effects an amazing musical score that does the great music of past godzilla movies justice and then some ignore the critics they dont know what they are talking about

Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla was amazing i got the chills every time godzilla and mothra showed up the fights were truly epic and i could not have asked for more though the plot between the people did need some work
Jun 3 2019,positive,the story is an interesting look at why the giant titans are here on earth with us while there are some slower times its necessary to build up the story when the action does come it really brings it its not the best movie but is certainly worth a watch 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was great except necessary deaths
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was so awe inspiring i watched it in imax and i loved it so much yeah the writing wasnt the best but hey big monster fights and some of the scenes with characters werent so bad and i liked some of the characters regardless of how boring they were but hey watch this movie if you want big monsters fights

Jun 3 2019,positive,dont listen to these critics they are the same sjws who gave the last jedi 93 obviously its a plot against legendary pictures since its owned by chinese people and with all this trade war of course trumps governmet will do anything to make chinese movies flop this is why americans are so blind and stupid    the movie is amazing the story is great i dont know why critics say its silly because honestly i think they saw another movie the story is easy to follow and the characters motivations are completely legit the music is amazing the sound effects are amazing the cgi is amazing and the acting is great really im surprised this movie got 39 of score they make this movie look like if its a shitty transformers or adam sandlers movie when clearly it isnt    lesson learned never trust critics anymore most of them are paid by companies
Jun 3 2019,positive,whats there not to like godzilla kicking ass i didnt go for an in depth storyline or to have an epiphany i loved the action and history or origin of godzilla it was great my kids and i loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome just awesome all these other bad reviews missed the point of king of the monters
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing and exciting experience each kaiju has so much detail and expression to them human story is great as well but godzilla and ghidorah steal the show
Jun 3 2019,positive,based and redsoxpilled
Jun 3 2019,positive,almost half of the critics need to get a life look how different they rate movies compared to the public amazing movie a must see 
Jun 3 2019,positive,so much better than the last two or three or four attempts at the franchise  fun with great visuals uncomplicated yet serviceable plot twists and  all the right archetype supporting characters and villains  the professional reviewers seem completely clueless on this one  i dont think they get the genre
Jun 3 2019,negative,how can people accept this but they complained about the destruction in man of steel giant monsters kaiju superpowered aliens all the same fictional crap its a movie nobody was hurt in real life people are sabotaging zach snyder
Jun 3 2019,positive,what a godzilla movie should be
Jun 3 2019,positive,so much fun a worthy update drawing heavily from the showaera godzilla movies the visuals are excellent and the sound design was amazing that they used  parts of the original toho score was very satisfying a proper kaiju movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,a phenomenal film the characters despite what critics claim are actually ok but the real stars are the titans themselves every scene involving them is fantastic it has to be seen on the big screen to be truly experienced
Jun 3 2019,positive,excellent graphics and just enough excitement
Jun 3 2019,positive,a movie where you should just sit down relax and enjoy giant monsters beating each other up the plot is just meant to facilitate more monster fighting  although there is a good amount of human centric plot developments
Jun 3 2019,positive,the critics dont know what they are talking about the graphics were amazing the battles were amazing mothra was just as beautiful as the first trailer this movie seriously blew my mind i almost wanted to scream and cry tears of joy on how happy i was with this movie i cant wait for what comes next

Jun 3 2019,positive,everything about the movie was perfect loved the action and the emotional connection you felt with the humans
Jun 3 2019,positive,i dont know why it didnt do well with the critics or at the box office its amazing bang for you buck and the best kaiju beatdown since the first pacific rim the 2014 godzilla was glorious in bits but had just too damn little of the big guy oh well i just hope we still get to see godzilla vs kong next summer 
Jun 3 2019,positive,okay so first of all the monster battles were magnificent the special fx the michael bay like explosions and overall the entire godzilla experience was amazing the plot however was a bit iffy to me but i will certainly recommend this movie to you if u love special fx godzilla battles and explosions
Jun 3 2019,positive,definitely a pop corn film if youre looking for backstory and set up its kind of short before we get to the monster battles helps if you saw the 2014 film first
Jun 3 2019,positive,all of the monsters scenes are great  theres emphasis on the power and strength of the monster  music rework is awesome human plots are dumb and weak  but hell thats not what most of the audience are going for anyway  this film recreated what a monster film fan is looking for and is a must watch 45
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing movie try to watch it in 4dx if possible the experience is epic

Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it brought back memories from watching the original movies growing up
Jun 3 2019,positive,a true godzilla movie made for the fans by a fan epic in all proportions dont consider the human side roles they are irrelevant in this movie its a monster flick watch the monsters battle to death enjoy the movie for the monster thats all this movie is about dont you dare compare this movie with movies like la la land this is a different movie with its own specific fan base and i am sure the fans will not be disappointed
Jun 3 2019,positive,the human storyline has way too many countdowns but once godzilla king of the monsters allows the titans to roam free it becomes a feast for the eyes of kaiju fans i got the feels when the godzilla theme started up
Jun 3 2019,positive,that shit was tight watch in 3d 
Jun 3 2019,negative,very slow beginning difficult to follow at times

Jun 3 2019,positive,let me start with i thought this movie was great    a improvement over the 1st one 2014 i see that some are having a hard time with the monster being the star and not the people in it  i understand but this is a godzilla movie  i felt the ration of monster to people time was more than adequate i felt i already had an emotional connection to some of the characters from the previous films  godzilla 2014 and kong  i did enjoy the 1st one just a little slow i still own it and kong and i will see the next one
Jun 3 2019,negative,poor story line but the visuals were pretty amazing i was completely lost and was not emotionally invested with any of the characters the cast was amazing but felt like their talents were wasted

Jun 3 2019,positive,just my kind of moviemonsters fighting
Jun 3 2019,positive,there have been over 30 godzilla movies before this one things technically have really advanced since the original movie with raymond burr its the storyline that drives the movie this one has nice graphics and while being ok seems a bit dark as in not welly lit still this one was on the par with the last godzilla movie and leaves the door open for another in a few years i did enjoy watching it but will not be adding it to my movie collection
Jun 3 2019,positive,both the story and the fight scenes i loved it

Jun 3 2019,positive,a lot of fun human plot corny and sometimes annoying but non the less exciting
Jun 3 2019,positive,the humans are purely the supporting cast they served their purpose the monsters are enchanting especially mothra this was a fun popcorn film that delivered the filmmakers listened to fans complaints from the first film they couldnt possibly please fans and critics without a 4 hour movie as a fan who loved the first film i am pleased and look forward to kong vs godzilla 
Jun 3 2019,positive,didnt care for the human crap that went on in it but man were those fight scene insane 5 stars
Jun 3 2019,negative,boring all humans talking and very little monster fighting
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it great with the animals a little less interesting about the people due to a lack of good character writing but the effects of the titans were fantastic
Jun 3 2019,positive,i really dont understand the criticism of this film the characters were fleshed out to the extent they needed to be the action scenes were awesome and the monster fights were woven within the plot pushing the story forward 
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely phenomenal breathtaking visuals simple yet engaging and enjoyable plot and action packed best summer movie for myself so far felt like a little kid watching my first godzilla movie all over again

Jun 3 2019,positive,really good movie about kaijus
Jun 3 2019,positive,my son is 11 he like bb it very much
Jun 3 2019,positive,probably the best special effects there is the plot twist makes you rage which makes it a great one  seriously it makes my jaw touch the floor when u see the cgi its so good honestly when i watch it i was too excited about the final battle till i forget the whole storyline not only the final battle is perfect but the moments that lead to it was also incredible its an amazing movie go watch it u will not moan in the cinema a single time
Jun 3 2019,positive,i like everything bout the movie and he is really the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,a true a great homage to the original
Jun 3 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie best godzilla to date  great actors dialoge was not always audible cgi not the best
Jun 3 2019,positive,i really dont understand the low scores and the low attendance on this movie its very true to the franchise well made and awesome effects the story line is great never had a dull moment and kept me on the edge of my seat great movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie for fans of godzilla and his lore for those who havent followed him its still a good movie full of action
Jun 3 2019,positive,i think this movie did a great job conveying the majesty and the raw powers of the four main kaiju many of the imagery within the fight scenes are breathtakingly beautiful and i got chills seeing them on the big screen i agree that the script could have been better but im not too bothered by it and i thought the actors did a good job committed to the characters and lines given to them overall i had a great time with this movie and i recommend watching it on the biggest screen possible 
Jun 3 2019,positive,some very good graphics
Jun 3 2019,positive,probably the best godzilla movie in recent years a lot of action and a pretty good storyline sometimes it was a little hard to keep up well worthwhile to going see
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of action good storyline
Jun 3 2019,positive,good action it kelp our attention  i didnt like that godzilla head was kind of small
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of cgi the monsters are awesome especially hydra and its power at the beginning very sleepy my neighbour in the cinema was snoring towards the end it picks up 
Jun 3 2019,positive,happy to see some childhood monster movie this movie esp the cgi is superb king ghidorah still makes me cower if ever this creature exist hahaha excited to see more kong vs godzilla and also a showdown between mechagodzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,the critics are just that over critical of a science fiction monster vs monster battle movie that surely would make toho proud not only were the monsters depicted correctly as titans but their updates in design movement and effects are spot on and beautifully executed sure there is always some sort of human story to play in all this you need to get all the monsters together right i think they did well bringing everything together from 2014s godzilla and wrapping that story up in this 2019s godzilla the story proves how harmful we are as a species and how the titans were waking to bring balance again the only problem is the titanalien that isnt apart of that balance ghidorah tying in the reference of ghidorah and godzillas epic battles of the past i am very satisfied with what we were given    shame on the critics for not only being over critical but pretty much wasting peoples time trying to read what you professionals think viewers know what they want and like might want to listen to the audience for a change and stop ruining the entertainment industry    thank you max michael and legendary pictures for staying true to the epicness that is titans and godzilla  and a heartfelt thank you to mister bear for bringing it all together with a masterful soundtrack 
Jun 3 2019,positive,wellif ya like zilla flicksyou will like this more closer to a japanese zilla flick  waaaaay more over the top and just looks awesome id say the rt score does not reflect this movie and how fun it is
Jun 3 2019,positive,ive always been a big fan of movies that have special effects especially when its a lot of cgi because in order to do such a movie like godzilla or star wars or any type of movie that requires realisticness it has to be spot on
Jun 3 2019,positive,for the true godzilla fan
Jun 3 2019,positive,a wonderful love letter to the toho classics incredible kaiju action and special effects interesting worldbuilding and just an allaround good time i loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,a ton of action right from the get go loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,a must see if you are a godzilla fan great visuals and actions scenes are fantastic epic movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,there are some slow parts in the movie at least godzilla gets more screen time and i like a good team up
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved it so much of my childhood was brought back to life they even had good easter eggs so no spoilers
Jun 3 2019,positive,okay so after watching it three times two with other people and one by myself i gotta say godzilla king of the monsters is easily one of my favorite godzilla movies the human story is passable at the start but as the movie goes on i felt very tense for the humans monsters where on point each monster has a distinct personality to let them stand out from each other all in all this is a great action movie with a great soundtrack fantastic visuals awesome fight scenes and a story thats is very interesting in my mind though i can not put this pass godzilla 2014 for me this movie is on par in my mind with 2014
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie myst watched
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely fantastic terrific lot of action fighting good history absolutely best godzilla movie ever
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla was a pretty good movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,an epic film about kaijus fighting for supremacy without a needless uninteresting human subplot taking up screen time a love letter from a godzilla fan which clearly pays homage to some of the best from the oldschool films as usual the critics missed the point 
Jun 3 2019,negative,although the cgi is great the human actor parts are tediously boring it comes down to characters pulling out powerpoint slides from nowhere and start lecturing the cg is epic there are a couple of scences well composed and colored overall i would rewatch this movie on a computer with the ability to fast forward 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this was the movie that i had been waiting for to be released lots of monsters lots of powerful monster moments and with some human stuff that played along with the movie instead of trying to be the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i enjoyed it the whole way through great fight scenes and good story too watch the movie for yourself and dont trust the critics
Jun 3 2019,positive,nice story not that believable graphics were good not great all in all not bad
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was a great movie go watch it
Jun 3 2019,positive,i chalked this movie up with most of the godzilla series corny yet entertaining
Jun 3 2019,positive,they say third times a charm holy shit is it the charm they finally got it right the first spectacular amazing american godzilla film props to michael doughtery this was so exhilarating and action packed a momentous sequel of epic proportions the humans are likable and the story is gripping and emotional ken watanbe was the best and of course godzilla 
Jun 3 2019,positive,less humans check  more monsters check  more action check  interesting lore check  crazy visuals check  serviceable story check  amazing soundtrack check    not sure what all the negativity is about i thought this was a blast
Jun 3 2019,positive,good movie love it but the girl who played 11 in stranger things shes annoying af and her mom like please btch shut up
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was everything i couldve hoped for it showed an amazing rendition of our favorite kaiju had an amazing soundtrack and the kaiju fights were epic it also clearly showed the movie was directed by an amazing godzilla fan as it had many easter eggs to previous movies i loved it and highly look forward to many more monsterverse movies long live the king rip haruo nakajima 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i went in with doubts and left so happy this movie was a spectacle i had so much fun
Jun 3 2019,positive,fun and entertaining summer blockbuster  the critics bashing this one is puzzling  giant monster movies arent for everyone but it seems some are just way too serious or never really watched godzilla movies   i was prepared for a horrid plot but thought it worked for a godzilla film and as good if not better than many of the other older movies  had all the feels necessary for this godzilla fan  musical score amazing and respected the original movies  i was in awe a few times mothra was particularly endearing and heartbreakingsurprised by the eerie beauty of ghidorah  backstory on godzilla was actually interesting and was not expected  godzilla was also mightier engaging and moved with more purpose compared to the 2014 film  quite the artistic spectacle overall and looking forward to godzilla vs kong  
Jun 3 2019,positive,i already made another review but in this one im going to say the movie mentions a whole lot of titans were waking up and causing destruction at the end all there was was a measly five again the fighting scenes amongst godzilla and the other guy were always freaking interrupted
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie overall was very nice so nice i had to see it twice   the critics absolutely do not know what they are talking about they are either not familiar with the franchise at all or just did not watch the same movie   highly recommended to watch this movie if they love action   the acting was decent not great but not bad either   best female actor of the year should be mothra  best villain of the year ghidorah  best actor of the year godzilla  cant wait for gvk 2020  its gonna be beyond epic  saw it at united cinemas in canal city fukuoka japan
Jun 3 2019,positive,we loved it lots of noise fireworks and just really loved it loved  the actors but mostly millie bobby brown one thing i didnt think was necessary was having her character say the f word just my opinion
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of monsters was simply awesome it was a throwback to my creature double feature days  most important aspects to me the makers of this film were fans you could see it and you could hear it in the score we see again the disconnect between real fans and the critics its the same old fight going on for star trek discovery star wars game of thronescannon and source material matter to real fans you cant just ignore it we the fans want to go to this world ive grown up with godzilla the theater was packed and from the 1st moment to the last we were in that worldlong live the king it was epic 
Jun 3 2019,positive,good if you are a fan of the series confusing for those who arent
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzillakotm is a true godzilla movie made by fans for the fans expect fun references and nods to the fans and older movies throughout the film this movie was truly made with love and the fans in mind
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was like watching old school godzilla as a kid awesome
Jun 3 2019,positive,if your a fan of godzilla youre gonna love this movie its huge monster fights with some many favorite kaiju what more do you want ps watching in 4d was a lot of fun
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzillia i liked on screen at amc 25 th street prime 3d glasses 
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you like the toho godzillas then you might enjoy this one but it does have really bad writing but it doesnt feel out of place compared to other godzilla movies if you are just looking for a modern block buster this might be 2 cheesy for you
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was great i will never be as emotional over monsters for a very long time
Jun 3 2019,positive,the best make me cry 
Jun 3 2019,positive,better than the 2014 sequel
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a complete love letter to the original films from the massive amounts of easter eggs like the original score re done to the names of some of the titans in this film unlike the 2014 film godzilla along with other titans are constantly on screen great summer flick
Jun 3 2019,positive,best movie so fari highly recommend ppl to watch this asap
Jun 3 2019,positive,i love it  epic ost  mothra is a dream  the battel made me crazyyyyyy
Jun 3 2019,positive,if youre worried about it being like the 2014 film not to worry this movie definitely out did itself with the monsters and i loved the fights worth the watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,action packed just like i expected 1010 would definitely see it again
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was made for fans the music and atmosphere are great and the monster battles  cgi are done wonderfully 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is absolutely everything you could want in a monster movie it is great i encourage all of you not to listen to the critics and to make this movie some money i promise youll enjoy it the world deserves this movie and its sequels to exist
Jun 3 2019,positive,im really shocked at the review that rt has given this movie i dont understand what they missed with the story it basically boils down to a family losing a child during the first monster attack and the mother making a bad choice thinking it was for the good of the world its easily understandable this movie is a great summer action movie while also giving extraordinarily homage to the fans and to the history of godzilla the human characters were so much more likable and you could relate to them better being a godzilla fan and having seen all of the toho movies this movie was a fantastic homage to what came before the effects were great and the story was great rt and other critics who have savaged this movie have it totally wrong this is a great summer movie go see it 
Jun 3 2019,positive,was a great monster movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,what movie were these critics watching  this is the godzilla movie that toho would have made if they had a budget  they captured the essence of godzilla and the rest of the monsters and rendered it in full living color on screen  it was magnificent  yes some of the human interactions were contrived  yes there were plot holes that you could drive a truck through  however i went to see godzilla kick butt and that is exactly what i got  
Jun 3 2019,positive,so everything the critics are saying is absolute garbage this film was an exceptional piece absolutely tromping the other two american godzilla films the monster to human screen time is split almost evenly and has plenty of story there just for the humans but the monsters just kill it the story is good too where most monster films have a quite laughable story this one was really good and absolute mist see film
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie for all godzilla fans enjoyed watching it with my kids
Jun 3 2019,positive,once again the critics got it wrong this movie mirrors and pays tribute to all the old godzilla movies the humans in those movies were the supporting cast to godzilla and the monsters this movie corrects what the previous movie got wrong you go to a godzilla movie to see godzilla fight other monsters as an adult that grew up watching the original moviesi loved this movie hail to the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was everything you could hope for in an old school kaiju movie i absolutely loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,definitely worth watching dont pay attention to those nasty critics
Jun 3 2019,positive,big dumb fun  exactly what i hoped for  we really enjoyed this movie  some of the criticisms are fair but its almost like they were expecting a genrebreaking deep movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,liked the development of godzillas character including where he went to recover disliked the distraction of the interactions with the humans and their soap opera problems
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved it i felt like i was 10 again watching monster vision on tnt bring on godzilla vs kong 
Jun 3 2019,positive,highly entertaining if you lack imagination stay home godzilla portrayal is perfect
Jun 3 2019,positive,if youre looking for a shakespearean toure de force go watch another movie if you wanna watch a kaiju fight night get comfortable
Jun 3 2019,positive,all bow before the king of monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,great action from the beginning
Jun 3 2019,positive,breathtaking the new favorite godzilla movie on the block the build up and scale of the monsters is a wonder to behold mothra rodan and the mighty ghidorah really take on a new persona that makes you fall in love with them all over again the humans interaction is based and designed to match the giant kaiju film genre nothing gets in the way of enjoying gkotm i loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was amazing they really gave all the monsters justice in this action packed godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,negative,was really excited about this movie especially with the titans however the human interaction and story was weak poorly written and uninteresting i wish there was more titan fights and less unnecessary dialogue
Jun 3 2019,negative,the dialogue and plot are mind numbing the characters are unlikable except for dr serizawa played by ken watanabe the monsters are obscured by either snow rain smoke fog or darkness you can wait for the home release 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is amazing although im not a fan of the godzilla but as a first time viewing this movie i immediately loved this movie as it filled with lots of kaiju action and drama and it was a huge improvement over the 2014 godzilla movie outstanding job legendary
Jun 3 2019,positive,finally the monster action weve been waiting for also like that its less of a drama movie like the first one 
Jun 3 2019,positive,watch it any fan of the toho classics is going to love this movie lots of easter eggs for yall as well if you want a modern take on 1954 godzilla this isnt for you if you want that watch shin godzilla awesome as well
Jun 3 2019,positive,the perfect giant monster movie tons of city destroying action the various titans are massive and beautifully crafted with subtle facial details that give you a good idea of what theyre thinking ghidorahs left head is particularly amusing the human characters are also surprisingly compelling there are plenty of easter eggs for old school fans and some great music call backs
Jun 3 2019,neutral,although it has amazing visuals and great action scenes it chooses to spend a lot of time with the human characters this would be fine if the main story was interesting its not the worst but it struggles to have investing human characters and a strong story since this was trying to apply its self to the western audience instead of the asian audience it should have focused its self more to the big monster fights and battles the great visuals do make it extremely fun to seefor the short time that their there
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was fun not too violent for a 10 year old boy he called it epic
Jun 3 2019,neutral,the only thing i disliked were unnecessary human drama when the mom selfishly tried to recreate peace by releasing the titans could have been better if there were more scenes of godzilla there were moments that looked touching with honorable moments when characters did the right thing for the humanity still engaging movie though
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is now my favorite movie of all time  its got fantastic monster designs actions scenes music and some genuinely touching character moments  its epic in every possible way  there are also some great message about finding balance with nature and making peace with our own demons  this is a movie ill watch over and over again      
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla had more depth than i expected and it had a real story line
Jun 3 2019,positive,all of the critics that hate this never was a fan of godzilla before  as a fan of original toho this is definitely a movie made the fans
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved the movie thought the story was amazing  the characters fantastic
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie and action only wish king kong wouldve made some appearance
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was some horrible dialog but the kaiju more than make up for it
Jun 3 2019,positive,i liked how there was more of godzilla actually fighting
Jun 3 2019,positive,to much human drama
Jun 3 2019,negative,maybe it was  because ive never seen a godzilla movie and didnt have anything to compare it to but i thought  1  the characters were not relatable the story was pretty ridiculous the scales were off making the juxtaposition of people and monsters totally unbelievable and the movie was too long for no good reason  all in all two hours of my life ill never get back
Jun 3 2019,positive,action packed from beginning to end
Jun 3 2019,positive,good enough but dark hazy and quick cuts that make it confusing about whats going on in the battles etc  basically a visual mess
Jun 3 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie ive been a godzilla fan since i was a child and for this being an american movie i truly enjoyed it
Jun 3 2019,positive,a fullon love letter to the showaheisei era godzilla films of the past if you dont know what im talking about when i mention those eras thats probably why you didnt like godzilla king of the monsters simply put this movie was made for longtime fans of this franchise its all fan service in homages and easter eggs
Jun 3 2019,positive,a big loud movie that demands to be seen in a theatre  much of the action was repetitive but entertaining  being of a certain age i liked and understood the references back to the old movies especially my favorite titan mothra  the closing credits set up the sequel  im ready
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing action throughout the whole movie loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,its a very enjoyable movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,the action was awesome long live the king
Jun 3 2019,negative,terrible movie i liked the first one but this one was awful some of the action was good but the plot was absolutely ridiculous at times i was just hoping they would end the movie but it seemed to drag on found myself laughing in disbelief of how ridiculous the movie was towards the end whoever wrote this should never be put near a script again 
Jun 3 2019,negative,though visually good and ok acting the screenplay was laughably bad almost along the lines of what about this that wont work ok well do absurd plot twist instead though it held promise in the first scene or two by the middle i was just counting down until the time i could leave
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was ok needed more action  a lot of movies have too much story and not enough action we want to see more titans beating the crap out of each other not a love story or relationship with kids 
Jun 3 2019,positive,everything i hoped from a godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i came here to watch godzilla fight other monsters thats all ive wanted out of this franchise make the old school monster movies bad plot and all with modern day effects godzilla 2014 gave me fights hidden behind crappy camera shots this movie gave me and my girlfriend that doesnt like this genre enough action to get forget that first movie ever happened go see it
Jun 3 2019,neutral,dialogue was awful character motivations and actions were without rhyme or reason and often conflicted
Jun 3 2019,positive,i rate movies on how entertaining they were as opposed to how realistic they might be  this movie was a bit silly in places but nothing out of place for a godzilla movie  this harkens back to the old godzilla movies wed stay up late to watch except 1000 times more exciting  this movie wont win any awards but it was extremely entertaining and pushed the story forward in the godzilla cinematic universe that seems to have found focus
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie is fun and a typical godzilla movie with great effects story was fine not as dramatically bad as top reviews have saif it did enough to move the story forward 
Jun 3 2019,positive,over the top fantastical but the actioni s fun and gets better as the film proceeds along so many good actors saying such silly dialogue
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was a fantastic blend of everything that a fan wants out of a kaiju movie terrific beautifully done action scenes and fantastic cinematography and a fantastic cinematic buildup while many have criticized king of the monsters for lacking human development and drama i would argue that it has the perfect amount the movie retains its focus on monster action as it is the climax of a monster fighting series after all while putting enough light on the characters to be interesting both aspects of the movie were well done and created legitimate interest on top of that the two flow perfectly together as the human drama serves to further the monster aspect of the story and the monsters influence the human actions there is a compelling villain and a legitimately interesting moral question as well as the characters stories flowing with and interacting with the monsters existence
Jun 3 2019,positive,i was expecting nothing and it was amazing it had a good story line overall good movie
Jun 3 2019,neutral,the issue i have with this movie is the lack of screen time for godzilla and the rest of the monsters americans dont make a good godzilla movie because they forget who the stars arethe monsters this movie started off hot with lots of introduction to monsters i grew up loving but then they focused on the storyline and it was talk talk talkmilitary this monarch thatboring us for a hour and a halfthen they give us more epic monster action often interrupted for more storyline if for not the awesome monster shots this movie was trash
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic from beginning to end the monsters told a great story and even brought a lot of emotion from the humans in the film the new look on godzilla and the fight scenes made this film worth the watch
Jun 3 2019,positive,fun exciting movie for godzilla fans
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was everything i expected im a huge fan well done
Jun 3 2019,positive,i liked seeing the original monsters brought back as well as the new ones that were part of the plot of the battle over dominance and restoring balance but the bad part of that is the rest of the monsters barely had any screentime except for the four that were the main attractions its understandable but you cant get the audiences hopes up by anouncing theres seventeen titans total then show only a few seconds of a handful of them seriously a lot of that footage of the other titans was already in the trailers so i understand this film was just to set up a bigger monsterverse but what i loved was the action captivating moments and the music i really was happy to hear the original soundtracks make it to the big screen as well as the easter eggs and references to the older movies overall the movie is amazing its what a big screen monster flick should be it doesnt need oscar material acting that shouldnt be the main focus im glad the monsters were in the attention grabbers
Jun 3 2019,positive,to long before you see godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,human stuff was lame but the monster stuff was cool enough to make me forget how much i cringed during the human stuff will see a 2nd time mothra was the show stealer 
Jun 3 2019,positive,wow just wow godzilla king of the monsters delivers exactly what godzilla fans want to see godzilla fighting titans 
Jun 3 2019,positive,anytime there are giant monsters fighting im into it
Jun 3 2019,positive,while there are a few nitpicks here and there throughout the film overall in terms of sheer action godzilla king of the monsters has probably become my new favorite godzilla movie note im not say that it is the best godzilla film made im just saying that its the most fun to watch michael dougherty and the people at legendary managed to bring not only godzilla but some of his most famous kaiju costars to life like we have never seen them before while i do wish that rodan and mothra had had a bit more of their own screen time the times the were on screen were just beyond awesome king ghidorah oh boy what can i say about this version of godzilla ultimate nemesis terrifying sadistic and awesome as all heck are just some of the things that come to my mind and of course his royal kaiju highness himself has never so awesome yet terrifying at the same time as he is in his latest flic the human characters while still not great i did find to be overall genially better than most other human characters from older godzilla films that i grew up watching as a kid i know a lot of people have been hating on the human aspect of the story in this film but a number of the complaints that i have seen about the humans in this film are complaints that could be made about the overwhelming majority of human characters from previous godzilla films if the critics are saying the human characters in this film are terrible they obviously never saw godzillas revenge from way back in 1968   overall godzilla king of the monsters is a solid monster summer block buster and i will defiantly be going back to the theaters again at least once probably even more this summer it is a must see watch for any godzilla fan and i also encourage anyone who isnt yet a godzilla fan to at least give it a try
Jun 3 2019,positive,i was super excited to see this movie and overall enjoyed the action and visuals my biggest frustration was the writing i just cant wrap my mind around why they would destroy godzillas home it makes no sense i cant move past it and it very nearly ruined the movie for me
Jun 3 2019,positive,i love everything about this movie the visuals the sound this is the monster iv been waiting for i love it my kids loves it and i can tell that all of the people who watched this movie on the same night we were loved it i can everything reaction coming feom them it was all positive they were struck with the greatness as they all came out from the cinema and it did put a great joy from my heart hearing from these people who watched may it godzilla fan or nongodziola fan they loved it and i m a witness to it s greatness all hail the king and to the critics godbless 
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla parts were great human parts meh
Jun 3 2019,positive,the critics are morons this film is fantastically fun
Jun 3 2019,positive,family loved it what a great time at the movies go see it is fun watching monster mayhem 
Jun 3 2019,positive,well made godzilla movie believe the fans not the critics 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great monster movie critics dont know good movies for what they are supposed to bev
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was amazing dont let the lame critic reviews turn you away the fan reviews are almost 90 for a reason this movie wasnt made for critics it was made for fans of godzilla and those who want to see an absolute spectacle on the big screen i also saw this movie in dbox for the first time just amazing i must see this movie again next week
Jun 3 2019,positive,plenty of action with the monsters but the subplot with the humans was garbage as always would have liked to see the earth defense force implemented into the storyline as having monarch fly around in a giant ship that could outrun rodan was kind of silly great cgi all around and the sound design was beefy and i loved the different monsters themes playing behind the fight scenes
Jun 3 2019,positive,very entertaining the fight scenes are way more satisfying than i expected definitely recommended
Jun 3 2019,positive,i rate this 5 stars it is everything i thought godzilla could become and more i wish they expand the godzilla universe passed kong vs godzilla i will be there for everything godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie idk why critics are so boring
Jun 3 2019,positive,good movie and i loved all the monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,it felt like an actual godzilla movie it knows what is but still a little bit to many humans even if the story was better or characters was better i still want more godzilla no cutting away from the fights 
Jun 3 2019,negative,movie was awful  horrible script and acting  best part of movie was special effects  wait for dvd if you must see
Jun 3 2019,positive,is the best movie of godzilla ever plus the post credist uff the best movie to go and watch in threater 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is a movie for gfans no hand holding lots of easter eggs and homages to previous films this is without a doubt everything i wanted in a godzilla movie 
Jun 3 2019,positive,lot of fun as a huge godzilla fan this movie did not disappoint plot was a little jarbled at times and the dialogue was kind of bland but the monsters background ideas like the oxygen destroyer made me so happy definitely better than the first i think the critics do not know godzilla very well so they may have the wrong impression of the material
Jun 3 2019,positive,i thought it was good
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of monster screen time and action
Jun 3 2019,positive,good movie fantastic
Jun 3 2019,positive,ignore the critics their view of great actionmonster movie is convoluted the movie is nonstop action from start to finish cgis are state of the art and sound effects are stunning for a long time godzilla fan i give it a
Jun 3 2019,positive,great action scenes fantastic cgi wonderful direction scene for scene beat for beat cohesive themes but also a straight thrill if you dont wanna read into anything
Jun 3 2019,positive,i dont care what the critics say the movie was amazing
Jun 3 2019,positive,all the best parts of traditional godzilla merged with big budget effects if critics were expecting shakespeare in the park and disappointed that they got the best damn king of the monsters movie possible thats their problem
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie made to think of my old days when i was a kids
Jun 3 2019,positive,silly story but its all about the monsters in the end and they deliver big time
Jun 3 2019,positive,the godzilla that weve all been waiting for this is one of the greatest movie ive watched this year and the experience was pure awsomeness i love it so much im gonna get those action figures for this movie was amazing and what the critics says doesnt matter let put our love in it and support it because they gave us what the crew actors and michael dougherty gave us is so much more we could asked for amd thank you go go godzilla  
Jun 3 2019,positive,didnt care much for the plot the lady doctors idea was sorta dumb i get the whole humans are mans worst enemys motif but i feel like waking up a bunch of giant monsters to refresh the world plan could have been thought out a little more the monster fight scenes are obviously the the thing we are here to see and they definitely were a thing to see very nice could have been brighter though made me feel like i was watching the netflix movie bright
Jun 3 2019,positive,i used to watch the old version of godzilla on saturday afternoons when i was a kid this movie especially in 3d was awesome
Jun 3 2019,positive,epic monster battles
Jun 3 2019,neutral,the monster battles were awesome but the story was too convoluted and poorly written 200 million dollars spent on the budget and no one read the script more monster action and a simple story
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is fantastic and a mustsee for the blockbuster audience breathtaking visual effects support the perfect kaiju cast and certainly lives up to its name
Jun 3 2019,positive,classic godzilla movie lots a action
Jun 3 2019,positive,great but can go into slow parts that break the flow of the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,im a huge godzilla fan and really enjoyed this and how it respects the toho monsters legacy in the film
Jun 3 2019,positive,although flawed in some of the character development here we have the movie we wanted whe  godzilla 2014 was announced an epic monster brawl between 4 of the most beloved toho characters a little dark at times giving it a muddy look a lot of what happens on screen still had my jaw on the floor
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was okay  millie bobby brown did an impressive and convincing job in her role as the survivalfocused child of a pair of really miserable parents  the storyline behind this family needed a lot more focus though  maybe most people are more interested in watching and hour and a half of giant monsters smashing buildings and biting each other  and theres no shortage of that  but i would have appreciated a little more story  also in imax it was visually impressive but so loud that i plugged my ears and still could hear all of the dialogue just fine  of course most of it was roar  screech  the volume alone will make me rethink my willingness to see another imax movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,the monster fights were awesome everything else was ehh
Jun 3 2019,positive,thrilling monster fights critics complain about lack of story but story and action was as balanced as it could get with this movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,classic godzilla movie brought into the modern movie making era
Jun 3 2019,positive,i was a hit cant wait for the next one
Jun 3 2019,positive,it doesnt follow a good story telling but still enjoyed the monster battles im surprised that the only good character you can identify in this movie is actually kyle chandlers character in conclusion i enjoyed the movie overall 
Jun 3 2019,negative,horrid  id put it on par with the mule in terms ofeverything  please dont waste your money  go try an impossible burger because at least youd enjoy it
Jun 3 2019,positive,pretty good got right into the action very few slow points totally cheesy big monster movie but thats what i paid for
Jun 3 2019,positive,story was lacking but the action was packed madison brought a good element to the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,its good just to pass the time
Jun 3 2019,positive,its everything youd want in a giant monster movie the only thing holding it back is the drama i know most critics complained there wasnt enough drama but who is watching godzilla for that the first movie was maybe 8020 dramamonster fights and this one improves to about 5050 heres hoping the next gets to maybe 2080 story to monster fights overall entertaining and if you love godzilla movies old or new its a must watch on the big screen its godzilla you know what you signed up for if they would have left out some of the slow down of the drama it would have been an easy 45 stars for me
Jun 3 2019,positive,better monsters than jurassic and no disappointments like star wars  go see the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,critically flawed but a lot of fun
Jun 3 2019,positive,the kaiju designs were phenomenal and they looked great on the big screen the monster fight versus human interaction ratio was perfect the fights were action packed and kept you on the edge of your seat it was an excellent homage to some of tohos greatest battles
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you grew up loving the old godzilla vz films then you will absolutely love this movie i keep wanting to go back and watch it again 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the action was excellent the human story and the lack of repercussions was not needed like woman you caused this and expect everyone to be chill and they were
Jun 3 2019,positive,just saw it at my local cinemark tinseltown and it was pretty dang good only part i didnt really like was that there were too many humans in it
Jun 3 2019,positive,good movie not bad like critics reviews
Jun 3 2019,positive,solid movie must see kind of have to watch the first one to fully understand everything but other than that would definitely recommend
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is beautiful i love dr rick who is based of rick  morty and mothra they did her justice and she steals the show godzilla is always amazing of course
Jun 3 2019,positive,i went to this movie expecting a cheesy plot with bad cgi but i was pleasantly surprised to find out that i actually liked it overall sure the motives of certain characters didnt make sense at key points in the movie but that didnt take away too much from the main reason i went to watch it which was to see the titans duke it out
Jun 3 2019,negative,the weakest of the three monsterverse movies so far this new entry is full of cliches and bad dialogue tries to build suspense with the old oh no is godzilla dead but come on everybody knows visuals are ok with most everything happening in the dark youd think with a 170 million budget they could render some of the monster fights in better light but nope  i wish i had waited for redbox
Jun 3 2019,positive,plot twists drama and just when you think theyll get lost in the human aspects they bring the monster action with a backstory that invests you in monsters and the humans to the point of silence and cheers in a packed imax theater it was definitely worth it
Jun 3 2019,positive,the visuals were beyond stunning and the action between the monsters was also top notch the story was a bit all over the place but i felt it was decent enough to fill in the gaps between the fighting there were a lot of really awesome callbacks to the old movies scattered throughout too 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the film i just wish it had more of the monsters fighting and less of the human drama
Jun 3 2019,negative,cliche and cookie cutter seems like my 5 year old son wrote the script spend you time and money on something else
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was okay the fight scenes were good
Jun 3 2019,positive,just a disjointed plot   poor continuity thruout the film
Jun 3 2019,positive,action packed  silly but brought back memories  always like milly bobby brown
Jun 3 2019,negative,movie was a let down but cgi was dope
Jun 3 2019,positive,plenty of monster mash action but the human story arc brought the movie down severely i found my attention drifting at various points during the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,fk the critics you need to see this in theaters
Jun 3 2019,positive,not really into godzilla background this was 1st modern godzilla movie ive seen it was surprisingly entertaining action scenes made up for sometimes spotty story would recommend movie to others
Jun 3 2019,positive,wow this movie very good i love this movie but camara angle makes dizziness and montage makes moster fighting is confused
Jun 3 2019,positive,special effects were incredible the destruction was epic godzilla was an even bigger bad ass than before watched it in a big theater with xd digital sound that unfortunately didnt seem to be working right still well worth the time
Jun 3 2019,positive,my grandson and his friend really liked the movie a lot and so did i i dont know why it was rated so low i thought it was an excellent movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,disappointed monsters arent the stars they keep cutting away whenever there is a fight boring human plot thought the 2014 did a better job
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was amazing the human element was fantastic the kaiju were portrayed beautifully from their overall appearance to the expressions across their faces beautiful
Jun 3 2019,positive,visually greatest godzilla movie ever so much action i loved every second of it the battles and score were incredible
Jun 3 2019,positive,walked in expecting to see giant monsters beating the crap out of each other energy blasts and explosions and that is basically what i got in my opinion some of the dialogue got a bit long but all in all i think this was a great film 
Jun 3 2019,positive,after watching it a second time knowing what i was getting into i ended up enjoying it even more
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is awesome go see it in the theater if you love monster movies or action this is for you
Jun 3 2019,positive,silly but they have 4 stars but obustly godzilla is a japan star but this time  good no excelent
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing will definitely see it again
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was jam packed with action the story line was well thought of due to the fact they introduced monarch in king kong and if you follow the movies they are linked im reading the critical reviews of the film and my opinion the reviewers have probably not invested the time to seeing the older classic films to appreciate godzilla in all its glory     despite the negative reviews and trolls on here with no sense of movie watching other than being critical films are not for critical thinkers it is for the amusement and enjoyment in the movie theater and for true movie goers if you lost your inner child and cannot see a movie without appreciating the older classics this movie is not for you     the movie is awesome
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was an amazing movie in my opinion 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was really good a lot of action and a good story definitely recommend to go see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,giant critters  a  human drama  b  military physics  c
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved the story the characters andgodzillas atomic breath the monster action was great i liked the love that the writers had a love of the source material i really enjoyed the movie and so did my son
Jun 3 2019,positive,best monster movie of all time showed the monsters plenty and lots of action
Jun 3 2019,positive,the greatest complaint about the previous movie was too much humans and too little monsters there wont be that complaint for this movie  a lot of great monster action
Jun 3 2019,negative,what a let down  movie gets political about global warming and over population  cgi effects were a joke
Jun 3 2019,positive,great additional to the franchise great story and amazing action sequences and fight scenes i really enjoy the intricate story line they have put in place so when you go back and watch the previous films you pick up on little clues you may have not noticed the first or even second time around
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing from start to finish
Jun 3 2019,positive,well made film realistic special effects strong action sequences
Jun 3 2019,positive,action packed from start to finish
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie for fans   even better for non fans to get into godzilla    this movie really pays its respects to this monsters fame     kaiju screen time is greatly improved    i dont understand why people said it wasnt enough godzilla screen time  there are other monsters that are in the movie and they all got good screen time except mothra      human story well there is not much of one     humans mainly talk about ways to deal with the monsters and technicaldata see if this works kind of talk    this may be why critics are upset human drama of the girls broken family is an afterthought  the movie doesnt really focus on that at all    thats good there are other movies for family drama    this movie was about the monsters    the lore created in this movie was nice it made sense to me and i think it went really well with the rest of the movie most of the time    i can see how some people who are more into the action part of the movie get upset because fight scenes would go back and fourth from humans struggling to monsters fighting in the background     i personally thought this was ok   the audience is able to see both the humans point of view and monsters     remember the humans are a big part of this monster issue as you will see when you watch the movie    so the humans having screen time during the battles made sense in this movie and it switched over when a monster fell or was getting pinned not during a major hit was being made    the deaths on the movie are very respected and honorable to the characters who did die    anyways the movie is great   i am a godzilla fan so call me biased if you want but my whole family loved it too    like my fiancé told me if the critics dont like it it must be good    
Jun 3 2019,positive,been a godzilla fan all my life i liked the 2014 one but loved this one so much more action almost nonstop from start to finish the characters arent amazing but nowhere near as bad as critics have made them out to be jokes at times are funny to meh but nothing to distract from the overall film the music and sound design are spot on seriously see this on the largest and loudest screen possible saw it in dolby cinema and it was sensory overload seriously great fun and super enjoyable
Jun 3 2019,positive,it brought back memories watching all of the monstersit had alot of actionmy daughter and i loved it
Jun 3 2019,negative,i liked the first godzilla movie but this one was all over the place definitely a matinee movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it to the end cant wait for kong vs godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,nothing to dislike it was awesome especially watching in imax
Jun 3 2019,positive,excellent job my grandson godzillas young big fan at 8 years old he acted out godzilla throughout the movie as he does at home
Jun 3 2019,positive,i like the different monsters from the original movies coming to life again in the big screen
Jun 3 2019,neutral,dialog wasnt that good great action scenes tho
Jun 3 2019,positive,it has gotten bad reviews on rotten tomatoes  idiots are missing the point  its a godzilla movie  remember godzilla movies from japan  its supposed to be a little hokey  its not a serious movie  its the monster loved by everyone  this movie is the 2019 version of the 70s destroy all monsters  better quality better effects  its freakin godzilla not casablanca  its awesome  ignore the plot holes and th3 cant possibly happen  its freakin godzilla  excellent godzilla for 2019
Jun 3 2019,positive,disliked lighting special effects and visibility
Jun 3 2019,negative,very slow and wordy at times
Jun 3 2019,positive,its giant monsters fighting why someone would complain about it not having this or that is beyond me the action sequences of which there are many are breathtaking great job michael dougherty
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved the movie full of action never a dull moment took my 2 teenagers and they loved it as well if you are a diehard godzilla fan this is a must see
Jun 3 2019,positive,well done perfect balance of action and story
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla was typical monster movie faire you dont expect a great plot or dialogue but what you do want is giant monsters busting up on each other here you have mothra rhodan ghidora godzilla etc enjoyable enough movie  it leads up to next yrs godzilla vs king kong which i guarantee will be more like batman vs superman in the end the thing i find odd is more and more of these type of movies have creatures who look just like the ones from pacific rim
Jun 3 2019,positive,is a good movie  nice effects
Jun 3 2019,positive,the best use of nostalgia and action in any american version of godzilla yet i usually dont splurge to see movies in fancy theaters but my wife surprised me with tickets for the dolby cinema and the sound blew my mind i plan to see it at least two more times before it leaves theaters
Jun 3 2019,positive,ive read the reviews prior but as a godzilla i absolutely love everything that involved with the monsters as for the plot and character wise it needed improvement
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was fantastic but picture looked really grainy could be the theater i watched it at though
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla is indeed king of the monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,forget what the critics say this is a film that is exactly what its meant to be a monster film great big monsters that couldnt care less about the humans that get trampled under their feet the battles are epic the destruction is catastrophic and you couldnt be more excited when you see these titans take the screen do yourself a favor and see it on the biggest screen possible you wont be disappointed
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of monsters is the best movie that i have ever seen cant wait to get it on dvd
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was a great monsterverse movie  my son loved it
Jun 3 2019,negative,it was so hard to follow one minute they want to kill gil next min they want to save him  i didnt like but my kids did so thats all that matters
Jun 3 2019,negative,contrived and without a real soul
Jun 3 2019,positive,the story line was really goofy but no more goofy than the movies from the 60s so it was a little nostalgic its kinda hard to suspend my disbelief when you have million ton beasts fighting and people running around under foot without a scratch could have been better but it could have been worse
Jun 3 2019,positive,exciting and entertaining
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of action lots of monsters lots of effects its exactly what its supposed to be a visual spectacle
Jun 3 2019,positive,such a great movie we will be buying when it comes out on dvd
Jun 3 2019,positive,a great fun movie that is a definite must see  truly a love letter to the fans of the franchise  the action is awesome the human parts are good  has to be one of the best films i have seen so far this year  cant wait to see where they carry the franchise after this and godzilla vs kong
Jun 3 2019,negative,ugh what happened here this movie tried way to hard to have a storyline when all it needed to do was be what it is a battle royale spectacle of epic proportions out of the 13 movies ive watched in the theater this year this one was easily the biggest disappointment save your money wait for redbox
Jun 3 2019,positive,good entertainmentall the creatures of oldgogo godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie loved it wanted to see it again
Jun 3 2019,negative,one of those movies that are only good in the theater setting even that being said i personally thought the movie was a bit too long the storyline wasnt as great at one point during the movie i wished it would just end 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was a little longbut action packedloved the g box seats
Jun 3 2019,positive,was an action filled roller coaster ride the whole way through yes some of the cuts to human drama does slow down the pace enough but not enough to make it unbearable but compared to 2014s godzilla it has way more monster goodness nobody goes to watch a godzilla movie for the human drama the critics who say they want less monster and more human drama are ridiculous the major complaint from godzilla 2014 was they wanted more monster action now they complain about too much monster action it was a great film great rewatch value and im going to see it for a third time it made me fell like a 10 year old again and i was smiling the whole way through this film doesnt deserve the low score from the critics id give it an 89 hands down 
Jun 3 2019,negative,a loud disappointing meh visuals were great but nothing new good actors but bad script the comedy was horrible and fell flat and hard  
Jun 3 2019,positive,monster fights were still mostly in the dark dialog was dumb missed some of the old school sounds that gidorah used to make
Jun 3 2019,positive,a wonderful flick if you love action and great plot mixed together  as a long time godzilla fan i would recommend this to anyone who wants to see a summer blockbuster
Jun 3 2019,positive,i liked it there were monsters in this one
Jun 3 2019,positive,i came for giant monster fights i got giant monster fights barring a shoddy script i would watch it again just for the action
Jun 3 2019,positive,so as a godzilla fan i thought this was a good film it had a lot of tributes to the older films that i appreciated but that might also go over the heads of some in comparison to godzilla 2014 the story was more direct and linear tying directly into the monsters and what was going on with them the acting is pretty decent and i personally connected to a few of the characters theres more godzilla and monsters fighting straight off and a lot of the shots are just beautiful the imagery the color the spectacle its good     its no game changer nor do i consider it a fantastic film or anything but after godzilla 2014 and kong i think its going the right direction its a fun enjoyable film and i dont think it needs to be much more than that 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was about what you expect from a godzilla movie  a lot of plot holes some comedy overall it wasnt terrible but it isnt a must see in theaters
Jun 3 2019,positive,i had high hopes going in as godzilla destroy all monsters 1968 was one of my favorite kaiju films as a kid  the movie was okay but i was really hoping to see more and different monsters battle  in the trailer and film itself they said there are 17 known titans but we really only got to see 4 go at it  i expect more monsters and more destruction from a big budget kaiju film
Jun 3 2019,negative,not what we expected but acting and it seems a cheap film sifi kind of movie lol
Jun 3 2019,positive,i cant get enough of this movie you will not go wrong by seeing this movies all hell the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was pure joy what movie fun should be 
Jun 3 2019,positive,a great movie i loved all the details this is now my no 1 godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome fun movie and a great followup to the 2014 movie plenty of monster fights in contrast to the previous film critics who say the human plot lines were under developed can shove it no one is seeing this movie expecting a christopher nolan style plot take it for what it is a blockbuster monster movie one that stays true to the original meaning behind the godzilla franchise and again provides plenty of monster fights
Jun 3 2019,positive,what are people expecting with an amazing back story the one before this had some character building but were here for some godzilla and boy did you get it the effects of the dragon are amazing fun as heck and a great break for some family time
Jun 3 2019,positive,great special effects and action
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was an absolutely fantastic movie i was already a fan of godzilla movies but this movie exceeded my expectations
Jun 3 2019,positive,really enjoyed the movie
Jun 3 2019,negative,special effects were good oh the monster effects were pretty good but i regret spending money 2 contributed to its open weekend the story was awful completely implausible even for a godzilla movie it rips off so many other godzilla movies its pathetic and honestly nobody in the theater seem to react well to it i wasnt even laughing at it it was just like really really youre doing this wow okay here we go oh oh come on thats just no no stupid i will never watch this again
Jun 3 2019,positive,non stop action awesome story line amazing special effects my family and i really enjoyed the movie they even used the original godzilla song which thrilled us godzilla fans
Jun 3 2019,positive,super awesome movie especially if you are a godzilla fan i love it and there are definitely some sad moments
Jun 3 2019,positive,dont let the critics fool you this is a good film not perfect but far from terrible this is a love letter to the godzilla franchise and fans the monsters are truly realized as the main characters and the humans while simple are the secondary supporting characters that help give perspective spectacle is the true goal here and it delivers if you just wanna have a good time go see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie and great monster battles the acting overall wasnt that great but the visual effects were high quality movie is entertaining
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you like godzilla  your going to love it 
Jun 3 2019,positive,there were a lot of loop holes and unrealistic plot armor scenarios but the cgi and battles were amazing would still recommend to someone who only cares about big monsters and fight scenes
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie critics are wrong they just dont understand what a good godzilla movie is supposed to be like but us real g fans do will be seeing this movie again
Jun 3 2019,positive,a must see in movies
Jun 3 2019,positive,a great godzilla movie some of the dialogue serves as more monologue vs actually conversation but the star is godzilla and the movie does a great job at delivering the king of monsters and playing up the battles
Jun 3 2019,positive,we went for the action adventure which was pretty good  the acting was awful
Jun 3 2019,positive,starts slow but builds into a smashing good movie definitely worth your time for at least a matinee
Jun 3 2019,positive,funny how ppl go to a godzilla movie expecting to get dialog like there watching saving private ryan or gone with the wind if you a classic lover of the old japanese flix you wont be disappointed if you looking for something else then obviously you wont find what your looking for  long live the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,fun to watch nice to watch in big screen 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie a lot of monster fight scenes especially compared to the 2014 movie i would recommend seeing it on the big screen to get the full impact
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie period when you have these titans going at all movie long grab the popcorn the soft drink sit back and be amazed
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was one of the best godzilla movies ive seen the monters were awesome the fights amazing and i cant wait to see the other titans in the next movies
Jun 3 2019,positive,my favorite part was when fire godzilla became cannon lol
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved this movie cant wait until the godzilla vs king king movie the monsters were amazing the fight scenes were engaging and the way godzilla connected with humanity emphasized their relationship the special effects were mind blowing
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome cant wait for godzilla vs kong
Jun 3 2019,neutral,i was very disappointed 
Jun 3 2019,positive,every godzilla fan will love this i feel like a kid again i liked the story and characters and the kaijus its a godzilla movie for fans
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved this film  this is the true godzilla film for the fans and if youre a fan of godzilla youll love it the performance from the actors was amazing even though that some of the human scenes felt a little boring   the monster action was amazing this is probably the best monster battles weve seen in a godzilla film with the fights being awesome and feel powerful while they also not being too drawn out fights and seem reasonable long fights there was a lot more screen time for the monsters with about one third of the movie had monsters just watching godzilla and king ghidorah fight and while looking very realistic made the little boy in me happy  the cinematography in this film was beautiful almost every shot of the monsters  could easily be your desktop wallpaper this is some of the best cgi that ive ever seen in a film with the scale in this moving being insane the monsters feel like giant beasts or titans fighting for the natural balance of earth  the human characters in this film were entertaining but was boring at some times the characters were more entertaining than the ones from the 2014 film and the characters that returned from the 2014 film did more than they did in the 2014 film   the message of the film was an important message but it wasnt executed in the best way the who ecoterrorist groups plan doesnt make completely sense but it does keep to some of the original themes from the showa films   overall the film was great it isnt a perfect film and could be worked on in some places but its still not a bad film the monsters looked great and if you love monsters moves and monster battles this is your movie if your more of a superhero fan this might not be the best film for you easily the best american godzilla film yet and one of the best godzilla films ever made
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved every second of it human story wasnt as bad has everyone said it was but this was the godzilla movie every fan wanted
Jun 3 2019,positive,it has spectacular effects and the final fight was the best yet 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great kept us entertained son is a big fan of godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,truly amazing   long live the king
Jun 3 2019,negative,forget a plot forget any level of plausibility  this is just a movie that exists to set up certain cgi fight scenes  if that is what you want to see great  if you want anything more too bad  
Jun 3 2019,positive,action from start to finish
Jun 3 2019,positive,going into this movie the only thing i expect out of this was godzilla city destruction eye candy visual effects and fight scene from the kaiju  i was not disappointed  the story are simple and it doesnt take anything away from the movie  however  some general audience may find the story confusing due to the fact  there are many homages and easter eggs in this film that references in earlier godzilla from the 60s  if you are a godzilla fan you will find it makes sense     there were minor issues with the movie mainly the humans  but that doesnt take away the enjoyment overall of the film  just dont expect any great oscar performance from the cast because this is a godzilla film  the musical score is just awesome   visual effects are top notch too   this film is definitely an improvement over the 2014 one
Jun 3 2019,positive,great action packed monster movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is a movie for true godzilla fans  but if you are a casual viewer i still think you will enjoy this movie as well  this movie puts godzilla front and center and does a great job building him up as well as making ghidorah seem like a true threat to the king of monsters  critics may point out the lack of character development but its a monster movie they do a passing job and make the lead characters seem important and pull at the heart strings a few times  i dont really get emotional about movies but whoa i was really into the movie and i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see some hardcore monster action
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie has mediocre dialogues and easily predicted plot but who cares about that only nerds think about lazy writing and dont appreciate how big kaiju monsters wrestle with nuclear beams honestly the critics arent childish enough to actually see the bigger picture giant freakin nuclear lizzard and big heckin 3 headed dragon
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved monsters needed less humans
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was amazing the monster fights were insane im going to go see it again definitely worth the money also the story isnt bad contrary to what biased rotten tomatoes has to say about it
Jun 3 2019,positive,saw this movie twice and loved it each time once again the critic reviews show just how out of touch they are highly recommended
Jun 3 2019,positive,was really good story action visual effects very good
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing amazing movie great tension edge of my seat excitement music was done with great respect to the original score and even elevated

Jun 3 2019,positive,hail to the king awesome movie
Jun 3 2019,negative,in comparison to its predecessors godzilla and kong this was nearly dismal the lack of fear and the odd choice of emotions portrayed was discerning the comedy relief needs to be sent back to the 2000s every majestic scene you will witness is shown within the trailer everything else is unholy clashing starting about 15 minutes in the script failed the alist cast tremendously cant even get started on the plot holes and the disappearance of numerous characters not a horrid flick but a horror compared to what was to be expected if you want to watch a wwe x monster royal rumble this flick is for you 
Jun 3 2019,negative,one of the biggest phony movies i have seen ever screenplay was ridiculous the scenes were contrived and not believable at all it was a total insult to movie goers i have to sit through such a trash movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved this movie this movie had so much more action presented in alot of amazing moments there is only minor jokes that dont pull from the movie this is a must see for fans
Jun 3 2019,neutral,when i first saw the trailers for this movie i was pretty interested to go and see this movie even in 3d however i was quite disappointed when i actually went to go see this a day after release compared to how awesome the trailers were parts of the movie felt rather quick and even forced little time for the audience to develop any relationships with the characters in the movie sure the visuals and effects were really great but i didnt see that as an excuse to overlook poor scripts and plots
Jun 3 2019,positive,i love it its what i want to see in a monster movie and i do love the call backs to the original 1954 godzilla
Jun 3 2019,negative,very loud annoying and stupid

Jun 3 2019,positive,this was leagues above godzilla 2014 the story was better the emotions hit harder and it actually showed godzilla for more than 9 or 15 minutes of the entire film truly an amazing summer flick to watch with the family or with a group of friends

Jun 3 2019,positive,personally as a fan of godzilla movies i loved it was missing a few things but all in all i give it atleast a 910
Jun 3 2019,positive,critics are wrong this is a godzilla movie not some contemporary piece of art if you went into the movie expecting it to not be a godzilla movie then you need to change your standards as a kaiju flick it hit every note right and even had a sensible human side story the fights can only be described with one word epic seriously some of the most beautiful cg to date the fights were not muddy or confusing like transformers for example i would definitely watch king of the monsters again highly recommended
Jun 3 2019,positive,definitely entertaining
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved the movie it has a lot of godzilla action a lot of human action and a lot of fun i would definitely recommend future generation to watch the movie including the other 2 movies
Jun 3 2019,positive,visuals and soundtrack were amazing
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie delivered exactly what it promised a huge spectacle full of citydestroying beasts the human characters were generic but serviceable and there were plenty of jawdropping camera shots and scenes to keep me solidly entertained the whole time i really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a simple good time

Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie is being criticized way to hard i went to see a monsters fight and thats what i got i didnt go to see a whole bunch of people drama 
Jun 3 2019,positive,ahmayzing action packed and reminds you why you started liking godzilla from back in the day dont know what these rotten tomato critics are saying but two thumbs way up

Jun 3 2019,positive,why do the critics bash movies like this theyre entertaining and fun no one goes to see them expecting oscar winning performances 
Jun 3 2019,negative,i was really excited for the movie it couldve been so much more than it was poor writing way too many cringeworthy jokes and mediocre acting i did enjoy a few of the big moments but they were almost always immediately ruined by one of the humans doing something incredibly stupid ill give it 155 for some cool fight scenes and actually quite good cgi 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was an awesome movie  my son loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,i wanted to like king of the monsters more than i wanted to ive never really been a diehard fan of godzilla but i did enjoy the previous movie in this series back in 2014 i thought that movie built up tension in an excellent way and had a fantastic finale that was a very satisfying payoff while this movie has multiple fights that are visually stunning and aweinspiring they never reach the highs of the final fight in the first movie my biggest complaint about the movie is that the story was just a little far fetched in ways i couldnt really get behind what the villains in the movie were trying to achieve and that took away from the experience i also thought the comedic relief characters could be a bit annoying at times however i think the fight scenes in this movie are great and honestly make the movie worth watching but as a whole the movie has some noticeable flaws and is just okay in my book
Jun 3 2019,positive,your in for some godly monster on monster combat story is a little all over the place 
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie godzilla is the ultimate bad ass
Jun 3 2019,positive,i actually enjoyed this movie more than the last one the monster fights were better and the human story was better  i cared a lot more for them this time and they explained things in an interesting way to me some scenes could be jarring but it never took away from my enjoyment of the movie as a whole overall it was an amazing movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,epic monster fights awesome popcorn flick
Jun 3 2019,positive,great addition to the godzilla franchise some of the story is lukewarm and the acting follows the writing but the monsters are epic and the battles are brutal one star taken away for some of the dialogue scenes being shot way to close to the actors face other than that if you love over the top action and a huge movie feel youll love this one 
Jun 3 2019,positive,despite what critics say godzilla was a good movie the story with kinda out there but my answer is so
Jun 3 2019,positive,seeing all of my favorite titans done so much justice with todays technology was amazing king ghidorah was the best part
Jun 3 2019,positive,there was no dislikes
Jun 3 2019,positive,finally this is a true godzilla movie with less human scenes loved it so much hail to the king
Jun 3 2019,neutral,the parts with monsters were good the parts with humans were bad unfortunately the humans got most of the screen time loved the previous godzilla movie but this was a disappointment
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely nothing short of breath taking
Jun 3 2019,negative,any good action is immediately interrupted by boring one dimensional characters that the audience couldnt care less about all the kaiju look great but theres still not enough of them for it to make up for the amount of boring humans we have to sit through 
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it didnt care for the new monsters but loved the inclusion of the original music
Jun 3 2019,positive,i thought the monster fights and sequences where really good  the story was a bore and it kept you wanting to just wish for more fights 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i will have to disagree with the critics hear they literally cant happen with humanity a human with in my opinion a god complex causes the problem and starts the plot and the another human who is at peace with the world and themselves is key assisting godzilla and in doing so saves the world long live the king
Jun 3 2019,positive,i like when monsters fight
Jun 3 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movies action from beginning to end
Jun 3 2019,positive,captures the spirit of the toho films  people complained about not enough godzilla in the first film and now this film brings you almost non stop kaiju action i also appreciated the use of the toho godzilla theme music looking forward to godzilla vs kong
Jun 3 2019,negative,visually there were more than a few moments that i said wow but the script was a yawner and family dramas were never fleshed out enough for me to care about anyone i really enjoyed the first godzilla this one is quite the mess
Jun 3 2019,positive,it had great graphics but they should have left the story out and let the mosters be the story focus not the orca it was an ok moviebut i wouldnt call it great
Jun 3 2019,positive,this was the godzilla movie ive been wanting to see for the past 40 years
Jun 3 2019,positive,what i expected and wanted from a godzilla movie lots of monsters and lots of action
Jun 3 2019,negative,boring too many us cliches stupid  annoying lead characters bad acting good visual effects

Jun 3 2019,positive, best godzilla movie ever made wall to wall fan service what a course correct from the first epic
Jun 3 2019,positive,you really have to pay attention to everything said to understand some of their accent language even they didnt understand each other which gave us a laugh to have in the middle of the loudness and edge stopping parts of the moviegood turnout by the way was that image of godzilla and king kong in the last of credit picts hummm
Jun 3 2019,positive,very entertaining and it delivered the set up for the next one between the other king 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie battle scenes epic worth seeing on big screen all the way movie critics are the worthless species
Jun 3 2019,positive,opening statement  i loved it but i may be in the biased camp of folks that enjoy giant lizards that belch radiation in their movies    godzill king of the monsters builds on the excellent foundation laid out by the stellar kong skull island before it we catch up with the mysterious monarch organization whose mission statement is to study and contain these giant monsters even more mysterious is their source of funding because these folks have come a long way since their humble hitch a ride on a military boat days in kong they have deep sea bases flying fortresses and a never end supply of grunts to be sacrificed to the popcorn gods as they are trampled underfoot of some of the best kaiju fights ive seen since the first pacific rim    despite the high casualty count i found myself actually invested and rooting for the human cast this time around keeping the same idea of staying with the people in the know like kong skull island we are whisked around the globe by the nose of actual human drama central to this story is the relationship of estranged exlovers mark and emma and their battle for the soul of their daughter madison played by the amazing millie bobbie brown of stranger things fame  not to spoil anything but shift in story actual caught be off guard initially and enjoyed the ride since then    so the human element did not drag the movie down like it did in the original godzilla 2014 and actually enhanced the central conflict of godzilla vs gidorah the latter becoming an actual threat simply because i was invested in the characters and how the its machinations would affect them and the planet    ive just ranting at this point but in short im utterly confused why this movie is still at a 39 on rotten tomatoes it was competently made and a ton of fun to watch i was cheering for big g and damn if seeing mothra didnt bring a tear to my eye    kong skull island is still the best kaiju movie ive ever scene but id comfortably put this one on the shelf next to it
Jun 3 2019,positive,watched it in 4dx which made the whole movie so much more fun awesome fight scenes cant wait til the next one
Jun 3 2019,positive,a kaiju masterstroke with biblical awe some of the most jawdropping cinematography  monster cgibattles ever realized to film a booming thunderous score and surprisingly human undertone in broken family portrait narrative 8710         ghidorah mothra scylla mutos rodan kong gojira monstergods of legend battling it out on our home turf set to some of the biggestscale epic visuals  action sequences money can buy thats what warner bros sold us on last year when marketing first began and on that godzilla kotm delivers my word does it deliver  a kaiju masterstroke with biblical awe some of the most insane cinematography  monster cgibattles ever realized to film a booming thunderous score  surprisingly human undertone in broken family portrait narrative     the visuals godzilla kotm is one of the most visuallystunning films ive ever seen and ive seen a lot of films as a critic the monster cgi is absolutely masterful and a quantum leap for the genre i havent seen since 1933s stopmotion king kong making all this possible almost a century later every single monster is spectactularly rendered from the hydrareminiscent monster zeroghidorah to luminescenceshow mothra to fire demon rodan to the blueflame breathing star of the show godzilla the cinematography is absolutely insane with breathtaking shots set in diverselybrilliant locational settings from subterranean ice caves to yucatan mayan ruins to mexican seatyphoons to dcsan francisco postapocalyptia rife with interpretive symbolism like the cross and monuments bowing to the monsters old gods as theyre referred to and the sheer majestypower theyre infused with feels that way the action is sublime startedearly and thrilliglybonkers in every way imaginable holy fck    the score and performances the soundtrack to this visually jawdropping spectacle only mountains of money can buy is equally as stirring booming thunderous and rife with as much power as the nuclear megamonsters it accompanies the power dynamism and senseoverloading panache of the film can hardly be put into words you just have to experience the canvas firsthand as strong as the lightning beams ghidorah breathes the performances are good overall with strong leads of acting prowess in the forms of vera farmiga ken watanabe sally hawkins kyle chandler and millie bobby brown of stranger things fame steals the spotlight and anchors the film in its surprisingly human undertonednarrative    the human balance weaved amidst all this destruction and massivescale monster fights is a surprisinglyhuman storyline of a broken family portrait trying to piece itself back together a relatively sweet sentiment of a family torn apart trying to find its way back home and restore some semblance of normal life while avenging their lost son is nicely deliberated this juxtaposition comes as a nice surprise in what i assumed was going to be a totally monsterfocused narrative has every right to do despite some fools apparently wanting more humans than monsters in a film w monsters in the name but instead aims to balance it with human emotion  universallyrelatable themes of family  environmentalnaturalorder    flaws in godzilla kotm include an overstretching of length pacing lull in the backhalf and slightlyvexatious mark russell 2hr12min seems like a great length for a film on paper but the screenplay admittedly not going to win any oscars but why should it again monster blockbuster was made for more of a 1hr50min film and you easily sense in the comparativelyslower backhalf paling in comparison to the brilliant first one also chandlers mark russell is somewhat abrasive at first with an annoyinglyoverdeliberated monster hatred coming across unnaturalwhiny and overblown    overall godzilla kotm exemplifies what it means to be a kaiju film  with unforgettable thrills and jawdropping visuals you have to see to believe    overall score 8710
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome what else can you want from a giant monster movie its great for what it is and delivers on what you want from godzilla saw this in imax and its powerful 
Jun 3 2019,positive,could have been better but could have been a lot worse  i wish they had brought a little more energy from the truly huge godzilla movies past
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing movie i couldnt see how they can do more better than that very well recomend to watch especially the end credit scene
Jun 3 2019,positive,too much comebacks still decent movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i thought it was fuckin great it was everything i wanted and more and yeah the human plot was not subtle or anything like that but it did its job and man the monster action i felt 10 again
Jun 3 2019,positive,the plot was aggressively stupid the monsters were welldone but it could have used more some of the fights scenes dragged it was a fine way to pass a few hours
Jun 3 2019,positive,we really like how people sacrifice themselves for the good cause to save the earth an humanity
Jun 3 2019,positive,human parts of the movie are meh but those godzilla battles make it totally worth it
Jun 3 2019,positive,probably about as extravagantly awful as godzilla fans want worth noting that i was taken here be a family of godzilla fans and they seemed delighted
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was awesome not sure whats up with the professional critics some of the human dialogue and actions are a bit cliche but the monster battles sounds and effects are amazing go see it in imax 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved it but i had a couple people that kept on talking behind our seats
Jun 3 2019,positive,i think it was good nice affects and the sound was good id say it has nice graphics people should focus on important aspects of the movie and the little ones
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was exciting fun and a total popcorn movie it delivered exactly what it promised lots of monsters good vs evil and big ol gojira
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was fantastic ive seen every godzilla movie and i can give it an official seal of approval i wont say its the best but it is a great godzilla movie 
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved the nonstop monster fighting sound fx and classic godzilla theme
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was much more improved than its prequel the development for some of the characters were great the models were astonishing and the fights were oh so epic koi
Jun 3 2019,positive,great visuals and homages to old movies and music themes will have you feeling like a kid again wall to wall monster battling
Jun 3 2019,positive,best american godzilla by far 
Jun 3 2019,positive,just ok  but what are we to expect
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a thrilling kaiju extravaganza that delivers stunning action sequences and fights between the monsters and thats when we do see the monsters we are constantly kept waiting throughout the film to see the monsters no one cares about the human characters but they keep showing them they need to understand that this is a godzilla film the main takeaway is that this movie delivers on what everyone came for the monsters but doesnt show quite enough of them
Jun 3 2019,positive,nonsensical plot actors get in the way reminds me of a michael bay transformers movie in a bad way
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie loved it  i love godzilla movies this one was the greatest of all 
Jun 3 2019,positive,what a godzilla movie should be fighting amd devastation
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie critics dont understand a godzilla movie and should be ignored as a godzilla fan i was pleasantly surprised plus there were a couple of nods to the older films which i respected cant wait for godzilla vs kong 
Jun 3 2019,positive,pure dumb fun its exactly what you think giant monsters fighting each other
Jun 3 2019,positive,i went into this one only hoping it would be better than the 2014 entry into the american made godzilla film series which includes kong skull island which does not include godzilla but features the kong that will be in the upcoming kong vs godzilla which will be out next year im happy to say it is an improvement over that godzilla 2014  which didnt have as much godzilla as fans had hoped but instead focused more on the human characters and the muto monsters that godzilla fought in the film    this time the standard adversaries of godzilla from the japanese godzilla films mothra ghidora rodan show up and its great to see them so well done with modern visual effects technology the monster fights in this are amazing unfortunately aside from ken watanabes monster expert character the human characters are not really interesting and just get in the way of the monster action even so this is a much better film the 2014 godzilla film and definitely pays off with the monster fights    i was very glad to hear that the godzilla themes from the japanese godzilla films by composer akira ifukube are back in this movie that really makes a big difference in this film and is quite impressive when we see these monsters with modern fx the new soundtrack music by composer bear mccreary was also impressive    i saw it in imax and the presentation and sound was fantastic     im curious as to how this film looks in 4 dx 4dx is a motion picture technology owned and developed by south korean company cj 4dplex a part of the cj group 4dx allows a motion picture presentation to be augmented with environmental effects such as seat motion wind rain lights and scents along with the standard video and audio as such theaters must be specially designed for and equipped with 4dx technology    the edwards marqe theater near 610 and 110 has this technology    i recommend this movie for the monster fights however i would say if youre not a godzilla movie fan you will probably be lost as to why these monsters are importantand would probably not get it    i dont know that i would see this movie again in a theater but would probably buy it on bluray when it comes out since i have godzilla 2014 and kong skull island    this movie has several references in it to skull island  which sets up the next film which will be out next summer    if you like giant monsters go see it if you do spend the extra money to see it on imax its definitely worth it
Jun 3 2019,negative,probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen director sucks i dozed off a few times during fighting seems the movie annoyed the crap out of me just a bunch of useless screaming
Jun 3 2019,positive,finally a godzilla like monster movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie absolutely delivered what almost every little kid who watched the monster movie marathons all night long was expecting from this godzilla movie a mustsee for even the casual godzilla fan who may or may not know who biollante is d
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely loved it the crtics can have several seatsthr creatures were done right and the fight sequences were fantastic 
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you go into the movie expecting mediocre writing in exchange for a lot of monster on monster action godzilla hits all the right spots
Jun 3 2019,positive,old fan of godzilla connected to the previous 2014 movie nicely and reintroduced the other creatures with plenty of action between the monsters  loved it

Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie  best time ive had at the movies in years  its not just a great monster movie its a great movie  period  fantastic script and visuals  much better than expected  55 stars  
Jun 3 2019,positive,so much damn fun saw it in imax and was blown away the monster fights were beautiful and the music was a great tribute to the old movies how you couldnt enjoy this movie is beyond me academy award winner no but did you go into this thinking that its gorgeous and intense and i just loved the whole time long live the king 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie with lots of action perfectly balanced between monster fighting and human stuff
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved how that they focused on the monster action because to me that was the best part about this film just seeing clash of the titans really made this film so great
Jun 3 2019,positive,take everything that was good from the 2014 movie and multiply it by a factor of 10 while there were a couple of cheesy moments they are small and so few that it doesnt affect the movies enjoyment at all those looking for an all out brawl between monsters will get this in spades an incredible score and visual effects rounds out this glorious love letter tohos original king of the monster rubber suits 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was the best movie i have seen in a long time yes maybe the story wasnt as epic as you thought but who doesnt want to see monsters beat the living daylights  out of each other

Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was incredible for a godzilla movie it is exactly what you would want from the franchise after the lack of monster fights from the 2014 entry the monsters are beautifully crafted and designed and bring such intensity to the movie dont listen to the critics listen to the people invested in the godzilla franchise 
Jun 3 2019,positive,great monster action
Jun 3 2019,positive,incredible fight scenes amazon action and just pure fun if your a fan of godzilla you will love this movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla vs ghidora was awesome but team human was boring and not very engaging
Jun 3 2019,positive,pure raw kaiju battling you pay to see godzilla kick some asses and thats alright
Jun 3 2019,positive,lots of nice ideas but the execution fell a little short monster fights are decent but leaves you wondering how certain characters dont get stepped on
Jun 3 2019,positive,the script needed a lot of work im not sure how it got past the drawing board but the action and the monsters in themselves were pretty epic
Jun 3 2019,positive,way to bring back the king strong a lot of action and a great ending worth the wait

Jun 3 2019,positive,if you are a fan of the original godzilla you will enjoy this movie it pays homage to a lot of previous kaiju movies the story has a bit of cheese to it but most of the godzilla movies follow suit seeing the kaiju in full cgi it was awesome i loved the easter eggs the fights and the music  i am going to go see this again 
Jun 3 2019,positive,waited to see these creatures come to life without guys in rubber costumes since i was 4 years old  im 45 was everything i ever wanted in a kaiju movie awesome

Jun 3 2019,positive,easily one of my favorite godzilla films im a huge godzilla fan from gojira to final wars this movie does a great job of tying elements from the previous monsterverse movie together and still showing respect to the original toho films i had hoped to see more of the toho kaiju in the movie besides the 4 big ones but im hopefully that we will get more of them as the series develops  
Jun 3 2019,positive,actors were unnecessary i didnt care about any of their characters
Jun 3 2019,positive,big monsters epic fights and a good enough story as an excuse to tie everything together fing loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is easily one if not the best godzilla film made by a hollywood studio it is has an excellent fan service from start to finish the special effects are top quality the soundtrack is awesome and full of life the story and way they set up the universe  here is very fun original and yet very faithful to the original source material the human characters are way better than the first one however they have some moments that are bad the action between kaiju and humans is better balance although sometimes the cutaways in the middle of a kaiju fight is annoying still its better executed than the first movie toho would be very proud of this interpretation of godzilla an awesome movie
Jun 3 2019,positive, was a great seeing childhood monsters on the big screen finally battling it out great popcorn movie for the summer  yes the human storyline couldve been better but godzilla movies have never been about the human characters its been about the monsters great popcorn movie for the summer movie critics just dont get it as usual 
Jun 3 2019,positive,was going in hoping for a good godzilla movie been a fan of godzilla as far back as i can remember can honestly say it more than exceeded my expectations the behavior of the monsters was amazing as well as the effects surrounding them i think the only people who see this movie negatively would be those who are not godzilla fans how could anyone be disappointed by this movie it wasnt perfect but it more than delivered on what the true fans would want from it 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was epic the monster scenes were nuts and there was plenty of it my wife didnt want to see and after the movie was done she was happy that she went to see it
Jun 3 2019,positive,better than i expected
Jun 3 2019,positive,great movie critics dont know what they talking about
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie has alot of monster action
Jun 3 2019,positive,truly awesome and i mean that in the truest definition the word a fun and exciting ride that stays true to the series
Jun 3 2019,positive,75 another similar movie to the series i liked the flow of the movie good special effects and a very detailed script line if you like this reptile you have to see this movie on gp 
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was better than the previous godzilla movies it wasnt the best movie in the world but for what it was they did a good job with it
Jun 3 2019,positive,theres a lot to like for fans and instead of the 7 minutes of godzilla screen time in the first one you get a lot of kaiju i also completely understand why critics are trashing it pretty much everything theyre saying is true but as a lifelong fan this movie made me cry with happiness 
Jun 3 2019,positive,was outstanding pays great respect to the japanese movies great story powerful acting and incredible cgi and battle scenes throughout 
Jun 3 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan you will be satisfied
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was exactly what i wanted kaiju kicking the crap out of each other couldnt be happier with it 
Jun 3 2019,positive,good movie more monsters please
Jun 3 2019,positive,as expected big monster fights and theyre great at that everything i wanted
Jun 3 2019,positive,very reminiscent of a traditional godzilla movie but way more excitement
Jun 3 2019,positive,loved it   my grandson did too well done i grew up watching godzilla and really appreciate how he has evolved
Jun 3 2019,positive,good old fashioned monster breaks the world fighting movie effects were great and the amount of monster screen time especially godzilla more than made up for the lack of in the last one a little too much exposition from the human characters and their convenient powerpoint like slide shows to go along with them good way to start off the summer blockbusters
Jun 3 2019,positive,movie was ok and i would recommend the movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i love this movie  its reminds me a lot about my childhood     people like tomatoers who doesnt love this movie maybe does not experienced a lively joyful and happy childhood or they just lack some sense of humor     i dont take others opinion about what i loved  so i still love this movie whatever the situation is 
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was lit an enjoyable godzilla action movie dont listen to what those idiot libtards on ripe tomatoes say this movie wasnt for them anways always go by the audience score never the ripe tomatoes score cant wait for the next one
Jun 3 2019,neutral,storyline was a little unoriginal  needed more carnage
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved it a must see
Jun 3 2019,positive,bad dialogue bad acting a bore
Jun 3 2019,positive,graphics and sound effects were awesome sad that mothra died but happy that godzilla prevailed
Jun 3 2019,positive,one of the summer event films where youre going to need to check your expectations at the door and check them real closely are you going into this movie as a fan of the 2014 gareth edwards film who appreciated the sensitive and grounded approach to the largerthanlife ideas therein if so you may be sorely disappointed by the rather uncouth and matteroffact nature of things this time around are you walking in as someone who was tremendously let down by the 2014 predecessors lack of action and kaiju combat in favor of dry character work and performances because you may have just gotten a movie that flies in the face of all that for better or worse are you somewhere betwixt these two groups enjoying the 2014 film for what it was but understanding the need for certain elements to change well you might just end up in the camp that this reviewers planted his flag within this movie is fine the action is thrilling and brilliantly rendered featuring a hefty number of moments thatll make you smile the character work is spotty at best featuring some of the more headscratchingly misguided attempts at depth ive seen in a while but youre at least given a protagonist that has more emotional drive than the 2014 film did the performances get the job done with some actors bringing a bit too much to the table than others im looking at you bradley whitford and the lore is  as always  sopping wet with imagination and creativity in short its imperfect but a worthwhile time at the cinema to be sure
Jun 3 2019,negative,hate to say this but its super boring so so action scenes best part was end battle
Jun 3 2019,positive,people watch godzilla to see the kaiju fight this movie delivers that and then some
Jun 3 2019,positive,exactly as promised 
Jun 3 2019,positive,the movie was great but i paid for 3d tickets on fandango and the show was 2 very disappointed
Jun 3 2019,positive,absolutely breathtaking movie perfect for anybody so much action and just completely enjoyable to watch 
Jun 3 2019,negative,horrible stop this franchise right now and of course fire the entire team
Jun 3 2019,positive,fantastic the visuals in this movie have certainly raised the bar there are many breathtaking moments when introducing the new kaiju and during the action sequences     the character drama is sophomoric yet still helps move the story in the right direction the classic lore of this franchise is strong here and brings an extra element of satisfaction and awe when brought to life with such masterful visual effects    warner bros is doing this property its due justice i cant wait for whats next godzilla vs kong
Jun 3 2019,positive,the critics giving this a low score have lost their minds  or their sense of fun  its fantastic  this is a movie made for godzilla fans and it delivers  the visuals are fantastic and the action almost onstop  go see this movie and long live the king 
Jun 3 2019,positive,amazing we loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,the idea of this movie is very interesting 
Jun 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monster is the big budget hollywood of every japanese godzilla movies fans ever wanted the director obviously is one of those fans too the film filled with a lot of easter eggs of the original japanese godzilla lore many critics mention the weak story especially the human side but upon watching it i dont really bother them that much because the tension that they build all the human scene is exactly the same as the original japanese movies they portraits the panic of the humans against these titans and to be honest as an audience i can 100 relate to that its like all the human in this movie panic 80 of the time because its paced quite fast the monsters just keep coming and thats good king of the monsters is a love letter to the godzilla fans no doubt this is much much better than the first godzilla thank you michael dougherty 
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome fun movie and tonnes of monsters throughout what else would you want from a godzilla  movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,i loved the monsters they way the movie was put together and how the ending showed that their could be another godzilla movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,if you are a fan of the japanese godzilla movies this movie will tickle you pink it is one giant love letter to those movies and feels like a true godzilla movie made in america there are so many references from the best godzilla movies and even shots and events basically remade from some of them you can tell mike loves godzilla and knows the movies inside and out yes the plot is convoluted and ridiculous as times but i did say it is so much like the japanese movies good and bad and for that reason feels so authentic if you are a godzilla fan you are probably going to adore this movie if youve never seen any of them or even dislike the japanese movies this probably isnt going to be your cup of tea this is for true godzilla fans first and foremost and i freaking loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,everything a godzilla fan growing up in the 90s would love to watch critics be damned i loved it
Jun 3 2019,positive,epic movie  the battles music  sounds and fx are amazing  only downside are the stuipid acting character and some logic flaws but hey its a monster movie      i dont understand what some people on the planet really expect from a movie like that  its awesome made and a lot of fan service  
Jun 3 2019,positive,ignore all the critics that say the movie was bad because its mostly monster fights they dont have a sliver of excitement in them they should stick to their soap operas instead this movie is about giant monsters dishing it out and not some boring humans talking when true fans want to see godzilla throw hands on king ghidorah if you enjoy watching a bunch of humans talk about drama for most of the movie this is not for you but if you want to see kaijus thrash and cause mayhem this is a must see
Jun 3 2019,positive,more monsters and way more godzilla
Jun 3 2019,negative,fun but mostly mindless and without emotion great action and cgi
Jun 3 2019,positive,awesome movie cant wait for godzilla vs kong
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was really good action movie the only drawback some scenes kind of theme rushed really good fight scenes
Jun 3 2019,positive,it was beyond amazing i love godzilla
Jun 3 2019,positive,the realist of the monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,such a materpiece perfect and memorable movie
Jun 3 2019,positive,explosions and monster fighting loved it the movie was also basically a giant easter egg too haha
Jun 3 2019,positive,i was on the edge of my seat the entire movie all of the monsters were done perfectly in the end i got what i wanted godzilla thrashing monsters
Jun 3 2019,positive,it is a really fun monster movie lots of growling and destruction
Jun 3 2019,negative,made a mockery of the godzilla franchise
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is how you do a monster movie you have lots of battles great special effects and blow shit up constantly i cant wait for another one
Jun 2 2019,positive,i felt like this was the best godzilla movie to date  specular cinematic graphics i will watch it a second time this time in imax
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monster gets everything right in the monster and visual department mike doughertys vision of these titans is very faithful to the originals while mixing in his own flavor to modernize these iconic kaiju as a lifelong godzilla fan i have to say the action spectacle is astounding the score by bear mccreary is thunderous and one of my favorite scores this year i would say where the movie has issues is in the storys execution and the human element the human characters are okay even though there are some strong moments there but i did not come to watch the human element take center stage in a godzilla movie godzilla rodan mothra and king ghidorah are the stars and they are executed beautifully if you are a fan of godzilla monsters or just want to go have an enjoyable and fun movie experience go see godzilla king of the monsters long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,stunning absolutely stunning
Jun 2 2019,positive,an amazing movie with amazing action an absolute mustsee for godzilla fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,a film for fans made by fans the first true godzilla film to come out of the united states
Jun 2 2019,neutral,i wasnt expecting much from this movie and i didnt get much  the monsters were great and when they were on the screen i was entertained  sadly however the humans were unimaginably stupid uninteresting their motivation was completely boneheaded and the overall script was just beyond silly  i actually managed to fall asleep halfway through the movie during a long period absent of monsters only to be woken up by godzillas roar  thats how uninteresting the human plot was
Jun 2 2019,positive,an amazing love letter to the showaheisei era of godzilla movies a great modern retelling but dont expect them to reinvent the wheel or be ultra serious this is pure entertainment still not my top godzilla movie but still this was the favorite american godzilla movie yet 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved the monster fights and mothra is so awesome 
Jun 2 2019,positive,too much action on the screen at one time story could have been better i probably need to see it again  great special effects
Jun 2 2019,positive,i enjoyed all of the easter eggs the action was good i enjoyed that they did spend 30 minutes of explaining the previous movies 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,cool monster action larded down with unlikable characters terrible performances and one of the worst scripts ive ever seen hollywood needs to stop making godzilla movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved it i saw it on thursday the first showing and i thought every was dope i really want to thank the director for giving what hardcore godzilla fans like myself this awesome movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,very exciting could be picked apart but monster scenes were great
Jun 2 2019,negative,could not se everything every monster scene was cloudy and raining
Jun 2 2019,positive,unapologetic old fashioned godzilla formula with modern pacing and effects follows the rules it lays out for itself and delivers  its saturday morning in steroids worth seeing on the big screen
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie action packed
Jun 2 2019,positive,definitely felt like i got my monies worth with this onethe action was very good
Jun 2 2019,positive,considering this is an amazing and faithful godzilla movie im not surprised the critics hated it im ok with that
Jun 2 2019,positive,some cringe worthy dialog but good kaiju punching action
Jun 2 2019,negative,monsters were very well done and its worth going to watch them battle it out the acting was pretty lame and the story was absolutely horrible
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was epic every audiences dreamed off and i dont know why the rating so low 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was awesome went with my niece and girlfriend and we all loved it the monster parts were incredible and the human parts were totally acceptable for a godzilla movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was action packed with all the original monsters that i grew up with i enjoyed the remake with some extras two thumbs up
Jun 2 2019,positive,the graphics were 5star they were unbelievable from the nuclearpowered godzilla to king ghidorah truly awesome the story line needed work for instance i liked 2014s version because the monsters did not think of humans as relevant enough to chase in 2014 if any human died it was through collateral damage and not intentional
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing godzilla truly is the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,a lot of fun awesome to see most of the og monsters worth the watch for sure
Jun 2 2019,positive,best godzilla movie plenty of action and effects
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was great the cgi and all the monster scenes were excellently created loved the development of the story line as well and more history concerning the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was filled to the brim with fanservice for people who know godzilla movies although i prefer shin godzilla over legendary godzilla this is a great movie in my opinion there are parts that will seem weird to casual audience but for godzilla fans it will bring great excitement to see them stick to some of original lore yes their are 3 headed dragons from space the use of the original themes really made it feel like a godzilla movie a worthy rematch of kings after a 15 year hiatus 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the story line for the movie dragged on a little bit at some parts but every single kajiumonster scenes in the movie was spectacular and amazing it is worth it
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved that godzilla remained the king and saved the day long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie for the family took my siblings and girlfriend and while my girlfriend was the only one who had not seen the first movie this film did a great job of getting everyone up to speed i personally loved the amount of action  fighting between the monsters and it definitely leans more towards that than the human storyline i think most fans of godzilla appreciate this all in all my favorite movie of the year so far
Jun 2 2019,negative,the movie was utter shit the cgi was bad the bullets move like slower star wars lasers the whole movie looked like it was recorded on an iphone x they used the part where everything was quiet but then suddenly something happened about 20 times the first two times it was exciting the other 18 were just bullshit the plot was stale and predictable and none of the characters were likable the movie should have been an hour and a half at most but they stretched out to two and a half hours it was wildly politically correct with three of the main characters saying that humanity should kill itself because of the climate changing all in all they took advantage of the godzilla saga to sell tickets to a movie that was worse than bad a waste of money and a waste of time
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved every second of this star packed film the fight scenes were fantastic and the script was perfectly paced long live godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the movie it delivers what most fans were expecting
Jun 2 2019,positive,love it more action
Jun 2 2019,positive,actionsoundeffectsmore monster actiondont forget end credit scene
Jun 2 2019,positive,all of the monsters and battles were spot on but some of the human parts of the plot were a bit drawn out and i hate to say it boring it was a great sequel and it doesnt happen often you have to watch the credits to the very very end no spoilers excited tho
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was cool monsters killing monster what else do you except
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is so much fun i love godzilla and 2014 but this one is so good i have been waiting and hoping it would be a good movie and it delivers some of the characters are iffy but besides that i loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was such an amazing movie all the action and interaction was just amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,great special effects nonstop action
Jun 2 2019,positive,a must see for any fan of big g  this movie gives us fans what we asked for in 2014 big compelling monster fights  what far to many critics and gareth edwards fail too understand is the human story doesnt matter  
Jun 2 2019,positive,epic childhood reborn while godzilla duked it out against king ghidorah good pacing awesome to see mothra in live action for the first time 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great monster action godzilla and friends looked and sounded amazing honestly could have gotten less of the silly humans and their bad dialogue
Jun 2 2019,positive,classic monster battle set in a mondern era  the cgi was on point but still like to seen the monsters a little clearer the plot was typical godzilla style but brought a new spin to the franchise
Jun 2 2019,positive,im a big godzilla fan so was ultimately always going to be positive of this film but it honestly floored me mike doughertys attention to detain and love of the franchise glows through this film great action and actual human characters that i cared about only issue was the film was a little too dark perfect otherwise 
Jun 2 2019,positive,my boy and i loved it best godzilla  yet
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was a great monster movie lots of drama a good enough storyline to drive the action and some real good twists along the way and some epic monsters ghidrah is amazing and rodan has lots of screen time yeah its a monster movie not a drama so some of it was silly and there were some plot holes but cmon its a godzilla movie not goodfellas highly enjoyable

Jun 2 2019,negative,worst movie ive seen so far this year
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing loved how real and viseral it felt the monsters were perfect
Jun 2 2019,positive,action packed jumped out of my seat at times
Jun 2 2019,positive,vast improvement over the 2014 film  highly recommend
Jun 2 2019,positive,definitely a must see i will be going to see this for a second time soon
Jun 2 2019,positive,i grew up on saturday morning kung fu  sciif theater this was a trip back in time in a lot of ways the monsters or kaiju look great the reference several original stories for each titan i hate them being called that instead of kaiju it has a little too much human story for my like still it got me very excite for the next movie check it out in imax to truly appreciate the kaiju sounds 3d isnt needed
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing film  so much monster fighting goodness does leave you with a few questions on certain details  but you cant over think it like most movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,good action aft story line
Jun 2 2019,positive,excellent true to the original toho sources but polished for american viewers remastered soundtracks were a smooth touch human plot is wack as always but a lot less than in any previous godzilla movies i hope the next one finds a way to top this
Jun 2 2019,positive,was what i expected and saw more of godzilla thant the last godzilla movie in 2014
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesomelots of action a must see
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved everything about this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,an awesome monster movie i would buy on dvd
Jun 2 2019,positive,slow plot more of godzilla vs monsters
Jun 2 2019,negative,so u put a bunch of talented actors in this mess u call a movie and expect it to be a little bit better than it is ha millie bobby brown did absolutely nothing and i think you were just trying to steal some of stranger things fame the monster fights were so boring and i would be nearly asleep when they would switch back to the humans not good at all hollywood 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great godzilla movie especially in imax another movie where critics hate it but everyone else loves it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,decent visuals with corny story line
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you go to godzilla king of the monsters in the spirit that was intendedbig monsters breaking stuff and each otherits a heckuva lot of fun and a great way to blow through a couple of summer hours
Jun 2 2019,positive,cant wait for the sequel
Jun 2 2019,positive,one of the best monster movies of all time if you are looking for flawless human driven stories then you clearly are in the wrong genre
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is an amazing film for godzilla fans as a lifelong godzilla fan this is the film ive waited over 20 years for many people look at the lack of a deeply human narrative as one of the downfalls for the movie but i find it to be one of the stronger points it took a more lovecraftian approach in that humans mean little in the grand scheme of things and that there are much larger forces at work which the film gladly focuses on the story for godzilla and company takes on a more animalistic approach as they fight for dominance i thought the characters in the film were enough to move the story along and get the monsters to where they needed to be and helped keep the focus on the rightful stars is the film perfect no but it gives you exactly what it advertises and thats godzilla king ghidorah mothra and rodan in a free for all fight for the ages all godzilla fans are welcome and long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,good movie my son enjoyed it
Jun 2 2019,positive,i grew up with godzilla and i really liked this new movie cant wait to see more
Jun 2 2019,negative,horrible script terrible one liners extremely campy the only reason its getting one star is for the titans that are supposed to be called kaiju i didnt see the movie for the human storyline i saw it to see monsters battle it out more monsters less humans
Jun 2 2019,positive,when the monsters are fighting i legit get chills when the humans are on screen i have to pee
Jun 2 2019,positive,wonderful story line for this movie   i think it was great and my son loved it also
Jun 2 2019,positive,exactly what youd want from a movie titled godzilla king of the monsters awesome cinematography and creature design with an amazing soundtrack 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i made an account just to talk about this    to all the people complaining about the human characters in this movie have you ever seen a single godzilla film in your entire life the kaiju are the selling point of going to see a kaiju movie and this film delivered on kaiju the fact that this is somehow the lowest rated of the american godzilla films when its quite honestly easily the best is the final nail in the coffin for review sites for me im never listening to critics again
Jun 2 2019,positive,best release so far of 2019
Jun 2 2019,negative,boring and when there was action i could barely tell what was going on
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you want a big spectacle full of kaiju action and a nice little throwback to the toho films like me this is for you yeah the story could have been a bit better but the action was overthetop and a whole lot of fun to watch the cinematography was great and the cgi is great as well 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was everything a godzilla movie should be  we want to go back and see it again soon
Jun 2 2019,positive,good movie  much like the monster movies i enjoyed as a kid  only problem was whoever set up the marketing to go along with the movie the previews were all for horror movies and certainly not appropriate for the 812 year old kids that were in the theater to enjoy the movie  bring your kid if you want i think they will enjoy it but show up late so you miss the previews
Jun 2 2019,positive,bigger action more monsters and using the original theme
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are a godzilla fan then its what you would want it to be  going to see it several times most likely
Jun 2 2019,positive,has a little bit of issues with camerawork but other than that its a fun movie if your a godzilla fan then there will be moments where you may have a fan spazzim
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing monster battles and it does a great job of setting up a new universe
Jun 2 2019,positive,i liked it a lot jus for the fact there was more monster fighting then godzilla 2014
Jun 2 2019,positive,best movie that i have seen in a while this movie was totally action packed with a good story loved it definitely a must see if tou are a godzilla fan
Jun 2 2019,positive,the humans the monsters were good
Jun 2 2019,negative,pretty lame s m h  whew  really pretty lame  by the way rotten tomatoes  i bought my 5 tickets at movie tavern denham springs la  rotten tomatoes  in all your success you have lost your way
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie got me excited for the monterverse  as a fan i am fully satisfied but it could have been a lot better to make godzilla even more the main character then he already is fun movie long live the king 
Jun 2 2019,positive,thrilling rollercoaster ride bringing out the kid in me a love letter to the fans    hearing the original toho godzilla theme song gave me the chills     enthusiastic ovation  from the audience and almost everyone sat through the credits to see the post credit scene    best since destroy all monsters 
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun movie lots of action
Jun 2 2019,positive,not bad typical zilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely fantastic
Jun 2 2019,positive,definitely a must see summer movie fight scenes were awesome i was very satisfied throughout the whole movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a godzilla fan i can this is my absolute lock for the best godzilla film ive ever seen
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it i left the theatre excited for the next godzilla movie granted the human characters plot isnt well thought out as they appear to all have very dense goldplated plot armor but if you ignore them because lets be honest youre not watching godzilla for anything but godzilla himself youll enjoy the collosal citywide action the cgi is very good and pleasing to look at
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie cant wait for godzilla vs king kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,classic godzilla for godzilla fans and my home city gets totally flattened too
Jun 2 2019,positive,an absolute monstaaaa experience    a must see for any godzilla or action fan    long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie was awesome bring back the old and making it new
Jun 2 2019,positive,enjoyed it enough to watch a second time
Jun 2 2019,negative,wanted to love this movie nearly fell asleep multiple times waaaaay too much time spent on the humans and family drama etc know your audience people want to see the giant monsters fight the human characters were annoying and slowed everything down so many talented actors playing cliche roles because hollywood thinks we need the human element make the drama come from the monsters give them the human element then well care when one of them gets hurt etc
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything  i wanted as a godzilla fan epic
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie was absolutely fantastic 
Jun 2 2019,negative,i am a huge godzilla fan and loved the last godzilla movie and skull island  but this movie is a mess
Jun 2 2019,positive,ive seen a bunch of people saying that they had a problem with the character development which i can agree with the plot of how it started was a little weak as in the no one would ever possibly do that kind of way other than that the plot was fine a lot of references to previous gojiragodzilla movies     however when i see a godzilla movie im not really concerned with the human characters or the plot  im really there to see godzilla fight other monsters the fights in my opinion were awesome loved what they did with ghidorah and mothra rodan was ok too
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie in my opinion achieved what it was supposed to do which was badass monsters fighting each other and the only part i didnt enjoy was the family drama and i really want to see what legendary will do with the series
Jun 2 2019,positive,it brought memories from growing up watching the toho movies with todays technology it was a movie worth watching again many times
Jun 2 2019,positive,critics are crazy i agree that most godzilla movies are lacking if not really bad this one is very entertaining and they even throw in a slight plot for the humans 
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of kaiju and lots of battles the story was setup to allow future movies there is an end credit scene which can also tie into future movies my entire family loved the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a monster movie its not supposed to be watch for the story nor should it have an existential merit at all a monster movie like this is supposed to be watched for how much fun it is so shut up watch the movie pull stick from your butt and have fun watching monster whoop each others  butts im sorry the studio did not have enough money to pay off the top critics so that its not getting glowing reviews if you want to watch something for the story watch amc as inthe channel
Jun 2 2019,positive,way better than the first the director and score appeared respect the past films unloke the first movie from musical queues to monster histories i enjoyed it very much as a fan who grew up watch godzilla films id recommend it
Jun 2 2019,positive,giant monsters fighting im about that immersive and over the top visuals and sounds is what i came for and what i got
Jun 2 2019,positive,go watch godzilla remind everyone why god is in his name
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie for all high action great special effects
Jun 2 2019,positive,story was suspicious but good action
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was a good godzilla versus kaiju flick i was not looking for shakespeare or dark knight level material  reality is that godzilla is an aesthetic film not a literary or character film of plot development based on human characters if anything it is the antithesis of orthodox dramas while in the film humanity is beholden before the kaijus power is social commentary its far more than social commentary  its an action movie and a fun romp on ideas other movies like avengers infinity wars traversed well before on ecological balance and ends justifying the means    critics hate the storyline for being shallow i dont disagree but i also did not pay my admission ticket to watch godzilla on oprah this was always meant to be an aesthetic movie not for traditional movie critics give it razzies if you want but its time that the movie critic community begin to realize that literary analysis is merely one facet of movie viewing in an age of blockbusters humanity does not matter as much as its creations
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monsters were cool the humans were boring as hell
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla is the king great movie

Jun 2 2019,positive,all of it was perfect nothing has to change
Jun 2 2019,positive,just need to get over the fact that storyline has more holes than swiss cheese so that you can appreciate the film for the awesome spectacle that it is 
Jun 2 2019,positive,such a good movie filled with action and good special effects 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you like monster battles and old toho movies this is the movie to watch
Jun 2 2019,negative,good lord what an absolute pile of crap they went out of their way to ruin this the human story interjected is literally beyond belief it is so godawful how in gods name do i get these two hours of my life back what a steaming pile of shi
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster movie we needed if you went to this looking for something other than colossal monsters duking it out youre wrong everyone knows godzillas only ever been about the monsters and this is no different nor should it be 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster fights were a great improvement but the think the overall story could have been better saw this movie twice and my first reaction to this movie was 1010 but after my second viewing i noticed that even though the human characters were more distinct there is to many secondary human characters that do not help progress the story and just say one liners and quips liked the world building that the movie gave us but most of that was presented as exposition during the human scenes i did like the movie and i think it is better then its predecessor from 2014
Jun 2 2019,positive,great action exactly what i expected from godzilla  humans kinda lame but i guess monsters cant just fight for 2 straight hours
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont pay attention to the tomato meter go and watch the movie if youre a fan of the godzilla movies youll absolutely love this film
Jun 2 2019,positive,got free tickets to see godzilla king of the monsters last night it was awesome my favorite godzilla movie of all time 5 out of 5 rating or 10 out of 10 depending on which rating system you use  1 godzilla king of the monsters 2019  2 kong skull island 2017  3 godzilla 2014
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic the graphics were amazing and the music was beautiful
Jun 2 2019,positive,beautiful cgi work on both godzilla and ghidora
Jun 2 2019,positive,best action and movie that is sure to get shivers up your spine would highly recommend
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre not a movie critic with either a paycheck from a competing movie company or their head up their snobby ass and you just want kaiju on kaiju action then this movie is definitely for you
Jun 2 2019,positive,thought it was going to be too much monstars in it but the movie made sense
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was an amazing movies ignore what these critics say because lets be honest they are paid talk sht about everything i loved it as and everyone has the right to like it or dislike it just dont judge the movie by what some 50 year old dudes in their basement say online check the movie out and give it your own review
Jun 2 2019,negative,most of the movie was dark and hard to see godzilla was barely in the movie
Jun 2 2019,negative,somom is an ecoterrorist responsible for the deaths of millions while her daughter buys into that too but later recantsand despite the slaughter of the human race they createwere suppose to then care what happens to that family and their safety uhhhh not likely that entire segment of the movie is horrible and ruins the entire film had they stayed on the monsters the science the conflict and a resolution it wouldve worked those parts were entertaining and riveting but the human drama was so terrible and so prevalent throughout the film that it crushed any momentum the films conflict  special effects tried to generate not very good at all 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,i was in the wrong movie at the right time stupid loud long but somehow i had fun
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie the effects are great and the action especially the fights between monsters are fantastic and last from beginning to end if you like godzilla or like a lot of action with some science fiction and filled with great cgi then this movie is for you if you want to go see a bunch of drama a deep thoughtful plot or a super emotional storyline then you should go see a different movie this is a fun summer movie that is not meant to be a shakespearean masterpiece but rather a fun filled action movies with huge monsters and a lot destruction
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was full of action and great fighting scenes
Jun 2 2019,positive,great visuals and some really great moments movie timeline is a bit sporadic and unsure how different events  transpire but the movie still gets you there to the impactful action when it matters stay until the end
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is amazing the monsters fights and the scenes of serizawa i even think that the scenes are balanced bewteen  humans and monsters one of the best movies of godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,my mom loved it and she hates movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,best monster effects ever in this type of movie acting was good but as usual the humans muck up things  it seems to set godzilla up in the end to be the bad one in godzilla v kong when they say good thing g on our side then the other says for now  also since it will be a david v goliath type it is understood kong is gonna win in the follow up movie  although i think he shouldnt and i been a kong fan for many decades
Jun 2 2019,positive,so for starters let me just say i dont know what fucking movie critics thought they went to see but ripping on this movie because it didnt focus enough on the humans is easily the dumbest criticism ive heard for a movie this year easily thats like watching the dark knight and saying they didnt focus enough on harvey dent like since the beginning the humans have never been the focus the film is called wait for itgodzilla not pacific rim not gamora not gundam wing or metal of honot fucking godzilla we came to see the king of kaiju we came to see him whoop ass and do badass roars that make us feel like little kids watching men in rubber monster suits duke it out     if you love godzilla you will love this movie if you watched him as a kid you will love this movie the most memorable mosts are here with references to the others they take story beats from the films of old with just enough of a twist that this movie really does feel like a movie made for fans     i promise you if you go see this movie and you watched the films as a kid or just got into them now you will find yourself saying this this is godzilla i wont spoil anything but just know when that big guy comes on the screen its all eyes on him the movie does everything to remind you this is his fucking movie and if you watched the old films i promise you you will smile from ear to ear when it does this is the godzilla film we american fans have been waiting for you will not be disappointed the humans do what theyre meant to do provide a break in the action and push the story forward 
Jun 2 2019,positive,first thing first this movie was an epic roller coaster it delivers in the most godzilla way it could both the music score and the references to the source material is just a bless this is how you remake a beloved franchise without the need to make it as close as the original a perfect love letter
Jun 2 2019,positive,long live the king after seeing the movie from start to finish im more eager to see a godzilla series i really like how its building up for more monster action
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was great this was a pure monster battle flick
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought it was great yes cgi but look folks just get your popcorn and drink settle in and just enjoy the movie and ac wish i saw more of the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,monsters  were fantastic
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you want a godzilla movie then this is it the plot was not confusing at all they probably couldve done with a few less human characters but this was a fun summer movie with godfrikkinzilla 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great monster flix  lots of action great special affects just a little loose on the plot
Jun 2 2019,positive,was a good movie make sure to stay after the movie for post credits 
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a long time fan this movie gave me exactly what i was hoping for absolutely loved all the monster personalities rodan reveal was amazing 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the cinematography was amazing the soundtrack is  amazing itake any screenshot of the movie can be a wallpaper
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie that is much better than previous one its bigger more tence and interesting pure fan service 
Jun 2 2019,positive,me and my 10 12 yr old daughter went to see it and both loved it the people drama was enough and at a level she could follow it but that isnt what you go see a godzilla movie for the kaiju were awesome there was no waiting half the movie to see a tiny glimpse of a monster overall it was fun and we both really enjoyed it
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun movie awesome fx
Jun 2 2019,positive,every frame a painting the production on this team really nailed the picturesque framing of each shot in this movie its masterful also they really allow you to delve into the character side of godzilla and actually recognizing him as a protecting force from the earth rather than a giant destructive creature which is really awesome as well they introduce old characters from the lore and invent some new once that dont really seem to fit there are some slow sequences and some spots that dont make a whole lot of logical sense and the human characters can only be seen as fodder but arent treated as such and get tin the way of what should be happening at times but its still a fun romp 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i liked the monsters cgi wasnt too bad i just wish it wouldve included more of the titans in the final fight
Jun 2 2019,positive,hubby and i grew up on godzilla movies this godzilla was the largest we had seen larger than the original in 1955 the movie was very good as we found ourselves rooting for godzilla to take out the bad monsters the end was cool watching the other monsters bow to king godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the movie the story made sense great action cant wait for godzilla vs kong
Jun 2 2019,negative,im not a big dumb monster movie fan but if you are youll probably enjoy this
Jun 2 2019,positive,its like an amalgamation of jurassic park  captain america the winter soldier  
Jun 2 2019,negative,just awful no plot characters are one dimensional and cgi that is too much of nothing
Jun 2 2019,positive,over all pretty good despite the human drama the fights were legit for godzilla fans and new people alike
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are searching for cgi extravaganza or a monster brawler movie this movie is one of the best a must see
Jun 2 2019,positive,while not perfect and some plot issues i had a great time watching godzilla and his fellow titans stomp across the screen  it looked amazing and as a longtime fan of the series i had a grin on my face the whole time
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie they did an absolute wonderful job long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,the storyline action everything was riveting about it definitely worth watching in 3d 
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie was good grandkids liked it a lot  i liked that it was a throwback to the original godzilla movies
Jun 2 2019,negative,absolutely horrible
Jun 2 2019,positive,an epic kaiju movie that deserves to be seen   epic fights check godzilla evolved check mothra being majestic check asian twins check curse words check godzilla is king 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you thought endgame was the movie of the year i have news for you in my opinon the movie was perfection from good acting to a decent plot in a godzilla movie which is surprising the war between the titans to the best score i have heard in years this movie has the most powerful impact points ever in a monster movie and with every hit you hear an orchestra playing  the traditional epic godzilla theme the movie is a godzilla lovers dream and is newcomers first love give it a shot if you havent seen its worth every penny
Jun 2 2019,positive,its what youd expect from a godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,negative,more like king of the turds first time i feel like requesting a refund  where to begin  the story was worse than terrible it was absolutely idiotic the direction is a catastrophe  what a disgrace to assemble such a gifted cast and have them recite so many moronic sentences through that nonsensical cgiporn fest 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i liked the fact that it was a classic godzilla movie and it seemed like they took to heart some of the complaints about the last movie from this group humans did have a tiny part in the outcome of the battle thanks for throwing us humans a bone if youre a godzilla fan its a real treat if youre not a fan at least there are some good action scenes if you dont like giant monsters or action at least you got out of the house
Jun 2 2019,positive,might be close to perfect  it looks glorious and has great monster designs  many many nostalgiagasms    the human plotline is a decent family story the family which is the human protag is torn about how to deal with the monsters  the human characters act according to their skill sets and given information which is a huge plus to me  there are 2 major exposition dumbs but they are better thrown into the plot than in a lot of movies  the japanese side characters act borderline stereotypical which is done well as it feels like honoring the source to me    the kaiju plotline is easy to figure out for anybody who is into godzilla it is a godzilla vs king gidorah with a lot of side monsters from the godzilla franchise and legendaries monsterverse
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie was pretty good holds true to the godzilla feel the human story was kinda meh but i didnt go for that i went to see titans fight which the movie nails honestly excited to see whats next
Jun 2 2019,positive,visually appealing but lacks the achievements of its predecessor godzilla 2014 made the giant monsters scary again and followed a cast that made an interesting story king of monsters unfortunately doesnt tell a compelling story and the screen time is divided by the spectacular looking titans and the overcrowded cast the plot is dumb the characters are cliche and the world is largely unbelievable even if you can suspend belief for the titans at least the monster fights were kind of neat
Jun 2 2019,positive,acting was bad poor story linetied into saving the environment movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun movie from a long time zilla fan its make believe folks just so you know
Jun 2 2019,positive,if your are into the godzilla universe this movie will not fall short  giid plot line to go with the battles
Jun 2 2019,positive,very good hightech american version of the godzilla universe made by fans for fans but still accessible for newbies better than godzilla 2014 not quite as good as kong of skull island my only big complaint is  not enough mothra she has her own film series in japan and a legion of fans that are more mothra fans than godzilla fans it seems unlikely but i hope mothra gets a standalone movie in this series as for this film kotm dont listen to the critics who say there isnt enough of a human story there is a very surprising human story with a twist i was not expecting there are some unexpected deaths i dont know how they could have crammed more human story into this without compromising it which i think did happen in the 2014 godzilla also godzilla is the main character not the humans that might not be to everyones taste but that is the way most godzilla movies are structured godzilla is the superhero at the center of the story and the humans are the ancillary normal characters someone who complains that the humans were not primary to the story is missing the point godzilla is the protagonist the idea that this is a superhero series with a giant atomic dinosaur as the superhero is pretty easy for me to digest having grown up with these films but i can understand why it might be tough for newcomers to swallow i think kids understand instinctively though some godzilla movies are pretty heavy and serious most of them are kids movies and family films i would consider kotm a kids movie that older audiences can also enjoy and thats ok by me
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was a rough and long 2 hours
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought it was fantastic  the best big monster combat movie ever made  decent plot amazing epic monster sequences  ive been waiting 44 years since terror of mechagodzilla for a movie to properly show godzilla as the glorious badass hes always been
Jun 2 2019,positive,fantastic for anyone who is a fan of classic godzilla and for people who want to see a good old monster brawl king ghidorah still remains godzillas greatest foe
Jun 2 2019,positive,great fun your inner child will thank you go see this movie on the biggest screen you can find
Jun 2 2019,negative,without a doubt worst movie ive seen in at least a decade plot what plot characters not one that was even remotely sympathetic  okay godzilla had some pluses how do you try to make a maniacal genocidal so called mother a heroine after destroying half the earth you dont special effects this is 2019 the first godzilla movie i ever saw circa 1960s had better effects  okay thats an exaggeration but really 
Jun 2 2019,negative,boring completely devoid of any semblance of a decent storyline characters should have died multiple times over ending is anticlimactic and predictable 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monsters looked cool storyline dragged a bit
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought it was overall a very good movie though sometimes it was spinning too many plates as far as story is concerned 
Jun 2 2019,positive,my folks and i went to see this and loved it anyone that has every seen the original movies from japan will love this because it does have bits and pieces from those movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,pretty good godzilla movie   bringing 4 of the most iconic godzilla monster on screen with modern visuals and technology a giant spectacle with beautiful use of the color pallet almost every time a monster was on screen    unfortunately the human parts drag this movie down a little with the exception of ken watanabe and charles dance almost all the human actors felt flat and boring most human scenes mostly felt like fillerbuffer time until the next monster fight if one of the monsters accidentally stepped on all of them near the end no tears would be shed     but at least it isnt nearly as bad as the last movie from 2014 where the most common answer to the question should i watch godzilla 2014 was just watch the last 10 minutes on youtube
Jun 2 2019,positive,who cares about plot the monster fights were all awesome and thats all i care about   big epic fights i bounced in my seat
Jun 2 2019,positive,im speechless im positive to me it will be the only movie i will love till the next one comes out
Jun 2 2019,positive,it may be that the movie makers tried to put too much monster special effects in show  it would have been appreciated if the film was sharper
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is why we go to a godzilla film
Jun 2 2019,negative,absolute garbage good cinematics and graphics the rest is horrible dialogue everything out of bradley whitfords mouth is retarded cliche lines bad attempts at humor countdowns bad scenes with the cast persistent just in the nick of time moments and a complete lack of technological understanding i feel bad for the graphics company audiences give great reviews to anything visually stunning but dont trust them this movie is terrible
Jun 2 2019,negative,terrible mess of a movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,most exciting one yet
Jun 2 2019,positive,im a life long godzilla fan best godzilla movie due to cgi highly recommend to take family to watch enjoy the action and dont pay attention to movie critic be your own critic and watch it for yourself long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,epic godzilla movie  buy an imax or 3d theatre ticket and enjoy this unique experience full of big monsters fighting all over thd world
Jun 2 2019,neutral,the special effects were outstanding but the overall plot seemed a little weakand i found myself really not caring about any of the main characters i didnt love it but didnt hate it
Jun 2 2019,positive,story was trash but you dont see movies like this for shakespeare its all about the kaiju fights and godzilla vs king ghidora delivered
Jun 2 2019,positive,sequel takes place five years after the events of godzilla 2014 with godzilla keeping a low profile and being monitored diligently by the monarch organization other creatures or titans have been discovered across the globe and the military wants them all destroyed while monarch believes they represent a balance in nature ecoterrorist colonel alan jonah charles dance feels the titans should all be freed to restore that balance and plans to steal the orcaa device capable of communicating with and possibly controlling the monstersto accomplish this he kidnaps orca creator dr emma russell verga farmiga her daughter madison millie bobby brown and her invention and thus sends monarch and emmas estranged husband dr mark russell kyle chandler in hot pursuit but jonah gets more than he bargained for when he uses it to release the threeheaded space monster ghidorah from his icy prison and the beast challenges godzilla for the title of king of the monsters add in the queen of the monsters mothra and the fire demon rodan and earth soon becomes a monster sized war zone    trick r treat director michael dougherty takes over from gareth edwards and seems to have a far better grasp of the material he also does script duties along with zach shields from a story by they and max borenstein what we get is far closer to a toho godzilla film than the 2014 flick and one that is a lot more fun sure the plot is a bit goofy but no goofier than an alien race building a robot godzilla or a creature created completely from pollution its filled not only with tons of fun references to godzilla flicks of the past but we get all the traditional story elements like devious villains stalwart scientists brave military types and a smarter than the adults kid not only are all the tropes proudly paraded out for those familiar with the series but it has some of the most spectacular monster battles ever presented as godzilla ghidorah rodan and mothra all converge to duke it out and destroy everything in their paths the final showdown in the city of boston is absolutely amazing and yankee fans might even get a giggle over godzilla and ghidorah throwing down in the middle of fenway park its also a true popcorn blockbuster so even those not too familiar with the big g and his 65 year history can still enjoy the flick on a purely entertainment spectacle level and monstrously entertaining it is not to mention the films final image is something every godzilla fan has wanted to see from day one on a technical level the spfx are amazing the monsters are truly titanic and majestic and their destruction is on a totally massive scale the score by bear mccreary is far more fitting than alexandre desplats hohum score for zilla 2014 and delightfully mixes in some of akira ifukubes classic godzilla themes to add a nice touch of nostalgia to the film    the cast are good and all of them get the material they play it seriouslybut not too seriously leads farminga chandler brown and dance all do well in essaying their roles vera farming as the scientist with a personal reason to get involved is solid and helps us understand her decisions even when they are the wrong ones chandler is fun as the father and husband trying to get his estranged family back hes a good lead and his old fashioned character fits this kind of movie well charles dance is impeccable as ever as the villainous alan jonah who like thanos thinks he is doing the right thing by trying to unleash these creatures millie bobby brown is especially endearing as madison and in many ways is the emotional center of the flick the supporting cast are all good too especially ken watanabe returning as dr ishirō serizawa and zhang ziyi playing dr ilene chen a character who pays tribute to a familiar mothra trope in a very fun and clever way a good cast that even give some very corny dialogue a little dramatic weight    overall this was a really fun and action packed sequel to a film widely criticized for skimping on the monster action it has monster battles to spare but still gives us some people time along with a very tohoesque storyline michael dougherty keeps the 132 minute flick moving very fast and pays loving tribute to the classic godzilla flicks in some fun and very clever ways stay through the credits for not only an end credits scene but for some amusing interwoven news items that echo what is to come a gargantuan blast of a good time    monsterzero nj
Jun 2 2019,positive,its really goood to see all the titans godzilla is a king  cant wait for the next one godzilla vs kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,another movie where the critics are of of their damn minds this here is a film that got a monster movie right in a very long time the main monsters all got a good amount of screen time and our big blue lizard did his job and looked awesome being the king dont listen to the critics go check the movie out
Jun 2 2019,positive,thank you to rt for letting this second class citizen post an unverified review i didnt buy a ticket via fandango some am one of the unwashed reviewers a monster movie doesnt need much of a plot or character arcs or hidden and deep meaning it just has to have cool monsters good cgi good looking babes some skin lots of shooting war stuff and a nice score  other than no skin the movie succeeded on all fronts   
Jun 2 2019,negative,dont waste your time or money the most moronic movie ive seen in years
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie for godzilla fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,omg one of the best movies i have ever seen while the human story was slightly lacking the monster fights and everything were amazing there were so many homages to godzilla like the oxygen destroyed the name monster zero burning godzilla and that ending scene that shows that godzilla is king of the monsters is just amazing 
Jun 2 2019,positive,would totally watch it again only problem was that there was a couple of kids talking during the movie but best movie and everyone that works there is great thanks
Jun 2 2019,positive,3 star review godzilla returns with a roar after laying dormant for 5 years when the mighty ghidorah is awakened by a group of eco terrorists hoping to bring balance to life on earth things go awry when they discover however that ghidorah never was a part of that ancient world where monsters ruled and kept the peace and thus implicate a far larger universe is out there than previously anticipated  while the film lacks in original storytelling i dont think anyone is honestly walking into this film wondering what new story will be shown on screen the real treat in a movie like this is seeing the kaiju engaging in largescale fights with one another while wreaking havoc and destruction the world over thankfully there is enough of a plot to keep a story alive and give the film an end as opposed to last weeks brightburn  for those who are familiar with the godzilla movies of old seeing ghidorah rodan and mothra come alive with modern visual effects is a special treat to behold on the big screen its not often we get to see so many famous monsters all at once with such great effects the primary protagonist here however is the titular hero godzilla who must fight off ghidorah and help restore order and balance to a planet plagued with deforestation over population high extinction rates and pollution   the film takes a giant leap forward in continuing the story of how these ancient leviathans have come alive once again what their purpose is and also tease where its all going in future installments of this series the movie is good with a decent enough plot to move the story forward towards the 4th chapter coming up where king kong will finally face godzilla 
Jun 2 2019,negative,im telling ya i would have paid someone to not make me watch it    couldnt leave kids at the theater because it was raining

Jun 2 2019,positive,whats wrong with rotten tomatoes this is perfect for longtime godzilla fans 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i went into this movie with low expectations having seen the previous ones was pleasantly suprised by a decent story amazing visuals special fx and sound they really upped the production budget for this one and you could tell would recommend seeing it on a big screen and loud its a godzilla movie but was much much better than  i expected 
Jun 2 2019,positive,honestly for me this is better than the 2014 movie great dialogue and plot although weird character development especially with the mother the main problem i had with it is that godzilla died in the beginning but how did he escape to atlantis where he regenerated he couldnt have gotten there if he died and had a flatline he couldnt just come back alive again like that    another problem was the fact that at the end none of them were affected by the radiation of godzilla in boston even though the radiation detector was on high levels they still werent affected and managed to survive i think they just breezes through it with no effort to that it shouldve gotten them at least poisoned with that much radiation in godzilla steadily increasing over the 12 minutes    the action was good however i really enjoyed the scenes plot thickening slightly and everything else in the movie 8410 would watch again
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it  the kaiju action is top notch
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie my son was jumping in his seat
Jun 2 2019,positive,the action and effects of this movie were crazy good i constantly found myself in awe as a new monster made its way into the movie so for those that are looking for some toptier effects and action this movie is the one for you    but the subplot about the now brokenish family still mourning the death of andrew took away from the experience a little    i kind of wish that they didnt have the human family part of the movie no one is seeing a movie titled godzilla king of the monsters to watch a broken family slowly come back together but for some reason i did still appreciate having breaks from the intense onscreen battles    
Jun 2 2019,positive,just as good as the first godzilla 2014 ive seen it twice so far and i really enjoyed both viewings
Jun 2 2019,positive,excellent chapter in the godzilla series
Jun 2 2019,positive,so awesome so dumb as long as you dont think and just enjoy it awesome dont think about things youll ruin it
Jun 2 2019,positive,minor spoiler alert whether or not you think this movie is good or bad will depend on what you expected out of it and with the godzilla franchise having taken so many forms in the past the audience today is bound to be divided over expectations having started as a statement about nuclear weapons throughout the years godzilla has been shaped into many things including monsterthemed wrestling movies horror movies cheap adventure movies etc one time he used to be the star in a kids animated tv show in which he well his son actually went on adventures with a group of teens around the world in order to keep the earth safe from other monsters my point is godzilla has been many things and so fans will be expecting different things out of this movie    those who wanted a complex narrative similar to cloverfield will be disappointed but for those that want a modernlooking monsterthemed wrestling movie this flick is sure to satisfy it has plenty of references to the old toho godzilla including his signature roar and theme song even the origins or king ghidorah stay true to the classic films human characters do still take up a lot of screentime however id say the split between monsters and people was 5050 the monster scenes were fantastic and the human scenes serve to keep us informed on what is happening at times when the monsters cant    one negative i would throw in however is that ghidorah didnt seem nasty enough he was powerful alright but evil im not sure he sure could pull of some nastylooking faces but though he intended on destroying the earth he didnt really seem very evil
Jun 2 2019,positive,great special effectshowever shallow plot that does not develop major characters fully
Jun 2 2019,positive,wasnt woke enough though needs more sassy black lesbian characters and trans kaiju also f drumpf
Jun 2 2019,positive,critics dont know what they are talking about godzilla rocks
Jun 2 2019,positive,the critics were wrong i dont know what they were expecting from a godzilla movie but it was great
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie was great they where alot of nods to the older toho films great kaiju action and alot of anticipation builders for the next movie i feel any bad review for this movie just doesnt grasp what joy people get from the cheesy creature feature type movies a lot of movies have fallen to these negative reviews that audiences seemly have very praise for and say they had a great time watching iy movies that can go under that catagory include pacific rim and rampage both of which got mixed reviews but i cant really say ive met anyone that say negative things towards the movie one of the funniest negative things i see is about how they have the fast camera change sequences that took away from the monster fight i felt the same way about the final war scene in avengers end game yet i dont think they where much backlash for that scene when i personally had tons of issues figuring out what was going on 
Jun 2 2019,positive,wow the best movie i seen i a long time it matched my child memories of the great story line please keep it coming
Jun 2 2019,positive,epic battles great ending
Jun 2 2019,positive,good tht they stuck to the original story
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun time for me my 11 year old son and his buddy 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great action through out nothing but great nostalgia and promises of this becoming a great movie franchise 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the action scenes were great and there was plenty of it too  the power up godzilla got to become burning was awesome the ending made you remember that godzilla is the king of monsters  also its nice that they remember king ghidorah being an alien a nod to his origin in godzilla v gigan  the plot is pretty mediocre  it kinda revolves around the idea of balancing the earth by wiping it out and rebuilding it  it worked for marvels infinity war and endgame but the way its portrayed in this movie by vera farmigas character and the eco terrorists just doesnt quite fit  overall a great movie just the plot can be a little boring at times
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome monster scenes rodan and fire godzilla the best
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie lots of action
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie it brought me back to my childhood watching godzilla kicking monster butt 
Jun 2 2019,positive,action with a little twist to it
Jun 2 2019,positive,i like that this movie have plenty of action and a variety of different monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was good good storyline and very good special effects 
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely loved it action from start to finish if you are a fan and grew up watching godzilla movies you will not be disappointed
Jun 2 2019,positive,an absolute rollercoaster of giant titans throwing down in epic battles with cities crumbling into pieces pretty much the visual spectacle youre hoping for when you go to see a godzilla movie plenty of action and less talky then the last one
Jun 2 2019,positive,i grew up seeing all of the godzilla movies and this one was a joy to see  i did think the plot of having so many monsters throughout the world was a bit much but the fighting scenes between the main monsters was good to see  looking forward to next years godzilla vs kong  bought my ticket at a regal theater as a walkin
Jun 2 2019,positive,a true monster and kaiju movie for all to see and absolutely spectacular work at that the cinematography works wonderfully in tandem with the score by bear mccreary that will make you sit on the edge of your seat   the true negatives are the humans which not only sap out some of the monster fun with cutaway edits but also add no narrative or emotional weight and merely serve as expository items for godzilla and his enemies to bash each other thematically though i am fine that the humans are merely expository as it helps cement the fact that godzilla and the titans are just that more important and the humans insignificant even if the main point of the movie is a giant monster fight at the end its nice to notice the team behind king of the monsters set out to please godzilla fans from the whole spectrum   the cgi is also the best i have ever seen possibly better than endgames not a slight against marvel but the special effects here are truly magnificent to see    
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it just are a godzilla fan or like seeing monster fights 
Jun 2 2019,negative,when serving its true potential it is all fans could want a spectacle of titand battling to rule the earth but when it isnt its too busy spending time on characters that are hard to care for
Jun 2 2019,positive,finally a godzilla movie with all the other monsters they did godzilla justice in this one
Jun 2 2019,positive,the writing for the human part of the story was not the best but i dont come to godzilla for the human characters i come to see godzilla they got his character right yes godzilla has a character the fights were amazing cant wait for kong v godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome  good campy fun taking me back to theold days watching godzilla at home as a little kid  
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the fight scenes alot better than 2014 human story line could have been better but then it wouldnt be a godzilla film if there wasnt a great human story line loved it all the same cant wait to see the fight between kong and big g
Jun 2 2019,positive,screw the critics if you like the godzilla cannon youll love this movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,best non japanese godzilla movie dont let those pseudo critics get on your head this is a great kaiju movie if you love godzilla you may want to see monster fights all the movie you will have it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,just going to be blunt this movie kickass godzilla and the monsters are the stars of the movie not the people thats why its called godzilla the more monster time the better the movie i suggest anyone want to see a high action movie to go see godzilla king of monsters hardly any down time
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics and please check this movie out for yourself 
Jun 2 2019,positive,much better than the last godzilla movie action packed reminiscent of the oldschool but just better graphics wise not a complicated story loved the kong references was just fun
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of action if youre looking for a great weekend movie this is a must see love it
Jun 2 2019,positive,its really hard to go wrong with a godzilla movie this was a really good godzilla movie at that proper godzilla and everything
Jun 2 2019,negative,want to say i am a huge godzilla fan i have seen every movie ever made with that said this movie is awful and the reason being is due to the focus on the human element they continue to think they need to have a side story about individuals with some boring family dynamic to add drama it is completely not necessary also i feel it is important to note that the special effects were extremely lacking and the new imagined monsters was a complete waste spoiler this also set up to the long awaited king kong vs godzilla unfortunately what will more than likely happen is a team up to fight off a mecha king ghidora at this point they should just stop making these movies all together they dont understand what the fans want and are more focused on ways to broaden stories to appease to all crowds and have completely fallen flat fire your staff and start over 
Jun 2 2019,positive,giant monsters doing battle what more do you need 
Jun 2 2019,positive,very action packed the movie was really great overallonly a few things seemed to be missed by the what should have happened people not being blown back by extreme wind gusts blasts etcthis did not happen every time though make sure to stay until after the credits
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie if you listen to critics youll be watching roma everyday for the rest of your life 
Jun 2 2019,positive,what an awesome kaiju movie it was so much fun for me and my entire family 
Jun 2 2019,positive,while godzilla 2014 felt like a visual game of keep away with the monstet fights king of the monsters delivers by setting up amazing fights and beautiful effects the human element works fine to get us to the fights which the point of a godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,the critics can blow it out their bums this is an awesome monster movie that is a love letter to kaiju fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,i am 9 years old and i enjoyed it
Jun 2 2019,negative,its ok if you like watching fight after fight bad story too disjointed
Jun 2 2019,positive,we want to see godzilla fighting monsters not following people that are uninteresting especially during the fight scenes fight scenes are great but too far in between cut like 2030 minutes and this wouldve been a better movie worth the watch on imax to see the scale of monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,tremendous special effects stellar all star monster this movie is for people who enjoy grand scale action or if you are like me singing the mothra theme out loud while the big ol monster fights in the words of dr serizawa let them fight
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing it was more of the monsters this time i like it
Jun 2 2019,positive,good movie well acted story was something you must pay attention to the whole movie or youll get lost has a interesting point about how we are destroying each other and out planet as well nice touch wont say to much so i dont mess up the plot for those who havent seen it great for a matinee with the family not a date night movie unless both are into these type films but definitely a film for the family
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are looking for an oscar contender youre in the wrong place if youre a fan of the series andor giant monster movies in general youll love it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,fight scenes imagery story and the films score were all extraordinary
Jun 2 2019,positive,finally a action packed godzilla movie exactly how it should be enjoyed it
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla delivered on exactly what fans wanted massive monster mash if you need excessive human drama there are plenty of those movies out there go watch those for drama let us just enjoy the sublime awesomeness that is godzilla and ghidorah leveling a city
Jun 2 2019,negative,incredibly disappointing  minimal action broken up by countless cliche cut scenes  about 45 min too long cut out all the useless parts and ad a worthy battle scene and it would get to 3 stars 
Jun 2 2019,positive,incredible everything you want out of a true godzilla movie its not about the acting or dialogue the actors are simple there to put a scale of the monsters to a human perspective and thats the way every great toho movie has done it
Jun 2 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i am a huge godzilla fan and always loved the japanese versions this movie to me finally brought the lore and feel of the japanese godzilla to the us this movie was the us version of destroy all monsters i look forward to godzilla vs king kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,no 5 stars only cause there was no king kong 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the visual effects were stunning and the monster clashes were epic but they were accompanied with an illconceived plot as with every godzilla film the human characters were under developed or had cliched motivations and their interactions with the monsters were driven by a literal plot device much like avengers age of ultron this film was an excuse to set up future sequels considering the fact there are more monsters out there but i was entertained nevertheless and i would recommend it to an audience who enjoys godzilla films
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie and special effects were goodbut the theatre was freezing cold the whole movie please address this issue
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome special effects great plot this movie gave me goosebumps godzilla is truly king of the monsters in this movie loved it
Jun 2 2019,negative,it really suckedi stayed for the monstersbut was really disappointed i could not empathize with the characters and the plot made little sense
Jun 2 2019,positive,nothing to disliked enjoyed every minute true godzilla fan will be on their feet clapping awesome movie
Jun 2 2019,negative,thank your for ruining my hopes of another good godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,pretty cool muy genial
Jun 2 2019,positive,ok plot good graphics and awesome fights 
Jun 2 2019,positive,shocker that critics dont get a movie about monsters fighting if you like monsters fighting this is your movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it   some parts unrealistic but its a movie   good time for sure   want to see again 
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing effects overall great time
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are godzilla fan you will love this film you will defiantly notice all of the reference and little things that in the movie king ghidoras heads all have different personalities mothra and godzilla have a very interesting relationship if you are not a godzilla fan the action really grabs you and takes you for a ride until the very end the human elements of the film have very good and interesting characters but dont expect the humans to be the center of the story they are there and trying to make sense of the world this is very much an action packed monster film enjoy
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie amazing score and most amazing visuals of all time
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is a movie for the godzilla fans superb monster scenes while bringing back the classic original godzilla theme songs i would like to personally thank all of the creators especially michael dougherty for the passion put into this project it just oozes with love for this property it felt as if i was watching a toho japanese godzilla film and in my opinion this is one of the top films in the franchise i would encourage anyone who loved godzilla movies as a child or just for the fun of it to check this one out with your family and friends bring on kong vs godzilla  long live the king 
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla 2 is a huge kaiju spectacle you dont want to miss although some of the plot is bland the movie is made up with fan service kaiju action and amazing cgi
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything i wanted it to be since i was a child growing up watching the old godzilla movies i could never imagine godzilla at this level a must see for all godzilla fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,do you want big cool monsters destroying buildings its awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,5  not to say i loved every minute but just to say how great of an improvement this godzilla movie was over the last i mean just to see the big climatic moments unfold allowed me to relish in my childhood fantasies of seeing larger than life monsters duke it out gave me chills and i cant wait for future installments mcu step aside theres a bigger cinematic universe on the horizon
Jun 2 2019,positive,go for the godzilla action its a movieenjoy it  we will go again loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla the king 
Jun 2 2019,negative,lame acting all round 70 of storyline abt main human characters godzilla and company just afterthoughts very disappointed
Jun 2 2019,positive,visually stunning but i wouldve preferred more monsters and less humans
Jun 2 2019,positive,a dramatic improvement over the original
Jun 2 2019,positive,big epic and lots of payoffs for godzilla fans the story works and the humans actually drive the plot 
Jun 2 2019,negative,great effect crappy story line stupid really 
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie great action
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan  this movie is a must see
Jun 2 2019,positive,felt like a kid again watching this movie the titans were beautifully designed and the fight scenes were awesome if youre going to see this movie for the human plot youre going for the wrong reasons
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie its no masterpiece but it has no reason to be its beautifully shot the cgi is impressive and believable the human parts are pretty garbage but i still felt for millie bobby browns character and enjoyed them all well enough its an epic and fun installation in a franchise that deserves one
Jun 2 2019,positive,i disliked the human characters i didnt care if they lived or died
Jun 2 2019,positive,enjoyed the film not enough mothra not enough rodan too much human drama
Jun 2 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this film the vfx and action was on point and though it certainly wasnt shakespeare it was quite good and spent time on the environmental and dangers of progress the acting was good and delivered the emotional weight very well
Jun 2 2019,positive,great addition to the series
Jun 2 2019,positive,an action packed adrenaline rush the entire way through with an interesting human plot taking second place to the monster fights its what fans have been dreaming of for years 
Jun 2 2019,positive,was pretty good the monsters looked pretty amazing acting was up and down in some parts overall a good movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you want to see an epic monster movie its what it is if you go to a monster movie for a thick and deep plot youre missing the point of a monster movie most beautiful monsters ive ever seen on screen fantastic effects and pacing the monster plot of the movie was straight to the point and worked the human part of the story keeps the universes and other movies connected and flowing the personal plot was fine but a bit more complicated than it needed to be fantastic movie watch it pay for it i want more of them please from a monster movie lover 
Jun 2 2019,positive,my god this movie is amazing xd best monster movie ever made my jaw dropped so many times 
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it want to see it again
Jun 2 2019,negative,its a total mehss
Jun 2 2019,positive,what can i say its a monster movie you gotta watch it like that knowing its dense with monster action monster story and scifi science its a great movie to spend to watching it and for sure going to watch it again and again    dont listen to the critics 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic i loved the part when godzilla was awoken again lots of action and even the dialogue was very interesting sound effects were great id recommend this to all my friend
Jun 2 2019,positive,i love godzilla but the story on this one was iffy
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved it  i grew up on godzilla movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,as an avid godzilla fan this is exactly what i wanted from a modern godzilla film this movie hit on all of the marks that made the older godzilla films so enjoyable to me if you want to see a fun monster film with thrilling action great cgi decent human side story and a focus on the monsters as every godzilla film should do then dont listen to the critics and go and see this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,a solid follow up to 2014s godzilla this sequel delivers in an overall good summer movie and a lot of fanfare for those godzilla fans out there the references to the previous film series for godzilla is numerous all the way down to the theme yes its a twist on the toho classic 90s godzilla theme the overarcing story is unique in that it combines whats already been laid out the idea of hollow earth theory and that godzilla is an apex predator with introductions of new characters and creatures into the series and the larger idea of what their place is in the world the introduction of several new creatures doesnt feel forced thanks to the implications of kongskull that there could be several as yet undiscovered creatures the casting was done well although as with some movies the family drama felt a little forced a family destroyed by events of the past and the hope of reunification is a trope referred to by many movies in a world where divorce with children involved in somewhat common this movie falls into the same hole but the strong acting makes it bareable unlike the last godzilla movie the family drama did not feel as though it eclipsed the headlining monster instead the monsters take center stage while humans struggle to adapt to the clash of the titans as a long time godzilla fan i deeply enjoyed the film and will likely go see it again 
Jun 2 2019,positive,better than john wick 3 but still misses the mark however i thoroughly enjoyed myself but felt i wasnt so much pandered to as i was lead by the hand really wish they had a director with vision sigh
Jun 2 2019,positive,huge fan of godzilla was my favorite as a kid will always love the movies
Jun 2 2019,negative,yet again hollywood proves it can produce nonstop action without a grain of tension why do i keep falling for it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a little slow to start and not real engaging
Jun 2 2019,positive,really good crittics got it wrong this is by far the best movie and shild be ranked very high 
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it legendary has done a great job with tohos creatures
Jun 2 2019,positive,ken watanabe is a treasure
Jun 2 2019,positive,i had so much fun in this movie  i loved it    i am a geeky long time godzilla fan  ive seen all the old movies and this one is absolutely the best  its everything godzilla fans have wanted since 1998  even if you arent a hard core godzilla fan its a fun movie  but if you are a godzilla fan  this is an absolute must  it has so many easter eggs from previous films and is a nostalgic ride  great job
Jun 2 2019,negative,decent special effects but overall a mess of a movie lack of story and a bad script make this very disa
Jun 2 2019,positive,i went with my husband who is a huge godzilla fan he has all the movies on dvd  bluray and he dragged me along to shin godzilla i am not a fan of godzilla but my husband didnt want to go alone i have to say i was very entertained the human story was easy to understand and the monster fights were not over the top or highly unbelievable i gave this movie a 5 star rating this coming from a person who isnt a fan of godzilla i dont know what the critics are going on about with it being rotten clearly some divide between movie goers and critics 
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome monster parts draggy human parts
Jun 2 2019,positive,i actually liked it 
Jun 2 2019,negative,nothing new from the old movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,action packed non stop
Jun 2 2019,positive,all the monsters i love rooting for the big guy
Jun 2 2019,positive,a lot of nods to the toho movies i would have liked to see some of the other monsters in action though
Jun 2 2019,positive,a perfect godzilla checks every box and then sprays it with radioactive fire breath just for good measure 
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome non stop action visually striking scifi
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved  the integration of all the back in the day monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,monsters fighting monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,definitely been a godzilla fan for years and to see the other legendary monsters had me in awww
Jun 2 2019,positive,the human characters were a little annoying but the monsters were awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,nonstop kaiju action and a treat for those  that have known godzilla for a long time  
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie not to be missed
Jun 2 2019,positive,the film was action packed and while you have to be open to this type of adventure if you are all in you will have fun watching this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,hell yes  best version of the godzilla movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it great movie if ur a godzilla fan
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you enjoyed the first movie youll be more than satisfied with this one very action packed
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of fun for kaiju fans superior to the 2014 version a few human characters return and infinitely better than the 1998 silliness note that a lot of the movie is lit pretty dimly it really needs to be seen on the biggest brightest screen possible
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun  not likely for oscar consideration but fun
Jun 2 2019,positive,critics240 people for 40100 audiences16000 people for 87100 after using some simple math and common sense go see the movie because it is epic
Jun 2 2019,positive,better than i expected
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is an absolute blast of a movie with it being nowhere near as bad as the critics are making it out to be while the human characters and the story may not be the best they arent anywhere near the level of that of a michael bay movie with actors that are actually good at their job despite there being very little character development whatsoever and a plot that actually makes sense while the story may not be shakespeare it isnt the absolute garbage that the critics are making it out to be besides that the monsters and fights are some of the best ever put to cinema with cgi that is on the level of jurassic park and cinematography that makes you feel the epic scale of these fights and how powerful these monsters are which get a lot more screen time in this movie than before the mocap in this film also helps bring these monsters to life giving godzilla mothra rodan and each of king ghidorahs heads theyre own personality as well as making them more expressive than before and helps makes their fights far more engaging as a result so if youre a fan of the giant monster genre andor want to see some impressive scenes of action and fighting then this is the movie for you just ignore all the negativity that the critics are giving and make your own decisions on whether this is an entertaining flick or a complete snore
Jun 2 2019,positive,i wasnt expecting much after reading reviews however i was pleasantly surprised  i enjoyed it better than the last  so many monster fights  i can honestly say that im looking forward to the next one
Jun 2 2019,positive,i went in wanting and expecting nothing more than a great monster fight while the story and human aspects were mediocre the titans and battles were very well done
Jun 2 2019,positive,not sure why people are complaining the monster fights were good there was a good human story and a ton of easter eggs for godzilla fans dont listen to the professionals they dont get it at all this is a fun film made with fans in mind
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved it and leading it up to kong vs godzilla that will be amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing movie loved it great that the monsters were the focus and great recreation of these well known characters
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is the sequel to 2014s american relaunch and the biggest complaint i had with that other film was how frustratingly coy it was with showing godzilla i wanted more godzilla in my godzilla movie and king of the monsters at least understands this need and supplies many of the most famous kaiju in the franchise like mothra rodan and the threeheaded king ghidorah the human drama is just as boring with characters i have a hard time caring about vera farmiga plays a scientist who lost a child during the 2014 monster brawl in san francisco she develops a sonar device to communicate and domesticate the giant monsters now totaling 17 plus she and her teen daughter millie bobby brown are kidnapped by eco terrorists that want to destroy the world and leave it back to the ancient monsters its a bit jumbled i felt more for a monster than i did any living person the plot does just enough to fill in time between the monster battles which can be fun but are also lacking a few key items firstly the sense of scale is lost thats one thing the 2014 film had in spades the humansized perspective of how enormous these beasts are also the fight scenes are shot in pretty dark environments that can make things harder to watch there is a simple pleasure watching two giant monsters duke it out on screen and king of the monsters has enough of these to satisfy its still a flawed monster mash but at least it sheathes the itch it was designed for and if youre a godzilla fan and feeling generous that might be enough to justify a matinee with a few of your favorite fiftystory pals    nates grade b
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie had it all including the kong setup
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie went above and beyond the critics just want to feel super important and relevant we are talking about the same people who gave black panther a 97 based on race look at audience scores pick for yourself
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything i wanted in a godzilla movie see it and be amazed
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters rocked totally loved the movie especially all the easter egg references back to the togo movies stay for the credits and go see it on the biggest screen you can
Jun 2 2019,negative,this movie is literally over used and trash
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie good for old fans and new fans alike  my eight year old son absolutely loved the monsters and millie bobby brown drew in my teenage girls if you can believe that and we all enjoyed the movie as an entire family  i was shocked when my wife in a kaiju movie of all things said she liked the story she is a scifi fan but not a big monster movie fan in general  in todays scifi cinema i see an overt effort to subvert the older fans to bring in the new generation of fans versus trying to bring in a multigenerational fan appeal which this movie does beautifully
Jun 2 2019,positive,suspect acting a disjointed plot and lack of significant screen time for the monsters kept me from rating this movie higher  a lifelong godzilla fan i had very high expectations for this and was certainly let down a little  i hope there is more screen time for the namesakes of next years kong vs godzilla and also hope there are new leading actors  the monsters themselves were excellent but unfortunately i had seen most of all the epic shots in the previews im not giving up hope for next year though
Jun 2 2019,positive,just as good if not better than the last action packed the whole way
Jun 2 2019,positive,really good story line brought me back to the 70s and 90s feel of godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,fantastic movie start to finish 
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything i would expect from a godzilla movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was action packed with godzilla fighting the titans i recommend it
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of monster ok monster action felt like it had alot of christian symbolism in it which felt odd in a movie about giant monsters fighting but whatever action was good human cast could care less for
Jun 2 2019,positive,all told i really enjoyed the movie its got awesome fight scenes and the actors did a great job portraying the character i will say the story had more plot wholes then swiss cheese but was nothing that really interfered with the story this is a great movie to show the divide between the audience and critics the movies doesnt have a crazy political message therefore critics hate it the movie is a fun story that created a fun atmosphere to watch some titans wreck each other i would suggest watching 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if your looking for a fun time at the movies doesnt get much better than this
Jun 2 2019,positive,sick movie  loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,killer sick and amazing sound and intense fight scenes ignore the negative reviews because the acting was great
Jun 2 2019,negative,godzilla king of the monsters is sequel to godzilla 2014 directed by michael dougherty it is a fantasyscifi film and has a runtime of two hours and twelve minutes the purpose of godzilla king of the monsters is to continue the story of godzilla 2014 and lead up to godzilla vs kong 2020 the main characters of godzilla king of the monsters are madison russell dr emma russell and mark russell the setting is primarily in boston massachusetts the central conflict of godzilla king of the monsters is that arch nemesis king ghidorah and other godsized monsters have taken over the world and the rightful king godzilla must defeat them to save the humans from extinction director michael dougherty did not achieve his purpose i was not convinced that these characters would exist in real life in addition one minute the story would focus on family drama and the other it would focus on the monsters it could not make up its mind the acting and the writing are not effective and are the biggest weaknesses of godzilla king of the monsters the confrontations between godzilla and the other godlike monsters were the biggest strengths of godzilla king of the monsters  my overall response to godzilla king of the monsters that it is a dumb cheesy monster film long live the king and other similar lines are cheesy and our characters especially the family like to run towards danger i cannot recommend a movie that mainly focuses on the dumbass humans instead of the monsters  the impression that godzilla king of the monsters left me with that these monster films are not getting any better and cannot replicate the success quality wise of the original 1954 godzilla movie what i want the reader to know before watching godzilla king of the monsters is to drastically lower their expectations and turn off their brain  godzilla king of the monsters earns a d because amidst all the bad there are still awesome monster fights
Jun 2 2019,negative,trash first part of the movie is boring af only two stars because of the good cgi but besides that not worth it
Jun 2 2019,positive,picture was great but the storyline could have been better
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it a few weak points but it was still thoroughly enjoyable and i will definitely see it again before it leaves the big screen and yes it does have a post credits clip 
Jun 2 2019,positive,best movie of the year i liked it better than avengers 
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome from start to end destruction overload
Jun 2 2019,positive,humans were boring but that to be expected from any godzilla movie other than that you come for the spectacle and this movie delivers while also paying homage to the original toho series in terms of score references and imagery ignore the critics and let reality fly out window and just enjoy giant monsters beating the crap out of each other
Jun 2 2019,positive,this film is everything i look for in a godzilla film  i am very disappointed with the critics reviews of this film  the human characters are not the reason people go to see a godzilla film and any critique of the monsters  battles are unjustified in my opinion  this movie had a lot of throwbacks to the original godzilla shows of the 1970s and i would recommend this film to anyone looking for epic monster battles
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the action and powers
Jun 2 2019,positive,great summer action movie a must for any godzilla fans 
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun action and godzillla yea baby
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you want to watch big lizards beat each other up youve come to the right place great movie for fans of the genre yeah the acting wasnt the best but i came here for godzilla not the people also it was a huge step up from the 2014 film
Jun 2 2019,negative,roar fight cliche line or two repeat as needed felt like it was 10 hours long and i struggled to stay awake even with the near deafening noise that makes up the films soundtrack
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla fans will absolutely love this movie the critics can suck it had one of the best movie experiences watching this in imax go see it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,despite of what reviewers says movie has a certain grandeur to itself which sets it apart even though it is quite predictable 
Jun 2 2019,positive,a great monster movie that really gives you the realistic feeling of what it would be like to be in the middle of an attack of this nature a little slow in the beginning but the end is amazing 
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a lifelong godzillakaiju fan this movie checks all the boxes on what i wanted out of it there is good balance between epic monster battles and human scenes the soundtrack is also amazing it harkens back to the old toho godzilla films especially from the 60s and 70s i highly recommend this movie to any godzilla fans and anyone looking for an epic spectacle
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it want to see it again
Jun 2 2019,negative,horribly forced diversity casting led to distractions lack of chemistry and unrealistic casting aka entire military is black and leader is black woman godzilla and monster scenes were good but storyline and acting except for main guy father was awful
Jun 2 2019,positive,i am an unabashed godzilla fangirl and this movie delivered the goods on a level i only dreamed about as a kid absolutely cannot wait to see it again
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan this is the movie you always envisioned in youre mind while watching the classic toho series amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,i absolutely loved it i thought it was a fantastic sequel to the new godzilla story arc now if youre looking for deep complex storytelling  look elsewhere if youre looking for some epic monster battles and pathos  grab a bucket of popcorn and head to your nearest movie theatre a mustsee for hardcore fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was like the classic godzilla toho films so if you enjoyed those you will definitely enjoy this the fights were a lot of fun tho i felt they could have been filmed a lot better overall this movie was entertaining as hell especially in 4dx long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,same legacy terrible dialog and 2nd plot line  ive never had the hair on my arms legs and neck stand up like in this movie and the scare scene shot my adrenaline to 99 but was a different scare feel than id ever had  this is classic godzilla format for today  every charge up sound from godzilla should be on your phone  i want to wake up to it  awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,my grandson and i went to see this movie and thought it was amazing the immense amount of action was exactly what he was hoping for
Jun 2 2019,positive,actions scenes were epic plot was pretty bad
Jun 2 2019,neutral,acting was terrible script was weak an could have bee written by a high schooler and made everyone seem like they were idiots but who goes to see godzilla for the acting  not enough monster fight scenes but it passed the cool test
Jun 2 2019,positive,a passably entertaining popcorn movie with great monster special effects and good use of colour and music to really emphasize the scale and impact of the creatures  the story is ok the actors are wasted on corny dialogue and poor jokes and the political message is somewhat undermined by the absurdity of the scenario  it also takes too long to get going and is too long overall but as a mindless monster fight film it looks good and plays out well
Jun 2 2019,positive,decent monster action the human characters are mildly frustrating and infuriating the grating family conflict plot almost makes the movie unwatchable thank goodness for the title character
Jun 2 2019,positive,okay have these critics ever seen a godzillakaiju film a good story is not something i typically dont associate with a kaiju film  i mean come on in the older movies ghidorah was created by aliens with a vendetta while godzilla danced and did a super sentaistyle dropkick there was also minillabut i digress that doesnt mean all those classic movies are bad but the stories definitely arent a literary masterpiece  and thats okay  godzilla has always been about whatever message is relevant to the times in the case of this movie natural disasters and humanitys impact on the environment and the monster fights  i didnt need an overly complex narrative or characters to enjoy this film  that being said director michael doughtry did a fantastic job here  this is a love letter to the og fans with nods to the lore and the mythology of the films that came before it yet it also allows for new fans to enjoy the kaijutitians  
Jun 2 2019,negative,if you love monster fights you wont love this movie 90 of the movie time is spent on a completely stupid subplot instead of following the monsters or even letting you watch the monsters actually fight the movie always cuts away from the action right when it starts instead it spends its time showing you the main characters reactions the monsters are literally fighting offscreen for 90 of the movie almost like its teasing you there are scenes where the human characters are dodging monster feetlightingetc all the while you never get to see the actual fighting going on if you want to watch people spout random military jargon yell and shoot guns then i guess this movie is for you if you want actual payoff and actual monster fight scenes that last more than 5 seconds dont watch this movie i thought the point of a kaijumonster movie was about the monster action not in this case i really regret watching this movie such a painful experience
Jun 2 2019,positive,wish it gave a little more background i seen all the godzilla movies however my son didnt and he was a bit confused about the relation between godzilla and king kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,was a good movie  slow in parts but good action
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla chapter 2 is an enjoy for all kaiju fan and a spectacle of effects and sound   
Jun 2 2019,positive,if your expectations going in are in line with what you see then its great
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome pop corn flick much better than godzilla 14 or kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it i went to see giant monster fights and thats exactly what they delivered
Jun 2 2019,positive,sure the human story was moderate but the overall story was amazing its no different than any other godzilla movie so it shouldnt be of any surprise i look forward to what comes next
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely amazing great story and just beautiful cinematography music kept to its true godzilla style loved it watched it in 4dx  definitely recommend 
Jun 2 2019,negative,1 star for the monsters being cool but the people are awful the writing is just so bad its predictable and boring the movie skips around and sometimes youre not sure where you are 
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is the modern godzilla film that all godzilla fans have ever wanted with titans such as mothra rodan and king ghidorah making their debut into the new legendary monster universe it is a warm welcome to see them back on the silver screen the human characters can be cheesy at times but whats a godzilla film without some of that cheese we arent here to see the new best motion picture just looking for some kaiju kicking ass and trust me you get that and more with this film 
Jun 2 2019,positive,long live the king great effects better than i expected
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it  its a great old school monster movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,so much more monster screen time compared to 2014 dont listen to the critics this is a mustsee
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie small details that make a difference your gonna need earmuffs but for the right reasons amazing sounds big booms
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is it folks this is probably the one and last effort at americans getting a good godzilla flick right yeah yeah whine and moan about how the human drama is not good enough or the how the characters are not fully relatable  so be it i did not find the same issues most critics have here is the script the best no not at all but is the monster sized action where its at hell yes this is a film by a zilla fan to zilla fans this is the uss one and probably last chance at getting anything close to a godzilla final wars produced at a huge budget by hollywood and holy hell did they get what needed to be right right this is a glorious fun sunmer action film about the biggest star in 2014 everyone complained that there was too much human stuff and not enough monster stuff well sorry critics  but the audiance got what they wanted a lot of monster stuff this is a kaiju film through and through and in my opinion is over what pacific rim was the plot was not too convoluted the plot devices matched the typical toho style if a bit shoe horned and the thinly layered moral over the story draped over like a veil ever so transparent enough for you to still see the real fun stuff this film does not have a message it does not have an agenda and it does not change anything about godzilla for fucks sake they did it right the lore the detials the easter eggs the callbacks the soundtrack the fight scenes this is it folks this is a big budget godzilla a film showing the biggest star on earth the human matters be pointless go watch the king fight for his throne against a truly intimidating villian in good ol fashion gman monster romp style this film may flop but i dont care this is what we wanted and we got it thank you mike for having the balls to do this thank you 
Jun 2 2019,positive,best american godzilla film to date hands down a must watch imo
Jun 2 2019,positive,wow what a powerhouse of a movie from start to end
Jun 2 2019,positive,its what i expected from a monster movie wish godzilla would of kicked some more monsters butt
Jun 2 2019,positive,a good sequel and nice upgrade from the 2014 movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,i got what i came for a fun monster movie that did the kaiju justice 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is a monster movie so i just expected destruction and kaiju epic battles and thats what i got
Jun 2 2019,negative,what a hot mess i did like the leading actors  they made suffering through all the non stop over played mayhem more tolerable it was like watching a video game made for 10 year olds so if you like a ridiculous abundance of monster attacks without much else this is your kind of movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was the best godzilla movie i ever seen great pacing better story line and epic fights 
Jun 2 2019,positive,all the action i expected and then some  definitely recommend watching
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is what was needed to give godzilla justice action packed and it gave godzilla more development looking forward to godzilla vs kong post credit scene could had been better to anticipate the next movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was awesome tons of action great story and loved seeing all the monsters from the old movies took my kids and parents to see it and every one enjoyed it
Jun 2 2019,positive,another excellent godzilla monster i took my two boys and they loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was even more than i expected i dont care for a lot of plot i want action
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a person who grew on old godzilla movies this was awesome i could see this again
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely great went there for great monster fights and thats what i got it also set up for godzilla v king kong which im very excited for
Jun 2 2019,positive,less people drama more monsters cheesy but good 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was awesome wish there was more mothra but it was so good most fans will love it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,much better than avengers endgame not even close
Jun 2 2019,neutral,the monster action scenes were great however the plot and human factor were terrible ken wantanabe and charles dance were the highlights on the human side
Jun 2 2019,positive,i enjoyed the new godzilla movie very much im 54 i felt like a kid again as i watched the movie i was excited looking forward to the next movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,poorly implemented human interaction poor humor and a general overuse of 1 liners cant stop the magnificent king of monsters from taking his throne 
Jun 2 2019,negative,not great all the monsters looked alike and some of the characters made no sense at all
Jun 2 2019,positive,mind  blowing  starts slow ends strong
Jun 2 2019,positive,this ones for the fans greatly stepped up monster battles with awesome abilities hail to the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,althought its not a perfect movie godzilla king of the monsters delivers what it promises and i really think that the director knew what he was doing about the human characters and the plot i really fail to see why people think its bad  some people seems to fail to understand that the humans are not the leads of the movie the monsters are so they really get a secondary role and for that this does not require them to be so developed    i do think that they could do less fights overall but make them last longer as it was with 2014 but ill not hold it against the movie  its not perfect but i think its entertaining and i plan to see it again soon    long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a godzilla fan was touched by how the monsters were portrayed a must watch for any godzilla fan less human drama and more monster presentation that a lot of people prefer
Jun 2 2019,positive,a truly brilliant film for both godzilla fans and new comers this film is everything a kaiju film should be but with a budget and brilliant cgi a good balance between world building and monster fights    this is everything that godzilla 2014 failed to do i feel that critics are being a bit unreasonable when it comes to the ratings on this site go see it and make up your own mind for me it was great just the way it is
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was absolutely amazing the movie couldnt get any better and the monsters were awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,epic everything you want from a monster movie and more
Jun 2 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie ever phenomenal imagery even better in 3d the story line and acting were horrendous however the big reveal doesnt happen until the credits which is unforgiveable

Jun 2 2019,positive,was a great movie enjoyed the implementation of specialized weaponry like halles shepards bikes knifes belts was very enjoyable movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,monster fights were cool i think there was to much human drama thought
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing a must see if you love the gman
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was good  not something that you would leave saying wow that was awesome
Jun 2 2019,negative,it commits the cardnal sin of action movies its boring so much time spent on a dull and unessesary protagonest there was nothing he did that couldent have been done better by the suporting cast worst of all we keep cuting away from amazing monster fights to see what the boring humans are doing everyones ark is confusing and poorly done and its realy hard to care about any of them which would be fine if we were seeing what we wanted to see big monsters wrestling but the movie keeps pulling away to show us boring father scientist with no character growth he wasnt there for his family now he is but the lesson he learned to turn away from hate is undercut by the fact that he isnt the one that learns it he sacrifices nothing and gains everything also i didnt pay to see him i payed to see monsters why am i still talking about this guy
Jun 2 2019,positive,its godzilla and he is badass enough said     as a former osprey pilot it was great to see the aircraft represented well
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you like movies with giant monsters fighting each other then this is the movie for you awesome movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,a very well done godzilla movie that had new things while still playing homage to the old movies great feelings and a decent story not great but decent with a twist for the human aspect visualization of the movie is amazing i will see this movie again in theaters i recommend it highly note for parents there is some language 1st time at epic theaters in titusville fl
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster designs and fights were amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,better than the originals but seemed to drag on at the beginning
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is epic   i dont need more human history  
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved the action i loved that there was more screen time for godzilla vs the first one i loved king ghidorah and the amount of screen time he had dialogue was typical for that type of movie storyline was pretty straight forward cgi at certain times seemed very choppy but over all excellent
Jun 2 2019,positive,there wasnt anything not to like about it simply awesome
Jun 2 2019,negative,this script is ridiculous 
Jun 2 2019,positive,why do people say it was too close up camera shots and shaky do you not understand that it took thousands of people to deliver such amazing film you try make up giant monsters that fight respect them for even making the movie for you all to see i was able to see the film in 3d and clearly saw everything good effort team
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome a must watch all kaiju fans
Jun 2 2019,negative,i think there was a movie going on when i went to see godzilla but it was too dark to tell storylinepoor everything elsemeh
Jun 2 2019,positive,a serious love letter to classic godzillas definitely for the fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was absolutely fantastic michael dougherty the cast and crew did amazing job on the film i highly recommend it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,how long can the king reign great movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,more monsters on the screen more often more pls
Jun 2 2019,positive,excellent monster action but the dialogue was so bad it made me angry id give it 5 stars if all the humans had died still a lot of fun though 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was a great movie every emotion is visually delivered from the monsters perspective the action sequences were truly astonishing it brought back the feels of the old school movies mixed with modern time things critics wouldnt enjoy this movie is a great movie their is so much more to explain and talk about but im out of time go see the movie you wont regret it
Jun 2 2019,positive,i really liked it both the human plot line and monster fights
Jun 2 2019,positive,best monster movie ever needs just a little bit more focus on the titans and godzilla himself but great action all around
Jun 2 2019,positive,i am a huge godzilla fan and enjoyed myself was great seeing all the godzilla monsters in a big budget movie and was sooo great to hear the old godzilla theme music got me all  nostalgic my only dissapointment was the fights kept cutting away to human  characters when all i wanted was to see none stop monster action with godzilla being a badass but it never happens like it should unfortunatly  i hooe the sequel has better un interupted fights  overall this was enjoyable for any godzillagiant monster fan but i was dissapounted the battles were not long enough a good human story in the background is fine but we want to see more ould bemonster battles un interupted after all the people have come to see godzilla not the humans fun  good but not great or amazing like it should be
Jun 2 2019,negative,all the human beings in this movie are instane and sutpid i wish there was a fast forward button in the cinema so i can skip those horrible and awkward scenes
Jun 2 2019,positive,if your a fan you will enjoy it  lots a monsters
Jun 2 2019,negative,too poorly lit camera too shakey  too many close in shots on action  could not tell what was happening
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it the movie was what i wanted from a godzilla movie   honestly the profession critics have no idea what  people want from a godzilla movie and because of the net and people who have seen the movie they are not obsolete  it is a fun movie that  gives you lots of fights monsters and smashing yeah  a great summer movie  
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a godzilla fan for 20 years great movies to add to 65 year of dominace long live the king of the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,rotten tomatoes respectfully this was amazing no one watches a godzilla movie for human drama but kaiju throwdowns
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved every second of it
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a long time godzilla fan 1963 i was quite happy with the movie contrary to what the critics are saying too much monster not enough human element i thought the movie struck the right balance between human and monster my one critical comment would be that the movie was shot dark last the last one but not as dark hopefully next years gvk will show the monsters in a better light pun intended one character really irritated me one character performed an homage to a character in the 54 film and one stepped up his game finally i loved the way original g music was integrated into the movie and was not surprised by the post credit scene 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster fights were easily the best part of the movie as it should be the family drama drags the film down a bit
Jun 2 2019,positive,more godzilla action is a good thing i didnt care for the human related story overall i enjoyed it
Jun 2 2019,positive,was everything i expect from a good godzilla movie action was fun and the humans while cliche wasnt so bad that i hated it the music score was stellar with new mixes of the monsters iconic themes ignore the critics and go see this

Jun 2 2019,negative,i couldnt wait for this movie to end was shocking 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the cgi was amazing although the film was a little darker than ideal i wish the film was more about godzilla and his daughter than the scientist and their children
Jun 2 2019,positive,sit back strap in turn off your brain and hang on for a wild nonstop action movie that has brought the charge back to a waning franchise michael dougherty rights all the damage inflicted to kaijumovie lovers with the glut of actor melodrama put forth by gareth edwards attempt in 2014 this summer offering is a typical blockbuster in the vain of the 1980s big screen hits godzilla king offers an olive branch to a new generation of fans 18 and under in the form of a millie bobby brown performance that is adequate for the plot but not overwhelming the older cast is little more than a story set piece this is a secondary concern as the true stars are the larger than life monsters and their fight for dominance  make sure you get plenty of rest before seeing this you will leave the theater with hand cramps from grabbing your seat if you are looking for the feel good hit of the yearwatch rocketman if you want pure movie junkie kaiju crack this is it
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a huge godzilla fan who owns just about every single one of the movies minus i think for now i really enjoyed the movie as it had just about everything i was looking for it to have for it to make me happy
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a very fun and action packed movie i was never bored and i was always entertained the cgi is some of the best cgi ive ever seen and the battles are big and gruesome my issues with the movie are the human characters are very bland but they are acted very well and some of the fights can seem repetitive like its the same shots happening over and over again but all in all this is a great summer blocksbuster and im gonna give godzilla king of the monsters a b
Jun 2 2019,positive,the action i great the cinematography is breathtaking and the effects are out of this world sure the human characters and plot are your standard sci fi scientists who doing what they do but you dont see a monster movie for the dialogue the trailers showed a lot of monsters and a lot of monster fight both of which it delivers on and then some get a soda and some popcorn and enjoy the king on the big screen
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was great the cinematography was wonderful and it is beautiful
Jun 2 2019,positive,best monster movie in years human characters have believable motivations while the effect of the monsters existence is really felt a powerful film really enjoyable
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun flick definitely a fans dream lol
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was grate the critics are fucking stupid the sounds were awesome the theme song was great and the monster battles were awesome as fuck im gonna tell you this dont listen to those fucking credits
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was a refresh from previous movies of this genre it focused on the raw size and power of the monsters and it shows us humans joining in on the fight 
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved all the monster fights disliked how much they showed the family n the girl
Jun 2 2019,positive,a breath of fresh air in the tumbling house of cards that is entertainment in 2019
Jun 2 2019,positive,the action was amazing any fan of the genrefranchise will love this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it  various homages   to the original godzilla series in numerous ways visually appealing and exciting to experience
Jun 2 2019,positive,alot more godzilla then the 2014 movie but not too much that its overbearing
Jun 2 2019,positive,monsters fighting  human drama
Jun 2 2019,positive,overall the movie was ok loved the monster fights not so much the acting  storyline the jokes felt really flat  forced not enough carisma
Jun 2 2019,positive,my little boy has been waiting for this movie and loved it it was very entertaining
Jun 2 2019,positive,my type of movie awesome graphics
Jun 2 2019,positive,2 hours of full action
Jun 2 2019,positive,some unbelievable human progression while these huge monsters battle it out it would seem you wouldnt want to be within 5 miles of these monsters but the cast was yards away and most survived all in all it was a great godzilla movie with decent story line and character progression i would recommend this to all godzilla and monster movie fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,the only thing real fans of the franchise care about is good monster fights having a compelling human story that doesnt take away from the action is an ideal and not the standard     oxygen destroyer is sort of shoehorned in would have liked to see more of an introduction      millie browns family drama is fairly boring     intro to the movie is a little slow was hoping for a title credits like godzilla 2014     monsters keep original roars and themes     all new abilities for the monsters are awesome     ghidorah is portrayed perfectly     
Jun 2 2019,positive,its exactly what was promised an all out battle between the greatest of tohos monsters if you grew up watching these movies in a theater or on monstervision smiles and eyes wide you wont be disappointed

Jun 2 2019,positive,i honestly believe that critics are full of shit i can understand somebut very little of their complaints but others its like they just didnt watch the movie at all its been two days and ive already seen it twice and all i can say is that after a semi delivering 2014 odd but good 2016 and three disappointing anime movies we finally get the godzilla movie that the fans deserve the action is great the story is interesting the designs are spot on dougherty is a real genious and deserves so much credit for what hes done with the monster verse not only am i thoroughly happy with this movie but i am now even more hyped for godzilla vs kong in march of next year
Jun 2 2019,positive,terrific fan serviced film when the original godzillas theme was playing i was like yesss so many fightingsand mothra is mvp shes beautiful
Jun 2 2019,positive,look this isnt a movie for the critics there is no hidden political message or deep lesson or activist moral in this movie this is a movie for the fans its a movie about giant monsters fighting and boy does it ever deliver if you were in anyway a fan of godzilla as a kid see this movie its everything that ever made you love the character in the first place sitting in the theater i felt like a 10 year old again and i loved the experience

Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a very fun and enjoyable movie for the moviegoer that wants to get lost in adventure and action if you are looking for a solid storyline with plot twist dont go to godzilla but if you want to have a good time and geek out by all means let them fight

Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved the action and monster fights and i really like that this time although the humans are focused on they are not the center of attention  if youre expecting some tourdeforce of cinema you came to the wrong film  if you want silly lines and fun monster fights you are at the right spot

Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fan you will love this movie  lots of monster fight scenes and the monsters are menacing

Jun 2 2019,positive,the graphics and everything is awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,action packed summer movie that g fans have been waiting for  sure not a perfect movie but within the genera its very good worth seeing for all audiences as well it has plenty of action as before stated but it also has emotional moments that cross over to all people im really not sure anyone could make this type of film any better ive seen it 3 times so far and plan on seeing it at least 2 more times
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie definitely better than the last one
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was everything it was supposed to be and some more awesome kaiju fights awesome visuals awesome soundtrack awesome moments sometimes a bit cheesy but always enjoyable go see it 
Jun 2 2019,negative,believe it or not the human characters are the primary focus of godzilla movies even the original was less about oh man theres a giant dinosaur wrecking things and more about this is humanitys punishment for being reckless with nuclear weapons this general concept holds true for most of the movies and yes i have watched most of them    this movie on the other hand focuses on the monsters the writing for all the human characters is nonsensical at best heck the writing for the two lead characters isnt even consistent their personalities do total 180degree turns instantly with no logical explanation the writing is horrendous and the comedic oneliners are incredibly forced i wish i could be more specific about all the flaws but spoilers arent cool    if all you want is to see giant monsters fight each other this movie covers that well enough if you actually want to watch a wellwritten movie at the same time stay very far away
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is amazing humans arent as bad as critics say but still there not amazing but dont ruin the film cinematography and soundtrack are godlike amazing and the literally every single little thing with the monsters are just fantastic the fights are glorious the designs are great every monster has there own moment and the way the combine old music with new and remake old pieces is amazing ive seen every godzilla film ever and this is one of the best ones ever definitely in the top 5
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome kayju action
Jun 2 2019,positive,great monster flick probably one of the best in my opinion definitely reccomended
Jun 2 2019,positive,great effects good soundtrack  average acting sloppy writing  watch it for the pretty lights
Jun 2 2019,negative,just one world flop i left the theater within 25 minutes with my hears hurting and my eyes getting out of focus stay away
Jun 2 2019,positive,a fun blockbuster movie godzilla fans will love how it feels like a showa era movie with its tone and themesbut it is americanized in a lot of ways if you arent to familiar with the giant monster movie genre you might not care for it much but it isnt full of techno babel however your kids probably will love it the plot was old school silly sci fi like something out of the 60s but with amazing special effects not formatted for imax or if it was my theater must have had issues if youre looking for a fun movie for the weekend thats mostly family friendly very mild language then take the family and have some escapist fun with no agendas 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie  monster action was amazing and non stop compared to the last godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,ive seen every godzilla movie multiple times while growing up in the 70s and 80s to the reboots in the 90s and 2000s one thing holds true in every one these movies for me just get the human story over with and put the g man on the screen the monsters are pure eye candy and this movie does not shy away from displaying its real stars i loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is what i call a monster opera with the backing of human drama helps bulit up the flow and how each monster relates to the humans prespective on them i give it a 1010 butits not  its 100100 thank you all who have work on the movie for building something to bring back the tokuarts 
Jun 2 2019,positive,love the special fx great movie love the acting and futuristic style to it the monsters were awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought this movie showed a lot of monster action while giving an alright story i could see how it could be hard to balance the monster fights while also fallowing the humans this movie balanced them in the best way possible while also building an expansion of their new monster universe
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla kotm does an excellent job of blending modern cinema with elements of classic kaiju films it embraces the absurdity of the premise and in doing so captures a thrilling and engaging sense of fun that godzilla 2014 failed to while contemporary cinematography and effects bring an almost overwhelming sense of scale and impact king of the monsters is what godzilla films were always meant to be
Jun 2 2019,negative,no realconfusing story line  loud too much cgi fake  first 30 mins totally boring i should have gone dancing instead
Jun 2 2019,positive,best monterverse movie anyone can fucking see hands down ghidorah vs godzilla put up a sick ass fight no lie those who criticized the movie for being too loud or too much fighting what the hell you expected from a big ass monsters fighting to be quite and fight for like 5min dont listen to the critics listen to the people the people are loving it and thats what matters
Jun 2 2019,positive,great story great cgi

Jun 2 2019,positive,when it came to the monsters the movie delivers amazing fights great visual effects and sound effects that shook the room only part that didnt work was the human element that fell flat 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre looking for monster on monster action this is a spectacle nobody cares about the humans anyway
Jun 2 2019,positive,not everything needs a compelling story or human drama to be good you stupid snobby critics  take a good look at the audience score vs the critics score the people wanted an epic kaiju flight and they gave us an epic kaiju fight
Jun 2 2019,positive,one of the best monster movies ever
Jun 2 2019,positive,you dont watch twilight looking for car chases and gun fights so you shouldnt go to a monster movies looking for a meaningful plot if you can get over that then this is easily one of the best godzilla movies to have ever hit the screen if anything i will look more at the audience scores on this site instead of critic scores for now on and the real audiences have spoken 
Jun 2 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed and interested to see godzilla vs kong next year 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought it was an excellent ride full of nostalgia 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i am a long time fan of the godzilla franchise and this movie really does it justice there are so many nods to its history that the film feels like a love letter to godzilla himself if you are a big godzilla fan or monster movie fan in general this movie is for you
Jun 2 2019,positive,perfect balance between protagonist and coprotagonist godzilla is the protagonist if you dont know perfect coreography this is how a monster movie should be made

Jun 2 2019,positive,its as if the critics have never seen any of the old godzilla movies    i loved the callbacks to the old filmsmonsters the action throughout and the payoff we get at the end theres plenty of teasing for what may be to come
Jun 2 2019,positive,very good and full of action almost like a live action anime
Jun 2 2019,positive,wow loved this movie monsters are huge with beautiful cgi and monster fights are epic the theater shook great for the whole family made me feel like a little kid again this is why you go to the movies cant wait to see again

Jun 2 2019,positive,great action story was ok humans in the story are cookie cutter
Jun 2 2019,positive,script could be stronger but exciting visuals and the soundtrack makes this movie exactly what a godzilla movie should be about lots of action and some epic fight scenes the story really does come second to the main attraction of godzilla movies the monsters battling it out
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was a movie made for godzilla fans and it sets up the monsterverse for future movies very well  it doesnt get the full 5 stars from me because it felt like they might have tried to cram too many concepts into one movie but all in all ill definitely be seeing this again one of the best movies in godzillas 35 film franchise
Jun 2 2019,positive,and i do recommend he movie theres just enough supporting history peppered naturally throughout that allows you to follow and just enough mystery to make you think therell be another the cgi was well done im just curious who the other 11 titans are
Jun 2 2019,positive,great graphics good storyline predictable but still great
Jun 2 2019,positive,still too much humansfuck critics 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the fight scenes were so much better this time if you liked godzilla 2014 you have to see this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,braught back the feelings i had as a kid watching the original gozilla tapes     everything a godzilla fan would want in a film  they finaly  got it right  loads of personality in godzilla this time  loads off stuff fans will love  i was grinning ear to ear and gripping onto the seat with all the heavy duty monster action gets you propa pumped     will be going to see it again in cincema     would give it a 98 actors where so so but not awful      beautiful film   
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie is fantastic visual effects are beautiful and the fight scenes are amazing if you love godzilla watch this they even have some of the classical music stay for the very end of the movie after the credits you will not be disappointed and the critics have bad tastes
Jun 2 2019,positive,65year old godzilla fan here this movie is a love letter to me 
Jun 2 2019,positive,too many character cliche but at least the monster fights are decent
Jun 2 2019,positive,completely blown by this sequel
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics  they are not in touch at all  godzilla king of the monsters is epic and glorious    wonderful monster action crazy story and the build up for the rest of the universe is amazing    i feel like im a little kid again and i loved every second of it     the special effects were perfect and my god the fights are a wonder to behold   cant wait for the rest of the films in the monsterverse 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a great godzilla movie but only an ok movie
Jun 2 2019,negative, the special effects were very good but the writing was lazy and shockingly bad even for a movie where everyone just wants to see the monsters crush things one hour in i realized that i was actually bored by a movie that had a bunch of awesome monsters stomping around destroying cities i happened to see 30 seconds of the end credits to aladdin which were more entertaining than the entire movie plus the movie makers  apparently hate boston  
Jun 2 2019,positive,the cast feels cobbled together and lacks chemistry and there is an overemphasis on the we humans are destroying the planetcommentary but the monster action is top notch which is what a godzilla movie is all about godzilla himself is a beefy colossus and king ghidorah aka monster zero is genuinely terrifying like the classic godzilla films there is a familiar nature in the balance theme which balances out the apocalyptic destruction plenty of fun worth the watch
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is why i love going to the movies godzilla king of the monsters throws all of the action and suspense on the table and delivers
Jun 2 2019,positive,great action movie geturpopcornready
Jun 2 2019,positive,toho godzilla fans will love it humans are there to drive godzillas story forward and thats ok great action amazing score incredible effects and sound and lots of monster mayhem its a romp
Jun 2 2019,positive,i really liked this movie the monster fights were fantastic and the visual effects were spectacular to behold the only reason it didnt get five stars is because it took awhile to get to the battles and not all of the monsters were in on the showdown plus godzillas head looks  way too small for his massive body ken watanabe and zheng zyi were awesome vera farmiigas character didnt make sense to me but i went with it i liked this one much better than the last few godzilla movies and still want to see more wait til end credits are done for sneak peek for possible part 2
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was clearly the best godzilla movie so far tons of monster action a love letter to all kaiju fans across the world
Jun 2 2019,positive,unexpected better than the last they really stepped up the storyline special effects and fights awesome movie over all
Jun 2 2019,positive,great film brilliant visual and fun 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,it was just ok i mean pretty much like all the others i think they should just kill godzilla off for good and let him rip
Jun 2 2019,positive,im giving it 4 because my 15 year old really liked it he thought it was well cast and the plot was as good as it could be i did enjoy some effects the people streaming out of the cities reminded me of the godzilla er al i would watch on the 430 movies after school the constant slap in the face with references to skull island made me wonder gee a sequel crossover movie soon with fay wrays old crush or am i showing my age
Jun 2 2019,negative,god this was awful the story makes zero sense the musical score is garbage and the camerawork is just so unbelievably bad it was so blurry and the amount of camera shake was crazy it just gave me a headache at least they got the monsters roaring right
Jun 2 2019,positive,very well done i loved it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the visuals were flat out amazing and it was a thing of beauty critics were saying the humans were not good characters but i felt a emotional connection to them and they even had some good jokes i really didnt see much wrong with the plot like critics are saying but who watches godzilla movies for the plotnobody they fixed godzillas dorsal spikes roar and atomic breath the score was breathtaking and i was a little shocked by how good it was this movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time and i had a fun time this movie was truly a fan service
Jun 2 2019,positive,go go godzilla my favorite movie of this summer screw you rt 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this films strongest selling point is the monster presence and action which vastly outshine those from the predecessor as a lifelong godzilla fan i felt this movie did a fantastic job with revamping and doing justice to the classic monsters the human story was a bit average and cliche at times but i do not watch godzilla movies to see a stirring human performance this film isnt perfect but i loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was awesome do not listen to the stupid ass critics or the rotten score go see it
Jun 2 2019,positive,nothing do dislike absolute action all the way
Jun 2 2019,negative,graphics were ok   but plot and story not good  i was sleeping
Jun 2 2019,positive,all this critics are annoying 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is a must see movie especially with the family if youre a godzilla fan or not the action in this movie will make you want to see it again  rotten tomatoes ratings are not my opinion i give it 5 stars cant wait to see the other planned godzilla movies  this movie redeems the 2014 one  godzilla king of the monsters is awesome 
Jun 2 2019,positive,theyv revived it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,action pack n storyline hope this is franchised i need more im a big godzilla fan since small so its very hype to see it in actual computer graphics  n all
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre a fan of the originals you will love this movie yes its not perfect but theres no point in critiquing a movie about giant fictmonsters this is an awesomely fun film and gives the opportunity to see classic monsters come to life 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved being able to see more or godzilla in this move the first one was shot in the dark and made it harder to see him mothra  was done beautifully in bright vivid color and the rest of the monster made for a very entertaining movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,love g0dzilla and this move was classic godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,best movie loved that my son loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,good movie for all godzilla fans  loud sound and get your sun glasses to watch movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great godzilla movie with a lot of action coming from our favorite kaiju it would have got 5 stars if it wasnt for the at sometime cringe worthy comedy at inappropriate times and to much human screen time 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,animation was good but the movie was a  very slow  there was not enough action  even watching it in 3d  i had to wake my boyfriend up about three times because he fell sleep it was so slow   i love monster movies but this was very disappointing
Jun 2 2019,positive,i watch this movieit was good movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the movie great sequel to the 2014 godzilla loved the storyline and action
Jun 2 2019,positive,took the family everyone loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun movie lots of monster fights
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was everything godzilla 2014 wasnt  it had all the giant monster action that was missing from the previous film  the human story could have been done better but thats not really why we go to see these films    if youre a fan of godzilla or any of tohos other creatures this movie is for you
Jun 2 2019,positive,good movie sets up the next very well
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters will go down as one of the best monster movie in america awesome work by the director he kept it real and original a must see movies with the whole family  never a dull moment  if youre a fan of the toho version you will enjoy this movie    also dont leave theres something at the very end of the credits
Jun 2 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie action from being to end both my kids enjoyed it as well
Jun 2 2019,negative,godzilla deserved so much better than this script  way too much jumbled storyline annoying acting and really how much radiation could all of these humans take and still be running around
Jun 2 2019,positive,i love it contrary to the critics  i think the human storyline was enough to dont lose atention of what really matters the monsters  i love the movie and the fights  every second was worth it somehow they manage to bring the clasic godzilla with a touch for the new generations
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla looked old school
Jun 2 2019,positive,im a longtime godzilla fan and it hit all the right spots for me apretty cool backsotry for godzilla with great visual easter eggs  spectacular fight scenes and the classic cringe godzilla dialogue if your expecting a drama focused on humn acting your in the wrong neiborhood  what you will get though is a great monster showdown beautiful visuals  and a lot of nostalgia so if youve watched any of the old godzilla movies made by toho and enjoyed them  youll probably like this  but if your looking for drame and suspense this isnt it for you     my reccomendation is to just let your inner  9 year old out and just watch
Jun 2 2019,positive,great fun a big kids perfect film many nods to kaiju movie fans throughout if you have trouble accepting soft sci fi concepts and came for the storyline i think it may not be your cup of tea 
Jun 2 2019,positive,best movie in the series
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything you want in a monster movie 
Jun 2 2019,negative,the nothing plot is a monster convention with lots of noise and very little else wasted two hours
Jun 2 2019,positive,just go see it if you like godzilla  a true godzilla fan will love it
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie had all the boxes checked as far as godzilla movies go compared to the original version but wasnt at times clear enough to give you the full effect i dont know whether this was by design or what
Jun 2 2019,positive,its good to see the other titans  rodan monster zero it brought me back to when i was young watching godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a summer blockbuster and lives up to that the character arcs are easily looked over by the epic scale and extended screen time of monster fights if youre looking for oscar worthy performances from this movie you might be disappointed if youre looking to have fun at the movies this is a movie for you
Jun 2 2019,positive,great monster movie great to see things get destroyed godzilla is back
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolute must see we watched it in 3d 4dx and all the special effects were incredible they did an excellent job with casting and setting up the sequel for skull island
Jun 2 2019,positive,killer movie critics wrong again cant wait for kong vs godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,i love godzilla i been following since i was a kid 
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics movie is absolutely amazing i was absolutely shook by the monsters the entire time highly recommend to go see this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,3 stars should say i enjoyed it not meh
Jun 2 2019,negative,human characters were awful especially mark the dad their motivations made no sense and they had no depth to them this is a problem because they make up at least half of the film the parts with godzilla fighting king gidorah are cool but honestly if you think that the 2014 movie had too little godzilla i dont know why you would think this one was any better there is about the same amount of godzilla screen time in both movies but he was just spread out over a longer span in this one rather than being teased a little bit and then brought out for a big fight at the end which i really enjoyed but a lot of people did not overall there were way too many bland characters that led to a nonsense plot however the fights are cool even if they are not as well shot as the 2014 film honestly not worth it to see in theaters wait for it to come out on dvd and then wait a few more months for it to be put in the 5 bin and when you watch it just skip every part with a human face
Jun 2 2019,negative,among the worst movies i have ever seen terrible cast that seemed to have no other purpose than to narrate loljust lol
Jun 2 2019,negative,it tries too hard to look like a kaiju movie when it mostly uses a select few wellknown monsters for trailer bait while forcing poorly written mary sue characters into our faces while some scenes tugged at my heartstrings it was ruined by the movies completely unrelatable and unlikable characters while people say dont call something garbage until you can do better im certain ive seen poorly written fanfictions with better writing  
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster fights are worth the price of admission but the human characters are terribly written and tiresome
Jun 2 2019,positive,its the godzilla movie weve been waiting for since childhood the action is bonkers the monsters are huge the critics dont have their head on right were they sad it wasnt another monster themed romantic drama a la the shape of water if you want to have a blast at the theater and watch monsters just wreck everything then see this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,ill be straight right off the bat and state that i havent seen the endless slew of godzilla movies that were made in japan ive seen the original gojira film from 1954 the awful american remake in 1998 and the 2014 version which kicked off this new run of films that warner bros hopes to make into a giant franchise crossing over with king kong with all of that out of the way i was going into this sequel hoping for some monster action that far exceeded its predecessor it may be the fact that only briefly knew the names of these others monsters throughout the film but having not seen the classic franchise seeing them for the first time here was quite the spectacle godzilla king of the monsters is by no means perfect but i believe its worth seeing for the visuals alone     loosely following dr emma russell vera farmiga and her daughter madison millie bobby brown as they plan to slowly release each new found monster one by one theyre caught in a bind when things begin to go astray and every one of them is released at once with the falling out of their family in the past madison must decide if her father or mother is truly the one on the right side of things aside from that this movie is all about the spectacle of giant monsters fighting with a clear setup that will eventually lead to the film godzilla vs kong next year if you can invest yourself in the numerous overblown action sequences then this is the movie for you     the human characters are throwaways even though i would like to put an asterisk next to millie bobby browns name although she is given some of the worst dialogue in the movie and there is a lot of that to go around at times she is a fantastic young actress that will only continue to strengthen her ability to steal the show as time goes on the humans throughout the course of godzilla king of the monsters really do feel like plot devices or stereotypical scientists just so that these monsters have a logical reason for being released to fight for that reason i found no possible way to fall in love with this movie at all     that being said the promotional material for this movie has been promising a lot of action and a lot of action is what is presented here there are some massive throwdowns and the cgi is quite impressive as well on top of the action this is a very wellshot film by cinematographer lawrence sher yes the visual effects definitely add to his shot composition but there are some beautiful images sprinkled throughout this film making a few moments during the battle scenes feel like a piece of art     in the end godzilla king of the monsters put the human characters in the back seat in terms of development which works out in terms of presenting numerous action scene but ultimately feels slightly hollow at times because of that from the very nice score that gave me chills at times to the visual effects actually impressing me quite a bit i was able to forgive many of the flaws here thats not something i usually say so im giving quite a bit of praise to the overall look of the film and the spectacle that goes along with it godzilla king of the monsters is a good movie with many issues but i really would recommend it to actionmonster movie fans 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i like it the movie and he died champion the best in the whole movie i like godzilla 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was monsters fighting almost the whole time its what a godzilla movie should be
Jun 2 2019,negative,one of the worst movies i have seen storyline and acting left much to be desired

Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie for what it is a monster movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,an absolute return to form for the king of the monsters and kaiju films in general from the superb monster fights to kyle chandlers and mbbs perfomances
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a wonderful movie i enjoy it immensely love it
Jun 2 2019,positive,best giant monster movie of all time director stayed true to original material  not the usual hollywood bastardization of your childhood 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,i thought godzilla king of the monsters was okay i was really bored throughout it and the two things that i thought were good were milly bobby browns character and the final monster fight i give godzilla king of the monsters a 510 boring forgettable besides the final battle because that was insane 
Jun 2 2019,positive,an american take on the toho movies a little less focus on the american actors and more on the monsters would have earned it 5 stars
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster fights were quite spectacular everything in between had me checking the time
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was one heck of a ride  awesome film
Jun 2 2019,positive,best godzilla film ever created awesome kaiju actions
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved this movie in so many ways from the human plot to the pure destruction of the monsters this is a must see for any godzilla fan and it is by far way better than the godzilla 2014 film it had a lot of fighting scenes in it between the monsters which is what we all go to see in the end anyways not lame human stories even though the human plot wasnt bad anyways it just made it even better although i think there could have been a little bit more fight scenes in my opinion between the monsters other than that its a great movie and is already my second favorite film this year behind endgame
Jun 2 2019,positive,the action was awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,great fun monster movie godzilla even better in imax where the monster roars reverberate in your body
Jun 2 2019,positive,very fun movie only complaint is that the story was very long and got boring at times but the action scenes were some of the best ive seen
Jun 2 2019,negative,the movie was all over the place it had a lot of continuity problems it just didnt make too much sense at times the acting was very mediocre it lacked substance and emotion
Jun 2 2019,positive,im shocked at the low critic score for this movie but also happy about the audience score  but to display only the critic score for so many years and have that take precedent over the audience score is absurd    i think they should proudly display both scores so people arent turned off to see a movie because critics dont know everything  personally i loved this movie  it was everything that it promised it was and everything i hoped it would be  a big bad ass kaiju movie  i actually thought the human story was faaarrr better than the 2014 movie   and its without a doubt the best american made godzilla movie so far  dont listen to the critics pay attention to the audience score
Jun 2 2019,positive,excellent story line cgi amazing and superb acting
Jun 2 2019,positive,a fun movie with a good balance of great monster fights and character drama held by good acting from kyle chandler millie bobby brown and vera farmiga godzilla is back and better than ever
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic definitely for fans every moment was worth my attention

Jun 2 2019,positive,thank you godzilla king of the monsters for giving me exactly what i paid for
Jun 2 2019,positive,while the movie was a little rushed and too deliberate in providing plot information the whole movie was a giant love letter to godzilla fans as is typical with more modern movies it did lack a little in monster action screen time and the monsters did have a cartoonish quality but overall a fun time
Jun 2 2019,positive,i cant disagree more with the critics with bad reviews this was a great movie with a good story line and acting  the  cinematography was awesome and creatures looked absolutely fabulous  i personally only look at the audience scores on this site most times there is a huge disconnect between the critics and audiences as seen with this movie i wish the audience scores rated all the movies the true test was the look on my 18 year old daughters face as the movie was playing we both were on  a roller coaster ride of entertainment 
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun movie with great special effects awesome monsters and bad human characters a great godzilla film
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a former submariner i knew that opening the bottom of the boat underwater is an impossibility but its a movie right good monster to monster action
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you want a movie with an outstanding plot you wont enjoy it if you want a movie with huge kanjimonsters fighting each other great visual effects and sound then this is the movie for you godzilla is back
Jun 2 2019,positive,i wasnt impressed in the beginning with the look of godzilla but once he became radioactive he looked awesome the fight scenes were great millie bobby brown is everything i was also very happy with the the destruction of a particular location at the end lets go yanks
Jun 2 2019,positive,the human element of godzilla king of the monsters wasnt too great but who the hell is coming for the human story i want giant kaiju fights and thats exactly what this movie delivers godzilla king ghidorah rodan and mothra bring the action and they deliver for its entire run time this movie is fantastic watch it
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun summer movie lots of action and thats why you go to this type of movie  i was never bored and looking forward to the next one
Jun 2 2019,positive,non stop action i like that they used the same actors to continue the story from 2014
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it great kaiju action amazing score 
Jun 2 2019,negative,save your money and just watch the godzilla trailer youre not missing much footage
Jun 2 2019,negative,more globalist propaganda humans are destroying the planet humans are bad  worst movie ive seen in years
Jun 2 2019,positive,loads of fun excited for more monster movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,action packed it was great to see
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is a pretty decent movie but i feel like they definitely had to rely on the cgi in order to get the audience engaged because visually it is fantastic but dialogue isnt the best nonetheless a very solid movie to continue the franchise i am quite excited for king kong vs godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,beautifully done movie that has so many call backs to true godzilla fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,very fun movie all actors give a solid performance all round an incredibly solid monster flick excellent fights visuals and a human subplot that while nothing fantastic does nothing to distract from why you would watch this film monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was a truly epic movie and the negative critics were wrong about this movie this movie did have a solid and exciting story that involved monsters and humans going back to see it again
Jun 2 2019,positive,story had something to be desired but special effects brought back some great memories of saturday afternoon monster movies in the 70s
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was everything i wanted ill go watch it again and again
Jun 2 2019,positive,cant wait for the next one
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is the godzilla movie that fans have always had in their head and have just been waiting for cgi to catch up in order to fully realize it its breaking my heart that its not doing better at the box office but as a hardcore fan watching this movie is my graceland
Jun 2 2019,positive,the technology behind the movie was excellent  at times it seemed a little hokey  there really werent any a list actors in the movie which may have made a little bit of a difference  if youre older and remember the original godzilla you might tend to like it a bit more
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a fun action movie and didnt feel like a cheesy godzilla movie like every other one lol
Jun 2 2019,positive,classic godzilla movie very entertaining and a lot of action throughout i only wish there was more mothra and rodan scenes but im sure they will be in the next godzilla vs kong movie cant wait to see it
Jun 2 2019,neutral,solid fx but plot meanders and ultimately does not deliver
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely spectacular if you are true fan of the godzilla franchise both old and new
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought oshae jackson jr would be a bigger role in the movie the way he promoted it so much
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a great movie my son and i love the story
Jun 2 2019,positive,a godzilla movie made with affection to the source material this movie made me very happy it does have its faults in the human character department but lets be real the monsters are the true main characters here
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was okay couldve been over in about hour 12 there were some story issues that were never really discussed or brought back up later in the movie liked the fight scenes and the inclusion of more monsters
Jun 2 2019,negative,imagine independence day ii but worse
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters delivers on the kaiju action promised but fails to deliver a satisfying story  while it is entertaining and im the end a good time the film fumbles with its message and to deliver a coherent narrative the plot is messy and only gets sillier as the film progresses   however godzilla movies were never made to be hyper intelligent and it is more than likely to satisfy viewers 
Jun 2 2019,positive,an epic new godzilla movie reminiscent of the films of old loads of fun monster action a very godzillalike human plot line which as usual decently serves up the monster action phenomenal visuals are to be had in this summer blockbuster with the titular creature
Jun 2 2019,positive,excellent i dont understand the critics attaching or slating the human aspect snooty critics no doubt 
Jun 2 2019,positive,incredible monster movie that is only held back by very unlikeable humans with weak motivations
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a good movie i wish more fight  but its great movie  gozilla king of the monster
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome effects and great monster action the story was average but i liked how they are connecting the universe together bring on kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a good movie with a silly plot i expected more battles and less human interactions but the kaijus are awesome on this one and made the film worth it
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the scale and details of the action and monsters and the many great monster battles great pacing waited my entire life for this film
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is definitely a dumber movie than its 2014 predecessor the sequel lacks a lot of the tension and epic shots the original had the human story can feel a bit convoluted and a little cheesy which goes some way to making it feel like an older godzilla movie however the action scenes are much more satisfying this is an attempt to course correct what people didnt like in godzilla 2014 if youre looking for a great story you should perhaps look elsewhere if you want a summer spectacle that features monsters tearing shit up especially each other than give this one a shot
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was worth watching but very predictable
Jun 2 2019,positive,you know what i really enjoyed kotm truthfully i like it just as much as the 2014 godzilla the common criticism for kotm is that the human characters and writing are lacking in quality however i dont think thats the case i felt the characters were pretty decent and play an essential part in the story of course the fights are absolutely spectacular and the main kaiju give off a distinct personality  ghidorah especially  which makes them feel like characters in their own right its not perfect but if your a monster movie fan its a must see and dont let anybody tell you otherwise
Jun 2 2019,positive,finally the godzilla movie we have all been waiting for  epic monsters fantastic effects impressive battles
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was great if you dont like it you may not be a true godzilla fan 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great graphics had alot of action my kids loved it too
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was so exiting and action packed i was getting goosebumps the whole time
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was exciting and different kids called it cool full of action
Jun 2 2019,positive,saw it last night and jesus absolute christ what a movie  anybody who said this film had no human story was dead wrong this film had the best of all worlds  a compelling human story unbelievably good monster fights killer visual effects and an excellent soundtrack  910 would be higher if it wasnt for a few minor plot holes and the camera panning through a scene a little too fast for the comfort of my eyeballs on a couple occasions  an absolute mustsee ignore what the critics are saying  this really is the best movie of 2019
Jun 2 2019,positive,its not perfect but i still enjoyed it there are still too much human for me i might give it a second watch do not expect academy award level of writing it is a kaiju film not an oscar one 
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely fantastic had an amazing time watching this movie the moster fights were all you could ask for with some masterful imagery cant wait for the next one
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters displays a great new take on some classic godzilla monsters from the original films the script was nothing to brag about with some cheesy lines from some of the cast but the plot held the film together well with some top of the range effects and monster action however there were far to many scenes of monsters conseald by water or weather conditions another issue i had was the lack of the city destruction we all associate with the godzilla name overall its a must see for any monster movie fan with great effects a good amount of action and spectacular creature moments
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is definitevely a mustsee it recovers element of the classic gives it a new fresh adaptation and in general its epic as it involves titanic and catastrophiclike action
Jun 2 2019,positive,visually stunning i have never witnessed a film of this magnitude in the cinemas please go watch  it and have a blast longlivetheking 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great godzilla movie better then captain marvel shit
Jun 2 2019,negative,damnit humans stay out of the monster fights
Jun 2 2019,positive,really well done  it wasnt quite as dramatic or complete as the first but it was a good movie  these new godzilla movies are way above any of the other godzilla movies done before
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it  i dont know what the critics wanted  it was action i always wanted  yes the dialogue could have been better and some of the jokes could have been al it better  other than that the action was phenomenal
Jun 2 2019,positive,this godzilla movie wasnt a blockbuster many anticipated but it was a pretty decent film the plotlines were all over the place the monster battles were okay godzilla kom will be number one its opening weekend and will make some money but dont be surprised that it doesnt exceed expectations
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was an epic movie very well thought out great special effects  a nice modern look at tohos iconic monsters excellent summer movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,great monster battles  i find the subplots pointless but it gives actors a job
Jun 2 2019,neutral,i honestly cannot see how this movie got such a high audience score there were maybe 20 to 25 minutes of this movie where it actually had the monsters fighting the rest of it consisted of a very weak plot meaningless and avoidable self sacrifice a poorly written story of redemption and crappy plot devices hamfisted writing aside it was not a bad movie and it was fairly action packed  
Jun 2 2019,negative,fell asleep twice so boring
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely fantastic the fight scenes were some of the best monster actions scenes i have ever seen the imagery was beautifully executed yes a bit of the human plot was a bit silly but overall this movie was amazing 
Jun 2 2019,positive,for what it is its a terrific film  a delightfully chaotic storm of action and destruction with strong performances from its actors  very much meant to be seen on as large a screen as possible
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre into godzilla youre gonna love it
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster battle movie we have all been waiting for
Jun 2 2019,negative,so many improvements with cgi make all the titans look and sound great its too bad that the entire movie is destroyed by poor acting poor dialogue poor human storylines and godawful representation of military personnel skip it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,omg it was awesome a must see  graphics  special effects  scenes  and so much more
Jun 2 2019,negative,too much dialog between the actors not enough clear monster fighting or scenes with monsters in it  movie was also very dark
Jun 2 2019,positive,the plot was good it stayed on track just enough humor to keep the edge off the characters were developed it was good to see the historic significance of the ancient titians godzilla seemed to evolve through his weaknesses lots of unanswered questions were revealed which helped the movie  goer who never saw a godzilla film much better than the one made a few years ago millie bobby brown was a good actress in this film as the sort of the child savior that helped keep perspective not going to spoil anything but it ended how i thought it would id go see it again with friends who hadnt seen it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzillakotm met all of my expectations and more  the special affects were amazing nonstop action from beginning to end their are some touching moments where you feel for the creatures and characters  definitely the best movie so far this year 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was great im a long time godzilla fan it was even better than the first one it perfectly incorporated what kong skull island godzilla brought to the table and cranked everything to 11 this franchise is just getting started and i cant wait to see whats next
Jun 2 2019,positive,who watches godzilla for the story no one we care about the monsters and the fights and they were absolutely amazing the story is as good as a godzilla story can get people just have a huge stick up their behinds
Jun 2 2019,positive,highly recommend the godzilla movie me and my wife are having godzilla costumes made zila and godzilla mr and mrs that is see you in halloween
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics just dont their little thought bubble is so far removed from everyone else that most of them cant really see this movie as what we see it is   anyway this movie is all about the monsters thats it the humans are just there to move the story along and their logic and reasons arent that very important the movie maker does put some effort into making the plot somewhat coherent though the critics can keep raving on and on about muh story but theyre missing the point it also clearly mean they never watch or didnt really like the original godzilla movies and dont understand what it is about because godzilla kotm is in many ways very similar to original godzilla movies with the awesome monster battles that makes you feel excited like a little kid again and not for having an existential crisis or deep philosophical thoughts you know youre watching a kaiju movie coming in so you should know what youre getting into just sit back and enjoy the spectacle  with that rant over i have to say i really like the movie legendary listened to the fans criticism of the first remake 2014 and that makes me really happy ive watch it myself twice already and will watch it again with my friends and family i highly recommend the movie if you just want to have a good time and hope you have a great experience
Jun 2 2019,negative,the movie was so boring i even fall asleep for part of it
Jun 2 2019,neutral,the cgi was great the story line and dialogue were hideous i had more fun explaining to people how bad the story was that it made up for having watched it  here are 5 things ive learned watching this movie 1 the us military are incompetent 2 terrorist know exactly when a new technology is going to work 3 women are crazy no wait it already knew that 3 soldering in the rain is easy 4 detonation velocity is not a thing anymore 5 we need to stop manmade disasters with manmade solutions that are disastrous
Jun 2 2019,positive,full of action great story line epic battles a must see
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a longtime fan of the series i absolutely loved this film   a lot of care was taken into the monster designs and staying true to the feel of the original films   there were also quite a few references to the original series for fans to pick up on and that was a real treat     the story line was definitely silly and unbelievable and there were some cheesy lines of dialogue but to me even those flaws had a charm to them   it kept me entertained from start to finish and featured some incredibly epic monster battles   this is the american adaptation fans have been waiting for
Jun 2 2019,positive,exactly what you expect from a godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a movie about giant monsters what else where you expecting
Jun 2 2019,positive,different style than the first one but great execution loved it the only issue for me was sometimes knowing who was talking because bradley whitford and kyle chandler can sound kind of alike but thats so small a detail interesting to see the modern take on the monsters and the og godzilla is insanely awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,an amazing godzilla experience if you have any love for giant monsters please see this
Jun 2 2019,positive,a bombastic ride with gorgeous visuals and heart the finest of the western godzilla adaptations and a must see for fans of the genre
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of action not much room for much else the audience clapped at the conclusion not too bad for that kind of film score was really good
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved it so much i saw it twice
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was awesome great action sequences and many easter eggs alluding to the original series
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monsters were awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,being a godzilla fan since my youth this movie was great i would honestly give it with a bias opinion an 810 45 the only reason im giving it 5 stars however in this review is because the critics didnt do it justice
Jun 2 2019,positive,a magnificent monster movie cool monsters great story
Jun 2 2019,positive,great action sequences but some plot holes 
Jun 2 2019,positive,big godzilla fan loved it everyone was clapping at the end
Jun 2 2019,positive,great action good storylines great build up
Jun 2 2019,negative,big disappointment the original was better and it stunk
Jun 2 2019,positive,attention dont believe these top movie critics their perception of the movie is subjective and is not the same as everyone else    if your a godzilla fan like myself then you will enjoy this movieits very fun and the special fx is fantastic as for the story i understand it the plot its similar to the older godzilla movies where there always an alien race  or an earthling  that wants to put the planet in chaos  then the heroes will come to save the day monsters and humans combining forces to defeat the villains but  the real reason to watch this os for the fight scenes between godzilla and his nemesis king ghidorah the movie also stays true to tohos franchise with an updated twist so whether your new to this franchise or if you have been following the series from day one like myself like watching creature feature on saturday mornings then you will enjoy this movie
Jun 2 2019,negative,mind numbing  voted worst screen play in the warning very low bar history of monster movies  the biggest plot alert disappointment  godzilla lives on to make another movie  how is it possible  damn he or she just wont die hopefully it wont be this group of producers writers and directors that do the deed next time
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla sounded original
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is the giant monsters allout attack ive wanted
Jun 2 2019,negative,took the boy 9 year old to see it he said the 2014 godzilla was better he was frustrated at the moms decision making her decision making killed millions of innocent lives btw my boy is right he also said that almost all cursing was unnecessary  my boy is right on that one as well and im proud of him for seeing garbage for garbage my opinion is that some of the cursing almost seemed silly almost like the writers dont know how to curse haha  the whole way home he told me the story they should have told my opinion is that the best part is the monsters battling it out need more monsters and less humans in the end i love that hollywood pushes the 13 year old girl has to save the world and parents are dumb oh and that every marriage is broken last time i went to the movies was to see that same trope in bumblebee 13 year old girl in a broken home saved the world too im obviously not a 13 year old girl and am clearly not the target audience i guess lol i used to go to the movies every month now i go once a year see you in december when girl from a broken home saves the universe in star wars oh wait that is real lol so creative
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont overthink this one its a monster movie i loved it the monsters looks insane the battles were intense and entertaining cant wait for the next one
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought the godzilla movie was great had a mixture of characters and monsters when together almost perfectly the only thing that i dislike was the brief moments of silence during the fight scenes when the wendy at human emotion segments where being placed up front but other than that the movie was a great movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,forget what the critics say about this movie if you are a true die hard godzilla fan like myself having grown up on the vhs black and whites to the the colored ones to the modern era movies japanese and american this is the movie we all deserved growing up go see this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,yes   its an absolute must see we seen it last night in dolby theater and the sound system was amazing  i recommend that you see it in imax or dolby thx
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is loud fun and entertaining i am not a huge godzilla fan but i really enjoyed this one
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was exactly what i thought it was going to b monsters fighting monsters which was awesome but the acting was subpar
Jun 2 2019,positive,the humans got in the way of fights at times my only complaint overall it was definitely a godzilla movie inspired by godzilla movies so if youve never liked those dont bother seeing it if youre a fan like me or someone who has kids that are old enough to not be scared of giant dinosaurs go see the film   tons of monsters more titan lore final fight was great and i cant wait for the next one the graphics sound and camera work were amazing as well every shot of the monsters was a work of art you can use as a computer wallpaper or slap on a poster the film was done by a true godzilla fan that just needed to tweak the amount of times the humans popped up during fight shots by far though best american godzilla movie ever go go godzilla    last thing dont forgot to stay after all credits roll
Jun 2 2019,positive,too much talky not enough chompy
Jun 2 2019,negative,i walked out 45 mins into the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,saw it twice with a buddy who loved the old movies its a film for fans of old godzilla its a film for kaiju battles long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsterss huge cgi fights arent enough to save it from its poorly written characters and extremely exposition heavy dialogue
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it total blast from the getgo
Jun 2 2019,positive,very entertaining pretty much what i wanted from the movie critic reviews are so disconnected from the audiences now the critic raiting shouldnt even be show anymore 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this film is basically a fan fest at its best    critics hate this film because they want to see  the monsters make a debate instead of a real fight
Jun 2 2019,positive,loves the action great time
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic dont believe the critics the visuals the story and the music were breathtaking it is a must see this summer
Jun 2 2019,positive,the action is epic with the monsters and a fair amount of worldbuilding done complements it for what comes next 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster designs were cool the actors were fine but i did think they could of paced some of their scenes better some scenes dragged with the human characters
Jun 2 2019,positive,love this godzilla movie we are big kaiju moster fans and this one had them all it was a fun show with hints of more to come if you like monster movies you will like this one a lot
Jun 2 2019,negative,over rated i found it really hard to care about the characters or what they were doing even lots of noise from every giant monster  not much reason to care
Jun 2 2019,positive,great special effects great 3d imaging good performances same old story
Jun 2 2019,negative,im a huge godzilla fan and i should have loved this movie the problem is it is more concerned with the human characters than the stars of the show the monsters more often than not monster action takes a back seat so the movie can focus on human drama instead though passably entertaining for action movie fans this will be disappointing for fans of godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,spectacular monster brawl great homages to godzilla and the supporting kaiju king ghidorah again proves why he is godzilla greatest rival i will admit that this plot isnt great but its not boring alot of charcters are one offs but this movie never made me bored like the first     another big plus is the performance milly bobbie brown vera farmiga and ken wantanabe are all enjoyable to watch the plot is simple and does flesh out the vera farmigas evil plan     tbh this movie has great monster fun and deserves more love than hate for only being the 3rd american godzilla movie this is a step in the right direction yes the story shouldve been better but visually these creatures were the show if you enjoyed godzilla and the rampagedestruction that the kaiju brought then the movie pretty much did its job human characters are not the point of the godzilla movie sorry thats the truth you want a badly paced and godzilla movie watch godzilla vs spacegodzilla king of the monsters isnt nowhere close to the atrocity of pacing that movie brings    longlivetheking
Jun 2 2019,neutral,its alright but they still failed to capture whats great about a godzilla movie the monsters should have personalities there was too much awful predictable exposition concerning the actors you know exactly what is going to happen when someone says go without me im right behind you
Jun 2 2019,positive,like it but it not the best movie of the year
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie presents us with great action scenes so many kaiju battles that keep your eyes focus on the screen although the action scenes great some dialogue is just straight and flat with no actual progress of something so dont expect it to be a storyrich movie lastly this movie is rewatchable for those who want to see nonstop action scenes again
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie in general but i must say its a very loud movie with lots of transitions from dark to bright
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved iti wouldnt consider myself a monster fan but ive always enjoyed watching godzilla minus that terrible lizard rendition in 1998 action was awesome it was good to see the different titans from the whole godzilla lore you wouldnt think there would be many emotional scenes from a movie with a bunch of big monsters fighting but there were
Jun 2 2019,positive,a movie that deserves way more credit for delivering the spectacle the audience wanted and not contrived overly complex story the critics would want  godzilla king of monsters is a great visual film that is beyond a feast for the eyes
Jun 2 2019,positive,great kaiju battles great cast amazing music  military being in the dark and so under aggressive seemed unlikely but fun movie nevertheless
Jun 2 2019,positive,very entertaining movie from start to finish
Jun 2 2019,positive,so many references to the classic godzilla legendary has done a fantastic job on the franchise and this movie is no exception if you like kaiju movies this is a must see
Jun 2 2019,positive,what a fantastic movie from the titans cast and story it is everything youd want in a godzilla monsterverse see it at an imax to this movie justice absolutely worth it
Jun 2 2019,positive,  i really enjoyed the movie i thought the human story was acceptable unlike in the 2014 film which dont get me wrong ioved the human plot actually has a direct impact on what happens with the kaiju you know what the story felt like the sort of subplot weve seen in multiple toho godzilla movies it wasnt amazing but neither did i feel it crashed and burned like so many professional critics have claimed yeah there were a few cringe worthy one liners but overall it got the job done    thats not what i was there for though and in regards to onscreen monster action kotm operates on an entirely new level of awesome not only are the creature designs outstanding each clash is choreographed with its own distinct feel so  unlike the transformers movies which essentially replay the same exact fight for two hours  the action here never feels repetitive    the monster mash ups are exciting and they invested the kaiju with a fair amount of personality rodan and mothra in particular are standouts    there are a multitude of call backs both visually and musically  the gojira theme is back and i suspect fans will cheer when they see where and how its employed and its clear this was made by people who love godzilla for people who love godzilla     out of  stars i can forgive any weaknesses in the human drama because this movie is a perfect engine of kaiju action that understands the qualities which make this mythology so beloved to begin with i may take heat for this but i think this is the best godzilla movie since the 1950s original see it on the big screen
Jun 2 2019,positive,perfect blend of what i have come to love about toho godzilla and the americanized version great job
Jun 2 2019,positive,it has dumb human characters but i got all the emotional drama i need from the monster fights
Jun 2 2019,positive,for all godzilla fans this is a must must must must see movie she godzilla and all his glory and weakness you can get no value in this perfect set up for godzilla versus king kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was awesome im not a big fan of godzilla but this movie blew me away just wish i had watch it on imax it would had been way better
Jun 2 2019,negative,im not a professional critic nor a movie snob i am a guy who enjoys watching movies  with that being said  godzilla wasnt very good  i wanted it to be but i left the theatre unimpressed    the concept surrounding the movie was descent  the execution was poor  the subplots seemed forced and unnecessary  i wouldnt recommend it unless you are looking to mindlessly pass the time
Jun 2 2019,positive,monster mayhem with carefully constructed creatures emphasized with mythbuilding observations by the human characters   partially this story has me pine for the days when the japanese clearly didnt know what to do with the story while the monsters clashed so they threw in sentient alien cockroaches toy robots and psychics yeah  that kind of godzilla is what we need
Jun 2 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyable a great ride from start to finish loved the easter eggs sound track and the monsters were truly jaw dropping
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie does what it sets out to do giant monsters amazing battles and a whole lot more godzilla and after the 2014 movie i truly believe this is a step up from that movie in every single way
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla was a great movie with a lot of easter eggs good fighting scenes and never felt like a dull moment there were times in which rhe acting felt forced or convoluted but it meshed well with how the movie was going  its a great movie to see but could be better in some areas 45 stars
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything a good godzilla movie needs  lots of monsters an actual decent plot for the humans and lots of the big guy himself  
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is a great action movie if you love transformers you will love this movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,some of the scenes dragged a bit but overall i loved the film and thought it did the franchise proper justice
Jun 2 2019,positive,the designs of the titans are spectacular and the cgi is top notch throughout the flick if you want to see giant monsters beat the sh out of each other this is the movie for you
Jun 2 2019,positive,i absolutely loved the movie from beginning to end the action was elite the emotion and acting was great godzilla is a must see of 2019    top 5 of 2019 for sure in my honest opinion
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved it ive been watching godzilla movies since i was old enough ride my bike to the library to rent them and i thought dougherty did a great job of honoring the old toho films and bringing in some new ideas to the monsterverse 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is great for everyone that likes scifi fantasy action anime monsters then this movie is a must see
Jun 2 2019,negative,overall i did not particularly care for the acting in godzilla king of the monsters also the movie scenes were too dark and busy for me to truly enjoy the titan fight scenes as i normally do i did not enjoy this movie and struggled to stay engaged
Jun 2 2019,positive,its was a great movie a must watch
Jun 2 2019,positive,i really dont understand how you can think this movie is anything less than sensational if you grew up watching these movies then this is the mecca of the godzilla universe 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i really enjoyed it i have been watching godzilla movies since i was a kid and i was very excited when this one came out and it was a very well made movie lots of action
Jun 2 2019,negative,the plot was absurd the monster action was less than i expected they made the similar mistake that game of thrones did this season with too much smoke and elements around the actual fighting and to close it out with the monsters bowing to godzilla and then the last second news clips that the deranged scientists vision was correct was mailed in my 10 year old son and his buddy seemed to enjoy it but i thought it was weak from the plot execution and ending
Jun 2 2019,positive,about what youd expect from a godzilla movie plot line was decent special effects and fights were epic
Jun 2 2019,positive,i liked it but it was too long for me
Jun 2 2019,positive,great  monsters  
Jun 2 2019,negative,i just added this movie to my list of worst movies ever
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a awesome movie i loved the story the monsters looked real and gorgeous love the fight scenes bring more movies legendary bring more
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing godzilla movie  i dont know what these critics are thinking but you go to godzilla movies for monsters and this one is packed with it  if you are a giant monster movie fan this movie is for you
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie special effects were great and the movie paid homage to the toho movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,great start from beginning to end great monster action better than avengers long live the king 
Jun 2 2019,positive,best godzilla movie ever if you grew up watching these movies youll love this one everything you want in a godzilla movie dont listen to the critics go see it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are a godzilla fan you will love it the audience i sat with were exceptional fans  it was a great movie
Jun 2 2019,negative,lousy plot nonstop destruction awful acting
Jun 2 2019,positive,love the use of the original movie scores just wish toho would have let wb use more of the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,i like monster movies and really enjoyed this one
Jun 2 2019,positive,my review of godzilla king of the monsters im a life long fan of godzilla and all of the old school cheesy films i saw godzilla 2014 three times in theater i have never seen another movie that many times in theaters so ive essentially waited my entire life for an american made godzilla movie with godzilla mothra rodan and the almighty king ghidorah to be in and to duke it out with american visual effects to just make it as epic as possible     with all of that being said for me this was the single greatest godzilla movie that ive ever seen it blew my mind it was huge beautiful and just perfectly made the monsters were everything i hoped for and more this was the ultimate godzilla movie the characters were great the fights were nothing short of epic the movie i waited forever for delivered to the highest degree if youre a fan of godzilla obviously this is a must see but if youre just a fan of great action packed thrilling blockbuster movies with a great cast and great monsters then give it a shot you wont be disappointed    this is also the longest and most detailed movie review ive ever done if thats any inkling of how i feel about this movie and godzilla himself 1010
Jun 2 2019,positive,more godzilla and more monsters than the one that came out in 2014 also millie bobby brown made the film even better
Jun 2 2019,positive,i was born in 1970 so the godzilla movie im used to was so much different i loved the new style
Jun 2 2019,positive,a movie that delivers what fans of the franchise and new comers can enjoy dont go to this film expecting got levels of story this is a monster film sit back and enjoy the visuals and a narrative that takes the film forward to an end just like a really really good rollercoaster at the end you might like the film just as much as i did that it will leaving you wanting to queue up in line to go again i would recommend for anyone and everyone to go see for such a fantastic and thrillingly fun ride if you are looking for a super deep and meaningful movie do not go youll be going in with the wrong mind set and expectation which i think a lot of these negative critics are doing trying to compare this film to nowadays expected level of storytelling this is not what this film or this ip is about the story serves its purpose with a simple message with no need to really pick holes into it if you are doing that then again youve gone in with the wrong mindset and expectations and this film will not satisfy you i am a godzilla fan i have seen every film in the franchise am i being biased possibly to most likely yes but as a fan i can tell you this film to me is awesome as a fan of the franchise and the genre i see the plot i see the depth not that its complicated or too simple its because i want to find it and i did indeed find it in this film i dont think youll find any meaning to this film unless it clicks with you and you have an interest to go deeper i went with my wife and my parents who are not fans of godzilla but are aware of it thanks to fan boy here my wife enjoyed the latest king kong giving her a level of interest of the genre but has told me she is not a fan of godzilla and found the movies weird weli what a surprise i had when my wife actually started to get into the film and she is not a fan at times she grabbed my hand as the film captivated her so much that just like a rollercoaster she held my hand when things got really intense when we got home she wanted to watch the 2014 godzilla converted maybe no she started telling me that king kong will kick godzillas ass oh how i laughed my mother is not a fan and she was cheering and enjoying the film i did explain to her before we left that its just a bit of fun dont take it to seriously and even said its just a bit of mindless fun it seemed my advice payed off not seen my mother react to a film like that ever she left that film with a smile my dad who id say i share more movie interests with than my wife and mother said the film was alright for a godzilla film he is also not a fan the film was mediocre for him not that he didnt like the film but it didnt really appeal to him as much as my wife and mother this was a shock for me as he is a fan of fantasy and scifi if i was to bet id of said my father would have enjoyed the film whilst my wife and my mother would of more likely not quite the film as much that showed me that this film does indeed have the ability to captivate and amaze those who would not really think of ever going to see these kind of films therefore this is a really good and fun ride of a film that all should consider go seeing even if its not really something youd go out of your way to see go for that bit of fun and a blast and yes this film is a blast have fun
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of monsters  exactly what a kaiju film should be turn the brain off and enjoy a funnostalgic summer blockbuster  7310  good  all the kaiju godzilla king ghidorah rodan mothra  third act  the monster fight sequences  the visual effects cgi  the cinematography  the musical score  nostalgia factor original godzilla score original mothra score godzilla roar  mythology    okay   performances  concept    bad  script issues  concept execution
Jun 2 2019,positive,slow in some spots but it was great to see them bring back all of the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,the humans were boring and not particularly likeable but the monsters were cool 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i line the old nostalgic bad ass feel the movie gives
Jun 2 2019,positive,stayed true to the old movies of godzilla for those who didnt grow up watching godzilla over the years talking 60s and 70s you might be a bit confused with the movie just read up about how the monsters came to be really loved the movie hope you do too
Jun 2 2019,positive,had a great time seeing this movie truly an awsome experience 
Jun 2 2019,positive,very entertaining movie it was definitely an experience in imax the sound and visuals were phenomenal and the way the action was filmed felt like you were right there with the characters i can understand some of the critics complaints about the plot jumping around and it being difficult to see the action sometimes but those are minor nitpicks and they did not take away from the joy of the experience i dont know why critics dont understand how to judge this film for what it is a summer blockbuster not citizen kane or gone with the wind the whole theater was cheering laughing jumping out of their seat and clapping throughout the movie i took a group of 20 people to see the movie in imax they were godzilla fans non godzilla fans men women and children everyone rated the film 85 or higher out of 10 after the movie 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,plot twists were predictable and typical  the acting was horrible especially unbelievable was godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,i absolutely loved it definitely takes it back to what toho has always designed godzilla to do only thing missing was the aliens that normally controls the other monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a good godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,ive been watching godzilla for as long as i can remember this movie by far is the best godzilla movie to date i personally feel like the progression of the human characters progresses well and theres no shortage in raw kaiju action this movie does well showing a sense of scale when it comes to revealing the kaijus theres alot here that gareth edwrds godzilla2014 was truly missing this movie is nearly flawless i plan on watching it again within the next week highly reccomended 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i hate critics  godzilla is a great movie  typical of the genre  no real surprises but also not expecting academy awards  just very entertaining  glad i saw it on the big screen
Jun 2 2019,negative,dragged on too long and the storyline left a lot to be desired disappointed in the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,some parts of the movie were fantastic others not so much would have been 5 stars if some of the characters were removed that seemed annoying on screen
Jun 2 2019,positive,tldr  if and only if youre a godzilla fan this is an absolute mustsee on every level narrative mistakes be damned     first off let me preface this by saying yes  im a a huge godzilla fan have been for all my life as evidenced by my massive collection of godzila figures clothing and even my tattoo of the big g that adorns my left bicep whether or not you are a fan will deeply impact your opinion of this movie as it is a big overstuffed blockbuster in the vein of the maligned bayformers movies the difference here is that the creative team behind kotm clearly are godzilla fans and it is reflected throughout the course of the film     from a narrative standpoint this movie has issues while i will say that the main characters were far more interesting than the piecemeal cardboard cutouts from the 2014 film sans brian cranston it was laughable how mark the films main character just happened to know all of the right information at exactly the right time he was an expert in everything and knew just what to do at the right time given how he was on a ship with literal monster experts for a good chunk of the movie they easily could have split his dialogue with designated expository characters like ken wantanabes serizawa to humanize him a bit better its also worth noting that sadly like the aforementioned bayformers movies a lot of humor simply doesnt land though when it does its outright hilarious as is the sheer sustainability of the main cast you can suspend your disbelief as much as you want there is no conceivable way anyone could have survived the monster brawls that happened directly over them while the scurried about like helpless ants     minor spoilers from here on out    but the oxygen destroyer was the biggest missed opportunity in the plot being the narrative heart and soul of the very first movie it only serves to have a glorified cameo here now at the films beginning we see a congressional panel grilling monarch about their supposed failure to monitor these creatures  why not introduce the oxygen destroyer here with the government saying this is monarchs last chance or this weapon will be used to wipe the beasts out it also would have better explained why the films surprise villain does what they do as if the beasts werent released they would have been easy targets for the weapon it would created an interesting question  is there a right time to play god and if so when and how much of the natural order should be preserved at the cost of human existence sure the movie touches on these questions but in the films current state there is something more to be desired     beyond that though this movie served as a love letter for godzilla fans by godzilla fans the biggest issue from the 2014 film was godzillas was relegation to a supporting roll in his own film that is remedied here as the conflict between him and the enigmatic monster zero is the core of the films plot as the two battle for supremacy in their prehistoric food chain most importantly the personalities of the monsters are inline with their original counterparts supporting monsters mothra and rodan are handled with care and respect although the latter does unfortunately get lost in the shuffle after his epic debut it is understandable though given how packed to the gills this movie is with action setpieces and visual eyecandy to a normal viewer this may seem like chaos for the sake of chaos but to fans like me this is hollywood simply making up for lost time    whether it be the phenomenal score that features modern renditions of the classic akira ifakube tunes the sound design that brilliantly recreates the sounds of these titans or the cutting edge visual effects the creative team learned from their eastern forefathers to deliver a product that honors godzillas legacy something that can hardly be said of the previous two american iterations your mileage may vary but as a lifelong fan and especially as a massachusetts resident and red sox fan this movie while certainly not perfect was a grand slam 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is the best godzilla movie go go godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,i watch it yesterday is very nice movie and epic and my all friends love it too 
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont believe in most of the critics sure this movie is ridiculous but its so ridiculously good it pays so much homage to the original source that your geek glands will burst with such joy and satisfaction i dont know what the japanese will think when they see this but it delivers all the monster fighting goodness that godzilla has been doing since the 50s even though the monsters and the buildings they destroy are cgi and not physically real like the guys in rubber suits the amount of detail they put in those monsters gives them more huge and deep then ever before and you will feel so small all hail the king of the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,my 13 year old son thought this was the best godzilla movie ever made  and i agreed wholeheartedly the storyline was relevant to modern day issues and the action cinematography and sound effects were second to none go see it
Jun 2 2019,positive,hits the wickets for long time godzillatoho fans several easter eggs that go back to original 1950s movie   actually a sequel to the 2014 release and the 2nd in a 3 series run but you dont have to see the 2014 version prior to this one  some fans may hope for more monsteronmonster action but  its actually got a plot  some humor a twist or two and some character development so that was a surprise but still satisfies as a giant disaster monster movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,i wanted to see them fight and i got exactly what i wanted 
Jun 2 2019,positive,enjoyed the monsters however the people characters were wooden
Jun 2 2019,positive,no matter who tried to say this movie was all out awesome they brought up the og soundtracks monsters and monsterhistory originally developed by toho into this present day film and i was not disappointed superb action packed and amazing godzilla is truly king of the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,excellent storyline creatures amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is a great movie if you are a godzillatoho fan perfect cgi and lots of action as for the human interactions ive could have done without the family drama
Jun 2 2019,positive,every godzilla fan needs to see this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,action packed  a must see in 3d
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,monsterverses are all about monster fights thats all i need  
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun high paced movie  my boys loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome jaw dropping and beautiful
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is what it is  we go to see godzilla and co smash up and stomp each other  the plot was bad i mean real bad  bad bad however youre there for one reason monster fighting and wow that delivers  the monsters and fight scenes were easily 5 stars  im giving it 3 stars overall only due to the plethora of time wasted on the humanfamily plot  and that part really drags and is horrendous  golden question would i pay to see it again nope but it is well worth it to go see it once in a the theater
Jun 2 2019,negative,while not as bad as i thought it was going to be its still pretty bad  the character development is horrific and way to much exposition takes place  the fight scenes are also framed terribly bad in a couple of scenes  overall this movie is a major disappointment  the motives of the protagonists are very unclear and the ending makes absolutely no sense  while not a total dud there is no chance id ever sit through or recommend this film to anyone
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,rotten tomatoes is pure garbage im going to shove my godzilla toy i bought up rotten tomatoes ass and watch their tiny brain drain out godzilla is great btw
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was okay what do you expect it was a godzilla movie the monsters where the biggest ive ever seen
Jun 2 2019,positive,for a real godzilla fan its all amazing maybe its not a good movie for some people but to me the most important part is get to see the everything i remember from the original version those are beautiful memories and this movie really nailed these 
Jun 2 2019,positive,a little cheesy but it was enjoyable
Jun 2 2019,positive,liked that they showed godzilla more unlike the first part but did not like that the fighting scenes were not long enough
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie just saw it last night with my wife we had a great time 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was so much fun i cant wait for kong vs godzilla    definitely worth seeing i cant explain the critic score after seeing the movie what movie did they watch
Jun 2 2019,positive,got what i wanted the movie to be a fun movie
Jun 2 2019,negative,we could not understand what part of monster movie these guys dont get but they still dont throw in bad acting and cast why is the phone guy in this that tries to tell a story that should not be there i sure that when they make the next one they will let kong win again too waste of money
Jun 2 2019,positive,kept old themes music and added great graphics
Jun 2 2019,positive,another strong step forward for this new franchise theres a lot in here to please both modern audiences and godzilla fans it shares some of the same pitfalls past godzilla movies have but everything i liked about it designs shot composition classic godzilla references it was all enough to outshine those pitfalls
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a monster movie made to entertain not an oscar aspiration movie its fun and cant wait for the sequel 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the special effects were awesome as the monsters were represented well in all their glory my biggest problem with this movie is once again the monsters in the background during fight scenes while the main focus is on the actors who should be the stars in your godzilla movies warner brothers the monsters thats who i know star power brings out others who are not familiar with the godzilla world but weve had two movies that have introduced this world to this generation let the monsters shine in your future films i give this movie 4 stars for being fun and godzilla and the monsters being represented well but actors who are put front and centered a little too much
Jun 2 2019,positive,epic blockbuster movie of the summer 2019    
Jun 2 2019,positive,they finally got it right with this one more of the monsters fighting and alot less of showing of the military good throwbacks to the old movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,very entertaining high adrenaline  used lots of bits from previous movies so it didnt start a whole new story line
Jun 2 2019,positive,the best way to continue the monster verse in my opinion a simple story and incredible and astonishing kaiju battle with some of the most famous monsters like king ghidorah rodan and mothra
Jun 2 2019,positive,i enjoyed it with my 8 year old son perfect big dumb  loud summer movie to lose yourself in for a few hours lots of fan service in this movie but thats ok very cool effects  cgi fun
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster scenes were good the b rate acting was not  it was entertaining as the type of movie it is supposed to be  wont win any oscars
Jun 2 2019,positive,bad story silly dialogue and cheesy acting but also visually stunning fight scenes between monsters which is exactly what i paid for took a little too long to get there but once youre there its worth it just dont come looking for a groundbreaking story 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,first 30 minutes is an action movie about a family you dont care about then becomes a liberal environmental film for awhile it did get much better the last 35 minutes or so when monsters became focul point monster fighting scenes were great not much else
Jun 2 2019,positive,its sad that an epic film like godzilla king of the monsters isnt celebrated for delivering exactly what it intended lots of monster stomping action mixed wfine performances from talented actors in a story that despite critics senseless whining is just fine thank you legendary brought our beloved godzilla to the big screen like never before gkotm is everything that any godzillakaijumonster fan could want  more
Jun 2 2019,positive,mind blowing a lot of godzilla scenes  also what we all want to a lot of monster action i loved it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was awesome the special effects are still improving and it was especially thrilling in the special theater with the 4dx it was like a thrill ride while watching the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a godzilla fan  i loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,wall to wall facemeltingly awesome so very very very very cool everything i could have ever hoped for from a godzilla movie and more 
Jun 2 2019,negative,cgi saturated chaos the only character to bond with the girl from stranger things and thats the point the committee that put this together forgot the human touch in their rush to amass seismic moments the japanese guy in a rubber suit godzilla wins every time 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the plot line is what it is the actors wont win an academy award but who cares this is what godzilla fans have been waiting for big time fun with big time monsters the score brought back memories from the old days let the critics have their opinions but dont listen to them if you want to have a smashing good time
Jun 2 2019,positive,sadly cant verify my ticket due to the fact that i saw the movie on an air force base in enlgand but with that said this movie is great plenty of kaijou idk if i spelled that right screen time and packed with action i really dont know why critics hate it overall very entertaining
Jun 2 2019,negative,editing was horrible characters where one place and then a second later someplace else storyline confusing in the beginning
Jun 2 2019,positive,is a good movie the scene of accion the suspense the surprise of the final scene is wonderful
Jun 2 2019,positive,i had an absolute blast being a huge godzilla fan it did not disappoint the plot was only okay the flaws in this movie are drowned out the epicness of the action sequences the monsters are beautiful and the sound shakes you to the core highly recomnded
Jun 2 2019,positive,monsters were great people were dumb
Jun 2 2019,positive,i love this movie as a child i loved all the godzilla movies but this one i enjoyed the most i will see this movie again
Jun 2 2019,positive,great action and the fight scenes are spectacular but the plot lacked substance 
Jun 2 2019,positive,its not perfect however they did a much better job blending the human element with what everyone cane to see aka the kiaju dukeing it out the monsters where designed to perfection 
Jun 2 2019,positive, all we need is the giant monsters fight
Jun 2 2019,positive,the action and graphics were awesome  the acting not so much
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of easter eggs and monster action coulda gone with less drama but thats hollywood
Jun 2 2019,positive,dope movie action packed
Jun 2 2019,negative,if you liked the others im sure you will with this too but for me i did not this one again there was just no story line it was all fighting and nothing else

Jun 2 2019,negative,just a bad story very hard too watch i started too fall asleep 
Jun 2 2019,positive,for true godzilla and kaiju fans the critics got this one wrong and are so out of touch with the audience you goto a godzilla movie to see godzilla and how his story unfolds and intertwines with other characters and monsters  im excited and hopeful for a next installment btw they nailed the original toho monsters
Jun 2 2019,negative,hands down the worst movie ever such a painful experience likened to something like child birth speaking of which do not take children to this movie as that would be a form of child abuse   sadly just another atrocity of a so called blockbuster 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was great and it had a lot if action keep u on the edge of your set

Jun 2 2019,positive,it has better mythos for a monster and has a lot of raw natural emotions of its world the work done for the behavior of the monsters is greatly visible the sound effects were soo on point that at times the whole theatre was shaking the world of these monsters is love able and makes you want more
Jun 2 2019,positive,the first 23 part of the movie was great   but the last part of it is kinda tragic the human parts ruined it the music in the movie is stunning  i love the remake version of the mothra theme very goosebumps

Jun 2 2019,neutral,its a godzilla movie alright the effects are great but dont expect much of a unpredictable plot like i said its a godzilla movie but my 13 year old daughter absolutely loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,i have no idea what critics as always are saying this movie was great popcorn fun in 2014 they complained of not enough monsters now in 2019 not enough character development who cares is godzilla king of the monsters the movie gives exactly what i expected monsters lots of them so let them fight  and fight they did and you could actually see them fight non of that hazy smokey effects you want to have some fun go see godzilla king of the monsters i am so ready for godzilla vs kong bring it
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are a godzilla nerd like me you will love this movie the opening sequence with the thump thump thump of his feet and that classic roar the cgi was wonderful and brining most of the classic monsters back was great i loved the fact that a black woman was one of the leaders and other ethnic minorities and women were both on the good and bad side of the equation an excellent movie with great fight scenes a little drama and wonderful sound saw it at an imax theater long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,i love the kaijus very much
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are a real godzilla fan then this movie is for you the actionfight scenes were awesome and the human to monster ratio was pretty darn good especially when compared to the last godzilla movie i believe it is a huge step up and improvement from the 2014 godzilla and i enjoyed the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,fckk critics movie is amazing af
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was honestly a great godzilla movie plenty of action and monster fight scenes i cant stress enough how this is a godzilla movie done right where humans seem more of a back drop worth the money and time
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was a well stitched sequel to the original and an improvised version of it it was very entertaining and enjoyable to watch long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,flawed but a lot of fun 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was surprisingly good never expected that the special effect is that awesome and story itself is good simply put will i recommend it to others yes will i watch it again if i had the chance definitely and this makes this movie a five star movie for myself
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is a great godzilla movie if you love the old ones im not talking about the mat brodrick one or any the 70s the side story is ok but the meat is there
Jun 2 2019,positive,what more do you want from a godzilla movie who cares the human side is poor this is about big monsters knocking shit out of each other and this film delivers 
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont listen to the reviews the movie is full of everything you could want from a modern kaiju film endless scenes of beautiful cinematography are the highlight of it all
Jun 2 2019,positive,  godzilla  king of the monsters  main character  godzilla    the monsterverse movies  1  godzilla 2014  2  kong  skull island  3  godzilla  king of the monsters  4  godzilla vs kong release 2020    i highly recommend watching godzilla 2014 and kong  skull island before seeing godzilla  king of the monsters  each movie tells a different story that leads to the conclusion of the monsterverse godzilla vs kong      i appreciate the love dedication and hard work that director mike dougherty placed into godzilla  king of the monsters  he paid his respects to toho co godzilla 2014 and kong  skull island with gkotm and the legend of godzilla and his kaiju pals      we enjoyed watching gkotm in an imax theater  the visuals and sound effects were mindblowing  the storyline ecoterrorism and godzilla returning to restore the natural balance were easy to follow  there are also a few easter eggs in the movie that give a nod to the thing and the exorcist      i highly recommend seeing godzilla  king of the monsters  the king of the monsters returns to kick ass and take names      we watched gkotm in an imax theater on opening day  the visual and sound effects were mindblowing  the storyline was easy to follow and the subject matter ecoterrorism is a possibility in our future      long live the king 
Jun 2 2019,positive,not all of us need to be mentally stimulated with every movie we watch after a busy week at work godzilla was the perfect movie to watch and let my brain rest for 2 hours    as for as blockbusters go it was pretty good i mean cmon its godzilla i went to see monsters fight for 2 hours and that was pretty much exactly what i got    the humans in the movie only serve to advance the plot and be annoying they are almost completely one dimensional and that is ok    you know exactly what you are getting when you walk into the cinema no twists no drama just pure action  effects look great action scenes are interesting and the sound designsoundtrack is awesome watch this if you like movies such as independence day pacific rim the mummy 1999 
Jun 2 2019,positive,a lot of fun from beginning to end with any transition to big budget film making michael dougherty had his bumpy road for this yet michael did this movie for every kid who grew up with a godzilla cassette tape and a toy dinosaur highly recommend
Jun 2 2019,positive,one of the best kaiju movies ever made i actually liked most of the human characters especially dr serizawa the monsters all had personality and an awe inspiring scale to them sound design and musical score was epic and beautiful i couldnt be happier with the film
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is an awesome mix of sound cgi and vfx at its best the only things  is we are not able to emptionaly  connect with characters film totally is worth watching and you will be lost in godzillas world 
Jun 2 2019,negative,movie was made with a poor story line acting was bad  the only good thing were the monsters fighting
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved it such fun and brought back memories of growing up with japanese monster movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,story was 710 but i was only there for the monsters and they did an amazing job with those
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely amazing  the greatest display of kaiju warfare in the history of cinema  anyone who truly appreciates godzilla genre will absolutely lose there mind this is what cgi was created for  now heres what the critics dont understand  godzilla is not gone with the wind or citizen kane  therefore  it should not be judged by the human element  we are there to see godzilla in action with the supporting cast of kaiju not human actors   if you want an epic human story line in a godzilla film replace all of the human roles with weasels and chinchillas maybe an otter for good luck  this will guarantee you a 100 score on rotten tomatoes  this movie is the greatest godzilla vs film in history  second only to the original 1956  if you grew up with godzilla as a child this is a dream come true godzilla displayed with the most advanced  cgi to date is absolutely incredible  must see it in imax  anything  else may lose a little magic   this is an epic godzilla film that will set a extremely high bar to overcome  not if bananas kong has what it takes to pull it off  time will tell
Jun 2 2019,positive,the discrepancy not only proves that professional movie critics are completely unnecessary but it is also easy to explain    these disneypaid lackeys have completely failed in making their own movies and also have wasted their time in majors like diversity in post modern vietnamese horror musicals     do you really think that they are going to allow themselves to like a godzilla film    godzilla like his other film krampus takes a sillysounding idea but has the chatacters treat it serious enough so that you never like groaning like in michael bay or roland emnerich movies    it treats the material and the fans with respect    on top of all that the characters dialogue and action are all very well done    go see it already
Jun 2 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movie ever made good job michael dougherty
Jun 2 2019,positive,this film consisted of 3 elements    1  the familyhuman drama which was included to symbolize humanities hatred and fear of godzilla at first but their gradual realization that they were actually on the same side  while this part was a little clunky it also had it redeeming moments and was a necessary element of the film especially considering  2  the exposition in the film which did take up a good chunk of the first half of the movie had the mighty task of setting up their entire monsterverse in a believable and fun fashion  it actually achieved this more successfully than one has any realistic right to expect and gave the absolutely necessary backstory and grounding necessary to attain that slight amount of suspension of disbelief necessary to be excited by skyscraper sized monsters tearing up cities  its no easy task to explain the world logic of a planet that has titans coming out of centuries long slumber but i think they pulled it off fairly well  3  some of the most spectacular giant monster action ever brought to the screen appears in this movie  even if you completely disagree with my first two points go so this for the fights and effects if you are in any way shape and form a godzilla fan  youll be glad you did
Jun 2 2019,positive,a fun brash sequel to garth edwards 2014 monster beat em up while the plot is understandably lacking as well as questionable character motives the film makes up for with glossy big visuals
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was great action packed and beautiful scenes exciting for any kaiju lover definitely on another level compared to the 2014 godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,monsters and destruction yay
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre a fan at all of the classic toho films or even of godzilla himself this is a must see love letter of a film pays huge respect and homage to the kaiju films from the past humans characters are a tad dull but theyve always been that way in godzilla films go for the main event monster fights that are so beautifully rendered on the biggest screen possible
Jun 2 2019,positive,visually stunning the story expands on the monsterrverse story nothing dramatic but story does its job
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monsters were great the only issue is the people were not
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely awesome like a love letter to all godzilla movies and all monster movies  dont believe the critics cause they clearly dont know anything about monster movies king of the monsters was a total blast and ill be seeing it again
Jun 2 2019,positive,absurd story and character motivations but great action
Jun 2 2019,positive,i went thinking it would be awful but my husband wanted to see it  great story and special effects really enjoyed it
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is exactly what i wanted from a kaiju movie lots of kaiju fights jaw dropping visuals and decent human characters accompanied by an amazing score its probably one of my favourite movies of the year
Jun 2 2019,positive,start to finish was a great movie battles are so intense
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you like the original godzilla films from toho you will love this film do no listen to critics as they are a bunch of cynical asshats apparently 2014 had not enough godzilla and kotm had too much godzilla honestly this film i great and if you go in with an ppen mind you may love it
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved this movie godzilla and the other monsters were awesome the fights were epic
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics critics love destroying movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,gave me exactly what i wanted
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a not that longtime godzilla fan this movie is exciting i enjoyed it really much and it is the movie of the year for me
Jun 2 2019,positive,the cinematography cgi and sound were first rate  the retro score also added a nice touch  but the script needed another rewrite  the monster action saves this film and maybe thats all thats really needed but more polished dialogue wouldve been nice  allinall a fun ride that really needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monsters where awesome their new looks are a lot better then the old looking so much more real and believable fight scenes hold a lot of action and the hidden ones have edge of the seat suspense wondering who won the hidden fight scenes are understandable for where the fights happened
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was an a great upgrade from the first better human story and more intense kaiju battles lets not forget about the original score that akira ifukube created is now back with bear mccrearys rendition which is amazing to hear again in the big screen the music is what brings this legacy alive amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,epic monster battle movie that is best seen on a large screen with good sound i recommend imax just wish theyd had it in imax 3d    the story keeps things moving between kaiju battles and further firms up the mythology of these new godzilla movies you dont have to have seen either godzilla or kong skull island to enjoy king of monsters but you will miss out on the references and the subtle set up to kong vs godzilla make sure you pay attention to some of the headlines and images they flash on screen during the end credits also there is a post credit scene
Jun 2 2019,positive,really enjoyed it not perfect by any means but entertaining and had some great monster fights got pumped more than once when  godzilla showed up to fight definitely go see if youre at all interested in zilla  
Jun 2 2019,positive,to put it simply if you grew up with all if not most godzilla films you will understand the formula many  things i loved about this film was how many easter eggs callbacks how much mass destruction size and scale came about through this film from the acting of our main characters all the way down to the sound and musical score king of the monsters is the quintessential film to see if you were looking for kaiju film made in america nothing but respect from the original source material michael doughtery has nailed it to a t with this piece i have seen it twice as of now first in imax second in the amc dolby atmos format which really brings out the mass and destruction that befalls the film more than likely i will be going for a third and final screening in basic 3d a mustsee for monster moviegoers or kaiju lovers alike
Jun 2 2019,positive,less humans in the next one please the music and the monsters were put well together the fight scenes where at an epic proportion
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely phenomenal
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic it was a genuine crowd pleaser 
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla fans will not be disappointed the showdowns in this movie are an amazing spectacle i watched it on screenx and the viewing experience was mind bending i watch godzilla as a child 20 years ago and this movie with todays graphics looked unbelievable the fights were numerous and awesome this movie is for the fans  i came away from this movie so satisfied ignore the critics tomatometer  their avengers and star wars glowing reviews prove their opinion is meaningless i dont trust them anymore  follow your heart and watch it   one tip  watch this on the biggest and best screen you can
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was a grand scale epic movie godzilla done right still in awe please try to experience it in imax this magnitude of a film deserves it
Jun 2 2019,positive,delivers what you want from a big budget godzilla movie its much more schlock than high art but that should be expected and its great schlock at that
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved this movie everything i wanted from a godzilla movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,dumb big monster movie fun a step in the right direction with an emphasis on kaiju but could have used a bit less humans
Jun 2 2019,positive,if your an og godzilla fan this is the movie for you more easter eggs than you could fill a basket with also monster battles kicked  
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything i couldve hoped for in a godzilla movie i dont know whats wrong with the critics but i have been a godzilla fan since i was six and i loved this movie if you havent seen it go see itnow the critics on thos site have no idea what they are talking about
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla in action is great the rest of the story is no that interesting good thing i didnt go to see the acting
Jun 2 2019,positive,the best monster fight 
Jun 2 2019,positive,theres enough action and stunning visuals to satisfy die hard fans however the story was lacking when it couldve been great if done right overall a fun blockbuster 
Jun 2 2019,positive,dope movie i highly recommend it dont listen to the criticism by these so called critics
Jun 2 2019,positive,lets take this review in a different direction than the others kind of how this movie went a different direction than its 2014 predecessor godzilla is back and this time ladies and gentlemen the gloves come off and stay off once the movie really starts to ramp up while i enjoyed the slow burn and element of surprise from the previous film godzilla king of the monsters excels at setting the pace for the audience and taking us on a very eventful very rewarding ride   i felt that king of the monsters was visually stunning with exceptional sound design for each monster it had solid performances from most actors and had moments that paid homage to the old school films in a tasteful manner yesof course theres a human element and a story revolving those characters but it never felt as if it got in the way for too long  its fun its large its loud and its a version of godzilla i cant wait to see more of
Jun 2 2019,positive,to be honest this movie is very good its weakness is in its human story i hope monsterverse can improve the script and acting for all of its human characters to be more meaningful and emotional in the next movie of this franchise   that also applies to kaiju  titan characters in the movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything i was hoping for
Jun 2 2019,positive,they kept similarities of story to the original japanese godzilla and king ghidorah the fight scenes were amazing and really got you intrigued no person should ever judge a movie they set up the godzilla vs kong movie and a possible third monster
Jun 2 2019,positive,a must watch delivers everything i expected honestly buying this movie when it releases 
Jun 2 2019,positive,cant wait for the continuation of the monsterverse
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a really good so good that ill pay again to go see it again
Jun 2 2019,positive,i keep seeing idiots saying the story is missing the plot is missing bla bla bla this is a monster movie monsters designed to be the main character the movie should focus on the fighting scene to make you feel good and cool  if you care so much about the story then dont watch it and why dont you go fucking watch la la land i bet that has a great story to satisfy you morons and i will leave comment says oh shit the cgi is missing its like eating a hamburger and saying oh it sucks because it doesnt have enough nutrients does it even make sense when you idiots make such comments
Jun 2 2019,positive,continuation from the first godzilla this one on the other hand did not disappoint alot of monster on monster action it was crazy good in my opinion i enjoyed it homage to classical godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,lets take this review in a different direction than the others kind of how this movie went a different direction than its 2014 predecessor    godzilla is back and this time ladies and gentlemen the gloves come off and stay off once the movie really starts to ramp up  while i enjoyed the slow burn and element of surprise from the previous film godzilla king of the monsters excels at setting the pace for the audience and taking us on a very eventful very rewarding ride  i felt that king of the monsters was visually stunning with exceptional sound design for each monster it had solid performances from most actors and had moments that paid homage to the old school films in a tasteful manner     yesof course theres a human element and a story revolving those characters but it never felt as if it got in the way for too long  id say humans and monsters almost got about equal screentime in this film with our king doling out the harshness from the first time we see him til the very end    in short this film does not disappoint unless of course you were expecting something much slower paced with a human focal point instead of i dont know multiple behemoths fighting to the death to claim their throne as king of the monsters    i will say however this film doesnt have as many artistic and unique cinematic moments that carefully build tension for the audience as its predecessor there are a few but theyre handled quite differently  the good news is the film seriously makes up for it with the fight scenes while taking its time to introduce each monster at a pace that felt just right without becoming overbearing theres also a slight goose chase during the second half but if we all survived the mess that was the last jedi we can get over the time burn in this film and fully enjoy its smashing finale     i saw this film in imax and couldnt imagine watching it in any other format theres several scenes in this movie that you can tell were shot with the imax experience in mind and those shots  sequences gave me serious goosebumps any time a movie can elicit a physical response from me i feel that its doing something right and allows for that level of immersion    its just a shame it scored so lowly on the critic side i really hope it doesnt deter warner bros from greenlighting future godzilla films with this formula but i can confidently say the general audience certainly got what they wanted out of this movie lets face it youll never please die hard fans of any ip     its fun its large its loud and its a version of godzilla i cant wait to see more of
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was action packed and did godzilla justice the film felt like it was genuine and made with love
Jun 2 2019,positive,monster fight fest everything i hoped for and much more long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre a fan of the godzilla movies you will be happy that they captured the emotions tenacity and spirit of each of the original kaijus counting the days till the next installment
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a monster movie this delivers but just like the 2014 movie focused a lot on a huge family drama this one burdens us with the same problem the plot is good enough with some good twists and ghidorah is amazing    on the bad side the daughter is an absolute mary sue a lot of the human drama is annoying and the levels of unbelievable stunts everyone survives is ridiculous yes i know its a monster movie but i swear i keep expecting the main carrier thing to transform into optimus prime the movie is also annoyingly preachy but oh well    overall enjoyable ill probably buy it and fast forward a lot
Jun 2 2019,positive,this clearly feels like a passion product from a director and crew that are familiar and respect the source material this gives me hope in what might come after the confirmed godzilla vs kong movie i hope the box office is kind to this one
Jun 2 2019,positive,dougherty you mad man this is a great film for the fans this will remind you of the classic films we all grew up watching as kids with ok humans and story cheesy dialogue and epic monster action sequences that make me feel like i was a kid again doing the godzilla roar stomping on hot wheels and playing the original theme in the background ladies and gentlemen if you came for epic monster action you will not be disappointed props to bear mccreary for the absolutely stunning soundtrack 
Jun 2 2019,positive,really entertaining godzilla fans will like this human storyline was adequate for a godzilla film with an interesting twist great action great renderings of classic characters rodan and ghidorah look amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,good movie special effects were ok
Jun 2 2019,positive,exciting intense and full of amazing monster fights just what the doctor ordered
Jun 2 2019,positive,i enjoyed the film the monster scenes were incredible yes they were always in the dark and rain but watch the story it is explained the human interaction was good explained why they were doing it great use of all the themes for each monster
Jun 2 2019,negative,easily the worst movie ive ever seen a real monstrosity 
Jun 2 2019,positive,good entertainment great visuals and another take on the king of the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,i went in to see this film because i was just in the mood for a movie like this but have to say i went in with low expectations i was pleasantly surprised for a high budget b movie if i can get away with saying that it was good maybe i was just in the right mood i dont know it definitely was not bad 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was a godzilla movie about the godzilla universe we grew to love a long long time ago were there flaws and imperfections yes but this is godzilla it was everything a godzilla movie should be long live the king i saw this with my sons and they were more excited than me they grew up playing with godzilla figurines watching the old black and white movies and playing the games on gamecube and xbox
Jun 2 2019,positive,a love letter to godzilla fans and the thirteen year old that lives in all of us  do not believe the critics fun film and true to the movies 
Jun 2 2019,positive,freaking awesome got instant  goosebumps three times godzilla is amazing saw it at a gqt theater riverview gdx
Jun 2 2019,neutral,story was missing in fight
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome  i love the cgi and visual effect of this movie  the bad thing about this is the human characters which is why if monsterverse want to make the next monster film in their franchise  they have to balancing the emotion  plot and script of human story and the monster story itself  well because this franchise is still new  not bad for a starter 
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie had a beautiful mixture of art acting and action with a couple scare moments great flick
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was made for lifelong fans of the franchise long live the king 
Jun 2 2019,positive,fantastic thrill ride the stars are definitely the kaiju with some amazing interesting battles while the humans of the movie let it down slightly with some poorly written dialogue
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was ok wait for it to come out the sound was great in theater but not worth the price
Jun 2 2019,positive,fuck yes best movie 2019 ahhhhhhhhhhh
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is the latest installment in the legendary monsterverse it is about humanity and godzilla having to deal with the arrival of a new apex predator aka king ghidorah and a new era of giant monsters aka titans this movie is amazing the best part is the huge battles between all the different monsters these fights are incredibly epic monsters are slamming biting clawing stabbing and burning each other not to mention losing limbs and eating each other these monsters dont hold back and these battles have such a devastating effect on the environment as countless buildings aircrafts and people are destroyed on such immense levels the movie does a good job at showing the destruction these titans can do and their impact on the world and humanity speaking of humanity the human characters do a job at not keeping the plot boring and slow and actually play a part in the monsterss story and battles they offer moments of sincerity and humor ken watanabe as dr ishirō serizawa is the best human character and has a very touching moment with godzilla  godzilla king of the monster is such a extraordinary giant monster movie that doesnt hold back on the monster brawl
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a monster figth fest
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved this movie action packed
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved this movie the amount of monster action more than made up for the lack thereof that we saw in godzilla 2014 there was monster action from the getgo and thats what i want to see from a godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,neutral,humans humans humanswhat the helli never payed to watch 3rd grade human family drama only good thing is they added more monster fights than the first film  all the human characters are wasted except kens 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,mehhhhh silly writing with fantastic special effects 
Jun 2 2019,negative,this movie was complete trash 90 of it was people doing dumb crap and the other 10 was monsters doing dumb crap
Jun 2 2019,positive,millies performance was awesome love the action
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a brainless good popcorn movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,great freaking movie if you watch this movie watch it in 4dx im not a big godzilla fan but this movie is bad ass you will not be disappointed at all very good action
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was not perfect i think id have written the story a bit differently if i chose to go in the direction they did however with the path they took they pulled it off well enough even with all its flaws i think godzilla and the other kaiju were the stars they gave us hardcore fans exactly what we had asked for a big step in the right direction i can only hope they learn from the mistakes and keep making improvements i love me some godzilla action  a must see for fans and for the people who just want to have a good time
Jun 2 2019,positive,its sad but i wanted this movie to end while i was watching it i think the verified reviews specifically stating that the cgi is great and blah blah arent from actual reviewers the trailer made this movie look great but this movie is contrived to its core the humans all suck remember war of the worlds with tom cruise that movie works way better than this one does where are the groundlevel shots giving us the giant scope of these monsters the cgi is good in some parts and very average in others the fights are the best parts but theyre broken up in odd and annoying ways as the camera zips to these characters literally throwing themselves at a device that does nothing but draws the bad monster to them its so confusing how do the humans have a timer for when something big is going to happen in godzilla why does godzilla save these specific humans at the last second it makes no sense dont even get me started on the sjw  feminist stuff this movie is just not exciting oh but they give us a nice shot of an american flag and pow mia flag who cares make a good movie     and instead of just criticizing the movie ill offer suggestions that i think wouldve made the movie better it wouldve been more compelling if the female lead actually was captured and had to work with her daughter to draw the monsters to the bad guys and kill them show the relationship between mothra and godzilla and those two and the rest of the monsters they couldve used mothra as a vehicle to get godzilla to get a second wind and she couldve swayed some monsters to fight with her and godzilla take out 50 of the human characters  so many were pointless distracting and annoying sure your sjw points are on fire but no one cares the male lead did a great job and he felt very natural for the film the dynamics of the divorce couldve been explored more add some foreshadowing and a sense of impending doom the humans took me out of the movie and destroyed any suspense look at jurassic park and war of the worlds as examples heck look at the 2014 godzilla movie the difference between the trailer and what i saw is shocking i have lost all faith in hollywood and im not going to see another movie in theaters unless people i trust tell me its good im just done
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a giant kaiju action movie if you want some epic giant monster fights this is the movie to see way more giant monster fights than the previous godzilla movie and a good use of a giant movie theatre screen plus it is a true homage to the classics films in execution and with so many fanfavorite kaiju
Jun 2 2019,negative,well the effects were top notch but we didnt know it would be one long environmental sermon about wiping out mankind to save the rainforests and spotted owls not even joking its 2 hours of getting talked down to by hollywood for being human cancer
Jun 2 2019,positive,monsters were amazing script wasnt great but if youre in it for the action this lives up to the first one
Jun 2 2019,positive,having seen the others i went into this movie with low expectations i was pleasantly surprised by a good story awesome visuals fx and sound not the perfect movie but much better than i expected and the best of this series 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the battles were amazing and the way they made us feel how giant and powerful these guys really were thru the eyes of the people felt so incredible
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely excellent
Jun 2 2019,positive,tremendously campy but crafted with affection for kaiju spectacle king of the monsters is an absolute blast yes some of the human drama feels underwritten but the performances are played with commitment and selfawareness importantlyand unlike a lot of oversized popcorn faretheres stuff here that transcends its context and the monster imagery often looks as if it was painted directly onto the screenthe best of it completely aweinspiring 
Jun 2 2019,positive,just fabulous  if you love the old japanese godzilla movies youll need to get ready to cry  the people who made this movie just love and addicted to godzilla and know what the audience wants from a kaiju movie  im looking forward to the next movie and thanks for the wonderful experience  
Jun 2 2019,positive,love the action want more lol
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was absolutely astonishing the critic reviews are displayed by people who just dont understand what makes a monster movie great all around its a feat of good plot good destruction and great fight scenes that leave you second guessing what you think will happen next it has just the right amount of godzilla balanced with the humans perspective of their situation in the battles i will praise this movie of absolutely surprising the 2014 godzilla movie in every single way 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great fun  lots of extras for monster movie fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,not very clear what was going on
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved the juiced up godzilla after the nuclear infusion
Jun 2 2019,positive,they kept similarities of story to the original japanese godzilla and king ghidorah they set up the godzilla vs kong movie and a possible third monster stay thru all the credits
Jun 2 2019,positive,love this movie to me it was better than the slow pace of avengers end game it exceeded my expectations it deliver everything i wanted plus more i lost faith in rotten tomatoes they apparently dont know what the fans want and this movie delivers the thrue fans and everyone else
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought this movie was great the fight scenes were amazing and really got you intrigued no person should ever judge a movie by just the rotten tomatoes score
Jun 2 2019,positive,the action scenes were great but the story were sometimes unclear
Jun 2 2019,positive,it would be a perfect movie without the humans story
Jun 2 2019,positive,is one of the best godzilla movies ever and every fan will to love it
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla kom is definitely not as bad as the critics say its fun fast and as you may have heardmore monster time than 2014 rodan  mothra are beautifully realized a solid summer blockbuster for boys due to the frenetic pace of kom this film is destined to grow in popularity as it truly gets better with a second  third viewing you wont be sorry
Jun 2 2019,positive,while the joy that comes from seeing something you adored as a child given a billion dollar budget and handled with the same level of reverence you once gave to a cheaper albeit more creative version is starting to lose its luster i still absolutley loved this movie hollywoods wonder trick is on borrowed time even the last avengers movie finally started drawing ire from a small number of mainstream critics as the public turns hostile towards tentpole nostalgia flicks warner continues to struggle at creating a successful cinematic universe by offering film that will mostly appeal to an esoteric fandom its no wonder critics havent been kind but if youre a godzilla guy prepare to be dazzled    for better or worse godzilla king of the monsters is everything its predecessor was not where the first was slow dimly lit and brooding this is jampacked with fun bright action and color this has 10 the monster action which after all is why most of us buy a ticket both films are similar in how little they care for their human characters the 2014 attempted an intelligent posthuman story that was ultimately distracted by a very boring human drama 2019 uses the humans as monster interpreters for the audience and lets the colossal beasts hog all the drama for an allaction spectacle  this is more superhero film than stylized moody drama but for godzilla fans it always was    most of the critics reviews reflect this the monsters are lauded and the human plot has been dissected and diagnosed as completely hollow i dont think mainstream critics get the genre it isnt that the human cast is supposed to be badthats a dumb arguement guyscomic book movies monster movies slasher moviesidgaf stop saying they get a pass when someone gets critical but they are intended as exposition to ground the monster action which is where the emotional investment lies we get one or two humans to connect with the rest are there to die or tell us how our monsters feel  they do that pretty well thanks to a plot contrivance where our lead scientist created a box to talk to monsters  if that sounds too corny remember two inch tall women did that job in the originalsid have preferred that    still i understand some of the complaints for an ancillary element there are a ton of human characters in this thing and a complete unwillingness to kill them off as they flail around their tiny ship star trek style as godzilla wrestles beast after beast if your going to give us a cast that big at least have the decency to let us watch them die classic godzilla movies had the good sense to keep them out of harms way dont tease us man we want death    the monster mythologies suffer a little as to save time in the mad dash to make the biggest blockbuster possible all of the monsters are essentially given the same origin story which robs a few of them of some of their more interesting aspects removing the weirdness of 60s toho somehow makes all this absurdity less believable  godzilla is the exception here as they add elements to the character that will have godzilla fans pumping their fist in adolation    fortunately this film heavy handedly brings back many of the allegorical aspects of the classic toho monster movie that the 2014 one was lacking blue oyster cult got it right history shows again and again how nature points out the folly of mengodzilla the allegory hits harder in this film than the 80s and 90s films that inspired it because human kind is most assuredly facing realworld impending doom blockbuster films are readying us to be okay with the end of days if this was the plan all along i wonder what edwards take on this universe would have been    classic godzilla music elevates the spectacle ill always get emotional when akira ifukube music swells while a monsters life is on the line    the monsters have life like never before thanks to motion capture godzilla feels his years but looks better than ever thanks to a subtle and welcome redesign he carries himself like an aging gun slinger that will rid this townearth of the evil corrupting it mothramy 2 fav looks gentle and lovable onscreen as only the monster protector of earth should ghidorah is a psychotic schizophrenic beast and rodan is concentrated anarchy watching the lifelike redesigns grapple in battle is more like accessing a forgotten memory than watching a film this is tohos beasts as only you can remember them because as an adult you cant revisit monster island     sure i prefer gojira godzilla 85 and gmk to 2014 i prefer the entire heisei era to 2019  it feels like weve seen both of these movies before but thats not all bad both legendary pictures are two very different but authentic feeling godzilla films even if cgi doesnt grant them the same weight as rubber suits and models    ultimately if youre the type who easily empathizes with the monster theres a nostalgic good time for you here with a ton of kaiju action i cant help but get giddy at a billion dollar budgeted heiseistyle godzilla film  this might be my favorite of the hollywood kaiju movies    for some of us godzilla is religion and we got church this weekend obligatory two claws way up
Jun 2 2019,positive,epic fight scenes awesome lovable monsters long live the king  roaarrrrrrrrrrr
Jun 2 2019,positive,excellent movie the action and back story melded together for a fantastic entertaining view of godzilla and the other monsters of its world
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun and entertaining 
Jun 2 2019,negative,i dont wanna give even a star to this horrible movie crappy storyline and visual effects just wasted 18 and 2 hours
Jun 2 2019,positive,they brought the original music back from the toho films felt like this was one of the original 60s movies with a 200 million dollar budget dont go for the actors acting they are incidental go for the monsters doing cool shit for two hours
Jun 2 2019,positive,for a godzilla film it gave us everything we wanted and more
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie this has more action and monsters in it while still keeping the amazing ominous tones of the first movie i hate to use the word epic because of its overuse in our society but this truly was epic visually amazing and beautiful movie i just wish they didnt cut away so much from the fight scenes also the comedic character came off as annoying but ken wantanabe by far the best character in it as a lifelong godzilla fan i was satisfied
Jun 2 2019,positive,a love letter to godzilla fans absolutely the best american godzilla movie ever made if you love godzilla this is a must see if you like movies that are entertaining same    dont expect a human drama set to a backdrop of a monster movie that is not what godzilla movies have ever been expect a monster movie set to a backdrop of a human drama instead the humans and their ridiculous plans set the stage for what you watch a godzilla movie to see  giant monsters anyone who complains that the humans didnt have enough depth or that the audience isnt made to care about them is the wrong audience for this movie and their opinions should be taken with several pounds of salt    godzilla movies dont convey a message any longer once upon a time they did and there are hints toward a bit of high mindedness in this film but its a tip of the hat to the heritage of the art instead of a serious exploration of weighty issues this is a movie that is not quite for children for kids at heart who love godzilla who go to the movies to see godzilla who cheer for godzilla the hero of this movie is a giant monster the humans are set dressing as it should be they are there to provide scale not a moving story about the horrors of struggling to survive in a disaster and survivors guilt    please do take note of the audience score actual people who go to movies to enjoy them obviously loved this movie the critics are simply wrong this is a good movie that will entertain audiences and pays proper respect to the 65 year history of a titan that stomped its way into our hearts a long time ago and continues to live there still this is a gateway drug to the rich heritage of godzilla movies for the modern generation    bottom line  its fun which is ultimately what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is the godzilla movie ive been waiting for since i was a kid it had the japanese spirit and identity of what theyve been putting out in japan since the 50s and the american big budget special effects if youre a fan of godzilla you should love this if youre one of those that consider the films cheesy youre probably not going to be swayed into changing your opinion despite mixed reviews you cant please everyone i thought the 2014 film was boring and lacking monster action this film is perfect as far as human characters and monster action id rank this as the best godzilla film ever made i loved the use of akira ifukubes monster themes that alone speaks volumes about the intent of this film i just hoped for more of ifukube that was probably my only minor gripe
Jun 2 2019,positive,succeeded in giving these classic monsters character  quite the feat  king ghidorah is officially my favorite movie villain ever
Jun 2 2019,positive,well the trailers of this movie raised my expectations and when i was watching it god the film took my expectations and completely surpassed them the movie a delight of kaijus fights and cgi of quality a masterpiece made with love for the fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,the newest addition of the godzilla movie series is awesome there are still some really good monsters yet to be reveiled andor return kong cant beat the king but it will be interesting to see the plot twist and the monster they will team up against
Jun 2 2019,positive,classic godzilla movie great follow up to the 2014 film monsters all got plenty of screen time but not too much movie reminded me of all the older godzilla movies 
Jun 2 2019,positive,every godzilla fans dream
Jun 2 2019,negative,plot poorly written predictable fight scenes were underwhelming comedy was bad did not meet expectations the movie revolves around the family and their problems more than godzilla himself
Jun 2 2019,positive,i love the movie special effects was awesome and the monster fights was a beast godzilla went hard
Jun 2 2019,positive,perfect godzilla movie loved the fights loved the action it looked beautiful visually and whoever choreographed the fights has a real passion the human part of the movie was cheesy and i couldnt care less about it but it does not in any way subtract from the rest of the movie i loved this movie
Jun 2 2019,negative,this movie is trash ive been a lifelong godzilla fan and this movie was a huge letdown spoilers the first time we see godzilla tear off one of ghidorahs head is underwater we dont get to see it the reason i gave a rating of 1 star and not a 12 star is because the designs of godzilla and the rest of the monsters are really well done when godzilla turns into burning g he never uses his atomic breath what too much focus on the human characters i know we have to endure the humans i know it cant be 100 giant monster fights but it was too much stop cutting away from the fights do not put a jet in front of the monster fight storylines that go nowhere i know this review is sporadic im just so disappointed do not waste your money on this trash oh yeah its a disaster movie with the name godzilla put on it to sell tickets the director should be ashamed of himself millie brown was fantastic in this but even her acting credibility couldnt save this trash 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,big fan of godzilla didnt care much about the human dramatics but there input on why things are happing were drawn out well i really enjoyed the special effects monster fights were great and destruction 
Jun 2 2019,negative,so noisy story is ok
Jun 2 2019,positive,the storyline was awesome the graphics were spot on and it embraced the spirit of godzilla
Jun 2 2019,negative,unless your fanatic i would bother
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing effects with lots of kaiju action godzilla and king ghidora put on a show and it includes og music from the other godzilla movies 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is exactly what you would want out of a godzilla movie especially if you are a fan of the older japanese movies huge amounts of monster battles compared to the 2014 title and the effects are some of the best ive seen recently to be fair the acting is pretty average which likely explains the critic reviews but thats not why youre going to see this movie anyway this is a really fun one to go see and i would definitely recommend it
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie enters the top 5 of the best godzilla movies in its history thanks legendary toho and warner
Jun 2 2019,positive,critics are blind if you wanted to see monsters fight go see thus movie great set up to godzilla vs kong next year cannot wait
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are looking for great acting then you probably be disappointed but if you are a fan of this genre then buckle up  it was a great tribute and in some ways a rendition of previous movies that go back to the 60s and 70s  it particularly reminded me of destroy all monsters and indeed the monsters are the stars of this flick and i am glad they held onto some of the original mythos with some modern updates  i was very pleased and could only wonder what raymond burr in the original japanese propaganda film godzillawould think  even some of the music scores from the originals was remastered and will be familiar for those familiar with the older films  bottom line go see this if you are a fan of the godzilla franchise
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre looking for a jaw dropping plot go somewhere else if youre looking for a great monster movie with fantastic fights youve come to the right place  
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was amazing loved every moment good movie even without being a fan of the the monster trilogy you will still enjoy it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing movie already hyped for gvk
Jun 2 2019,negative,if you like basic boring movies where a thing destroys every big city and youre not sure if your eardrums work after seeing them this is for you straight up bad acting boring plot and took way too long to get to the point 
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything a godzilla movie should be
Jun 2 2019,positive,its godzilla and a shit ton of kaijus as long as you go in with that expectation youll have a blast some truly impressive set pieces and visuals
Jun 2 2019,positive,exactly what this fanboy wanted from this sequel didnt have to wait forever for any kaiju to appear onscreen the human drama was just enough to keep the story at pace and the fights were amazing also be on the lookout for all the nods to the original toho films and stay after the credits
Jun 2 2019,positive,surprisingly good the movie incorporated the idea that humans cause damages to the earth and the monsters are the earths guardians penalizing humans thus it indirectly spreads the going green message to the audiences 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i think it was a good movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,i really loved the movie i think the cgi and acting were really great and i love that they used the original design for godzilla and i just thought everything was really well done and explained why godzilla was there and the story thoroughly just wish they had gamera the turtle but i loved mothra and godzilla cant wait to see whats next     longlivetheking
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome i love it godzilla king of the monstersnow im waiting for the fight with king kong 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you love the godzilla franchise then this is the movie for you
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of great action scenes pretty much exactly what youd expect from a monster movie a wild and fun ride
Jun 2 2019,positive,evil incarnate vs earths guardian this movie was epic and the amazing score amplified that by 10 bought my ticket with regal so cant be verified but i did see the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,i find it weird that 1 critics are being well critical of the human story in this film and 2 it actually has a rather significant human story yes charles danse character has pretty much 0 development but hes barely a plot device in the movie the russel family is the core of the movie and both emma and mark go through significant story arcs the only real bad thing about them is the event that set their respective arcs in motion are very simply stated rather than fleshed out a bit and the best character returning from the first movie gets a lot more screen time and a fitting respectful resolution for his character his partner did get shafted a bit but if youve followed even a tiny bit of legendarys build up to the movie in this case the monarch website it will be more meaningful considering her importance to ghidorah this movie is a love letter to godzilla fans make no mistake the inreferences are absolutely cheerworthy but the true subject of the movie the titans is where the movie should and does shine each titans introduction is nothing short of breathtaking mothra is so inline with the respect women agenda shes gorgeous in both forms and bad ass yet they movie doesnt knock you over the head repeatedly with the fact that shes a female titan ghidorah is finally realized as the true threat that he was always meant to be you get a legitimate concern for just how godzilla can beat this thing rodan is beastly from the get go which makes spoiler even more satisfying the music is top notch taking the classic cues from the japanese series that everybody whether they want to admit it or not knows and loves and amps them up substantially and rightfully so as the monster action is equally ramped up compared to their japanese counterparts there were some bad jokes in the film i admit but there were also great moments of seriousness of poignancy that addressed the immediate situation as well as the overall narratives of individual characters the pacing of the film could have been slowed down just a bit but at the same time jumping from amazing action sequence to amazing action sequence made it one of those movies where you forced yourself to hold in any potential bathroom needs the movie succeeded far far more than it failed with hints that the next movie could actually potentially be grander than its title implies i believe that the true sign of a well done monster movie is very present in the disparity between critics and audience critics are trained to look for deeper meaning subtext plot lines nuances in performance they often miss the shear joy of letting go and watching two or more humongous behemoths doing what any average sized animal would do and the consequences of that folks this is the godzilla movie all godzilla fans have been waiting to see this is the movie that weve all seen in our imaginations when creating our own epic showdowns via toys artwork stories daydreaming etc do yourself a favor see it at least once on the big screen no matter how awesome your home theater set up may be youre just not going to be able to recreate the shear scale of seeing this in a theater imax even better
Jun 2 2019,positive,you want king of the monsters you got it right here
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved all the monsters had to be a true godzilla fan i feel to really appreciate this one great movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a smash one of the best movies of the summer the monster fights are huge and spectacular not only can you feel the huge nature of these goliaths clashing but you can feel the huge destructive impact these titans unleash on the world both made even better by an amazing score that amps up the epic destruction and revolution of the monsters and from the human side you will feel the love and loss of family and people letting go of grudges and finding friends in their supposed enemies also explosions there are many explosions 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,where were the monsters calling humans monsters is a poor substitute very disappointed at what might have been 
Jun 2 2019,positive,a very fun godzilla film that tried to fit it too much fan service
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a great movie better than the first part it was exciting from beginning to end if youre a godzilla fan this movie is what weve been waiting for a long time
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely amazing dont listen to the critics the real fans know that this sht was incredible i enjoyed the human characters charles dance aka twyin lannister was fantastic as always as was vera fights were badass hands down one of if not arguably the best godzilla made so far while godzilla 1954 will always be 1 this movie has found its way to my 2 spot 1010 would recommend the battles and effects are fantastic the music and sounds are perfect
Jun 2 2019,negative,starts fine enough but oh my god does it begin to drag the 2014 was solid why did people have to complain and ruin a good thing
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was phenomenal the ratings the critics give it shows how the audience is nothing like the critics its a must see in imax
Jun 2 2019,positive,they just kinda killed off characters usually without any consequences
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was soooooo awesome loved that it was action packed with monster fights and not so much human drama
Jun 2 2019,positive,pretty cliche and sometimes corny but thats what i want to see in a godzilla movie thoroughly enjoyed myself
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie if you are a godzilla fan
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is so fun and looks amazing exactly what i wanted from a godzilla movie lots of monsters and monster fighting not humans talking about some random stuff that no one cares about full on action
Jun 2 2019,positive,very minor spoilers    godzilla kotm was a fanfiction crossed with hollywoods most generic tropes in a way it almost checks all the boxes for nailing just the right amount of campbut it goes too far sometimes with some lines so incredibly dumb the actors occasionally struggle to actually spit it out itshollowearthugh i mean yea i was right theres a certain lack of a soul here in the sense that rather than being a stupid plot personalized for this movie its just the same stupid plot recycled from every movie kill the humans cuz humans is bad n nature is yes and the entertainment comes in spurts speckled around that weve essentially exchanged what should have been our grounding for an impersonal audience test with two big rocks and a little rock and it really feels like none of them belong especially if you notice the actors are often placed so far from anything else in the room that its like theyre not even trying to hide the green screen but i consider this less of a negative and more of the lack of a positivenoone sees a godzilla film for the human aspect but i certainly would have appreciated something to connect to instead of a relentless distractionor hell at least a unique kind of camp so i dont have to crack the same jokes that apply to every other hollywood blockbuster when im ripping it apart for fun the problem isnt that its dumb thats expected its that weve seen this all before also on a personal note comic scientist guy can just xxxx himself hes excruciating    so then we have the effectswhich are good mostly the first few action sequences are pretty aweful with blizzards and constant cutaways to the rock family distracting us from any chance of storytelling through action turning what were lead to believe is a fight for dominance into a disconnected sequence of events that feels pretty empty but once we end up in mexico things start to improve however i noticed a certain something missing even after this pointwith cgi we can achieve a unique sense of scale when using the right framing examplified in the 2014 versions meticulously rendered upward panning shots in this one they just dont bother theyre just static and fully in frame which just sort of removes one of the greatest strengths of using cg in the first place then we have the destruction where we hit the real problem even as campy as the rubber suits were theres a sense of weight and tangiblity found in smashing a practical building but it seems theres no amount of cg particles one can kick up thatd create the same effect it just becomes any other generic hollywood blurpuff and by the final sequence this shit is just everywhere i dont feel two monsters smashing through a building i feel two michael bay transformers playing in a fake desertminus the robot balls although they make a point to mention that those are a thing    the actual rendering of course is phenomenal as expected of a big budget american film monster designs are utterly fantastic even godzilla whos stupid elephant feet and extra thicc butterball turkey silhouette i wasnt a particular fan ofthough hes definately slimmed down some and its here in these areas where the undeniable passion begins to showexcessively to the point of bordering on fanfiction similarly to final wars all the easiest references and fan favorites are thrown in from hessei era super forms to the curse of ghidorahs middle head to mothrabeing mothra despite none of these things being woven into the story as well as they were in their original films its almost like going down a checklist but you still cant deny the love and attention that goes into this sort of thing the final sequence of the film is just pure unadulterated fan service and its easily the highlight of the entire experience     some nit picks   this is one of the weakest ghidorah incarnations where hes so clearly outmatched by godzilla in their earlier counters that theres little doubt hes going to win contrast showa ghidorah who could give 2 monsters a good fight and even survive a 3 on 1 pileup did my boy dirty here  no pattented ghidorah stomp thats his favorite most devastating finisher and its a shame it wasnt included there is a midair varient but it didnt quite carry the same intensity as victory dancing on your fallen oppenent like a trampoline  why are missiles hurting these things being immune to those is the bare minimum requisite for being a kaiju  godzilla theme remix is great and expertly usedthe blue oyster cult remix is not its aweful  would have appreciated more named characters getting stepped on for making me put up with them for how badly i wanted to scream shut the fuck up for most of the movie theres a serious lack of payoff here  could we not just leave some uranium around instead of nuking the greatest discovery in human history was that an option no  missiles cause pain but a citybusting nuke gets no sold make up your mind   revealing another muto and not killing it just contradicts everything established about godzillas motivations in the first film   serezawa only exists in this to pronounce gojira differently from everyone else dont  me    overall  this is easily the best american godzilla movie and the first one i can really say is a true to form godzilla film if only reaching the lowermid echalons on paper the good is really good at times even great but you have to trudge through some lazy unoriginal painfully generic schlock to get there alot of it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing spectacle that rarely lets up on the intense pacing its every bit the worthy sequel to 2014s godzilla but even seeing it with friends who skipped that movie as well as kong skull island everyone was thoroughly entertained and enjoyed this one
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is spectacular and eye pleasing 3rd act is simply mind blowing
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was everything and more i could have wished for for 30 years of being a goji fan it was a fun action packed monster battle royal with great visual effects and a great story told nothing drawn out just to the point dont mind the critics reviews go see this movie and have fun i did 3 times already with 2 more showings tomorrow and at least 2 more times in the comming weeks 
Jun 2 2019,positive,kaju were cool when on screen but they spent too much time in the background of pointless human bickering
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of action and very cool monsters they made all of the characters look so good the story was good not great but the action and design made up for it
Jun 2 2019,positive,without blatant exaggeration this is the first movie i can remember actually smiling almost the entire way through  it really is hard to not smile whenever that bidibidibidibidi blasts on the speakers and jerks off your ears causing an instant erection every bi each followed by the fat ass yolked as fuck justasinstant nut with ever di  granted the jokes online really make it sound like theres a lot more kaiju fighting than their actually is but we as adults all know the reason being for this is the critics started it and theyre really just not good at anything probably  id like to finish this by quickly adding that while rodan has always been my favorite seeing him as a mexican such as i myself am except im legal made me really want to spread my wings and fly    but im already on the better side of the border so i dont need to lol  fucking amazing movie for any godzilla or kaiju fan unless youre that group of teen girls rolling balls on my left  yall gotta learn your limit then maybe you wouldnt have had to leave so early
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was a big budget fan film made by a fan for the fans this film wasnt made for critical acclaim it was a faithful rendition of everything that made all the older godzilla movies fun to watch on saturdays and over and over again on vhs the monster mayhem was on an epic scale excellent references to older films in the godzilla franchise did i mention the monsters old favorites from past films rodan mothra and the threeheaded super badass dragon king ghidorah look amazing if you are a fan of the older films watch this movie if youre not that much of a fan and just looking for a fun time watch this movie it truly shows off why godzilla is the king of the monsters heres hoping that rotten tomatoes starts showing off the viewing score on google to give this film more traction people shouldnt  care what 250 critics think but those 12000 regular movie goersthats something that needs to be put out there as well
Jun 2 2019,positive,heard a few hell yas as big g delivered the final blow the audience was clapping as the end credits started to roll definitely a ride and a half seeing it again on sunday  
Jun 2 2019,positive,a lot of action its good its a must see to believe
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie action sequences were amazing and character development while a little weak was also there good story overall and i like the tie in of so many kaiju cant wait for godzilla vs kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,madison russell is a badass
Jun 2 2019,positive,i had more fun at this movie than ive had in years it was truly a worthy experience
Jun 2 2019,negative,yo this movies trash i literally cant get my money back all over the place and visuals were terrible and acting was bad if it was a film that was made to show how funny terrible films are then it was aight
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely amazing film if you like kaiju monsters fighting other monsters then you wont be disappointed at all some reviews have complained about the humans but i didnt think they were bad at all i was expected the worse and didnt get anything negative from that experience     i also brought my girlfriend along who i had made see the 2014 one and enjoyed but has no history with godzilla she loved this movie a lot as well there is a specific scene where godzilla comes out of the water that she enjoyed the most
Jun 2 2019,positive,pretty good movie with great visual effects and sound design the actions scenes were shot really well outside a few cliche moments that were somewhat predictable i would recommend the average movie goer to check it out put that amc alist membership to good use
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was truly an amazing movie longlivetheking
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you didnt like this movie then go ahead and kiss my white american  this movie was unbelievably awesome high intensity action monster violence loud appraising screams from the king himself human conflict guns and rockets blazing and of course a sub connection of the beloved titan kong from skull island however will kong face off with godzilla and if so why he could take out kong with just one radioactive atomic outburst totally fried to death other than that i believe everyone who worked on this film deserves a standing ovation and should true heart in delivering the next chapter in the monarchgodzilla universe well done
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre a fan of giant monsters or just action packed films in general youre gonna love this the visual effects are stunning and though the human plot can be thin at times the monsters more than make up for it it is a godzilla film after all
Jun 2 2019,positive,a bit of a mess when it comes to the human cast and story but just like the first pacific rim movie it doesnt need a complicated well written plot to be enjoyed it does what it was set out to be a great throwback to the silly but amazing fights from the godzilla verse  saw it twice and would do so again in a heartbeat 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is by far the best one yet and i have seen them all  i have been a godzilla fan my whole life
Jun 2 2019,positive,its the best godzilla movie ever created
Jun 2 2019,positive,good movie i believe its worth the money seeing it but you can form your own opinion on it
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was awesome action from begging to end great story and it links all other previous movies to the storyline i would watch it again and again
Jun 2 2019,positive,there were some plot moments that felt like the writers got a little lazy or succumbed to classic movie tropes  as well as the tendency for the story having many unnecessary hoops to jump through    that being said it had great action beautifully animated and filmed scenes and some fantastic sound engineering    so all in all it was kind of an underwhelming dish that was beautifully plated and presented  ps  youll probably end up cari more about the monsters than you do the people
Jun 2 2019,positive,even better the second viewing
Jun 2 2019,positive,better than me but not awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie   totalgodzillafan
Jun 2 2019,positive,staggering jawdropping incredible if you are a godzilla fan an actual fan then you will love this movie dont listen to the critics dougherty poured his heart and soul into this movie and mccrearys soundtrack roars to life alongside the action this is the godzilla weve all been waiting for
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie was amazing  great cgi and great special effects  definitely recommend
Jun 2 2019,positive,i got exactly what i went to see in my opinion it couldve used less human interaction
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing action  if youre a godzilla fan youll love this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,starts a bit slow and actually kinda dull for about the first 25 mins  then turns into a fun and whimsical silly circus  entertaining enough
Jun 2 2019,positive,i dont know what the critics at rotten tomatoes has been smoking  but godzilla king of the monster is awesome   yes there are flaws in the movie and it is not perfect  but its not as bad as the rotten tomatoes critics makes it out to be   its a godzilla movie so dont expect oscar worthy performances deep character development   some people may not understand the movie as it is heavily devoted to the fanbase of godzilla  lots of homage and easter eggs in the movie   the director of the movie is a hardcore godzilla fan and he literally gamble and made it for the fans   i find the movie enjoyable for what it is  eye candy  monster fun with a special visuals effects  story is simple that a 10 year old can understand it   it is an improvement over the 2014 film overall  
Jun 2 2019,positive,best american godzilla yet
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a good and stunning movie cant wait for the clash with kong 
Jun 2 2019,positive,giant monsters laying the smackdown on each other what more could you want
Jun 2 2019,positive,story was a little spotty and the script couldve been better but the cgi coloring sound design and epic ass monster battles were incredible and lets be honest thats all were here for 
Jun 2 2019,positive,cool visuals story lacking
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun movie great sound and visuals 
Jun 2 2019,positive,a spectacle to behold this movie is a beautiful love letter to the godzilla franchise packed full of huge monster action watanabes performance is a standout although the human plot may be average the acting is great and they move the plot along very well
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was amazing it had godzilla and all of the monsters all of them occasionally there were some people talking about stuff that i waited around for more monsters and i was not disappointed the monsters came back and they were awesome i would recommend this movie to anyone
Jun 2 2019,positive,best viewing to watch a monsterous action packed filmed movie like godzilla should be
Jun 2 2019,positive,1010 the perfect movie for any godzilla fan the monster fights soundtrack and acting were top notch this is the best godzilla movie and movie of the year
Jun 2 2019,positive,takes the best of the 2014 movie and puts it on steroids the scaling visual effects and the cinematography makes it feel as real as a monster movie can the human characters arent as good as kong but much better than the 2014 godzilla many homages and call backs to the originals while still putting a fresh spin on everything including the soundtrack they couldnt have done much better and did an amazing job at achieving their goal giving us a thrilling and exhilarating monster movie that is jaw dropping at all moments 
Jun 2 2019,positive,plot and characters left quite a bit to be desired but i went for the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely incredible monster scenes see it at the biggest screen you can
Jun 2 2019,positive,all hail the king perfect  counting the days till the next one 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie better then the first
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla lover youll like this if youre all about the monsters and fights youll like this if youre looking for a critically acclaimed movie and have high expectations for an oscar winning script you wont like this go for the cool fight scenes not the depth of plot 
Jun 2 2019,positive,memories of childhood but gozilla on steroids  movie actually made me smile
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing action  fight scenes definitely a great movie for kaiju fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,if your a godzilla fan or kaiju fan youll love this movie the action and fight scenes are done phenomenally the story and explanation of why the titans exist also add depth to the story good movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,so awesome loved the monsters and the humans  coolest monster fights everrrrr    
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is awesome critics dont like because they dont understand that this is an america made japanese godzilla film
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a lifelong fan of godzilla movies this movie was awesome and exactly what i was looking for the monster battles were incredible since i didnt expect an academy award winning story and understood that kaiju movies can be somewhat cheesy this movie was a kaiju movie with a big budget which i have always wanted i plan to see it at least 3 more times support this movie if you like good old monster fun
Jun 2 2019,positive,i would say some aspects of the film could be better but overall it was a decent film me personally l feel that the japanese versions of godzilla films are still more better than the american made ones just how i see it like the way certain little things that could of been done that wasnt to make the film much better wasnt relies on graphics to much fight scenes and storylines could of been stronger still didnt have much godzilla in the film yes more than first but could of been use more and godzilla new look is ok but generic and his arms some things rather current times they need to leave alone from the past
Jun 2 2019,positive,seriously action packed
Jun 2 2019,positive,i really liked the direction they took this film good story lots of chaos if you are a true godzilla fan you will catch all the little references to the old toho movies
Jun 2 2019,negative,wow godzilla king of the monsters is dreadful i mean really dreadful the sequel to a gareth edwards superior reboot resembles a channel 5 type b movie complete with bad acting bad writing a nonsensical plot murky incomprehensible visuals and most of all a lack of excitement in fact ill be honest and say i slept through 30 minutes of it to try and relive the pain even the action doesnt redeem it you literally cant see what is happening due to rain fog mist dust and god knows what else seemingly sneered across the camera lens in an obvious attempt to mask the poor visuals and of coarse theres the shaky cam theres too many characters delivering lines of exposition with all the emotion of a corpse i realise that the concept of the film is silly in itself but surly some thought could have gone into its execution kong skull island and even 1998s godzilla are better than this well it can only get better as we move into june but at the moment this takes the crown as the worst film of the year hail to the king indeed 
Jun 2 2019,positive,stop putting story in my monster kaiju action movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,epic movie dolby atmos made the experience 10x better best godzilla yet
Jun 2 2019,positive,so good reminds me of when i was a kid
Jun 2 2019,positive,great action sequences and the actors were good
Jun 2 2019,positive,pure kaiju action at its finest    cant wait to buy this on 4k bluray
Jun 2 2019,positive,good storyline  great cgi
Jun 2 2019,positive,a godzilla movie finally worth going to see  the plot involving the family was out of place and distracted from the main plot but wasnt bad enough to effect the whole picture
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it truly nostalgic for anyone whos been a long time godzilla fan king of the monsters made reference to multiple japanese originals in back stories musical numbers kaiju appearances and capabilities if youve never been a long time fan you wouldnt appreciate it the same way like all godzilla movies its fanservice but fanservice done right 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was okay but not what i expected
Jun 2 2019,positive,long time fan it  was great bringing back some of the old music really helped set the tones just like in the movies before it  will go see it again and will buy to add to the collection now if they make godzilla beat kong in the next movie it will be great trilogy but i hope for more movies there is plenty of monster action but is there really ever enough monster action
Jun 2 2019,positive,the cheese in the film were expected but they werent film breaking like any action flick the story was the weakest but it was actually coherent enough to keep me interested the key is to keep it as simple as possible no need for a complex or thought provoking plot and finally the monster fights were top notched they exceeded all my expectations and easily makes up for all weak points of the film bring on the next one
Jun 2 2019,positive,my kids loved the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,screw the critics a lot of call backseaster eggs to the original japanese films and waaay more kaiju screentime than the 2014 film watch it
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the newest addition to the godzilla franchise cant wait to see whats next
Jun 2 2019,positive,obviously predictable  probably was written in 20 or 30 minutes but its a godzilla movie so   acting was much better than expected and dialogue was good  really good cgi but you know that from the trailers  godzilla was way to chubby at first but the fighting seemed to get him in shape by the end all in all fun and my family really liked it so what do i know   although they should have sprung for the twin  godzilla fans will understand
Jun 2 2019,positive,a bit cheesy at times but thats what i want out of a good godzilla movie fight sequences were much better and more intense than the 2014 movie cant wait to see where they take the franchise next
Jun 2 2019,positive,its good the fight scenes were awesome the rest of the movie not so good id give it a 7510
Jun 2 2019,negative,the movie was boring as hell the monster fights were anti climatic and the human characters were uninteresting and 1 dimensional its definitely a waste of money
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it cant wait for more
Jun 2 2019,positive,a new twist on a classic all the intense action we remember and love from the original godzilla movies with an epic upgrade of action and a new feel for characters a must see for godzilla fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie however the stupid humans made it less fun
Jun 2 2019,negative,cringey bad talented actors cant save this movie some of the visuals were cool though not sure where the positive reviews are coming from our whole group was disappointed
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was an epic movie full of intense kaiju battles great acting by the cast and all around a very enjoyable movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,epic monster movie mayhem pure monstrocity in size and scope as good as a godzilla movie can be it must be seen to be believed hail to the king 
Jun 2 2019,negative,going into godzilla king of the monsters i thought they would have fixed the issue from the first one and for it to be non stop monster action but all we got was human characters setting up fro the next fight for 40 minutes until we got to the five minute fight i wouldnt mind this if the character werent so kind numbingly flat and boring the humans feel like only a plot device but they are the main focus of the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is a perfect tribute to the godzilla movies the kaijus are the main characters as it should be humans are mostly there for exposition and still they are not as bad as the critics say plus nobody expects a kaiju movie to have a brilliant script the human characters are kinda meh and the story is overall really simple but it works all the kaiju scenes were perfect and if you are a fan youll love this movie if youre not a fan youll still have a really fun time 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it wasnt bad but i expected better
Jun 2 2019,positive,one of the top if not they best monster picture all time and there only gonna get better
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is a wet dream i dont care what losers sorry critics might say they can keep watching black and white movies and feeding their smarty ego
Jun 2 2019,positive,to all critic ratings learn how to critique this movie should not be 44 approval critic rating it was a good movie dopes
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla still needs more screen time
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing fight scenes 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great giant monster scenes very true to the original movies loving nods to the classics silly writing but who cares
Jun 2 2019,positive,humans talk to much need and more monster fight in daylight
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie while it does have some flaws like some boring human charactersis not only a worthy addition to the franchise but in my mind ranks as one of the best i truly love this movie and think even if youre not a huge godzilla fan you can go in and have an entertaining time 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,i found myself falling asleep it was drawn out in my opinion didnt keep me interested
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing movie beautiful visuals amazing sound perfect action secuences the king in all his splendor an incredible soundtrack this movie is everything a godzilla fan could ever want sure the story is not the most complex but is not annoying or stupid as the so called critics say you are definitively going to love this movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monsters are the stars not enough screen time for them too much drama with the humans it never really gets resolved entertaining visually
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely amazing movie godzilla is a beast mothra is beautiful the titans were great
Jun 2 2019,positive,the dialogue was cheesy and annoying at times but overall the story was good for what you can expect for a godzilla movie  the pace of the movie was perfect even if it slightly made the story suffer it never really slowed down too much and seemed to keep the excitement escalating all the way through until the ending fight scene    the actors performances were good even if the writing wasnt as good as it shouldve been  other than the few cheesy one liners i felt like most of the characters were real and not just forced into the movie  the music and the monster battles is really where this movie shines they didnt overdue the monster scenes to the point where they got boring and left nothing up to you imagination but they also put in enough time in the movie to show them unlike godzilla 2014  overall the movie seemed pretty well balanced and the special effects were epic and mind blowing i recommend seeing this movie in the biggest screen possible
Jun 2 2019,positive,really good a spectacle to be sure great battles c level story for the humans but idc about that tbh because the kaijus delivered lol
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic words cant even begin to describe how amazing it was the honor it gave to the original movies is amazing from the songs to the little references like the original return of godzilla song with the a more tribalesque theme to it and mothras theme song with a chinese feel i love the references to the older movies when it came to king ghidorah especially his origin and naming i love the contrast between godzilla and ghidorah rodan was awesome he was big agile and really reminds me of the original mothra i fell in love with her all over again she was a beautiful as ever and the chemistry between her and godzilla made me tear up i do of course have my few nitpicks and i really wish i could hear the original or new takes on the original roars of rodan and ghidorah because it felt like they were a generic monster noises to be completely honest but i loved it one more thing i wish it would take place in japan a little more and have a few more japanese characters thats because i grew up on that in the old movie japan and america would usually team up to fight the monsters and now it was just america i kinda miss seeing japan get destroyed a bit and have it be a focal godzilla will always be a japanese monster and movie to me i wish it could at least feel like a hybrid of japan and america the movie was fantastic overall i like more monster with my monster movies like i dont know who hired the critics to review this movie because they dont know what theyre talking about no one cares about the humans and their pathetic lives shoot theyre just tools to keep the story going but the monsters is what we are here for like if you came for some human plot go watch aladdin because this is a kaiju film not some deep compelling story about human endeavor its about kaiju fights and stuff thats literally the only reason i bought a ticket to begin with that and because its not just any kaiju movie its godzilla the god of monsters if it had a bunch of human plot like the 2014 one i would have disliked the movie but this this was something else 1010
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing movie great action fantastic visuals and a fun ride overall if you are a godzilla fan this is the movie for you long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a perfect movie its exciting and as monumental as godzilla himself
Jun 2 2019,positive,great follow up cant wait for the next one
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing scenes amazing music loved seeing the king get the action he deserved
Jun 2 2019,negative,choppy dialogue uninspired and unoriginal characters lacking clear motivations just rewatch  pacific rim
Jun 2 2019,negative,the family story was weak
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing for a true godzilla fan this was done properly and they got it right absolutely fantastic i will definitely see this again 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i came to watch monster fuck each other up for two hours its exactly what i wanted couldnt recommend it more
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie possibly too long but good
Jun 2 2019,negative,although they listened to us when we wanted more godzilla than the previous 2014 version they left another issue from that film untouched the humans the dialogue is cringe worthy the characters are underdeveloped and the side villain is one note and quickly pushed aside i thought the action was filmed too shaky making it hard to make out whats happening at some points there are a few wide shots of the monsters which are breathtaking and worth seeking out on an imax screen overall they improved upon the lack of godzilla in the last film yet failed to provide an interesting story with well written characters who have arcs and make logical decisions 
Jun 2 2019,positive,good movie  critics who are saying too much monster time on the screen need to pull the rancid cancerous advertising dicks from their mouths and go blow their fucking brains out  if anything they should have just cut out the boring family story that was utterly pointless to the plot
Jun 2 2019,positive,fantastic im going to see it again see it on the biggest screen you can find
Jun 2 2019,positive,monsters were great and most of the characters were likeable would have preferred more fight scenes  overall it was fun
Jun 2 2019,negative,paper thin characters and a nonsensical plot godzilla drags on if youre in it for the monster fights they are few and far between 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic it had a story line that you could follow and the action in this movie was amazing 
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome giant monster battles and loving tributes to the classic movies kinda clunky  dumb script but it doesnt matter lots of fun
Jun 2 2019,positive,more monster fights good special effects good soundtrack brought back old theme and more
Jun 2 2019,positive,its entertaining and worth tons of popcorn dunno bout you critics this films freakin good
Jun 2 2019,positive,overall a fun godzilla movie forget the critic score
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing movie all around
Jun 2 2019,positive,that was all i wanted
Jun 2 2019,positive,what a fun movie made me feel like a kid againwatching the old vhs tapes love how they brought the old godzilla back and badder then ever  forget what the critics say go enjoy this movie in theaters you wont regret it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the movie go see it my girlfriend isnt a fan but she really liked it also she kept jumping but was fully engaged some human parts was meh but godzilla totally made up for that i cant wait for kong v godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,its the best godzilla movie ive ever seen before it was awesome and after seeing it on the big screen it now has me so pumped and excited for godzilla vs kong next year
Jun 2 2019,positive,heck yeah monsters this was perfect 
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely the best godzilla movie ive seen so far  loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,would give this five stars but i wanted a monster brawl not a family drama
Jun 2 2019,neutral,the real fight is between story and spectacle but if you go in looking for some awesome monster action you wont be disappointed
Jun 2 2019,negative,some repetitive dialogue made the emphasis of godzilla seemed forced to me early on in the movie the back and forth sides of the main issue by actors seemed fickle and the titan action was ok but was more loud than intense scenes just rubbed me wrong i guess
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was even better than expected  the director did an amazing job by focusing on the monster action and the human drama  its a great time to be a godzilla fan  long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont go by rotten tomatoes this movies rocks
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a long time godzilla fan this movie was everything i wanted plus more its a true love letter to the godzilla franchise and something any fan of the series will enjoy immensely i will be seeing this movie a few more times in theaters
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you expect great story youll be disapointed if you expect gigantic monsters fighting and gorgeous action scenes youll be fully satisfied
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was great i can not imagine it being any better than it was heres hoping the next movie in the monster franchise is just as amazing d
Jun 2 2019,positive,what an amazing movie awesome action scenes beautiful cgi characters and plot was simple it is a movie about monsters destroying stuff after all  cant wait to buy it in dvd
Jun 2 2019,positive,the story is silly the characters are not really well developed and some of the fx could be better but its best damn godzilla movie since great originals i was smiling through the whole thing 
Jun 2 2019,negative,i would have rated it a 3 but sadly this movie fails to grab my attention if this movie was just a little longer they may have been able to spread out the story line a bit better but failed to do so however the dramatic fight scenes and the mediocre acting kept this movie alivesort of i tried to go into the movie with an open mind but ended up being disappointed
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla is a badass cant wait for kong vs godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it kept me on the edge of my seat
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a lot of fun i did occasionally miss the japanese speakers with english words edited in there were some clearly nonsensical plot elements that were delivered seriously in english and i would have much preferred them piped in english because it fits the nonsense being spoken very well however the monster violence was excellent if you are a fan of disaster films particularly monster disaster films this is a fun one to watch theres some cussing for no reason clearly showing the films desperation to get a pg13 rating but its excusable an exciting note for stranger things fans is that millie brown aka eleven delivers a fantastic performance as the daughter of the two lead scientists
Jun 2 2019,positive,so to start it off godzilla just be too thicc i mean every time he on screen and also ironman dies in endgame 
Jun 2 2019,positive,they followed the original storyline loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,the special effects and massive action scenes makes it worth seeing  it did need a little more character development and better script as it didnt at all engage me
Jun 2 2019,positive,the story may have been a lite weak but the monsters were amazing  i found it very entertaining and enjoyed it immensely
Jun 2 2019,positive,great godzilla flick  oscar worthy performances
Jun 2 2019,positive,thought it would be good i actually loved it great movie cool action scenes  the monsters where awesome as well definitely worth seeing  45 stars
Jun 2 2019,negative,absolutely awful they turned godzilla into a nucleified cat with 9 lives had i known it was a continuation of the previous series and not a new version entirely i wouldnt have even bothered
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a fan of godzilla final wars i am pretty satisfied its a film that is meant watched with little seriousness and i very much enjoyed the callbacks to the original soundtrack 
Jun 2 2019,negative,weak and went off the story line way to meany times
Jun 2 2019,positive,wonderful and entertaining loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing everything a godzilla movie should be with the big budget pays all sorts of homage to original movies gojira
Jun 2 2019,positive,great special effects
Jun 2 2019,positive,the best monster movie i ever watched
Jun 2 2019,positive,good acting and amazing looking monsters
Jun 2 2019,negative,i hated the boring writing of godzilla what a terrible film i wish i could have my money and time back the effects were good but didnt stop me from loathing this film 
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything a little boy who grew up watching japanese non dubbed videotapes of godzilla and co duking it out would want to see now in this new day and age the visuals the kaiju were spectacular and despite reviews it had more human development than i expected super duper thumbs up 
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun movie but disappointed  my son gave it an 8 out of 10 i gave it a 6 so i split the difference  if you like transformers movies this will be for you  very hectic cgi  lots of explosions and destruction  visually amazing  we saw in imax which in hindsight was a mistake  too loud gave my son a headache  the downfall however for me was the ending  i didnt like how the battle was eventually won  seemed to deviate too much from the original godzilla and how he aways got it done  really bugged me but hey thats just me  many will enjoy  
Jun 2 2019,positive,exactly what i paid for did not dissapoint on a side note you will encounter underdevelopment in many aspects
Jun 2 2019,positive,saw it in imax in all of its large and loud glory  the kaijumonster design and encounters was pretty awesome  the story was okay there was enough plot to make it interesting  my 7 year old was enthralled with all the godzilla goodness as well
Jun 2 2019,neutral,the action was sequences were good
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome in every way dont waste time listening to the critics 
Jun 2 2019,positive,you go to this movie to see what the 2014 movie did not provide  monsters beating the hell out of each other  if youre seeing this for any other reason youll be disappointed and should go see something else  if you go to a godzilla movie to see human characters youre doing it wrong  
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely incredible i loved the 2014 one but this one was 10x better it was mind blowing and the visual effects were insanely good im 100 going to see this again in theatres
Jun 2 2019,positive,the special effects and action was pretty good the plot was okay but could have been developed more on the areas of the family issues i liked the ending
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved the movie as an overall monster movie the graphics for the monsters werent always the greatest but for the most part i thoroughly enjoyed the action lots of actual action and fighting with the monsters  
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved the movies we saw it in 4dx and it was pretty good experience other than on some scene smoke was released and it would cover the screen but other than that i recommend it
Jun 2 2019,neutral,i love monster movies and even i was bored the story was lackluster for the first time in a while kept checking my watch to see how much time was left because it kept dragging on
Jun 2 2019,positive,was an awesome movie with cool old godzilla references from the old classics and was so freakin nostalgic
Jun 2 2019,positive,i believe your movie reviewers are off on this one  the best godzilla movie of almost all time i loved the retro music and the characters were fine  i went to see a monster movie and not worry about character development i wanted to see godzilla  what a great movie thank you so much for bringing us back to the old movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a godzilla movie it is one of the best ones of all i cried several times between the scenes all the monster scenes were so great especially the ending even if i see it again and again and again i still wont be satisfied everything from top to bottom was great especially the music 
Jun 2 2019,positive,exactly what you expect great monster movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought the movie was a lot of fun  its a movie about big monsters fighting  dont expect oscar worthy performances because if thats what yoo came for you are really missing the point of a godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,negative,lecturing and boring   too many scenes of dialogue between useless characters not enough monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it definitely a must watch for any godzilla fan
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is coming from a lifelong godzilla nut  i know few fans who have a better grasp of the franchise than myself  these characters are important to me  i mention this because if youre not a fan you probably wont enjoy my take  also ive been reading the reviews and a lot of reviewers are making their godzilla expertise obvious    after gareth edwards 2014 slowbuild into the classic mythos michael doughertys followup shifts into 2nd and hits the gas  ive been waiting for a big budget studio to take advantage of these characters for the bulk of my life and im very excited about the result      what ive been reading in other reviews is that the story and the human characters sucked but the monster fights were pretty cool  i cant help but cringe  has anyone ever seen a godzilla movie aside from the two american reboots  doesnt sound like it  so much of the mythology is packed into this movie that unless youve seen every one i could see how this one would be hard to swallow  for a nerd like me however it was an absolute delight    the plot  after the 2014 battles all of the sites godzilla and the mutos destroyed are now lush with vegetation and life  in steps an ecoterrorist group led by the deviously charming charles dance who plan to reset the planet by unleashing all of the other monsters hidden across the globe  those who have seen the aftermath episode world without oil will know that this plan is actually legit as elimination of certain human industry may appear devastating but in fact be beneficial in the long run  the group hijacks a bioaccoustic device called orca and succeed in unleashing titanus mosura aka mothra rodan the flying demon and monster zero a three headed dragon buried in antarctica  godzilla instinctively travels towards zero for a pissing contest but rodan and the big g both have their clocks cleaned in battle  the military tries to shut down the beasts with an experimental oxygen destroyer  they knock out godzilla but monster zero is unaffected forcing everyone to suspect that zero might not be from earth  this theory is confirmed by an ancient legend about ghidorah who fell from the skies eons ago  having beaten godzilla ghidorah becomes the alpha titan and begins deconstructing the planets ecosystem to suit its own needs  all other monsters on earth respond to its commands so the humans use nuclear weapons to recharge the beaten godzilla and help him take down ghidorah  a tag team monster match ensues as mothra rushes to the aid of godzilla and the planet while rodan sticks to his guns defending the new alpha    it doesnt take much imagination to figure out how it ends  although this story may be weak i believe a bad story is the perfect way to reimagine these characters  the original godzilla film from 1954 and its five reboots 1984 1998 2000 2014 and 2016 are probably the only movies in the saga not to have a completely ludacris plot  that leaves twentyfive other movies before this one and if youve seen them all youll have to agree that the bad plot of this movie is pretty consistent with the others  the tone of this movie is much more in line with the 60s and 70s superheroesque serials as opposed to gareth edwards movie which was much closer to the original  ghidorah the threeheaded monster 1964 is the biggest influence on this one but it also borrows heavily from godzilla vs monster zero 1965 destroy all monsters 1968 godzilla vs destoroyah 1995 and giant monsters allout attack 2002  rodan 1956 and mothra 1961 are the heaviest inspiration for their respective characters featured      i personally thought this movie was great  the monsters had personality  the humans had laughable lines  and most important the fights were epic  king ghidorah is something ive wanted to see done well for a very long time  he doesnt just fly around breaking buildings in this one hes literally restructuring and destroying the planet  i really think the best of the franchise has been taken and mashed up for a near perfect monster blockbuster  granted it seems to have more in common with the pacific rim movies or even the rampage adaptation than it did with its own predecessor  dont expect to be able to suspend disbelief as easily as you may have in the first film  this is a total fantasy not taking place in our reality but in a false reality created by the aftermath of the first one  after all if martians xilians kilaaks cockroaches seatopians futurians natives from varying fictional islands and aliens from the third planet of the black hole are what were following ecoterrorists arent that hard to swallow
Jun 2 2019,negative,boring but great mindless activity if you need to pass the time
Jun 2 2019,positive,fight scene is good and respect original but guys i want to watch kaiju movie not family drama villain look like a guy that wannabe thanos and many logic in movie is dump
Jun 2 2019,positive,practically a perfect godzilla movie but may not resonate with the casual viewer
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla was amazing hands down the best movie this year and im not even a fan of godzilla because hes not a very good looking protagonist
Jun 2 2019,positive,the fights were great
Jun 2 2019,positive,superlative equal to if not better than the first one
Jun 2 2019,positive,a fun ride with our favourite monster 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,frankly i get sick and tired of hollywood always putting their liberal bs into a movie  in this one we hear the same things we heard in the matrix and in the day the earth stood stillman is bad man pollutes the earth man makes war  the world would be better if collective man put a gun in his mouth and committed suicide and let the earth go back to the animals and for the movie in question the rightful heirs of the earththe monsters  if man and his activities were so bad why in the hell does hollywood keep making movies about the violent nature of man  anyway about 55 minutes into this odd godzilla movie i had to sit through the lecture of man badand i got up got a refund and left  in this one godzillas front arms are too long and the roar is not the classic roar we have come to love in a godzilla movie  save your moneythis will be out on dvddirectv in a few short weeks at a bargain price  so sad we have to have our brainwashing lesson in just about every effen movie hollywood puts out  pathetic
Jun 2 2019,positive,its really something i expected from godzilla movie regardless any plot flaws love it
Jun 2 2019,positive,these critics love tlj but hated this movie what is going on here
Jun 2 2019,positive,nice  better than the previous movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is more awesome than the first one forget about the critics from an indie horor super heroes or a sex movie fans i love this movie and the fans are loving it
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie killer effects incredible if you are s godzilla or kiaju fan
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a battle royale with not too much human interference   after all it a godzilla movie and true fans will love it
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie not a fan of the swearing  no need for it
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is a monster movie plain and simple any one who has seen the multitudes of incarnations of the king oughtta leave the theatre with a smile on their face the oneliners are cheesy worldwide travel is boundless and the radiation runs wild thats what i expected these factors combined with the assembly of classic monsters did not disappoint
Jun 2 2019,positive,theres a lot going on so much so that it can actually be hard to follow at times but it was a lot of fun and was definitely made for fans
Jun 2 2019,positive,i love the monsters scenes a and lore they include in this new movie i love it cant wait for the match against kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,possibly the greatest monster movie of all time  
Jun 2 2019,negative,ridiculous story terrible acting and way too dark
Jun 2 2019,positive,go see it best movie of 2019
Jun 2 2019,positive,giving the viewers what we wanted entertaining is what youd expect but somehow we get more watch it
Jun 2 2019,positive,action packed from start to finish really entertaining if you can look past the story
Jun 2 2019,positive,the character development is weak but the monster battles are glorious this movie is a fine way to pass the time 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie a little on the long side but packed with action rodan and mothra were executed beautifully cant wait to see the next one with kong my son and i are huge godzilla fans im just glad they didnt get wrapped in to many politics there were a few but ill let them be id recommend this to any die hard godzilla fan the ending reminded me of the old toho days when the monsters talked to each other long live the king saw it at ncg so my review dont count i suppose no way to verify it thats bs now i know why this is called rotten tomatoes 
Jun 2 2019,positive,back to the old days of creature double  feature loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,im basing my rating on being a lifelong fan of the character  series echoing the others who enjoyed this film for what it was once again the critics dont seem to get it fans wanted a monster battle royale and thankfully the studios obliged no one expects to come out enlightened from a film like this and yet for some odd reason rt feels that this film wasnt even half as good as the 2014 film they couldnt be more wrong the film drastically improved aspects that many fans complained about from godzilla 14 more screen time for the big guy a better balance between the human component and the titans more fighting  less cutaways in the middle of the action is it flawed of course it is there are plenty of areas that couldve been done better or that i wouldve preferred handled differently but at the end of the day i felt like it successfully did what most fans of the series were hoping for get the creatures everyone remembers on the screen  ring the bell 
Jun 2 2019,negative,i loved the 2014 godzilla this movie was garbage  story was terrible acting was terrible writing was atrocious even the buildup to the monster battles was anticlimatic worst movie of the year for sure 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre thinking about seeing this movie do it id ignore critics rating on this movie what you are about to see will blow your mind and you will be amazed by the work from the cast crew and vfx team put together to create an memorable godzilla this is near perfect and best godzilla film out of any godzilla film the only issue i had was the human storyline which is usual thorn in all godzilla movies but it was decent enough for me to follow but some decisions with some of the characters felt weak and bleh but all was to push godzilla in the spotlight which is the main focus of the film overall great vfx cinematography good cast awesome soundtrack and most importantly godzilla and monsters scenes are badass check it out
Jun 2 2019,positive,a fun spectacle of mighty monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,the special effects was crazy
Jun 2 2019,negative,worst movie of the year
Jun 2 2019,negative,monster movie full of battles off screen and amazing creatures that have less screen time than the humans  because we want to watch humans in a monster fight film  just so much fail  not 1 single fight from start to finish that isnt interrupted by some sort of human screen time 
Jun 2 2019,positive,best movie i have saw in a long time
Jun 2 2019,negative,worst movie of all time
Jun 2 2019,positive,monster fans will love this movie straight up bringing monsters movies back
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie was beautiful and went straight into the monsters in the first 5 minutes  the human story was ok but some boringness to it the vfx was amazing cant wait for godzilla v kong and those critics who are hating on this movie are irrelevant people and dont know what kind of audience this movie is for so i do suggest to watch it and i hope you like so we  can expand the monsterverse and make it the next big cinematic universe
Jun 2 2019,positive,jaw dropping spectacular every godzilla fans dream movie the effects are unparalleled do not miss on imax
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is what every godzilla fan wanted and more the filmmakers are true fans as they pay homage to the source materials for every main monsters king ghidorah rodan and mothra the music was also great and especially during the battles the fans can appreciate the love and care they have done with this movie i cannot wait for another godzilla movie as this has a great potential for a trilogy 
Jun 2 2019,positive,my movie of the year i normally hate the movie theater experience but godzilla shones on the big screen definitely worth seeing multiple times for the spectacle
Jun 2 2019,positive,way better than the last two western godzilla movies  had some fun throwback vibes from the old saturday morning black and whites
Jun 2 2019,positive,i thought the movie was fabtastic it was everything i came to see and more story is alright but the fighting is what you come to see a godzilla movie for not the story it has never been for the story
Jun 2 2019,positive,you know what youre getting and it delivered
Jun 2 2019,neutral,a lost opportunity what could have defined a generation will soon be forgotten way too choppy the story started off decent but soon turned to disappointment they should have only had the story focus on godzilla and a couple other kiju too many characters human and monster monster zero is awesome though 
Jun 2 2019,positive,very happy they had the original music in the background when things were going well  explained the existence of the titans very well  could have spent more time on other monsters  seeing them destroy things is what we have always seen  needed the mothra twins should have started with an ancient meteor crash at the beginning of the movie if you know what i mean
Jun 2 2019,positive,just another example of the critics having absolutely no idea what is good and what is bad
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is everything it should be big dumb and oh so fun its like taking a classic godzilla story and updating the special effects dont go in expecting high art thats not what its trying to be its an incredible ride that just gets better you go the godzilla film fans have been waiting for
Jun 2 2019,positive,keep the human civilians out of the monster battles stop it stop doing it we dont care about the humans we dont care if the broken aircraft goes over the cliff the jetfighters and war ships are fine since they are big enough and armed enough to fight back but we dont give a shit about the helpless human beings running around trying not to get stepped on either step on them or ignore them these monster battles are absolutely amazing and you need to stop taking the camera off of them we dont watch godzilla movies for a human family who never appeared before and will never appear again we came for godzilla and the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,lot of action impressed images
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are a fan of the monster movie genre then this is for you the megasized action starts within the first 15 minutes and doesnt stop until the movie ends its an in your face visual spectacle with multiple close in shots of godzilla ghidora rodan mothra and a plethora of other monsters i suggest watching it on a wide screen to truly appreciate the fight scenes this is definitely the best modern godzilla movie so far until the next one arrives
Jun 2 2019,positive,its very cool with very good special effects and this time the actors make a good role in the story 
Jun 2 2019,positive,the perfect summer popcorn film  there are enough thrills and action scenes to keep even the most casual fan on the edge of their seat  for the hardcore long time fans there are enough easter eggs and nods to the history of godzilla to satiate even the most discerning fan  why are still reading this  run dont walk to see godzilla king of the monsters
Jun 2 2019,negative,my husband enjoyed godzilla more than me personally i thought the movie was laden down with too much manucia i just wanted to see godzilla in action lastly although godzilla was the star of the movie it didnt seem that he was the main focused
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome will go see it again
Jun 2 2019,positive,family loved it  wish the fighting didnt cut out as much but overall enjoyed from start to finish
Jun 2 2019,positive,this film has some of the best visual effects i have ever seen godzilla king of the monsters is definitely a spectacle and worth watching especially if you love giant monsters fighting human characters were also better than expected i havent had this much fun in the theater for a while 
Jun 2 2019,positive,fan service all the way the critics dont know what the hell are talking about you have to see it to make your own opinion one of the best movies this year loved it all the way frombeginning to end if you can watch it on an imax screen and then watch it again on a 4d cinema
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything you want in a godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla is back awesome
Jun 2 2019,negative,this movie is so bad i almost expected george clooney to walk out as batmanmaybe he didi walked out before it ended
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster fights had me smiling from year to year like a child the special effects are amazing and the love that the director has for this franchise is noticeable throughout the film its a love letter for the fans and for the old toho films its almost guaranteed godzilla fans the japanese audience and people that are looking for some top notch action will enjoy it  however even though the human characters arent as important as the monsters the parts theyre in have pretty noticeable flaws in the writting and there are some structural problems that made some fights feel unearned  overall a pretty good godzilla movie i want to see it again someday
Jun 2 2019,negative,terrible scriptwriting  uneven sfx  a waste of two hours  im being kind
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was good but lacked the awesomeness if the first movie from 2014
Jun 2 2019,positive,im a long time godzilla fan that like the 2014 movie but thought that one big improvement that could have been made would have been to cut down on the human screen time in lieu of more monster action and remove any lame romantic subplots    this movie does that i enjoyed this movie more that the 2014 version and look forward to more in the monster series  i think that outside the original 1955 movie these are now the best godzilla stories weve gotten on film     the mothra related content in the movie is worth the price of admission alone but king ghidora is great and even poor ol rodan is upgraded from his lowly toho beginnings this is one for the fans though it seems like professional critics might prefer the matthew broderick flick oh well
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was awesome the monster fights were epic and godzilla was more impressive than ever
Jun 2 2019,positive,took my 11 yr old to see it other then the messed up trailers before the movie not bad was pretty much what i expected story meh plenty of action to keep it interesting for the kiddos  lots of kids came to see the movie not killer zombies and killer clown trailers that did not go over so well
Jun 2 2019,positive,a a fan of the godzilla genre i loved this movie and look forward to seeing it again
Jun 2 2019,positive,toho monsters looked fantastic on the big screen mothra is a star and godzilla is king youre not going to want to miss out on this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,no storyonly actionnot worth watching for 2 hours
Jun 2 2019,positive,i understand that many people may dislike this movie due to its lack of human drama however i personally enjoyed this movie i beleve it had amazing fight scenes and a wonderful musical score the only reason this doesnt get a 45 out of 10 is because the acting was not the best even some of the best actors in the movie werent on point
Jun 2 2019,positive,such a wicked awesome movie the best to see in 3d
Jun 2 2019,positive,cant stop thinking about this onesuperb all aroundf the criticswhat were you looking for
Jun 2 2019,positive,i liked when godzilla just blew up
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla is and shall ever will be the king of the monsters and hes held that title for 65 years
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is a very underrated movie the story is great and the fights are breath taking there is a perfect balance between monsters and humans one of the improvements they made from godzilla 2014 
Jun 2 2019,positive,spectacular and epic as expected
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it the godzilla movie ive been waiting for since i was a kid great monster action and impressive shots to say the least go see this movi
Jun 2 2019,positive,the qhole movie was awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,more godzilla and monster brawls you got it
Jun 2 2019,positive,the whole movie was awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,have always loved godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,the fact that critics are giving this movie negative reviews for being exactly what it was supposed to be are why this site is so stupid its a goddamn monster movie its not supposed to have the most compelling story
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is soooo amazing the cast is wonderful acting is superb the monsters are absolutely awe inspiring every time they are on screen the viewers jaw drops for longtime kaiju fans and newcomers to the genre go see this movie and on the biggest screen possible with the best sound quality you can find
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a freaking godzilla movie giant creatures  battling it out futuristic military weapons whats not to love definitely a toho studio film it literally puts you at the feet of these monster fighting it out never meant to be an oscar winner but meant to be fun and it is rotten tomato critics seem to be a bunch boring old people whove never watched a godzilla film just for the fun of it if you like godzilla you will like this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,really enjoyed the battle scenes
Jun 2 2019,positive,saw it three times and there were so many things i missed each time it was like watching it again for the first time
Jun 2 2019,positive,what a great ride though when fenway park was destroyed it turned from an action movie to a horror flick
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie gave us exactly what we wanted the main characters were the monsters the background stories were the people  we went to the movies to see giant monsters fight and thats what we got and it was awesome i hope godzilla is going to win against king kong in 2020 i love him my kids love him and he is the star of the franchise
Jun 2 2019,positive,ive seen some bad movies over the past several years feels good just to watch some monsters battle 5 stars as i loved every moment of it
Jun 2 2019,positive,bleh   too many logical inconsistencies in a movie with not much spectacle yes i do think the movie bailed out on the visual side of things there were soooooo many missed opportunities where the cinematographer could have flexed his muscles but alas most of these opportunities were squashed in favour of keeping everything largescale without any artistry   besides some cool shots mainly involving the butterfly titan mothra really unsubtle symbolism and the fights it was really underwhelming   and to those who say it was a turnoff your brain movie a film can have monster fights and all sorts of fanservice while also being of depth 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you are a godzilla fan a kaiju fan or just like a good solid scifi action movie youll love this straight forward story a little kid can follow and tons of awesome monster stuff great sound effects and wonderful score dont listen to the critics
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you love kaijugiant monster films this one is for you
Jun 2 2019,positive,great godzilla movie action packed
Jun 2 2019,positive,was happy to see elements of the old godzillakaiju films honored in this new one
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved it if you want to see monsters monsters fighting other monsters  military action this is the movie for you
Jun 2 2019,positive,great for kids and all of us
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything ive ever wanted from a godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie antagonist didnt make a lot of sense but at the same time their ridiculousness echoed that of the hiesie era toho movies the monster battles are thrilling though sometimes i wish they didnt cut away so often would be nice if they were some day fights but thats okay this movie is stuck between wether it wants to take itself seriously or not this problem rest with the characters some are fun and relevant while others are cheesy and trope riddled the score is top notch and the resurgence of the original theme is breathtaking  over all if you are looking for classic monster action and are a godzilla fan through and through you will have a good time and if you dont like classic monster tropes then idk why you would go watch this movie in the first place
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is an absolute masterpiece the emotion and the personalities of the monsters really brought the feeling of a truly great continuation of the godzilla franchise
Jun 2 2019,positive,i grew up on godzilla movies the new effects together with the fierce godzilla is awesome no more chubby short armed fake and cross eyed watch in xd or dolby to get full experience some reviews not so good but i would guess they did not appreciate the film holding onto its root storylines and simple themes but thats what made the old films so great you overlooked the goofy monsters and fake planes and tanks you rooted for the good guys to show up and save the day and let your imagination run its not supposed to be too serious or grounded in reality
Jun 2 2019,positive,it took a while for the movie to get going but once it did there was some cool action and some good fighting scenes and it was good seeing godzilla again on the big screen and i did enjoy it see it
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved it  best movie of 2019 
Jun 2 2019,positive,sooo much better than that boring first one this is a must see
Jun 2 2019,positive,great story line actors and better understanding of godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is a love letter to kaiju movies its a fun time at the theatre and i never wanted it to end yes its not a perfevr movie but boy did it deliver where it mattered
Jun 2 2019,positive,a true godzilla movie 123 better than the 2014
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was amazing like anything any godzilla fan could have ever dreamed of and wanted legendary and michael dougherty did an outstanding job best godzilla movie ever and my new 1 favorite movie of all time the story plot soundtrack action sequences and ending were great best ending of any godzilla film ever tomoyuki tanaka yoshimitsu banna and haruo nakajima would be proud and crying they are probably doing so from heaven right now this movie gets a 1010 from me
Jun 2 2019,positive,ignore the cretins posting bs about this fantastic work of art the lack of human drama is a selling point to fans of the series and anyone else who just wants to see some good old fashioned monster on monster carnage not everything needs to be oscar bait not every movie is trying to be schindlers list sometimes you just want to go to the movies to have a good time and this is just that a really good time
Jun 2 2019,negative,seriously its that bad
Jun 2 2019,positive,literally the coolest movie ive ever seen
Jun 2 2019,positive,best godzilla movie ever crazy action john wick of monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla 2014s biggest weakness was the lack of actual monster battles while forcing a human plot along     godzilla 2019 however course corrects and delivers on exactly what you wanted in a godzilla film monster fighting galore lessons on the human element have not been learned in this movie and repeats the same mistakes as the first movie which is a bummer but if you are going into this film for a story then you are going to the wrong film    excellent cinematography visuals and audio track that will leave you speechless  however the human element is lacking and although they did a good job at making the cuts less so the human story still needs to be better     i came here for the monster fighting and only for the monster fighting and this film delivers completely 
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely loved this movie and i saw it in 3d and it was soooo freaken amazing visually the only thing i would have done is have less human storylines and more fighting and maybe during a day scene  but all in all i think this is the best godzilla movie ive seen and ive seen them all by the way and i cant wait for kong vs godzilla 
Jun 2 2019,positive,could have been better grafics on the monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,nothing nonstop  action i remember the old godzilla movies that used to come on tv i grew up watching hose i love it so did my kids
Jun 2 2019,positive,classic godzilla exciting throughout
Jun 2 2019,positive,very good godzilla movie i think critics are missing the point by saying it is incoherent its pretty simple plot wise and yeah it is not even a bit as sophisticated in its messaging as shin godzilla but the american versions have always been toned down im looking at you raymond burr and some of the humans are dumb surprise but overall you get a lot of giant monsters foreshadowing for kong foreshadowing for future mothra etc
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was good but not as good as the first one 
Jun 2 2019,positive,long time godzilla fan epic af ghidorah looked amazing terrifying mothra was beautiful godzilla was just a beast the score was perfect even the human side of the story was great and interesting 1010
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie tons of monster action and destruction the human story was fine i dont know what the critics are talking about this is the new standard that all future godzilla movies need to achieve or surpass 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was the best fudging movie of the year so far  dont let no one tell you differently
Jun 2 2019,positive,this chaotic mess may be as confusing as it seems but it is clearly the tribute of what toho gave us for the past 65 years this is more of a film dedicated to diehard fans of the franchise this disaster cuttingedge style is no different from its predecessors 
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of monster action
Jun 2 2019,negative,biggest scifi disappointment i can remember the trainer was great  the film was an utter mess
Jun 2 2019,positive,the visuals were amazing and they did an awesome job actually including the monterstitans
Jun 2 2019,positive,not as good as the last movie but entertaining if you like monster movies and grew up watching godzilla good cgi vera famiglia is great in any movie full of gratuitous explosions and more open mouth stares than i could count
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla is and always will be the king of the monsters  loved it  he looked fantastic
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a good movie but wasnt amazing i liked to graphics and fighting scenes all the titans in the movie really looked real and believable
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is so much fun if you go in with a fine comb you can find a lot to get hung up on but if you go in excited to watch an exciting kaiju flick youll be incredibly satisfied  if you liked the first one youll love this even more if you thought the first one needed more focus on the monsters definitely give it a second look
Jun 2 2019,positive,best godzilla movie in a long time
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome facts loved the battle scenes the only disappointment i want it more fighting overall excellent movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters was a grate movie the movie had nice and tasteful callbacks to the older toho godzilla movies the movie did a good job with incorporating some of the older soundtracks the designs of the monsters were changed but in a tasteful way that did not crap on the original designs the movie did linger on the human family drama and tried to make you feel sympathy for the mothers redemption story but i could care less
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was like a old school godzilla movie only made in the modern day i liked all the litte nods and easter eggs from past films the kaiju designs old  new and i liked that  they showed respect to the older films and those that stared in them i wont call it a perfect by any means but i will say for kaiju and tokusatsu fans this movie was for us
Jun 2 2019,positive,the blockbuster movie of the summer dont believe the so called experts and their reviews do yourself a favor and make sure to catch this beast of a movie the hype for godzilla vs kong is real
Jun 2 2019,positive,i love the movie godzilla is one of my favorite monster
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely loved it reminded me of the old school godzilla movies that focused on the monster fights and the humans were the side characters
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was seeing our monsters as real creatures instead of puppets long live the king godzilla

Jun 2 2019,positive,saw it only for the monsters once again the humans sucked except for anthony ramos of course    
Jun 2 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie i have ever seen
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie is a giant monster masterpiece and a prime example of just how out of touch critics are with the actual movie consumer the producers of godzilla 2014 were told by the audience less people problems more monsters throwing down and they delivered i watched this movie in imax and i have to say it was an absolute thrill levels of destruction that rival the legendary 2012 even if monster fights were the focuse the acting was supreme and the human story i still found much better than the 2014 movie ive never really agreed with rotten tomatoes critics but their horrible misrepresentation of this movie motivated me to make an account and voice my own opinion you want a kickass monster fight movie step aside pacidic rim the king is here critics can shove it this round
Jun 2 2019,negative,boring and didnt care for the political agenda in the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,exactly what i hoped it would be
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved the imax experience was my first time ever at an imax theatre the movie theatre was extremely clean
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was honestly really good it could have done with a little less sappy finding the truth about myself character development but it was allinall a great godzilla movie as far as they go
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre a godzilla fun you will love every minute of this movie if youre a critic youll hate it because you have your head squarely lodged in your own anus
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the movie it was what a giant monster movie should be
Jun 2 2019,negative,biggest let down of the year as boring human characters take up most of the movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great kaiju movie almost reaching lovecraftian levels and lots of fan service 
Jun 2 2019,positive,plenty of action and many references to other monsters
Jun 2 2019,positive,more monsters and several times better then godzilla 2014 go see it make him king of the box office
Jun 2 2019,positive,a whole lot of crazy action going on at one time godzilla delivers insane monster fights and some of the most over the top action i think ive seen on screen intense and unforgiving to the senses this movie does what it can to keep you wowed even though it maybe goes a little too far
Jun 2 2019,positive,exactly what you want from a godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,phenomenal monster movie and one of the best godzilla movies every moment that a monster was onscreen was incredibly epic     story and characters were also really good but the monsters owned the movie they were the real main characters    the sense of scale was incredble and pacing was great finally the musical score and sound design was par to none
Jun 2 2019,positive,just amazing best movie ever my jaw was dropped the whole movie i dont like the bad critics look at critics vs adence
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is the best godzilla movie long live the king
Jun 2 2019,negative,awful special effects sucked too much talking
Jun 2 2019,negative,good action but under blue snapchat filter bad plot
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was awesome    the monster battles were epic the music was on point the special effects top notch and the cinematography was great the human element did not detract from the actual monsters and the undertone theme about the environment and finding a balance between our environment ourselves and the other animals that live here was done well instead of being shoved down the audience throat like a majority of new films these days it was a great homage to tohos monster movies without spoiling anything godzilla and mothra sent chills down my spine so did the other monsters but ive always had a soft spot for those two i was hoping to see king caesar but alas not in this film they probably didnt get the rights to it     also charles dance is epic he doesnt have a particularly large role but damn does he have screen gravitas    its everything a kaiju film should be and they were respectful of tohos film cannon i dont know what movie these super critics were watching but they need to get off their sanctimonious high horses this was a great fil worth the price of a movie ticket popcorn and soda
Jun 2 2019,positive,first the critics dont know shit about godzilla apprantly second best godzilla movie ever made
Jun 2 2019,positive,well balanced between the human plot and monsters background immersive experience for everyone godzilla fans enjoy it its great fit for a king
Jun 2 2019,positive,big summer blockbuster fun incorporated all the hits from the classic rubber predecessors long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was exactly what i wanted it to be and a little bit more so good
Jun 2 2019,positive,pretty fun monster movie not as bad as the critics are saying but man for the next film have a bigger final fight preferably one not in the rain and snow
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was amazing 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i admit some aspects of the human plot were dumb and perhaps not very well crafted or thought out but overall this film was extremely entertaining and fun the pacing of the plot is kept the movie exciting and stimulating the kaijutitan action was well balanced with the human characters overall this is a giant upgrade in storytelling and action in comparison to the 2014 gareth edwards film the story wasnt perfect but overall it was a very entertaining and action packed summer blockbuster that i feel is a definite mustsee 
Jun 2 2019,positive,very good movie i thought it wouldnt be  at  first because toho productions used to  produce the movies until warner brothers out bought toho productions thiss is the fourth movie not made by toho productions i also think warner brothers also did good to but they couldnt match the nastalgic ones of toho productions 
Jun 2 2019,positive,ive been a godzilla fan since i was 8 i remember watching godzilla team up with rodan and the baby mothra against king ghidorah this movie had many nods to the original content and the story was better put together then the previous 2014 movie the action was great and you finally feel like godzilla was the main actor instead of a cameo  its heavy on the cursing but you cant blame the story for that i doubt people say sweet things when facing the end of the world   i would recommend this film to any godzilla or monster fan along with those looking for a good movie to watch on date night  i even enjoyed this movie more than end game though i would give them the same rating
Jun 2 2019,positive,ignore all the pompous bleep hole critics this is a great oldschool monster movie with the modern special effects
Jun 2 2019,positive,looking forward to seeing it again
Jun 2 2019,positive,i have been a fan for the godzilla franchise for years and this did not disappoint for me
Jun 2 2019,positive,action packed and great visual effects they finally did godzilla justice hopefully there will be a follow up movie
Jun 2 2019,negative,well it looked good  when the monsters clashed it was enough to entertain in that mind numbing way  unfortunately the plot was stupid  the characters were stupid  the dialogue was cringe  the environmental message was so on the nose im surprised it didnt hurt the writers when they came up with it
Jun 2 2019,negative,looks good way too much filler i would even watch the lego movie over this
Jun 2 2019,positive,big fan all my life  they did it they brought the daikaiju eiga genre to hollywood it is at least the closest thing we will ever see of it anyway in other words its a great godzilla film made by hollywood  yeah pacific rim  godzilla 2014 and skull island were close but kotm is on pare with the toho style for sure  i went into it mostly spoiler free i was surprised by a few things it was fun all the familiar themes are there but its not the same old thing its a little different in a good way they continued the story quite well from the 2014 film and improved the story and character development its a lot better this time around they managed to cram as much important drama into it with the action i did not feel like the film paused needlessly at all i enjoyed the human story it went well with everything its a classic toho style with the monsters as the stars with the human supporting characters and drama moving the story forward i feel it is a well balanced film and nowhere near as incoherent as some of the reviews suggested you need to follow what everyone is saying thats all it makes sense it all came together quite nicely i am very happy with it all 4 of the titans were true to their original characters more then i expected i am very pleased with this film i was wishing that the vs kong film wold have been a lead into this one but now i understand where they are going with it and am quite excited to see what transpires from here on in the monsterverse it aint over yet stay for the end credit scene wow  not what i thought it was going to be  only bad things are how dark everything was  that was mostly due to ghidorahs bad weather but it would have been nice to see things more clearly in parts  also they cold have puled back more and showed us some scale more often      
Jun 2 2019,positive,good family entertainment
Jun 2 2019,positive,1010 best godzilla movie so far if you are a fan of godzilla youll love this movie cgi was marvelous best of year ive ever seen i loved it
Jun 2 2019,positive,so much action and monster on monster scene its a break from all the drama most movies bring every scene is a desktop background and nothing looks boring in this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont listen to those sour old critics  this is the best godzilla movie ever
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you want a drama movie go watch lifetime this was the ultimate godzilla movie that gives homage to all the classics
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is the godzilla movie that kaiju fans have been waiting for this is a fans film full of giant monster action that just set a new standard in filmmaking all while paying homage to its ancestors epically awesome and nostalgic a must see for anyone who loves monster flicks without a doubt this film is worthy of its namesake as the king of the monsters long live the king  
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster fights were great though at times they make godzilla look weak   what was dissapointing was the families story and the ridiculous science   they focused too much time on that stupid sound machine  the whole plot with the mom wanting to wipe out humanity to save the planet then come to her senses at the last minute was ridiculous  of course the military thats involved has to look incompetent  the cool monster fights were interrupted too often with that crap  cant we have a monster movie without people making stupid decisions but the cool lore about godzilla the anciet civilizations that worshipped him and ghidoras origions were hardly mentioned  that would have been a better focus 
Jun 2 2019,positive,third time watching its amazing please go watch it
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome throwback to the classic godzilla movies  the pacing is good  the monster fights are perfect  the human part of the movie is decent and what you would expect from a traditional godzilla movie  i  give it a 1010 for what it is a godzilla movie  these movies arent dramas arthouse etc theyre giant monsters fighting each other  as a lifelong godzilla fan i was beyond happy with this  
Jun 2 2019,positive,this godzilla is not just the king of the monsters hes the king of the godzilla franchise
Jun 2 2019,positive,great monster movie but only a good film was exactly what i wanted to see when i went but its not going to win any crazy awards will see the sequel whenif there is one
Jun 2 2019,positive,monster fights were epic if they werent interrupted by stupid human stuff  all in all a great popcorn flick worth the price of admission just to see these kaiju in all there epic glory
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved the action the story and just everything in this movie was so satisfying cant wait to see more in the next installment of godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,a visual spectacle very good use of the monsters  the humans story is just ok nothing special
Jun 2 2019,positive,its an espectacular piece monster fights are awesome human plot isnt that good but who cares about humans in a kaiju movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,exceptional visual effects brought this cast of classic monsters back to life in a larger scale than i could have hoped for youll enjoy this movie if you arent expecting a deep dive plot sit back and get lost in larger than life recreation that is more true to to old movies than the 2014 reboot
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie delivered beyond my expectations from the trailers an amazing homage to the lore that this franchise has created and im ready for the next one with open arms
Jun 2 2019,positive,perfect godzilla film monsters trashing cities and monsters fighting monsters 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i was apprehensive going into this movie i enjoyed the 2014 godzilla and 2017 kong skull island but hadnt seen any other godzilla property many attempted cinematic universes have gone the way of the dark universe and ended before they truly began the godzillaverse did better than most with two generally acceptable movies and was hoping to keep things rolling with a third    for me it absolutely keeps rolling this movie was a lot of fun its easy to say after a block buster movie comes out that visual look amazing but it really is jaw dropping to see these huge fictitious monsters go at each other and really feel their weight that is the most common complaint against cgi that the characters feel to light and dont affect the world around them enough somehow with the most outrageous unrealistic monsters you really feel these fights you feel the size of these characters their weight and their affect on the environment around them you can see the expression on their faces and it is really incredible     it is disappointing that not all of the 2014 godzilla cast returned especially bryan cranston but one of the holdovers ken watanabe absolutely slays fans of stranger things will also enjoy millie bobbie brown who does her roll very well    overall it is really solid the first fight scene might actually be the most impressive and its run time could arguably have been trimmed a bit but still an entertaining time happy to see where this franchise goes
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome loved the film  on the edge of my seat all the way only on the big screen
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movies imagery and visuals are absolutely stunning there is plenty of action and plenty of titan on titan action where this movie lacks is in its rushed story and lack of information on most of the titans this is a very entertaining movie and it is exactly what i was expecting this movie is a spectacle and the story line suffers because of it but that does not make it a bad movie if you want to see some badass titan versus titan action then i highly recommend seeing this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,big fan of godzilla and enjoyed the movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a good movie  would watch it again 
Jun 2 2019,positive,a great  movie i saw it in imax and it was an absolute spectacle and a pleasure as a long time godzilla fan i cant recommend this movie enough kotm is a movie for fans and newcomers alike the soundtrack for this movie had me in tears especially the theme for mothra which is a loving remix of her original 1961 theme and the big g himself has his themes remixed in this movie and its perfectnot to mention a certain blue oyster cult song in the end credits  this is a godzilla for modern audiences and hopefully will help bridge the gap between casual viewers and hardcore fans i give this experience a 9510
Jun 2 2019,negative,story line was garbage
Jun 2 2019,positive,good monster action and story lame human drama not relatable
Jun 2 2019,positive,general review  i dont normally write reviews but a friend a nongodzilla fan wanted a review from a nongodzilla fan to decide whether she would give the movie a shot so here we go     this movie is well worth seeing and seeing on as big a screen you can manage it is a big monster movie and thats not for everyone but its not just a series of contiguous monster fights the story is solid you can always nitpick at technical minutia but again theyre giant monsters dont get lost in the weeds or youll miss a good story that is very well told     the pacing of the movie is good there is a great deal of tension built up and the ebbs and flows are well crafted its a long movie but i didnt feel it they did a great job of establishing not relying on explaining things after theyve happened allowing the story to unfold rather than be explained there is technobabble but it doesnt bog down the story again dont get lost in the weeds its a macguffin good use of foreshadowing things early on dovetail nicely into things that happen later in the film bringing you along with the story not treating you as an idiot   the effects were stunning definitely the best digital effects ive seen in any movie so far the fight scenes were epic as one might expect they did not disappoint in any fashion the progression from the first fight to the last were logical in their choreography and execution i wish i could go into detail but spoilers there was only one little quirk that kind of jerked me out of the emersion but it quickly passed and as it was funny it was easily forgivable in the larger context of the sheer carnage of citydestroying mayhem     the musical score was spectacular cudos to bear mccreary the score is usually a companion to the movie but in this instance the music acts as a character in its own right without being obtrusive or an obvious tool of manipulation it follows the story not just cueing but accenting the action on the screen he takes the musical themes of godzilla mothra and others im sure i just didnt catch and elevates it wonderfully the japanese roots are very strong and ever present bear shows a light touch here and reminds me of john williams overall score of the empire strikes back    specific review  although i am not a godzilla fan i will refer to the monsters as kaiju instead of titan out of respect for the world created by ishirō honda   in the center is this young girl dealing with her broken family its told with the backdrop of an unfolding disaster which is the destruction of the planet as i dont want to spoil anything ill just talk about the portrayals and keep the story very abstract madison russel millie brown is a smart but troubled young lady dealing with separated parents pay attention from the beginning they are establishing very important concepts with these central figures they do this wonderfully however pay attention as nothing is wasted in this aspect of storytelling madison goes on the heroes journey she has her fears and faults she wrestles with them goes through the fire and becomes truly heroic theres a lot i can say about this but id have to reveal too much but she is the hero of the movie    millie brown was wonderful in this role unlike most child actors they are all too often praised for roles where they act well above their characters age millie plays her age and does it very well her character is smart astute but troubled and you can feel that in her performance this almost reaches natalie portmans performance in the professional shes not quite there but shes well on her way and i hope she takes her craft seriously because she definitely has the potential to be tremendous     the father mark russel kyle chandler starts the movie a broken figure the aftermath of the first movie which you dont need to see as they allude to the events well enough to bring you up to speed mr chandler is very good in his portrayal and is key to setting up a lot of the overall tension and much of the themes of the plot particularly the philosophies that drive the actions of the us government and monarch the organization hes sortof part of more than this is the conflict between his character and godzilla himself which is one of the few direct connections between humans and kaiju there are always parallels that they expound in these films about the relation between the kaiju and humanity and this movie is no exception but the relation between mark and godzilla was a surprise and wasnt told in a vacuum it wasnt a onesided feeling where the human takes godzillas actions personally and godzilla doesnt even know he even exists this relationship is really interesting to see and thats all i can really say about it without spoilers    the mother dr emma russel vera farmiga plays her character very well and although i found her in the beginning somewhat puzzling it came into focus midway and youll know when you see it again her role is integral to the plot and although she isnt the hero of the movie she has her own painful journey nothing wasted here everything serves the story and vera does it very well    not every character in a story gets a story arc most of the characters are just there to fill a need in the story but there are some real standouts in this movie top of the list is ken watenabe dr ishiro serizawa the absolute moral center of the story he is both the voice of reason and compassion for this story an advocate for humanity and kaiju alike and im assured by my godzilla fan friend that he embodies the core of the overall godzilla thread hes not just the soldier in the storm he is tested and has his doubts bringing that nice touch of vulnerability in his humanity    charles dance colonel jonah alan was epic in his portrayal of the ideological warrior unapologetic and exacting in his actions this was really the only obvious bad guy sometimes on the verge of a cartoon villain but charles pulled it back just enough to make him compelling well played sir    bradly whitford dr rick stanton was the skeptic of the group echoing is this really a good idea and that snarky fashion that doesnt overexhort itself bradly although he could have pushed this he held it at a good line leaving you in the position to decide whether you like this character or dont you funny stuff    aisia hinds colonel diane foster was the motivator a strong stern commander who carries out her duties sometimes not happily but always professionally she ties together nicely the security forces of monarch those poor soldiers who just suffer absolute devastation at the casual movements of the kaiju and the core of characters in the forefront of the movie it wasnt just heres the military and they do what they do they were tied into the story through the colonel    oshay jackson jr chief warrant officer barnes and elizabeth ludlow first lieutenant griffin were the standouts of the extraneous characters absolute badasses they were not necessary but they added to every scene they were in and gave some personality to the poor poor soldiers    lastly is david strathairn admiral william stenz is great in his portrayal of the military i say portrayal of the military because hes really more than an individual in the movie hes playing a kind of force of nature potentially every bit as destructive as the kaiju themselves davids performance is very strong and not in a trite bullheaded immovable object manner but as a reflective and introspective manner he makes decisions and doesnt secondguess himself but these decisions do weigh on him he brings some degree of sympathy in this regard    im not a fan of big monster movies or disaster movies as a genre unto themselves but i dont dislike them either i went into this film with the notion that it would be at the very least going to be a fun monsters brawl it was that and how but i was surprised at how much more was there and how well it was done its not a somethingforeveryone picture its just a really good picture i think almost anyone can enjoy unless the just cant stand monster movies ive read some complaints of too much monster not enough people this is nonsense and i wonder what movie they actually saw the people are there almost the entire time and besides its not a drama its an action movie dont walk into the wrong theater another criticism was that the eco terrorists were the bad guys well the are terrorist but this is as ridiculous as people complaining that the bad guy in that muppet movie was an oil company chief ideological nonsense and what the morons really dont get or refuse to get is that monarch the opposition to the eco terrorists is also an environmental organization    to michael dougherty youve really done an amazing job here youve taken a very iconic piece and shown it the reverence its fans deserve and elevated it into a really fine action movie bravo im going to see it again today on a bigger screen cheers  
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla fans will love it

Jun 2 2019,positive,my 8 year old loves it it does have a lot of fight scenes i thought the story plot was lacking it was suddenly raining storming dark or snowing anytime a monster was on the screen as if to save money on cgi hoping the directorsproducers of kong skull island are responsive for the next zilla vs kong movie

Jun 2 2019,positive,when your watch movies like this you have to suspend disbelief obviously this is not based on real life once you get past that this is an entertaining film the special effects are great and the storyline was easy to follow if youre looking to get away from real life for a couple of hours and be entertained this is the movie for you it definitely wont win any awards or break any record but people will walk away taking about it

Jun 2 2019,positive,it was everything i was hoping it would be good fun and lots of monsters only a few parts that made me almost go to sleep but to be fair i was coming off a 3 12 hour flight after 4 hours of sleep before coming to this haha

Jun 2 2019,positive,professional critics never cease to amaze with haughty  stuck up opinions  thinking everything has to either be a gold metalist at sundance or an oscar contender    this is godzilla nuff said    and its fantastic  take the kids buy the big bucket of popcorn and have a blast    so good 
Jun 2 2019,positive,you cant go to a godzilla movie expecting gone with the wind that being said there was some cliché stuff but the movie was fun if you took it for what it was worth and dont think too much definitely had some fan service in there glad this film got the rights to the original music unlike the last movie anyway for a monster movie i thought it was good you go for the monsters and sht blowing up if there is an actual story its a bonus see it on the biggest screen possible 
Jun 2 2019,positive,went to see the movie with my bestfriend we became friends because of godzilla i found it very enjoyable i felt like a kid again a deeper lore was added to a cultural classic and the storytelling was natural and the fan service was great
Jun 2 2019,positive,a little homey in parts  good action  just ok
Jun 2 2019,positive,finally surpassed the  japanese godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla movies are awesome
Jun 2 2019,negative,last week my kids subjected me to pokemon now i have to watch this  back to back bad  godzilla is not a horrible movie but it wasnt very good full of ridiculous plot holes and loud banging and screeching noises  i get enough of those from my kids  if you want an adhd epileptic meltdown this might be your movie  in some respects it channels the old cheesy 60s godzilla movies  oh no godzilla  bring out the science guys and the army  they maybe could have steered into the wind and played up the humor and the camp but they played it super serious and it doesnt work when what you are watching is so patently absurd  and then they added a family drama  not only was the family drama bad the mom went from channeling samuel jacksons villain in kingsmen humans are the virus to supermom hero  the movie seemed to swing between justifying genocide and cheering the balance of the titans to  no  humans are good  i was going to kill 14 of humanity but my daughter is in danger i had better scrap my megalomaniacal plan  geez  glad she bought it otherwise the end of the movie would have been awkward  some cool monster on monster action scenes but not enough to recommend the movie and at 2 hours this thing dragged despite the frenetic plot pacing
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved this godzilla best one yet in the modern era the rendering of the monsters terrific with fighting scenes that are amazing  my eyes literally widened during some scenes  its remarkable to hold go see it
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is the film godzilla fans have been waiting for for the last twenty years im not saying the 2014 film and shin godzilla are by any means poor films in fact they are some of the best in the series but kotm delivers on its promise of giant monster fights memorable and important side characters and best of all the film feels nostalgic all the way through delivering moments of fanservice seemingly every five minutes this film is a must see for all fans of godzilla and monster movies alike 
Jun 2 2019,positive,exceptional action much better godzilla film than the first disagree very much with the critics on this one
Jun 2 2019,positive,great cast  action full movie

Jun 2 2019,positive,great focus on the monsters plus wait until after the full credits for an extra scene
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a hardcore godzilla fani expect godzilla to fight monsters destroy buildings and leave minimal human characters i felt this movie did justice to godzilla fans everywhere by following those rules

Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie wasnt made for critics it was made for godzilla fans the human element of the movie isnt as bad as press would make it out to be this was undeniably a classic godzilla movie humans having no choice but to be at the mercy of the titans that were battling over the planet the visuals were breathtaking and while the plot was relatively predictable it was nonetheless satisfying this movie is an absolute must see for any godzilla fan
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the action definitely served godzilla justice

Jun 2 2019,positive,epic  a good old fashioned monster movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,surprisingly very good exactly what a summer movie should be 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is exactly what godzilla have been wanting to see for a long time critics arent going to like this because they are going into this for all the wrong reasons absolutely amazing and over the top cant wait to see the next installment i hope there are multiple movies in the future and not just one or two more
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome monster fights story is eh

Jun 2 2019,positive,its a giant monster movie for the ages soundtrack cg and sound design were exceptional
Jun 2 2019,positive,love it its a godzilla film all the way story was great and monsters even better
Jun 2 2019,negative,no way near enough monster fights 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you grew up watching the godzilla movies then this is another to add to the collection if youre not familiar with monsters you might get lost but all in all
Jun 2 2019,negative,stupid with moronic plot  but it was visually impressive  things blew up monster roamed the earth
Jun 2 2019,positive,fun movie action packed and great fight scenes some plot holes but its a monster moviego and enjoy it
Jun 2 2019,positive,i almost sleep un the cinema regular cgi actors were very overacted
Jun 2 2019,positive,went to see a monster fight movie got a monster fight movie dont listen to the clowns in the critic corner
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was so epic giant monsters fighting was just awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,pays amazing honors to the originals loved it cheered a ton clapped a lot nostalgia train plus a classic good vs evil story 
Jun 2 2019,negative,hard to follow cgi overload
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a fun time that anyone can enjoy a massive improvement over 2014 but no shin godzilla but really what could be 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is what a godzilla movie is supposed to be  liked the callbacks to the classic films  ill be seeing this again
Jun 2 2019,positive,i was a fun movie with plenty of references to the original movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie all the way
Jun 2 2019,positive,the monster storyline is epic the human plot less so with writing and character motivations that dont make a whole lot of sense  the cinematography is excellent though they really know how use camera angles and lighting to make the monsters feel as big snaps strong as they are
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a more recent fan of godzilla films i found myself really loving this movie all the action sequences are breathtaking it has some top notch cgi the actual story was fine nothing thats going to blow your socks off but compared to some of the storylines in other godzilla movies i think its one of the better ones there are some decent performances here nothing oscar worthy but nothing truly horrible if you are going to see this movie for the actual story you can skip it if you want to see giant monsters duke it and and have a fun time while doing it then definitely go see it preferably on the biggest screen possible
Jun 2 2019,positive,id rather watch this vs a movie about an untalented overrated gay musician
Jun 2 2019,positive,everything you could ever want from a godzilla movie and more
Jun 2 2019,positive,saw opening thursday  incredible spectacle  listen to my dvm audio notes
Jun 2 2019,positive,the loudness ruined it a little
Jun 2 2019,positive,the right mix of people and monsters good story great monster fights what more can anyone want from a giant lizard fight movie love it
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters is a wonderful phenomenal film an excellent celebration of the titular characters 65 years of history the 35th film in the franchise has easter eggs and references galore and the fan service is excellent the score is intoxicating the action is edge of your seat thrilling the human characters while not the quality of such ones from gojira or the ones from the heiseimillennium era films are thoroughly entertaining and do very well to advance the plot without boring you the acting is sincere and full of spirit the monsters themselves are more expressive than ever and godzilla himself is the most badass he has been in decades the story itself is an excellent representation of mankinds struggles to coexist with nature and how in the end it is up to us and us alone to make the right choices so we dont go extinct godzilla being nature mankind must coexist with godzilla you will come for the action but stay for the experiences as a whole
Jun 2 2019,positive,one of the best movies to see  man me and my brothers grew up on godzilla and to see it now like this was awesome
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was amazing must see
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you like godzilla like me and can turn your brain off like i did you will love this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,too many liberties taken with the story line ghidora was never an alien creature godzilla and mothra were not friends  too much jumbledaction reminiscent of a transformers movie  misleading commercials leads one to think godzilla fights multiple monsters  corny ending
Jun 2 2019,positive,it brought back classic monster action songs from the old movies and countless references i didnt think the characters were that bad and the story was good but it couldve been better the visuals were beautiful all of the monster designs were on point the only thing that bothered me was a couple plot holes mainly dealing with characters location but they didnt distract me from the enjoyable factors of this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,the graphics were awesome and the monster fights were wonderfully done the acting was a little dull but i went to see the monsters anyway
Jun 2 2019,negative,terrible film only better than the 2014 godzilla cause theres more of godzilla in this   the family storyline in this film is painful to watch utter waste of time watching them   the actors done what they could but the characters was poorly written and the jokes fell flat on there face monsters looked great but yet again we kept panning away from important fights to see the garbage human drama what was pointless   very disappointing film havent been this disappointed since batman vs superman
Jun 2 2019,positive,best godzilla film evercritics have to be getting paid off
Jun 2 2019,positive,good ole monster madness silly dialog and bonkers action cant beat it
Jun 2 2019,positive,relieved to say the movie itself was a large step up from the 2014 reboot way more monster vs monster action   the previous one barely had any godzilla the fight scenes were dark and murky and the human players were just plain boring  here the human characters werent as uninteresting as last time even though some of their motivations are shaky at best the focus next to the king of monsters is a fractured family recovering from the aftermath of the battle of san francisco vera farmiga kyle chandler and millie bobby brown as the russells lost their youngest in the midst of all the chaos now both parents have polar opposite reasons to either keep the monsters alive or eradicate them altogether more and more are being discovered daily and because of a signal created to lure them out they follow on alpha this one being in the form of ghidora the dragon with 3 heads and the power to unleash lightning the other creatures include rodan even mothra   monarch the secret organization studying these giant beasts are also on the verge of being shut down yet they still want to communicate with them   if its more balls to the wall action you want you wont be disappointed the human players actually do join the fight in helping godzilla reestablish the natural order  theres definitely so many callbacks to the older generation of fans whom have followed this giant lizard since 1950s cinema  in terms of godzilla himself theres no black or white maybe we just live in the world with him its also hard to tell if hes on our side or not and there can only be one king above the rest     its a scary thing too trying to balance nature with so many apex predators involved to avoid extinction our own species may perish if we dont let the original planets inhabitants take it back is mankind its own poison killing the earth whos the real monster the ones exploiting these behemoths or the behemoths themselves theres always consequences messing with mother nature   if you were letdown by the previous movie then this rectifies all that amazing action mind blowing effects better human players and great fan service the king of monsters is back in top form   
Jun 2 2019,positive,excellent movie if you know godzilla movies youll understand this movie it draws from many of the classics its great this is an update people are critiquing plot lines and acting umm have any of you ever watched godzilla movies before this and the last one are by far the best of any of the 50 movies out there i have seen my fair share of train sets and plastic soldier being knocked over since i was a kid i dont get people also how do you fall asleep in this movie up to late the night before diabetic i dont understand yeah its not avengers but its a pretty darn good movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,a giant all out monster slug fest  you dont go to these movies to see the humans fight each other but you often see it occur long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzillas delivery was as its supposed to be monster fights thats what godzillas about 
Jun 2 2019,positive,so much fun    warner bros has got a great thing going on with their monsterverse  great flick
Jun 2 2019,positive,the critics are dumb this is a monster movie it was better than the first wish it was more monsters than humans but still very enjoyable cant wait for future movies
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was an absolutely fantastic movie i wrote this somewhere else and pasting it here where it belongs    incredible moviestunning to behold and fantastic action  i think the critics were expecting a shakespearean production with the monsters speaking with a sophisticated english accent  the vast majority of them are missing the actual point and raison detre of the film did they really expect godzilla to say to ghidorah  hark you 3 headed knave thou hast ruined my childhood in the cambrian age due to thy treacherous machinations  all i can say to anyone on the fence in regard to watching this film is this  the movie is a summer blockbuster designed to entertain and dazzle which it does in spades  fantastic visuals great fight scenes and a pretty darn good plot line considering we are dealing with giant monsters and aliens  do not deny yourself one heck of a spectacle because of poor reviews made by clueless critics     1    zach pope    
Jun 2 2019,positive,i enjoyed it  watched it with three of my friends and we all enjoyed it  it was highly entertaining  we watched the friday night late show and were all tired from work  didnt fall asleep so yeah it was good  if you want to watch a movie that will win an oscar this is not for you  but then again the movies that do win awards are the ones that put me to sleep
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was basically a perfect godzilla movie it was cheesy bmovie fare with very little attempt to maintain any sort of realism while the last movie spent most of its runtime trying to be realistic and focusing on boring poorly written characters this one didnt try to be anything but a goofy kaiju movie with modern effects it is exactly what ive wanted since this franchise was rebooted my only problems are a few small nitpicky things that i can easily ignore given how glorious this movie is
Jun 2 2019,positive,yeah the human plot was basic as pumpkin spice lattes the dialogue as cheesy as buffalata anybody complaining about these things never grew up with the originals which were horrendous in those areas doesnt matter who remembers the names of the original human characters now who remembers the names of all the classic monsters this movies is everything you could want with a godzilla movie its basically showa era with a monster budget and better fight choreography
Jun 2 2019,positive,if youre planning on sitting down in the theater for a showing of godzilla king of the monsters and your first priority is worrying about the interpersonal relationships of the human characters youre doing it wrong    godzillakotm is a classic kaiju movie with big monsters beating the nuclear snot out of one another if you go into this movie expecting to see a serious film about human drama i bet youre the kind of hapless shmuck who goes to a buffet and whine about the lack of salad options human drama is an absolutely ancillary aspect of these films for what its worth this movies human drama was actually pretty well done but it didnt need to take any more time on screen than it already did in fact they could have shaved a few more minutes off if you ask me     kaiju fans will adore this movie for the big screen grudge match between godzilla and king ghidora pompous assclowns will poo poo this movie for not being human enough 
Jun 2 2019,positive,excellent balance of fighting scenes and story telling
Jun 2 2019,positive,critics who are not fans of the genre have hit this film too harshly the fantastic action and visuals far outweigh a plot which simply had too many characters but remains a love letter to both the fans and the genre in general
Jun 2 2019,positive,in the new chapter of the monarch saga new characters are introduced and the framework for a powerhouse franchise is set cant wait to see more
Jun 2 2019,positive,movie was awesome i love how he beat the 3 head dragin
Jun 2 2019,positive,to be honest the godzilla movie was great i love the action and im hoping that there will be more to come so at the end there might be only him left at the earth or something like im just so excited i got to see it 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was amazing i reco
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely stunning
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome  the godzilla movie ive been waiting for for my entire life
Jun 2 2019,positive,at first i thought the movie going to be terrible because of the reviewer but then i realize that tomatometer has a bunch of stupid reviewer who cant even understand the beauty of the movie itself
Jun 2 2019,positive,the best godzilla movie ever
Jun 2 2019,positive,this was a good movie and more of a setup of what weve all been waiting for kong vs godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,need to watch it on imax the monsters are huge
Jun 2 2019,positive,three wordsmillie bobby brown
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie loved that they showed more godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,fantastic movie but pleaseeeeeeeee stop cutting from the fight scenes i dont care about human characters i just want to see that sweet sweet gozilla booty 
Jun 2 2019,positive,as someone that has been watching godzilla movies sense he was a little kid i will easily say this is not only an amazing godzilla movie but an amazing movie in general the fight scenes were fantastic the story wasnt bad at all over underdone as critics have been saying and i give it to the actors that did such a great job 1010 im gonna see it again 
Jun 2 2019,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever its way better than godzilla 2014 the humans were apart of the story this time not like g2014 where it keeps in putting the foce on the humans instead of godzilla and the monster he is facing godzilla is the star not a backround charater like they treat him like in 2014 this is what a american godzilla film should be and have a goal to be not like 2014 or godzillas revenge i highly recommend watching this great kiju movie  1010
Jun 2 2019,positive,not enough screentime for the big guy to much human interest special effects were better in shin godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,overly long actions a little hard to comprehend at times sit in the back of the theater to take it all in
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing the sounds and cgi make it the most eye pleasing movies to see
Jun 2 2019,positive,saw this on imax  this is the godzilla movie fans have been waiting for  amazing great  the critics are clueless  well worth seeing on imax  long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,i was a bit disappointed it was lacking something
Jun 2 2019,positive,directing was nice and action kept you at the edge of your seat
Jun 2 2019,positive,fantastic movie fights are plentiful and very exciting humans are fine much more interesting than godzilla 14 story is a wild ride and it keeps the wild crazy feel a godzilla film should have
Jun 2 2019,positive,jesus christ f the critics if all you wants is a classic b g showdown this is is i challenge any critic to mortal kombat who dare tell me otherwise 
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome plenty of action
Jun 2 2019,positive,godzilla at his finest if youre looking for character developmentwhat makes you think youll find it at a godzilla flick enjoy it for what it is and its a ton of fun everything you could ever want in a godzilla movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,amazing  great sequel and continuation for this legendary franchise if you like giant monsters explosions and military stuff you will enjoy this i totally recommend this flick five stars
Jun 2 2019,positive,were seeing it again 
Jun 2 2019,positive,its perfect v 
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was great movie  really like it
Jun 2 2019,positive,i understand why critics didnt like this movie however i enjoyed this movie i mean sure it wasnt the masterpiece i was expecting the human characters were kinda boring and the fight scenes with the monsters were awesome but i wanted more however i really enjoyed this movie and im excited for godzilla vs kong
Jun 2 2019,positive,saw this at the arclight dome in hollywood loved it godzilla fans will not be let down not enough mothra however and bradley whitford is hilarious 
Jun 2 2019,positive,monsters were amazing and thats what were here for the human stuff is just fluff for the monster stuff
Jun 2 2019,positive,one of the things i love is the fight scenes so much
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was fun and kaiju action packed and worth the view but the human characters were the dull part abut the film
Jun 2 2019,positive,as a huge gojira fan this one is probly the one to tie with the first film american or japanese style with great action scenes that even put endgame and other brawl films to rest and a cast that knows the monsters and how to do a godzilla film is a high note for any fan the role of the 4 main toho kaiju are set well out have their own personality that is almost exact to their older and funny movies godzilla did pretty much every cool godzilla thing you can get from his moviessadly no tail slide or jump kick or flying and literally every cool scene has his theme and even a remix version all the kaiju play into their role well have their themerodan theme is amazing but they played mothras like a boss and fight in a style that is reminest of their old times but in new styles the biggest worry for me would be who dies and the way they die but the deaths are cool and are pretty close to old times the final battle involving the 4 kaiju is brillant and is a allout callback to final wars spoilereven to ghidorah and the draining of gojiranote this was a difderent ghidorah in final wars what every fan was saying about the kaiju was that they loved rodan the most but maybe mothra might be our fav coming out and thats true she has a really cool role as the actual queen and the ending with her is cool spoilerand a callback to gmk the new kaiju are cool semicreative with a new twist the plot is really good or even the best in any film to feature the big g and ghidorah is really epic the best form of ghidorah ive ever seen rodan design was the main reason i loved him from the start of the release of the first trailer and even more scenes with him make him seem even more cool the part were he destroys building in mexico is epic has his theme and a great callback to the first rodan film the chase with him is cool his small fight with ghidorah was probally his 2nd best behind ghi the 3 head mon and his brawl with mothra is cool mothra is completly battle ready on gojiras side and ready to throw down if your debating on the film it all comes down to if you love big fights the critics are kind of right when it comes to slow to the plot when it just carries us for monster fights but the fights are dependent on itlol have you not seen godzilla thats what every film is about even from 2014 when it took 3 years for gojira to show up its not his first time i never once saw a gap were the plot was slow they got into the action fast but explained what was going on first and has probally if not the greatest godzilla film title the end screen and credits with go go godzilla had so much fibs
Jun 2 2019,negative,how is it possible for a movie that cost 200 million to have cgi this crappy really banal writing the monsters were unwatchable id be embarrassed if i worked on this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,4dx is the best way to experience this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,fk the professional critics  this movie is going on the path that the fans really wants to see   the fans dont want deep human character plots on a kaiju movie  they want to see mayhem and big freaking monsters fighting   and that is almost what we got here   i dont know if it was a budget problem or still the movie makers were afraid of moving the focus fully from the humans into the monsters but all fights have those annoying moments where we lose focus from the monsters to focus on humans running like idiots   the human plot isnt as half as bad as some critics say its campy and predicable yeah but it works as a setup for a freaking monster mash its simple easy to follow and dont over complicate things   there are monsters there are humans humans do something stupid and monsters end up fighting  and its clear that lots of the professional critics doesnt know of kaiju film history  the amount of references and homages to old plots and famous scenes and settings  i wont spoil anything but i can say that if you were a fan of the old toho movies all of them youll love this flick 
Jun 2 2019,positive,moments of inconsistent in character identitys and a disorder view of the human element at times is a stumbling mess  however  this is a movie about the balance of power and how godzilla is the rightful king of this world  a godzilla movie has never really been about the plot  although it has some nice transition of the plot from the 2014 film  this movie is epic in everyway  jaw dropping moments and monster fights make up all of the mistakes made by the human viewpoint  to the movie  over all to all who  watch this movie looking for a thick well acted plot is in for a disappointment  its just simply monsters fighting and destroying cities in there wake that makes this film a must watch for godzilla fans  and by fans of godzilla i meen the 5080s old school films  
Jun 2 2019,positive,gloriously cheesy monstery goodness over the top dialogue ridiculous plot crazy decisions last second saves at every turn in short everything a monster flick should be if youre looking for great cinema or original plots or well written and though provoking dialogue then give this a miss if you like b movies creature features and monsters flicks then go see this on the biggest screen you can find go go godzilla
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome movie especially in imax long live the king
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome in every sense of the word  
Jun 2 2019,negative,yes it passed the time but thats 2 hours of my life i will never get back the story line is ok the acting was satisfactory the special effects what we expected with todays technology however after numerous loud explosions and roars from the numerous beasts consistent dark screen constant rain and cheesy one liners we were ready to leave half way through the film the comic relief is what you see in the trailer and no more this movie took itself too seriously and tried to tie its message to current events but failed to make their point stick i would wait to stream this movie or dvd for 175 when it hits the box  not worth your time and 20 bucks at the box office
Jun 2 2019,positive,lots of fun kaiju battles and faithful adaptations of original toho monsters plot is mostly forgettable but if you expect that going into a godzilla movie then youre going for the wrong reasons
Jun 2 2019,positive,best monster movie of the 21st century
Jun 2 2019,positive,ive loved monster movies since childhood  rodan scared the heck out of me as a child  seeing all my childhood monsters together was amazing  i thought it was very entertaining
Jun 2 2019,positive,the best american godzilla movie ever dont belive in tje critics they just dont know anything
Jun 2 2019,positive,awsome monster fights soso story
Jun 2 2019,positive,good monster movie to just veg out and watch and im looking forward to other movies that might come out in this universe  if you look to hard into movie like many movies it will leave you with questions and it would have been nice for them to identify all of the monster
Jun 2 2019,positive,it is cool and i love it 
Jun 2 2019,negative,wanted to love it  as a godzilla fan for almost no 50 yearsbut it lacked drama had laughable and unlikevale human character  the color pallete was dark and generally monochromatic  the attempts at oneliners fell terribly flat  the kaijus deserve much better 
Jun 2 2019,positive,finally a proper monster movie ignore the critics who as usual think they know what an audience wants and dont
Jun 2 2019,positive,the socalled critics are totally wrong about this picture  the human interaction is more poignant than they can imagine  the discussion of the natural order is exactly in tune with todays headlines  we have criminals who feel they must do everything and anything to stop mankind  you have the ones damaged by the loss of a family member  one who hates the titans and another who believes they are the future  and you have one who is for the titans but only in that they should take their place naturally  and when you throw in the action scenes which i had hoped for in the 2014 movie you have a very very good movie   the drawback  animals dont bow
Jun 2 2019,positive,visually appealing full of fart noises though
Jun 2 2019,positive,oh boy it was great everything was perfectly balanced dont listen to the critics about it not having a good story they are giving an opinion on a franchise they know nothing about this movie is good fun
Jun 2 2019,positive,dont decide if youre going to watch the movie based off the critics because honestly this movie was great and deserves the appreciation its receiving from the audience 
Jun 2 2019,positive,great awesome fun for the kids and family has some nostalgia of the old but with a modern twist
Jun 2 2019,positive,watched the movie today and i honestly dont know why the critics have given this such a low score this movie was leaps and bounds better than the last one and had a better story must watch if your a true godzilla fan 
Jun 2 2019,positive,ignore these idiot critics who seem to have seen a different movie than i did its great
Jun 2 2019,positive,humans weak but it delivers on what was promised a movie filled with a lot of monster action accompanying it with a  masterful remastered of godzillas and mothras theme 
Jun 2 2019,positive,loved the movie  can not wait for next one

Jun 2 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this film dont get me wrong it has some minor flaws like all films do but most of the criticism it has received grasps at straws the kaiju were phenomenal mothra steals the show the human characters were larger than life enjoyably so and they were developed wonderfully compared to prior godzilla films definitely go watch it and go watch it more than once there are so many easter eggs and intricate moments that deserve a second viewing for appreciation if you are a godzilla fan youll have tears of joy if youre not a fan youll fall in love with these iconic developed kaiju characters

Jun 2 2019,positive,i really enjoy this one the monsters were fairly close to their original counterparts i really liked the mix of old and new roars they seem to have learned a bit from the first movie the human story line doesnt distract from the monster fight as much they still could have ditched that entire family subplot seriously im just here to cheer my favorite monsters on as the trash s i would have liked to have seen more of mothra and i really missed the twins and their song mind shes my favorite kaiju im definitely going to watch this one again and i really hope to see more godzilla in the future

Jun 2 2019,positive,wonderful monster fight movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you want monsters this movie provides
Jun 2 2019,positive,there are two ways someone can view this movie a sequel to the 2014 godzilla movie which it is or just a godzilla movie    if you go into this movie looking for something with the same tone and pacing as the 2014 godzilla movie as i suspect many critics did then you will be disappointed    however if you go in wanting to watch a godzilla movie then you will thoroughly enjoy yourself     as someone who grew up watching the original godzilla movies i can say that this movie undoubtedly captures the same feeling at one point the original godzilla score plays and it honestly felt like the avengers endgame avengers assemble moment this movie is truly meant for fans of the original    i will say though that the story is very basic in particular theres a certain character whos introduced shows up in a few scenes and then suddenly is never heard from or seen again     with all that in mind id give the movie a solid 710 its a lot of fun for fans of the originals andat leasta dumb yet entertaining monster movie for others 
Jun 2 2019,positive,a film for those who wanted a giant monster movie and those who have godzilla fans for nearly 70 years  i would recommend this to all of the kings fans  young and old alike
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie is very fun and cgi is spectacular fk you critic
Jun 2 2019,positive,super fantabulous  action packed with kaiju fights and awesome military hardware  at least there was less of the people stuff in this one but the homage to the toho movies was all there enough to make this a total rush  screw the snobby critics this is one for the real audience viewer
Jun 2 2019,positive,fantastic movie great effects the movie ive been waiting my whole life to see any critics that think the human drama was downplayed or too convoluted are idiots im 54 and followed it with little to no problem some of the human characters were a little stupid for their own good but thats typical of the genre and if everybody in movies always made smart decisions  there wouldnt be much conflict two enthusiastic thumbs up

Jun 2 2019,positive,godzillakingofthemonsters was awesome if you like the toho movies when you were younger or now this was just like them but with better special effects it was more like the toho films than godzilla 2014 and kongskullisland
Jun 2 2019,negative,very weak  bad film at the time of the monster battles the camera was diverted to the actors running inside the buildings its a monster movie that does not show the monster battles
Jun 2 2019,positive,too many slow human parts monster action was fantastic
Jun 2 2019,neutral,monsters were outta sight not much story too many plot holes
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie was awesome i love giant titans and dinosaurs and enormous beasts so fun to watch
Jun 2 2019,positive,i enjoyed this a lot the story could have used some work less of the human drama especially the mom but thats a minor quibble the kaiju action is why were here i had no complaints about that we got several beautifully done fights and some fun teasers about whats to come

Jun 2 2019,positive,im a huge godzilla fan and this movie was action packed from the beginning great movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,too many people but a hell of a ride  of course id be happy with 20 monsters and no humans but thats not going to happen  plenty of cool callbacks to the old toho films  if you want godzilla this is a lot better than the 2014 version
Jun 2 2019,positive,absolutely epic movie chills the entire time monsters were on the screen i dont know what movie the critics saw to rate it so low but this was phenomenal beyond phenomenal actually seen in dolby experience but if you watch it in imax or at least a real theater go experience this for yourself very happy with my favorite monster taking the crown on the big screen
Jun 2 2019,positive,its a spectacle that needs to be seen in the big screen  so much monster action that will satisfy everyone
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is the godzilla film id been waiting for the story was a bit shallow but thats not a bad thing godzilla and friends more than make up for it monster fans i highly recommend it
Jun 2 2019,neutral,same plot as previous godzilla movies nothing new
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was a really cool and very actionpacked liveactioncgi hybrid monster movie it had really outstanding animation really excellent cast really awesome music really cool action really exciting adventure really good comedy really well done cinematography really interesting characters and a really good story in my opinion i really like this one better than the first one i would recommend this movie to old and new godzilla fans of all ages
Jun 2 2019,negative,its a scifi and its a godzilla movie but seemed like a failed attempt at campy  just ludicrous and not very entertaining
Jun 2 2019,positive,too much time listening to humans talk i came to this movie to watch monsters beat the crap out of each other
Jun 2 2019,positive,i liked this movie decent plot good cast great monster battles  i enjoyed to nod to the old godzilla movies with the snippet of the old monster battle music  very enjoyable not art house fare but good saturday afternoon fun
Jun 2 2019,positive,1010 if youre a godzilla fan you will like this movie ive been watching them all my life and i can tell you this will be the best american installment to date cgi was the best ive seen in a while blows avengers out of the water they do a very good job at giving you connections to the monsters the accompanying music scores were perfect for each monsters the little easter eggs were perfect for lifelong fans and not overbearing to the general audience id honestly give it from a critical standpoint a 95 no movie is perfect and i do feel like there are things to improve on but as a fan i loved this movie and will see it again
Jun 2 2019,positive,fast pace almost non stop action great story telling  character building was fast and still deep if you are a godzilla fan this movie is for you lost count of how many reference from old movies you think toho had an hand in making this film
Jun 2 2019,positive,not enough monster fighting only 10mins of it came to see monsters fight and two dumb parents fight for a little girl
Jun 2 2019,negative,what a waste of money wait for it to come out on dvd it was a pure disappointment poor script 3d scenes were wasted godzilla wasnt in half of the movie so many cliche moments too many it just wasnt that good a waste of the talented actors 
Jun 2 2019,positive,this is a good movie but not a great movie  no reason why it could have not have been 1520 minutes shorter
Jun 2 2019,positive,special effects great story dragged in places
Jun 1 2019,positive,i get it its a monster movie made for monsters too fight but i think it just wasnt realistic enough bringthekong
Jun 1 2019,positive,godzilla is a great movie  many of the fight scenes will make your jaw drop  i will see it more than once
Jun 1 2019,positive,this movie delivers in a single premise godzilla fights monsters and mothra helped i think for kaiju movie fans that is the most important thing like pacific rim which would be a great crossover event it delivers in the spectacle and eye candy dont look for deep emotional scenes look for the subtext and allegories and you will find an enjoyable movie 
Jun 1 2019,positive,great movie better in imax
Jun 1 2019,positive,if you like the japanese toho godzilla films this is a perfect fit as a monster vs monster film it is perfect it brings fans back to all 3 eras of tohos films and pays homage to godzilla and all the other monsters perfectly the easter eggs are nicely done and well placed however i do suggest that you stay and watch the end credits sequence as it could possibly set up the conflict in kong vs godzilla
Jun 1 2019,positive,the monsters were amazing i wasnt thrilled with the humans
Jun 1 2019,positive,it was very loud bring ear plugs  the movie was always in the dark  it passed the time
Jun 1 2019,positive,the movie was dc dark all the way through it if you like  not seeing the monsters or fight scenes clearly then youll love it could have cut back on the human parts a bit 
Jun 1 2019,positive,i got what i wanted out of it huge monsters epic fights and more screen time for the monsters
Jun 1 2019,positive,good movie will see again
Jun 1 2019,positive,the human elements are not very good and the story could use some work but what youre really here for the monster fights and they absolutely deliver godzilla is loads of fun and the effects are breathtaking see it especially in imax
Jun 1 2019,negative,im no critic and never have posted anything like this before however im compelled just like its predecessor this movie is awful in its balance of live action to the monsters its 212 hrs or something maybe 12 min was given to the monsters the rest of the live action  plot is meandering and tired godzilla and zero face off 3x and each is peppered with ridiculous human pov cuts rodan and mothra both get limited screen time the balance of the 17 monsters get nothing 
Jun 1 2019,positive,great movie  much better than the stuff disney is releasing these days
Jun 1 2019,positive,dont listen to the critics it was fun for me and family cant wait for the sequel 
Jun 1 2019,positive,this movie was the best godzilla movie ever i hope this isnt the end of it i love this movie
Jun 1 2019,positive,king of the monsters goes full avengers in introducing king ghidorah mothra and rodan for a full on monster mash its by no means a good film but its dumb fun watching the titans clash
Jun 1 2019,positive,been a big godzilla fan since i was a kid so when i see these old movies with a more modern look it always take me back to my childhood this movie is a must see for g fans like myself it proves hands down why he is truly an the king of monsters
Jun 1 2019,positive,if youre in on a movie where the world is full of monsters fighting each other and godzilla is one of them its enjoyable if youre not then the human story part of it will definitely not make it worth your while as i fall into the first camp i liked it and was satisfied with the experience
Jun 1 2019,positive,this made me feel like a kid watching godzilla films on saturday afternoons it was a fun exciting and visually arresting movie go go godzilla
Jun 1 2019,positive,i liked the story line i liked the action it would be great for godzilla  king kong to come together in a movie working together against monsters
Jun 1 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic in so many ways visually its a very impressive film and all the cgi looks great never did i think it looked bad or choppy all very clean that plus the fight scenes its great now the movie does have some have some good character moments some mediocre ones but all in all it doesnt really ruin the movie in anyway actor ken watanabe was probably the best human character bringing great level of charm to the movie the movie also does a good job of informing about the monsters and never having you confused plus they have some great fan service for long time fans that was really well done only complaint may have to be some of the human stuff but in all honesty no ones going to this movie for great oscar acting you just wanna see giant monsters fight each other and for to look amazing and thats exactly what youll get
Jun 1 2019,positive,the music and the fights sold it for me my movie of 2019
Jun 1 2019,positive,i liked the plot of the movie but it felt a bit rushed
Jun 1 2019,negative,133 min that i will never get back
Jun 1 2019,positive,the critics once again know jack  they did the toho godzilla justice and more  first of all unlike the first film they are able to tell a human story without it getting in the way of what were really interested in which is monsters vs monsters  second they make all the main characters godzilla ghidora rodan and mothra feel like forces of nature the human interactions with the monsters are more in depth yet add to the story  from beginning to end its a fun ride for everyone  except nyt critics who cant enjoy a fun ride
Jun 1 2019,positive,awesome the best godzilla remake and ive seen most of them
Jun 1 2019,positive,best godzilla movie ive seen in a long time did everything right the last one didnt hope there are sequels awesome 
Jun 1 2019,positive,the acting is horrible godzilla should have fought more in it first one was better
Jun 1 2019,positive,never in my life have i seen a movie with such a saturday morning cartoon plot the story was full of plot holes and contradiction  the characters were hollow dull and uninteresting  with that being said i went exclusively to see godzilla roar trample destroy and wreck havoc on all who opposed him  he truly is king of the monsters seeing him constantly in his rawest form was a true treat and well made up for all the shortcomings 45
