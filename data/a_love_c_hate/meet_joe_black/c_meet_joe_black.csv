Jan 17 2024,negative, some messages on not settling when searching for true love even if said true love happens to be the grim reaper reflections on mortality on trying to live a good and honest life bill refuses to sell his media company to a greedy corporation even if it would make him even richer as he extols the virtues of honest and straightforward news reporting theres a subplot concerning an elderly jamaican woman dying in a hospital who recognizes joe black as the grim reaper leading to discussions in which he breaks into a terrible jamaican accent no racial or ethnic diversity otherwise parents need to know that meet joe black is a 1998 romantic fantasy movie in which brad pitt plays death a man is struck and killed by a bus and a car while standing in the middle of an intersection in new york city some language including fk st ahole ass son of a bitch goddamn damn and hell a sex scene contains no nudity some talk about sex cocktail and wine drinking theres a subplot concerning an elderly jamaican woman dying in a hospital who recognizes joe black as the grim reaper leading to discussions in which he breaks into a terrible jamaican accent to stay in the loop on more movies like this you can sign up for weekly family movie night emails in meet joe black bill parrish anthony hopkins is a successful media mogul who is about to celebrate his 65th birthday in grand style meanwhile his daughter susan claire forlani is a med student who has seemingly met mr right brad pitt in a coffee shop while on her way to work but after they part ways it seems that they will never see each other again little does susan know that the man she just met is about to be hit and killed while standing in an intersection but that night he appears as a dinner guest of her fathers this guest had first appeared to bill as a voice in his head but it doesnt take long for bill to realize that this voice and this man is none other than death who has taken on the body of the man who was struck and killed in traffic and death has come to take bill away meanwhile susan thinks its the guy she met at the coffee shop and death decides that he wants to go by joe black and hang around for a while and learn about life from bill love from susan and the joys of eating peanut butter from a spoon from bills hired help as bills time for departure looms ever closer he must fend off a hostile takeover of his company from susans former fianc√© as joedeath begins to feel an increasing attraction to susan a gimmicky premise is made even worse by iffy acting hilariously bad dialogue and a slow pace not even the acting chops of anthony hopkins can rescue meet joe black a movie that lumbers along back and forth between some sort of romantic dramedy and reflections on life and death and what does it all mean anyway brad pitts performance is a real headscratcher why is death such a spacedout wideeyed goof who develops a fondness for peanut butter and there were many layers of bad decisions that led to pitt engaging in a cringey irie mon accent when death meets a dying elderly jamaican woman in the hospital where his love interest works its three hours long at least one hour too long for this kind of schlock families can talk about how death is portrayed in meet joe black how is it considered to be ironic to have an actor like brad pitt playing this role common sense medias unbiased ratings are created by expert reviewers and arent influenced by the products creators or by any of our funders affiliates or partners common sense is the nations leading nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of all kids and families by providing the trustworthy information education and independent voice they need to thrive in the 21st century
Mar 28 2023,positive,a glossy but overlong update of mitchell leisens 1934 comedy death takes a holiday 
Dec 20 2022,positive, nothing like a movie with a good lore behind it like the stories behind the story of the room i finally succumbed to watching meet joe black  director martin brests 3 hour dramafantasyromance from 1998 browsing through twitter i came across the absolutely bizarre car accident scene with a 30something brad bitt and claire forlani rather than lean on cgi crew molded a dummy from pitts body that in one take  actually crashed through the windshield inches from a stunt drivers head  like a lunar eclipse the wild scene makes the rounds every now and then to be discovered by a new generation from those images you cant help but be seduced into watching the whole marathon melodrama the film itself was a flop with a 90 million production budget that grossed only 44 million in the states but thanks to brad pitt pingponging off two cars on a manhattan street meet joe black has become something of a cult classic in recent years it currently has a 72 rating on imdb the film plods along from the very first shots inside media mogul bill parrishs anthony hopkins gilded ageseeming bedroom is he rockefeller charles foster kane on the cusp of a milestone birthday bill is slowly dying but its not enough to show him waking up in the dead of night clasping his heart once we come back to it a second time and then a third and a fourth as he lies wide awake hes sick by golly and this is the note the film must strike bill is a wealthy man but also a decent family man he has two daughters allison marcia gay harden who often manages her fathers affairs in the hopes that she will be loved in the same way her younger sister susan claire forlani is bill and susan fly into manhattan together where she works as a doctor in another plodding scene bill gives a monologue about how susan shouldnt settle for a guy who only kind of makes her excited that poor middling guy just so happens to be a parrish communications board member drew jake weber who comes to regular family dinner to be with susan and also wants more power within the company  before work susan hangs out in a cafe where she meets a man brad pitt new to the big city who immediately sweeps her off her feet  so much so that when they part ways they still keep looking back always missing each others glance the moment is mined for every morsel of drama even though were at a point in the story when were not much invested in characters we barely know its a bad choice cinematically you could say but then theres the twist of seemingly killing off prime brad pitt 20 minutes into movie in almost comedic fashion only for him to be resurrected as deathjoe black  but rather than a spoof of your typical predictable rom com id argue that meet joe black considers itself a more refined version of the romantic genre i havent watched a movie with subtitles all the way through in a long time but when death arrives at the parrish mansion and starts haunting bill in his library i could barely make out most of those lines the basic premise is that death is here to take sickly bill but for some reason wants to experience life on earth for a little so as long as a wellconnected bill can show him around the billionaire will be granted a few more days on earth soon death or joe black as hes called is following bill around to family dinners and company boardrooms alike susan recognizes his image but also feels that something is off with this guy after all instead of eating a 5 course meal like a normal creature he prefers even finer dining  a jar of peanut butter and a spoon eventually susan starts to take a liking to joe and in a wild scene takes his virginity by the pool that was like making love with someone making love for the first time she swoons but just like the car accident scene its not anyone who is being portrayed as a neophyte but brad pitt another viral moment involves a subplot at susans hospital with an elderly jamaican woman she rolls into the hospital with her daughter and immediately is chilled by joe to the worlds surprise pitt puts on his best jamaican patois accent and starts to develop a friendship with this woman eventually ending her suffering it is here where the films thematic messages shine brightest though i cant help but wonder if this entire scenario is yet another magical negro trope with a twist as a titan of industry bill is also trying to get his affairs in order and protect his company and legacy from being swallowed up by a conglomerate here bill is hoping to avoid another kind of death and in the final hour joe tries to figure out a way to be with susan while bill resigned to his death wants to protect his daughters and his legacy  this movie should probably be funnier than it is but for some reason has a habit of taking itself far too seriously in spots  leading to a lot of unintended comedy a la that tommy wiseau masterpiece still the story of social media rediscovery starts to make you wonder if the very way viewers first come across a film influences our perception and experience of it or if a conventional movie trailer still sells a movie better than a patchwork collection of clips on twitter or tiktok curated by popular demand fittingly a film once left dead in the streets lives on 
Oct 26 2020,positive, why you can trust gamesradar    our experts review games movies and tech over countless hours so you can choose the best for you find out more about our reviews policy director martin brest took his inspiration for meet joe black from the 1934 film death takes a holiday that was a comedy but brest needed a story that touched on something deeper hence what was originally touted as a romcom unfolds as a much more sincere drama before its release meet joe black had already been condemned as the most expensive romance ever made costing over 100 million and thats for a movie with few special effects death may well be a very ordinary character with no obvious special powers but parrish on the other hand is a millionaire with a millionaires lifestyle wardrobe and lavish birthday party to attend every detail of his life is perfectly realised on screen specially designed furniture ornaments clothes etc and to create a millionaires lifestyle you evidently have to spend a millionaires budget the money however isnt the issue no one minds how much is spent if the end product is fantastic the issue here is the running time meet joe black is not bad its superbly acted by the three leads while the relationship between anthony hopkins struggling to deal with the knowledge of his death and claire forlani who gradually begins to suspect the strangers motive is particularly well handled it looks sumptuous too bathed in autumn colours as light and life creep into deaths existence and to top it off this morbid love story also has a compelling central storyline as well as a subplot about the fate of parrishs media empire but what it has more than anything else is a bumnumbing threehour running time with its epic nature titanic got away with it meet joe black does not at the beginning parrish delivers a long speech about the nature of life and love his distracted daughter looks at him and says give it to me again but the short version someone should have said that to brest he could have cut a few speeches he could have lost a very uncomfortable sex scene between joe black and susan would they make death babies he should certainly have sliced out some uneven playing from the support who seem to think theyre in a different kind of movie to the central protagonists these elements wouldnt have been missed we could also have gone without pitts astonishing jamaican accent used for dramatic effect when a caribbean woman recognises joe black for what he is not to mention the very unconvincing explanation of how although hes in one place he can still kill people all over the world the audience would have survived the best bits of meet joe black are contained in the first halfhour and the last and are worthwhile the beginning is intriguing the end tearful especially as susan wordlessly begins to realise the fate of her father to those who have lost a relative recently these scenes in particular are teary and painful but they would have had so much more impact without a thumbtwiddling seatshifting middlesection not bad just not as good as it could have been had the editor been allowed to hack an hour or so off the running time thankfully however the classy performances from pitt forlani and hopkins make meet joe black worthwhile but only just the total film team are made up of the finest minds in all of film journalism they are editor jane crowther deputy editor matt maytum reviews ed matthew leyland news editor jordan farley and online editor emily murray expect exclusive news reviews features and more from the team behind the smarter movie magazine 
Oct 26 2020,positive, a businessman is visited by an otherworldly presence who has the nerve to fall in love with his daughter in this savory extralong feature 1998 whose obvious plotlines unfold with an almost painful slowness that somehow makes them deeper the potentially doomed romance between susan claire forlani and joe brad pitt achieving the unimaginable with a convincing portrayal of a sexually naive character is set in a deliberately ironic materialists dreamscapethe estate of susans fabulously wealthy father anthony hopkins who learns to appreciate whats truly important even as he decides which theatrically decadent dessert to serve at what may be his last birthday party martin brest directed a screenplay by ron osborn jeff reno kevin wade and bo goldman inspired by the 1934 movie death takes a holiday
Oct 26 2020,negative, to call the threehourlong meet joe black leaden would do an injustice to lead to call it phlegmatic is to dishonor phlegm to describe it as turgid does a disservice to honest turges everywhere only the hardestcore brad pitt fans will want to brave this static deflated entry into the screen angels sweepstakes if they insist on disregarding the best advice  dont go  then they should at least heed the following bring adequate lumbar support and gallons of coffee not to mention a box of kleenex because rest assured tears will be jerked meet joe black which is loosely suggested by the play death takes a holiday later turned into the 1934 movie starring fredric march revolves not around pitts character but a business tycoon named bill parrish anthony hopkins parrish spills more money in a day than most people will earn in a lifetime but hes just not happy about to turn 65 hes nagged by a mysterious pain in his left arm the onset of which is accompanied by a mysterious voice heart attack stroke worse bill doesnt know because he doesnt bother to see a doctor to find out which is strange because one of this daughters the beautiful susan claire forlani is a medical resident whos constantly hanging around his manhattan penthouse taking dips in the pool and wafting around the artstrewn corridors she isnt exactly the hardestworking doctor in show business after endless scenes of helicopter rides and dinners and people talking to each other the mysterious voice finally makes its identity known and its presence seen enter the aggressively blonded pitt as death who arrives not to speed things up but to take a break from all that reaping a deal is made as long as bill can keep him entertained death will spare his life an arrangement that could add entire weeks to the older mans life he installs himself at bills side living at the penthouse going to the office sitting in on board meetings and oh yes falling in love with the comely susan who is a tad confused by this handsome strangers behavior you can imagine the cosmo quiz your boyfriend is moody and disappears for unexplained periods of time hes a on crack b married c the angel of death brad pitt who really should listen when his mother tells him to get that hair out of his eyes may well be a very fine actor but not in meet joe black in which the shaggy heartthrob seems to have researched his role  an odd semaphore of stilted speech robotic movement and bobbing head  by observing street mimes and dashboard dolls still pitt cannot be faulted for meet joe black this interminable exercise in noncinema should be laid at the door of director martin brest who has inexplicably orchestrated the movie as a series of long dull scenes we get lots of board meetings and corporate backstabbing and literate speeches the words suborn imprimatur machinations and machiavellian popped up in a single scene indeed the most visceral moment of meet joe black is the shocking sight of a muchloved character being hit by a car and tossed into the air a scene that should be approached by pitts younger fans with extreme caution only an actor of hopkins caliber could wrest a modicum of human feeling from the blurry character hes been handed and against all odds he does lending meet joe black an acuity and verve that the movie doesnt deserve marcia gay harden as his other daughter has some touching moments too
Oct 26 2020,negative,ive never encountered such dramatic flatulence never heard so many pregnant silences that dont deliver never watched so many closeups that graze on actors faces until every last trace of expression has been devoured
Oct 26 2020,negative,martin brests weepie is nicely played but overlong  especially considering the original zipped by in under 80 minutes
Oct 26 2020,negative,   when the true identity of peter cushing is revealed in dr terrors house of horrors this ordinarylooking passenger in the corner seat of a train compartment is suddenly transformed into the grim reaper of popular imagination the one truly memorable personification of death in a modern setting is the alluring princess played by maria casares in cocteaus orphe√©  so the opulent meet joe black in which brad pitt impersonates death is something of a rarity its very loosely based on an italian play of the twenties that became a hollywood film in 1934 as death takes a holiday in that film fredric march as death disguises himself as a russian aristocrat and spends three days experiencing life on an italian noblemans estate and finding out why he incites such fear during his absence from duty no one in the world dies the movie lasted a mere 78 minutes less than half the length of the remake which might well have been called death takes a lengthy sabbatical   in meet joe black the emphasis shifts from the guest to the host from death to the multimillionaire business tycoon bill parrish anthony hopkins who on the eve of his sixtyfifth birthday has intimations of mortality in the form of internal voices and severe chest pains  on the way from his hudson river mansion to his manhattan office by helicopter the widowed bill warns his beloved daughter susan claire forlani that she should only marry his righthand man drew jake weber if she really loves him that morning in a coffee shop near the hospital where she is a doctor susan falls in love at first sight with a handsome young man played by brad pitt hes killed in an accident shortly after they part and his body is taken over by death who thereupon moves into the parrish household under the name joe black joe gives bill a reprieve until the mammoth sixtyfifth birthday bash his other daughter marcia gay harden is organising but he prevents anyone knowing his true identity  films in which people become aware of their impending death normally involve remorse over past sins and attempts to put lives in order kurosawas living is the classic instance but astonishingly for a rich man involved in the media bill has conducted himself impeccably there is not a stain on his private or professional life in fact his only remaining task is to preserve the integrity of the communications empire hes created by preventing the duplicitous drew from merging it with the corporation of an unprincipled rival death in fact could hardly have found someone better prepared to go into that good night he thus has more quality time to spend with susan who loves him not as death but as a mysterious stranger  in the seventh seal the knight holds death off by beating him at chess anthony hopkins gains his victory over brad pitt by sheer screen presence this isnt entirely pitts fault because the movies four screenwriters clearly dont know what to make of death and havent agreed on what precisely he is or what hes been doing with his time  from his appearance and behaviour hes a narcissist fascinated by his own experiences but little interested in others apart from susan and bill hes never heard of peanut butter or cookies yet he can get around manhattan without a map he can pass himself off as an internal revenue investigator but has never heard the saying nothing is certain except death and taxes he knows he isnt gay but has to be taught the fundamentals of sex which suggests he wasnt on duty when nelson rockefeller or john garfield died  none of this would matter if the director martin brest hadnt provided so many longueurs in which we might contemplate the films hollowness and contradictions one tedious sentimental drawn out scene gives way to another and death does seem to be having dominion over us the flaccid climactic birthday party for instance is nearly as long as the ball sequence in viscontis the leopard and is the sort of thing that gives hubris a bad name  the result is that a potentially charming fantasy becomes a grave funereal work though i suppose that grave and funereal are the qualities traditionally associated with death   so the opulent

Oct 26 2020,negative,pitt who is not asked to do much more here than behave alternately like a robot a bashful boy and a moron fulfills his modest tasks with aplomb when he has to act though he fares less well
Apr 12 2019,positive,meet joe black marks the latest in a succession of strong turns by anthony hopkins more than even brad pitt the film serves as a showcase for the versatile and talented oscar winner
Feb 6 2018,negative,you just feel like youre dragging a set of dumbbells around with you while youre watching it
Sep 7 2011,positive,meet joe black is sometimes clever and enjoyable even touching yet too often the film makes you feel as if youre in sunday school

if handled with sophistication and insouciance is instead weighed down by ponderous pacing overstuffed production values and an instance of miscasting this first and most expensive of universals four big yearend releases could do some solid midrange business on the basis of brad pitts name and the publics seemingly endless appetite for stories relating to angels intermediaries to the afterlife and so on no matter how mediocre what dreams may come but whatever bo it does cannot possibly match its pretensions martin brest skated on thin ice but got away with it at least with moviegoers when he stretched his last film scent of a woman out to 157 minutes here he pushes his luck too far by extending a slim conceit to a full three hours rarely has there been a film with so little justification for such a marathon running time much of the problem stems from the dialogue direction which often has the actors pausing significantly for many seconds between lines the uncharitable could make mileage of the issue that the film upon which meet joe black is based mitchell leisens 1934 paramount release death takes a holiday ran just 78 minutes except for the fact that the new picture isnt a remake in any meaningful sense brest who began mulling the project seriously more than 15 years ago and his writers have taken just the central premise  of death assuming human form for a few days to get a taste of what life is like and falling in love along the way  and spun it in different much more detailed ways  no matter the new films failings its inventions can represent only improvements as the leisen picture itself adapted from a 1920s play now comes off as deadly dull with his 65th birthday fast approaching new york media tycoon william parrish anthony hopkins begins hearing a strange disembodied voice and shortly suffers a heart seizure while being spoken to so mysteriously at the same time his young physician daughter susan claire forlani who is halfheartedly involved with her fathers ambitious secondincommand drew jake weber has a memorable chance encounter in a coffee shop with a dashing young man brad pitt who immediately after is hit and killed by speeding cars in short order the voice materializes to the mystified william in the guise of the fellow from the coffee shop in the communications barons plush library the visitor who goes by the name of joe black informs the older man a widower whom he has chosen for his exceptional character that he can buy some time if he will act as his guide to all things earthly thus begins a peculiar relationship in which the dazzlingly blond joe black follows the powerful william on all his rounds first stop is a family dinner where susan is understandably disconcerted by the presence of the young man who charmed her in the coffee shop and even more unnerved by the fact that he doesnt behave as though he were the same guy williams other daughter the tooeagertoplease allison marcia gay harden her affable but nonetoobright husband quince jeffrey tambor and drew are also curious about the newcomer joes presence induces some polite raised eyebrows among the members of williams corporate board which the next day convenes to consider a megamerger that the principled william refuses to endorse the underhanded drew who has been in cahoots with the other company all along then sets in motion an elaborate scheme by which he forces william into instant early retirement a process spurred by the fact that the boss has privately stated that all important matters are now up to joe a man whose presence and identity no one understands it doesnt help that joe walks and talks rather like a zombie and that he prefers peanut butter to any other food but susan for one is willing to overlook all this in her determination to figure out who the mystery man is and sure enough maneuvers him into her arms in line with what the young man in the coffee shop hoped for from the beginning they fall for each other quickly and deeply to the great consternation of william in an instance in which father truly does know best he demands that his daughter whom he had earlier told to become swept away by love steer clear of joe after wrestling with his impending fate and coming to accept it william tells his otherworldly emissary that hes ready to go to which joe replies good after the party this is a cue for the final act a blacktie birthday bash staged on the vast grounds of williams stupendous waterfront estate encompassing 45 minutes of screen time the elegant blowout provides the setting for neat resolutions of all of the films important narrative and thematic strands all capped off by a gigantic fireworks display by taking so much time and building to the climax so methodically brest seems to be trying to pull off a metaphysical slow burn one whose cumulative impact will prove moving and profound but even if one buys the premise the story is finally just too contrived and wispy to support heavy emotional investment the heart of the film can be found in hopkins william parrish a dynamic man who has been chosen by death for observation as the best humanity has to offer as hopkins plays him with tremendous verve and sympathy he is all this but the character also seems impossibly idealized truly without flaws never is there an indication of the ruthlessness that must have been required to get as far as he did he is even the perfect widower forever living in the memory of his adored wife without a woman to replace her by contrast pitts joe black is an odd egg indeed at times joe looks as though he hasnt a clue what to do or say in polite company while at others he appropriately appears to be several steps ahead of everybody else looking dashing and slightly impish at times pitt isnt particularly effective in the moments he must carry the screen alone or in his attempts at physical comedy hes better in the romantic interludes in which joe experiences love and sex for the first time and best of all in his scenes with hopkins suggesting that he would excel in ensemble pieces cast opposite strong actors rather than toplined alone forlani makes a decidedly limited impression as the rich mans daughter who has never before been swept away by love in the first coffee shop scene her character says and does nothing to make any impression on the young man who is impressed anyway and the tentative manner and skittish eye contact with which the actress endows susan become tiresome weber starts quietly and eventually commands singular attention as parrishs treacherous wouldbe successor and soninlaw while harden and tambor more gently score in lightly comic support luxuriously upholstered pic so thoroughly expresses the world of its wealthy characters that the money all but drips from the screen if one had unlimited resources one might certainly want to engage production designer dante ferretti and costume designers aude bronsonhoward and david c robinson to create ones personal ambience with the help of cinematographer emmanuel lubezki to make sure everything was lit to maximum effectiveness thomas newmans score is quite beautiful particularly in its main theme which possesses a ghostly echo of his father alfred newmans exquisite title music for the greatest story ever told
Mar 11 2008,positive, one of the unwanted gifts of the impending millennium is the new metaphysicslite subgenre these movies usually involve good people  no make that downright noble people  who go on some aweinspiring spiritual journey nudged along by lots of pieties and string music contact city of angels and what dreams may come are prime examples the point of these films always seems to be that the universe is kind god is smiling above us and within us blah blah blah meet joe black is far and away the best of this current crop and not just because it skimps on the lifelesson speeches anthony hopkins summing up the film in a today show interview spouted more pieties than can be found in the entire threehour movie this isnt a great film but its an excellent piece of work  hushed deliberate surprisingly levelheaded and intimate the director martin brest scent of a woman takes his time and lets tension and meaning gather in the long spaces between lines of dialogue the 178minute length makes sense the movie unfolds during the final days of a man who has to learn to let go of his life bill parrish hopkins an extravagantly rich businessman has been plagued by alarming fatigue and chest pains he suspects that death is near and sure enough death is waiting for bill in his library  in the form of brad pitt death who soon assumes the name joe black has occupied a human body and wishes to experience life on this mortal coil before he takes bill into the undiscoverd country this idea has been around before of course  in 1934s death takes a holiday and its many permutations since and the selling point now as then is the romance between joe and susan claire forlani the younger of bills two daughters as a doomed storybook love this beats titanic all to hell hey guy youre death  you cant be messing around with mortals even if they do look like claire forlani surprisingly though the script credited to ron osborn jeff reno kevin wade and bo goldman treats the romance as a plot point among equals much of the films emphasis is not on joe black but on bill who knows he doesnt have much longer to live and is trying to put things in order more important he learns is to put things in perspective anthony hopkins does a beautifully subtle job of showing us the growing tension between bills not wanting to leave his loving daughters his eldest whos throwing herself into planning his 65th birthday party is played by the warm and appealing marcia gay harden and his wanting to make sure theres no unresolved business the character is a bit idealized  your basic dream boss  but hopkins burrows inside the mans fear anger and resignation brests scent of a woman had that completely needless subplot about chris odonnell getting in trouble for a prank and some will say that brest is at it again in meet joe black there are maybe three scenes too many involving the machinations of bills devious righthand man drew jake weber who nonetheless brings dry wit to a thankless role and thomas newmans score gets a bit too loud and effusive near the end screaming cry to be frank i didnt need musical encouragement when susan delivered her line about her father i admit i was a goner judging by her winning performance here id guess claire forlani is about to become very hot and deservedly so brad pitt too makes up for his dullness in the devils own and seven years in tibet sometimes hes funny as when joe discovers the joys of peanut butter sometimes a little frightening whats more meet joe black contains one of the more startling images ive ever seen in a movie  the openingnight audience buzzed about it for a full minute¬π youll know it when you see it overall the movie is full of surprises long but never boring spiritual but never soggy this is the brand of big entertainment hollywood is best at but so rarely does right these days ¬πthere was also laughter as i recall and indeed that ragdollphysics moment  right you know the scene  became how the movie was known best and derisively so which is unfair its a good film martin brest is a good director okay so the nowfamous trailer for star wars episode i  the phantom menace which was shown in front of meet joe black among several others has finally been unveiled what is there to say about it the fans are loving it and theres no question that its a brilliant job of marketing the trailer will be analyzed and deconstructed for months to come poked and prodded for the secrets it may dislodge upon the twentieth or thirtieth viewing all of this to an unbeliever like myself is a gigantic sick joke the movie when it comes will undoubtedly be a trailer itself  a shiny advertisement for a fresh line of star wars toys and the first chapter in yet another trilogy the presence of a young anakin skywalker and a goofy alien sidekick suggests that george lucas is courting the next generation  the children of his original fish which he landed back in 1977 can star wars be blamed for the current wretched state of american movies not entirely but lucas hasnt done much to help either to put it kindly the new star wars films will be good for 20th centuryfox exhibitors toy manufacturers and whatever other companies are in bed with lucasfilm to produce star wars junk the films will move some currency around but i dont think i will be called cynical if i predict that very little of the riches will be pumped back into independent film the massive anticipation for the phantom menace  hell the massive anticipation for its trailer  reveals america at its arresteddevelopment worst bigbudget spectacle has its place but if that becomes the only genre welcomed in the marketplace  and were getting perilously near that point  then its all over
Feb 8 2003,positive, meet joe black rated pg13  running time 300  released 111398  the story of meet joe black penned by ron osborn and jeff reno and  based on the 1934 classic death takes a holiday is not epic in any  way the cast is basically made up of 6 people the action takes place within  a 2week period set in the present and apart from the final half hour  there are really no major visuals but like robert redfords the horse whisperer meet joe black  is cursed with a selfindulgent director who doesnt know how to cut there  is absolutely no reason for it to be three hours long  martin brest who has directed several excellent films in the past beverly  hills cop 1984 scent of a woman 1992 must have misplaced  his scissors but the length of his film is not its only fault excellent  performances by anthony hopkins and clair forlani are foiled by a rather  styleless job by brad pitt and jake webers stereotyped villain is not  human enough to believe  when death pitt comes to collect his latest package newspaper ceo  bill parrish hopkins he decides to hang around awhile and sample some  of the earthly pleasures hes heard so much about choosing a plain tan  suit over the usual scythe and black cloak he steals some guys body and  adopts the moniker joe black he chose parrish as his guide  because of his leadership qualities but he didnt realize he also had a  daughter who is both beautiful in a bignosed barbra streisand sort of  way and intelligent susan forlani is a doctorinresidence at the local  hospital bill also has another daughter allison marcia gay harden who  is busy planning a spectacular party for her dads 65th birthday allisons  affable husband quince jeffrey tambor and susans fianc√© drew weber  are both on the board of directors for bills multimilliondollar company  and drew a cutthroat businessman is bills closest aide  but the sudden appearance of joe black takes everyone by surprise especially  susan who had just met the bodys former owner that morning at a coffee  shop she had been charmed by the mystery mans polite candor about love  and commitment and felt romantic pangs that emphasized her dissatisfaction  with drew joe has no recollection of the coffee shop meeting of course  but is intrigued nonetheless drew first welcomes joe as a friend of bills  but soon grows irritated by joes apparent influence on his boss and girlfriend  but what really ticks him off is when bill suddenly cancels drews plans  to merge the company with another larger corporation thinking bill has  surrendered control of the business to this mysterious visitor he engineers  a hostile takeover using the unwitting quince as a tool  meanwhile joe is basically just enjoying all the enjoyable aspects of  being human from eating peanut butter to making love the one hes making  love to is of course susan who has fallen completely head over heels  for a man who must leave earth in just a few days 
Aug 21 2002,negative, for millions of people a close encounter with death has enabled them to see with fresh eyes the beauty and bounty of life in this fantasy film directed by martin brest scent of a woman the process is reversed several members of a fabulously rich family teach death about the pleasures of the flesh and the transports of love so far so good the problem is this light parabolic vehicle is weighed down by a tediously slow pace and overwrought production values even so its simple message is worth taking to heart brought to his knees by a heart seizure new york media tycoon william parrish anthony hopkins hears death calling him while one daughter marcia gay harden is busy planning an elaborate celebration for his 65th birthday his favorite daughter susan claire forlani a physician is being romanced by a handsome and charming stranger brad pitt in a coffee shop when he is hit and killed by two cars the grim reaper takes over his body and asks parrish to serve as his tour guide in the land of the living adopting the name joe black death becomes addicted to peanut butter and eventually falls in love with susan in addition he helps parrish fend off the efforts of drew jake weber his righthand man to sell off his company to a corporate raider in one of the opening scenes of the film parrish tells his daughter that he hopes she will find a lover who will enable her to sing with rapture and to dance like a dervish he wants her to be deliriously happy that simple message about the spiritual firepower of love is what we are left with at the end of meet joe black too bad it wasnt delivered in a more simple and lean package
Apr 28 2001,positive,the latest masterpiece to fall victim to cynicism
Jan 1 2001,neutral, november 29 1998  meet joe black is a movie that just never seems to go anywhere and it never seems to end and all of its characters seem to be asleep this story is not lively and it is not fastpaced some plants grow faster than this story develops  the story is a modern retelling of the old death takes a holiday film made in 1934 but it is about three times as long as that one was death in the person of megastar brad pitt decides to take human form to see what it is like on the other side of the veil he persuades multimillionaire william parrish anthony hopkins to show him around in return for a few extra days of life  parrish doesnt want to be bothered with being a tour guide so death takes up with his pretty young daughter susan claire forlani of the rock basquiat and mallrats parrish doesnt like that either he doesnt seem to like much of anything you would think death would have picked someone more upbeat for a guide  parrish and death have harsh words you would think that death would always have the last word but not this time pitt gives a very lowkey performance as death a guy who knows the irs code by heart knows how to speak with a jamaican accent but knows nothing about peanut butter  there are some fine actors in the film in addition to pitt hopkins and forlani theres a sparkling performance by marcia gay harden who plays allison parrishs older daughter who lost the sibling rivalry war she appeared in flubber desperate measures to her sister susan the relationship between allison and her father is about the only believable one in the film harden brings a little energy to her role and thats about the only energy in the film  jeffrey tambor plays allisons lovable looser husband quince the actors try hard but they just cant pump enough life into this over bloated somnambulant movie to keep it moving ahead as woody allen said in annie hall what i think weve got here is a dead shark this film rates a c
Jan 1 2000,positive, a loose retelling of 1934s death takes a holiday this updated version adapts a fuller firmer attitude toward otherworldly romance as well as a nearthreehour running time with hopkins onscreen for much of it its not as dreary as youd expect and even the angelic pitt as an anthropomorphized blondebanged death is surprisingly tolerable in an admittedly difficult role that could have just as easily descended into unwitting farce brest scent of a woman opens the film with a sequence in which susan parrish forlani  young md daughter of hopkins wealthy media magnate william parrish  runs into a nameless but utterly charming young man pitt in a new york coffee shop during the course of a fiveminute flirtation the spark arcs and the two nearstrangers part never to meet again as it happens the handsome stranger is struck by a car and killed moments later as luck or fate or more accurately death should have it the stranger is reborn after a fashion as death itself appears at the parrish family mansion wearing the strangers flesh hes here to take the senior parrish off to the great beyond but before he does hed like to find out a bit about the living you will be my tour guide he tells an understandably stunned hopkins and before long death under the moniker of joe black is attending parrish communications board meetings wrapping his tongue around gob after gob of peanut butter a delicacy we are led to believe absent from the netherworld and falling in love with daughter susan at first its difficult to understand why anyone would need three hours to tell this pleasant fable but to his credit brest fleshes out the film with a subplot involving a corporate takeover unnecessary but absorbing nonetheless and assorted other tricks meet joe black flows nicely and the whole of the film is bathed in some of the most sumptuous cinematography courtesy of like water for chocolates emmanuel lubezki of the year the film however belongs to hopkins pure and simple he commands your eye when he is onscreen and when hes off youre subconsciously waiting for him to reappear as the noble media baron and devoted family man hes stuck with lines that would surely crumple in any other actors mouth but here manages to make them sound good even great by sheer virtue of his being sir anthony hopkins pitt is in a realm that approximates his lunatic role in terry gilliams 12 monkeys but toned down considerably his death is an egocentric spirit engaged in learning a smidgen of humility and humanity and though the role frequently borders on the comic it rarely sloshes over into the absurd only once when death his facial muscles lost in the act of making love did the males in the packed screening audience audibly squirm which perhaps says more about the males than pitts acting too often derided as a vacuous pretty boy pitt brings a wan insouciant charm to the grim reaper while hopkins as ever anchors everything around him its an elegiac love story from beyond the grave as appealingly simple as it is emotionally complex a note to readers bold and uncensored the austin chronicle has been austins independent news source for over 40 years expressing the communitys political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene now more than ever we need your support to continue supplying austin with independent free press if real news is important to you please consider making a donation of 5 10 or whatever you can afford to help keep our journalism on stands

Jan 1 2000,positive,  pig in the city as its title suggests brings the sheepherding pig to an unnamed metropolis inventively designed as an amalgam of new york sydney paris san francisco among many others to save the farm after inadvertently causing his beloved master arthur hoggett james cromwell to suffer a crippling accident  as upsetting as the sight of some heavy machinery falling on the gentle farmer is its not quite as upsetting as a ridiculously drawnout scene of a dogs neardrowning not to mention an alreadycrippled dog being thrown from a speeding car his spirit then briefly seen frolicking in a canine heaven   the children in the audience with which i saw the film were audibly upset as were some parents and i cannot blame them what nearly redeems the film is the enduring charm of the pig this time voiced by eg daily taking over for christine cavanaugh the imaginative production design and the impressive effects work  as in the original it is impossible to distinguish the real animals from the animatronic ones to the computer animated ones  and as in the original everything does work out nicely for the pig who learns a lesson or two about life  but walking out of this babe iand i am sure many othersfeel that universal should have left well enough alone heeding the immortal closing words of farmer hoggett in the original repeated in this film thatll do pig

celebrate  and what exactly do we learn about our society from celebrity  that it is one where just about every celebrity is willing to appear in a woody allen filmhence another starstudded ensemble which also includes joe mantegna famke janssen bebe neuwirth and winona ryder who displays nice chemistry with branagh whose deadon allen impression didnt annoy me  without any clear ideas or a strong story celebrity ends up as a showcase of fine character work by starsa celebration of celebrity that i dont think allen intended  instead abramson and bernstein cast their focus using that term very loosely on two separate groups of people who are tapped to appear on jerry for different topics only to end up intertwining  receiving the most screen time are a motherdaughter pair of trailer park

michael dudikoff of american ninja er fame  in retaliation the mother molly hagan starts having her daughters fianc√© ashley holbrook  slightly more amusing is the other group a trio of ghetto stereotype girls wendy raquel robinson tangie ambrose and nicki micheaux who have all at one point or another fallen into the bed of musclebound studmuffin demond charismatic spawn and tyson star michael jai white who can certainly find better work than this what ensues is tons of too hot for tv tawdriness that ironically enough is not compulsively watchable as springers two too hot for tv

those fights do feature nonprofessionals inflicting real harm on each otherwhich is part of the shows sadistic guilty pleasure factor  but the main reason is the amateurish sloppiness of the entire

terrific job with the animation on antz but a bugs life shows that pixar is still the king of feature computer animation and by default so is disney and with its broader demographic appeal a bugs life

anticipated epic the prince of egypt  although his filmmaking career has spanned twenty years sam raimi has always remained on the fringes of hollywood scoring no big box office hits but amassing a fiercely devoted cult following and with his trademark brand of dark humor more often than not tinged with gore and wildly kinetic camera work  more than a few raimi cultists weaned on the likes of his evil dead trilogy will undoubtedly cry sellout after seeing a simple plan which neither looks nor feels like a traditional raimi film  instead it looks and feels like  a simply traditional film no flashy camera work no excessive violence no macabre humor thematically on the other hand this adaptation of scott b smiths bestselling novel is exactly what one would expect from the auteur  bill

portrayal of death comes off as a cleanedup version of his blank stoner character in true romance  i echo eberts sentiments but from a different angle  there is a lot of violence sex and various other forms of bad behavior on display in first time writerdirector skip woodss lowbudget thriller  but the graphic nature of thursday is not what upset me it was the content behind the mayhemor rather the lack thereof  theres absolutely no substance to woodss script beyond the setup a reformed exdrug dealer thomas jane who has his quiet houston household violently thrown upside down after his stillinthebiz expartner aaron eckhart who should have known better arrives for a stay  what follows are random plotless acts of violence and nastiness such as various bloody shooting deaths grisly body disposals and most notoriously an amazonian femme fatale paulina porizkova wearing a jacket reading cunt who openly masturbates and later rapes the main character  this criticism may sound hypocritical from someone who completely bought into the sick sensibility of very bad things but there writerdirector peter berg had an actual story to work with and the borderline offensive shocks naturally emerged from that narrative  woods on the other hand hails from the school of film that believes that shock value in and of itself equals hipness  in actuality it only equates to pathetic desperation  my experience with nickelodeons smash cartoon series rugrats has been confined to just an episode or two caught during breaks from channel surfing  but as limited as my familiarity with the show is i have seen enough of it to know that its not something strictly for the tykes despite of its titles implication  while clearly targeted at the preschool demographic the adventures of diaperclad tommy pickles voice of eg daily and his friends chuckie finster christine cavanaugh and twin siblings phillip and lillian deville both voiced by kath soucie show mature flashes of wit and that smartness extends to the film  only adults will appreciate such wry touches as a hospital sign tracking the arrivals of newborns like flights at an airport references to the fugitive and a cry in the dark and the childrens numerous instances of malapropism eg custardy for custody the majority of the film on the other hand is equally accessible and amusing to grownups and wee ones alike  as can be expected there is only a sliver of a story in david n weiss and j david stems script  at center of the plot is the arrival of a new child in the pickles household dylan aka dil tara charendoff who much to tommys chagrin immediately dominates all the attention of their parents didi melanie chartoff and stu jack riley  but tommy must learn to live with and love dil when they chuckie phillip and lillian find themselves lost in the forest thanks to a runaway toy wagon  not too far behind is tommys bratty cousin angelica cheryl chase determined to reclaim her beloved cynthia doll which dil has taken with him the adventures that ensue in the forest setting ranging from some wild river rafting to an encounter with circus monkeys are sure to keep the children enthralled the kids at the screening i attended were noticeably silent and amuse the adults  part of the appeal for the older set is the distinctive art style which is rough and simple yet remarkably expressive  wisely directors norton virgien and igor kovalyov resist the urge to punch up the visuals with gratuitous computer animationat least for the most part a boulder clouds and dils headtrippy arrival into the world are the instances of cgi and they are brief and effective  the directors big misstep though was bowing to disney animation tradition and grafting on a few musical numbers to the film which feel like theyre well grafted on with the exception of one inspired number where angelica breaks out into a modified version of blondies one way or another sung in reference to her missing cynthia  production numbers aside the rugrats movie is essentially just a bigscreen episode of the series and thats more than enough to satisfy any audience while disney has a rich tradition in animated family entertainment but its track record in liveaction film is to put it mildly less than stellar  the wan ill be home for christmas will do nothing to change that  this piece of warmedover sitcomlevel

Jan 1 2000,negative,brestian adj bloated boring and longwinded as in meet joe black is brestian in scope and to be avoided if you have a weak bladder
Jan 1 2000,negative,brest lets scene after scene ramble on and on giving the picture a languid air for everyone except the most fervent pitt fans this is sominex cinema
Jan 1 2000,positive,a sleek goodlooking and entertaining romance
Jan 1 2000,negative,  despite its faults titanic had just enough plot to justify its threehour running time and the story behind benhur made for an enthralling nearly fourhour movie  but judging from the example set by meet joe black filmmaker martin brest could have made either of those earlier movies into 10hour opuses  since he managed to stretch a 100minute premise to threehour length here  whats particularly irritating is that meet joe black does have an interesting story germ which has made for two good movies already  1934s death takes a holiday and a 1971 madefortv remake  dont get the wrong impression the film isnt completely unwatchable thanks in large part to a filmstealing performance by anthony hopkins also the reinterpretation of the story by four credited screenwriters is more thoughtful than you might be led to believe  however the subject might feel fresher if we hadnt already seen city of angels also based on an earlier muchbetter film which trod similar ground and the snaillike pacing robs it of muchneeded vitality  the new houseguest reveals his secret to parrish  that hes actually death and has assumed the form of a recently slain man but he has a dual purpose in coming to parrish not only is he there to claim the sixtysomething businessman hes also curious about the human experience and wants his next victim to be a guide to physical existence  the revelation causes parrish to reassess his life including his relationships in business and with his daughters allison marcia gay harden the older perfectionist and susan claire forlani the younger romantic  and while parrish tries to ready himself for death joe discovers human emotions including romantic love susan has mistaken joe for the charming stranger she met in a coffee shop the man whose body he has claimed and has fallen for him  from there the story diverges from the original film seemingly to suit the whims of brest and the screenwriters its a metaphysical journey done in a metaphorical style but it also lacks the necessary weight and impact  performancewise pitt is decent enough but he cant hope to hold a candle to hopkins who is terrific nor for that matter can the supporting cast though both harden and jeffrey tambor try their best  meet joe black is rated r for profanity including the pg13 rated one simulated sex a fairly lengthy scene in fact a disturbing autopedestrian collision and use of vulgar slang
Jan 1 2000,negative,  meet joe black has the dubious distinction of being the longest film to date of 1998 it is also one of the most tedious and bombastic at a hair under three hours its shorter than james camerons titanic yet when it comes to pace joe black is glacial director martin brest who helmed the enjoyablebutalsotoolong scent of a woman is at his absolute worst here brest transforms a seemingly foolproof idea into an overblown bore   there are slow movies slooooooooooow movies and then theres meet joe black somehow brest manages to take a script lacking the content to justify a two hour motion picture and drag it out to three several obvious techniques are applied to accomplish this the first and most obvious is that the director forces his actors to insert frequent lengthy pauses into all dialogue i kept wondering if he believed he was directing william shatner it wouldnt be as bad if the conversations were wellwritten but most of what the characters say is sophomoric and rarely of much interest then to add insult to injury brest never lets a scene end naturally but keeps things going long past the point where the audience has lost interest   meet joe black was loosely suggested by the 1934 movie death takes a holiday which in turn was based on a 20s stage play of the same name this is not a strict remake  in fact a key subplot is eliminated entirely  but it uses the blackandwhite films central conceit what would happen if death decided to temporarily abandon his place in the cosmos and reside for a brief time on earth meet joe black postulates that he might look like brad pitt fall in love with a beautiful young woman and help save a good mans company one thing this movie ignores however is how the universe fares with death on vacation death takes a holiday went to great pains to describe the horrors of a world in which there was still illness and injury but no death disappointingly that potentiallyfascinating aspect of the situation is ignored by meet joe black which wastes the bulk of its three hours on a passionless romance and an absurd corporate takeover scheme   the film introduces bill parrish anthony hopkins a corporate tycoon on the verge of celebrating his 65th birthday hes also about to die from a heart attack one night after dinner death brad pitt appears with an offer hell put off taking bill if in return bill will introduce him to the wonders of being alive the longer bill can keep him interested in remaining corporeal the longer the reprieve so bill introduces death renamed joe black to his family daughters susan claire forlani and allison marcia gay harden soninlaw quince jeffrey tambor and future soninlaw drew jake weber with his almost childlike innocence joe is an immediate hit with everyone except drew who sees him as a rival for susans affections his fears are justified soon joe and susan are falling for each other and theres nothing that bill can do to stop the doomed relationship   the centerpiece of meet joe black is the romance between joe and susan but its not the kind of motion picture love affair that causes the spirit to soar forlani and pitt may both possess matineestyle good looks but they generate no heat or chemistry and as a result they end up being featured in some of the most painfully protracted and awkward romantic sequences of any movie this year as bland as they are together theyre not much more compelling when apart at least susan shows hints of threedimensionality joe is unreadable  sometimes ingenuous sometimes ominous but never interesting and since death has been watching humankind for eons how is it that he doesnt understand what kissing and sex are when it comes to a spiritual being taking a physical form nicholas cages angel in city of angels wins the 1998 sweepstakes   in general brad pitt is not a terrible actor and i give him credit for trying to broaden his range but his work here is execrable pitts acting in concert with brests heavyhanded direction makes this character a complete waste of celluloid joe black looks like death warmed over anthony hopkins does his best to add a dose of class to the proceedings but theres only so much he can do and he isnt given an especially meaty part claire forlani the young beauty from basquiat shows great promise although there are a few scenes when she looks like a deer caught in a cars headlights jake weber is suitably despicable as the traitorous drew and marcia gay harden and jeffrey tambor provide adequate support   as is brests trademark theres plenty of emotional buttonpushing only this time the director doesnt have a good feel for how best to manipulate the audience theres a big speech near the end and a lot of melodramatic music but instead of leading the viewer into a state of emotional rapture it all rings hollow perhaps its because theres no rapport between the audience and the characters or perhaps its because the movie has long since worn out its welcome either way the grand finale like almost everything else in the movie is a dud as far as epics go this one is a failure in fact by comparison meet joe black makes last years kevin costner postapocalyptic tale the postman seem like a model of restraint and solid storytelling 
Jan 1 2000,positive, meet joe black is a movie about a rich man trying to negotiate the terms of his own death it is a movie about a woman who falls in love with a concept and it is a meditation on the screen presence of brad pitt that there is also time for scenes about sibling rivalry and a corporate takeover is not necessarily a good thing the movie contains elements that make it very good and a lot of other elements besides less is more as the movie opens a millionaire named william parrish anthony hopkins is pounded by a heart attack the soundtrack using low bass chords to assault the audience he hears a voicehis ownin his head on the brink of his 65th birthday he senses that death is near he tells his beloved younger daughter susan claire forlani that he likes her fiance but doesnt sense that she truly loves him stay open lightning could strike it does a few hours later in a coffee shop she meets a stranger brad pitt they talk and flirt he says all the right things lightning makes at the very least a near miss they confess they really like each other they part he is killed that night at dinner she is startled to find him among her fathers guests the body of the young man is now occupied by death who has come to inform parrish that his end is near he does not recognize susan thats odd isnt death an emissary from god shouldnt he know these things hes been around a long time one imagines him breaking the bad news to amoebas this death doesnt even know what peanut butter tastes like or how to kiss a job like that you want a more experienced man no matter we accept the premise were distracted anyway by the way brad pitt plays the role as both the young man in the coffee shop and as joe black the name given him by parrish he is intensely aware of himselftoo aware pitt is a fine actor but this performance is a miscalculation meryl streep once said that an experienced actor knows that the words i love you are really a question pitt plays them as a compliment to himself there is no chemistry between joe black and susan because both parties are focused on him that at least leads to the novelty of a rare movie love scene where the camera is focused on the mans face not the womans actresses have become skilled over the years at faking orgasms on camera usually with copious cries of delight and sobs of passion as theyre buffeted by their competent male lovers i am sometimes reminded of a teenager making the cheerleader team crossed with a new war widow a male actor would have to be very brave to reveal such loss of control and pitts does not cry out his orgasm plays in slow motion across his face like a person who is thinking this is way better than peanut butter i was not in short sold on the relationship between susan and joe she spends most of the movie puzzling about a very odd man who briefly made her heart feel gooey there is no person there for her just the idea of perfect love joe black is presented as a being who is not familiar with occupying a human body or doing human things one wondersis this the first time death has tried this approach parrish strikes a deal with him he wont die as long as he can keep joe interested and teach him new things and takes him everywhere with him including board meetings where joes response to most situations is total silence while looking like the cat that ate the mouse the parrish character and anthony hopkins performance are entirely different matters hopkins invests the dying millionaire with intelligence and acceptance and he talks wonderfully well meet joe black consists largely of conversations which are wellwritten and do not seem false or forced as long as parrish is involved in them his key business relationships are with the snaky drew jake weber whom susan dumps for joe and with the avuncular quince jeffrey tambor his loyal but bumbling soninlaw quince is married to allison marcia gay harden who knows susan is her fathers favorite but can live with that because parrish is such a swell guy hes ethical sensitive and belovedthe first movie rich man who could at least squeeze his head and shoulders through the eye of the needle whats fascinating about parrish is that he handles death as he has handled everything else he makes a realistic assessment of his chances sees what advantages he can extract negotiates for the best possible terms and gracefully accepts the inevitable there are times when he handles his talks with death so surely that you wish heaven had sent a more articulate negotiator the movies ending takes too long there are farewells reflections confessions reassurances reconciliations partings and surprises joe black begins to get on our nerves with his knack for saying things that are technically true but incomplete and misleading the film would play better if he didnt always have to talk in epigrams even at the very end when a line or two of direct dialogue would have cleared the air hes still talking in acrostic clues still theres so much thats fine in this movie directed by martin brest scent of a woman claire forlani has a touching vulnerability as she negotiates the strange terms of her love marcia gay harden plays a wise grownup scene with parrish as a loving daughter who knows she isnt the favorite jeffrey tambors performance is crucial through his eyes we understand what a good man parrish is and anthony hopkins inhabits a story that tends toward quicksand and finds dry land you sense a little of his nixon here a man who can use anger like a scalpel while still standing back to monitor the result roger ebert was the film critic of the chicago suntimes from 1967 until his death in 2013 in 1975 he won the pulitzer prize for distinguished criticism
Jan 1 2000,negative, personally ida thought death himself would be more interesting than a doeeyed brad pitt doing his best forrest gump imitation i mean hes got a pretty cool job that takes him all over the world he meets people from literally all walks of life hes been around you know but director martin brest and his four count em screenwriters would have us believe that death is so busy with his grim reaping that he hasnt had time to develop any semblance of a personality instead death  death  has become hollywoods favorite clich√©d male of the moment the soft mushy boyish sexually nonthreatening pinup yawn william parrish anthony hopkins instinct the mask of zorro is a sort of ted turneresque mediamogul type only with an english accent instead of a southern one on the eve of his 65th birthday hes wealthy beyond dreams of avarice and his news corporation is about to sell for zillions to a competitor in the biz he has daughters who dote on him  susan claire forlani mystery men a doctor whos involved with drew jake weber dangerous beauty bills trusted righthandman and allison marcia gay harden whos married to another member of the companys board quince jeffrey tambor theres something about mary life would be perfect except that bills been having chest pain  any idiot could see hes having a bunch of heart attacks but bill doesnt bother seeing a doctor no he waits until death himself brad pitt fight club the devils own shows up with an offer let him hang around for a while down here on earth and bill can live a bit longer bill agrees and introduces his new friend around as joe black oh what a raucous black comedy this could have been bill running out to the best heart specialists in the world trying to cheat death himself while death has a wild time trying out all the sensual pleasures of the flesh but no  meet joe black is staid somber serious ohso earnest at one point bill says to death youre violating the laws of the universe really i wouldnt have thought anyone could say that line with a straight face hopkins manages to make it sound death is breaking some arcane tax law and its three freaking hours long three hours of endless meetings of the board of bills company while the sale of the company is rehashed and dinner parties during which the details of bills humongous birthday bash are discussed who cares what party favors should be given away to guests poor death  he must wonder what all the fuss about life is about the truncated airline version of meet joe black is credited as an alan smithee film which means brest did not see the shortened version as worthy of having his name attached which means he actually wanted his actors dragging scenes out as their characters stare at one another in silence until the viewer wants to scream say something already you could step out for half the running time of this film and not miss anything as most of it consists of characters sitting around wondering whos joe black who indeed death should have panache style something dark rippling underneath death should be almost irresistibly sexy instead joe black is as a friend of mine has so hilariously termed the dewy version of brad pitt to whom were subject here like a newly hatched chick all soft and warm and innocent and cuddly and were supposed to believe that susan has fallen head over heels for joe that shes experiencing the electric obsessive love her dad suggested she needed instead of the comfortable relationship she has with dorky drew not only does the icy forlani fail to ignite any sparks with pitt but theres precious little reason evident why any woman would fall for joe and top it all with ridiculous plot coincidences torpid stilted dialogue and a nice pat happy ending and you get a piece of glossy hollywood tripe that is well deadly dull
Jan 1 2000,negative, oh to die in a sugarcoated hollywood movie while the spiritual schmaltz craze is under way you look your best you say wise things your loved ones cherish them perhaps therell be a party with a dance band and fireworks in your honor and you can spend as much time on your last farewells as it took to sink the titanic a ship that doubtless bears some responsibility for the rise of the fourstar demise you can even insist as the oppressively lavish and snailpaced meet joe black does that the old wisdom about the rich man and the eye of the needle was dead wrong william parrish the noble tycoon played zestily by anthony hopkins in this otherwise somnolent emotionfree weepie is just such a fortunate paragon and meet joe black does its prettified best to find inspiration in watching him die because william is wise kind generous and so wellheeled that he pays no attention to the great paintings on his remarkably many walls manhattan triplex sleek offices versailleslike seaside palace destiny even gives him a gift a personal afterlife trainer in the form of brad pitt as death with blond highlights mr pitt might have been expected to give the film a pulse but his role is conceived in an all too appropriately lifeless fashion meet joe black is a latterday version of death takes a holiday the play that was filmed in 1934 with fredric march and had some nicely fanciful notions of what might happen if death gave himself a breather for instance it would be impossible to commit suicide by jumping off the eiffel tower and withering plant life would flourish perhaps in the wildly overlong case of meet joe black enough plant life to refoliate deserts but as directed by martin brest who last made scent of a woman meet joe black doesnt even have time for such charming diversions its busy showing off the parrish familys privileged life style ad nauseam the lilygilding is formidable thanks to production design by dante ferretti and emmanuel lubezkis polished cinematography and it devotes one whole dopey subplot to planning williams grandiose birthday fete meanwhile william is having severe heart trouble which takes the form of heavy editing strident musical melodrama and agonized winces from mr hopkins his number is almost up but death would like to offer him a bonus round in exchange for showing death a k a joe black what it means to be a happy mogul william can put his affairs in order without much of a rush and joe black while falling for susan can express innocent amazement at human life as if he were a greatlooking version of et there are repeated ostensibly delightful scenes in which joe discovers the wonders of peanut butter thank you for your patience while we verify access if you are in reader mode please exit and log into your times account or subscribe for all of the times
