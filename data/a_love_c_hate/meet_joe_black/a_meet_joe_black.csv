Feb 17 2024,positive,i love this movie so much the story is amazing the music is beautiful and well i just love everything about it
Feb 12 2024,positive,people say its long and yeah i guess it is but i kinda like its pace parts of it remind me of a happier kinder version of succession but with good people rather than evil self centered people i liked brad pitts performance because there are times when hes super weird and awkward and aloof which makes sense for his character and times where he really dials into some intense moments of competence and i like the range of that character in general anthony is great the story is romantic but also kind of a refreshing and non depressing take on death     critics hated it but whatever if its too long for you watch it in hour slots like episodes of whatever hour long show youre used to binge watching
Feb 10 2024,positive,one of the best films ive ever watched   sooooo lovely marvelous  fucking hell best story best romance best quotes best writing best actors fun and funny sad and tragically beautiful love and happiness tax and death super lovely and beautiful compare to everyone i didnt want the film to end my heart couldnt it was super fun to watch    1010  peak writing and perfect time to produce such film   just wonderfully awesome    its going to seat on the top with interstellar as my all time favorites

Jan 22 2024,negative,too long too noisy background music too soppy nice photography  never again
Jan 9 2024,positive,setting aside for a moment the runtime for this motion picture which clocked in at around three hours i can dismiss that if i liked the subject matter the acting the plot and all of those things that would make for an interesting review    sue instead of wasting any additional time as was already spent on the movies length as mentioned let me cut to the if you had a very large bag of popcorn at home when you rented this thing there really was a lot to enjoy if time simply wasnt an issue anthony hopkins acting was topnotch as usual so wonderful was it that he singlehandedly held this film up and a large thumb up for claire forlani who is gestures are an absolute delight i completely fell in love with her eye movements and her performance seemed genuine to me a number of others that should also be mentioned in the positive column are the contributions of jake weber in the role of drew a sniffling sneaky individual doing the dirty deed of destroying the company for which he worked and which anthony hopkins ran as ceo in the role of a weasel you really cant ask for anything better then there is the contribution of jeffrey tambor in the role of quince who does a lovely job as a soninlaw to anthony hopkins and a contributing member of hopkins company in which he in advertently creates a situation that helps bring the company down something that he owns up to towards the end of the film an incredibly likable character who is just wonderful to watch i have to say at this point although its a very small detail how do you get to be a topnotch actor and have a missing tooth on the upper right hand hand side thats clearly visible i mean the guy doesnt make enough money to get a crown or an implant  that really is important because its very annoying because you cant stop looking at it every time he smiles ffs    and now for the elephant in the room i havent said anything about brad pitt when wouldve thought that along with hopkins i shouldve mentioned him immediately but i cant  i can only label that performance says grim brad pitt himself even tore his roller apart saying that he tanked it and that someone else couldve done it much better agreed but here unlike many critics who would seek to tear them completely to shreds i disagree with their assessments to a certain degree he plays the role of death so tell me how death is supposed to be played he has entered the body of brad pitt a character who earlier in this motion picture was killed in a terrible car accident so he can spend a little time on earth getting to know a bit more about it and habitants which eventually leads in the fall in love with susan aka claire forlani i thought the role well not dramatic certainly is very interesting in that he is attempting to adjust himself as a human being apparently quite difficult to do and understandably so as he seems to have never  placed himself in this kind of situation so theres a lot of bumbling and stumbling in a development for peanut butter that adds a bit of lightness and humor to this otherwise fairly dramatic film after all hopkins is going to die we know this very early on theres no escaping it but how does death interact with hopkins final days and how does he deal being in love for the first time i thought pitt actually handled i thought it was a brilliant movie that very well its clearly a difficult world to play and i thought this understated admittedly grossly so performance is justified i can only say that the few moments of drama that he had at his disposal he clearly couldve done more in those scenes otherwise i have no complaints his acting simply wasnt bad enough to distract from a very enjoyable movie a movie i might have that has some very interesting things to say about life the philosophy of life and living and how we deal with the end time very difficult subjects handled appropriately with a fair degree of lightness thats something also difficult to pull off i thought the screen writing was fairly brilliant    i should point out that the movie score for this film by thomas newman is among his best works and did in fact receive critical acclaim    i just cant hammer this movie like so many other critics have and ive stated my reasons and im sticking to them there are flaws and pitt couldve done more with the role but im going to take it easy on him for reasons ive mentioned critics have been too hard on him for that role and he was too hard on himself    as to whether anyone should rent this film thats 100 for me just be prepared to stake out some significant time but if youre relaxing youve got nothing else to do and as i said youve got your popcorn and maybe some wine and you perhaps have a loved one to be with there are worse things you could do with that three hours a lot of worse kick   back and enjoy
Dec 22 2023,positive,perfect casting for all the main characters fascinating story  and unusually the film takes its time to let the story unfold  a classic
Dec 14 2023,positive,while everyone spends their holidays watching love actually and home alone and the holiday i spend december watching this movie every year its my favourite romantic movie i also feel this is one of brad pitts most underrated films if you want to know what love truly is this should be the film you should watch happy holidays
Dec 11 2023,positive,amazing movie if all rich people understood about doing right things like bill we would not have terrible moral like we have now
Nov 16 2023,positive,outstanding listen carefully and you will hear many great lines that you can keep with you always
Oct 21 2023,positive,just an all round great film it has enough pathos and storyline to keep going super cast plenty of fun
Oct 14 2023,negative,too slow too dreamy
Sep 13 2023,positive,one of my fav fav fav movies ever its so romantic and beautiful  brad pit looks like an actual angel  thank you for loving me 
Sep 9 2023,positive,i watched this movie for the first time in 2011 i found it to be enjoyable and sad upon a rewatch the movie is so much better than i remembered it being the acting is great on all parts which is what could make or break this film yes it is a long movie but worth it
Aug 14 2023,positive,can be a little boring at times but overall pretty good movie
Jul 26 2023,positive,i love this movie anthony hopkins is perfect
Jul 11 2023,negative,the ending was such a disappointment its like they resolved to end it in the most bland limp way they could great premise ruined by a blah ending
Jul 2 2023,positive,a perfect movie perfectly acted the script is pure poetry for the heart 
Jun 2 2023,positive,this is possibly my favorite movie of all time
May 25 2023,positive,must see beautiful heartfelt and make you ask what if claire forlani playing her character beautifully the the music will make you cry i guarantee you
May 22 2023,positive,absolutely fabulous brad is amazing as well as anthony snd the whole cast kept my attention the whole way through seen it many times love it more every time
May 17 2023,positive,what a surprise i had low expectations when i started meet joe black perhaps it was because of the 3hour runtime but i was expecting a convoluted and boring mess of a film the exact opposite was true for me i was continually transfixed by the story and glued to the screen for the full duration the concept of having death learn about the subtle wonders of life was beautiful and compelling    the script was wellwritten though slightly melodramatic at times the performances were excellent and i finally saw the brilliance of anthony hopkins he brought a quiet confidence and sense of acceptance to the role his relationship with the other characters especially susan had an emotional pull that brought me in on top of it all this score is one of my favorites in recent memory other than a few quirky moments in the first act the music was a powerful reminder of the depth of the story    one of my favorite elements of this film was the use of silence the runtime allowed the audience to experience stillness usually brushed past in the average film nothing felt rushed everything was calculated and you leave remembering that nothing is as certain as death and taxes
May 16 2023,negative,its terrible very slow and boring dont wast your time
May 8 2023,positive,if you would indulge me  evie and i watched this film 12 years ago a few months after we met we loved it funny poignant and the way one should feel about finding the one you love and how you should treat each other that was us at the beginning joe black came to visit her last september 5th she went with him with dignity and grace she was at her very best at the worst time for her i loved her every minute after i told her and she loved me watching it again by myself just cemented the fact that we did it right   its hard to let go isnt it yes it is well thats life   to the ones who found it hard to sit the running length i say maybe you havent loved like that   thanks for sticking it out with me until here enjoy the film
Feb 28 2023,positive,fucking masterpiece both movie and music
Feb 14 2023,positive,the 3 hours just flew by love it
Jan 12 2023,positive,could easily be an 810 if it was a 2 hours long movie cut out the big amount of scenes that we really dont need and you got one of the best scripts i ever saw its too slow sometimes scenes take too much to end that ending it could end after the walk that joe and bill had and it would have been much better but then the guy from the cafe came back from life and bla bla bla the writing is beautiful except when it isnt great casting great score but overall a good movie gonna eat some peanut butter now goodbye 610
Jan 11 2023,positive,yes it may be too long for todays film audience yes its a lots of what the rt critics have too say but theres something about it that is very moving powerful  fulfilling that even a 60 year old skinhead punk cries at the end
Jan 1 2023,positive,an interesting personification of death curious how even death struggles with desires as a human biggest takeaway is that death is what makes the people we love and the moments we experience that much more special and precious because time is fleeting also claire forlani is hot
Dec 22 2022,positive,personally i think this was some very pleasant acting facial closeups were very good i dont care how long it is it was fun
Dec 21 2022,positive,okay the whole thing is preposterous but it is a romantic fantasy with some fine acting and a lead actress so watchable she doesnt need to say anything
Dec 21 2022,positive,excellent and enjoyable movie the plot is intriguing twisting and characterful most scenes are expertly executed however the occasional performance prevents the movie from obtaining a higher score
Nov 6 2022,negative,i absolutely could not stand susans strange facial expressions through the entire show as if she was trying to emulate a very shy 8yearold girl it was bizarre and i guess the writers had no clue how to end a movie made no sense whatsoever the only saving grace of course was the brad pitt eye candy
Nov 5 2022,positive,how dare the professional critics give this film a 44 approval rating this is one of the finest films ive ever seen  on many different levels and believe me  ive seen many thousands of films all actors here offer brilliant portrayals  with pitt showing what a class talent he is as he deftly portrays three different characters including the obeah hospital scene where he conjures up an excellent jamaican accent and attitude the film is long  but its also long in beauty and content kudos especially to claire forlani for her wonderful characterization as susan  joes love interest    just watching it leaves the viewer with a beautiful and warm inner contentment
Oct 4 2022,negative,this sucked from the script to the overacting by anthony hopkins the lack of chemistry the horrible plot line  this was so bad i hate that i wasted these hours of my life watching this crap and what the hell was the thought that brad pitt doing a horrendous imitation of a jamaican patois even the black  actors couldnt pull it off  why couldnt he just speak to them in his regular voice so racist  the female lead is so unforgettable and just overall terrible acting why did they want anthony hopkins to scream so much in this
Oct 1 2022,negative,oh gosh easily in the top ten of terrible movies with established actors  long and tedious surprising only in that it just gets worse as it stumbles along  and i had to wear sunglasses to shield my eyes from mr pitts hair color  hard to believe its the same mr pitt in once upon a timein hollywood  an excellent movie  as with everything i suppose one gets better with experience  the director mr brest has done some very good work before and after meet joe black  makes one wonder how good people come together to make such a bad movie  writing  editing  undue influence from the people holding the money
Sep 22 2022,positive,im a longtime brad pitt and anthony hopkins fan but the length of this film was way too long and unnecessary it kept going and going and i couldnt watch it in one sitting  i did enjoy it thought and it was a couch snuggler movie with my spouse the beginning grabbed me but i almost fell asleep until pitts death character spoke jamaican to an old lady and she knew he was an angel the ending was a complete let down thought
Sep 11 2022,positive,when i first read the review they always said this movie does not make any sense and it is a brutally long 3 hours if you are turned away from this movie by these review comments then you would miss this wonderful movie actually the 3 hours went by before you realize it really love this movie what a casting as anthony hopkins brad and clarke are all wonderful love this movie so much
Jul 9 2022,positive,long one for the drama love emotion and romance lovers
Jun 25 2022,positive,my husband really likes this movie but i did a lot of eye rolling on the other hand which i guess is ironic that me the woman didnt caught up in the weird romance like my husband    i found the concept too fantastical to take the movie seriously the concept was just too bizarre for me   brad pitt could easily be an angel character so i guess he made a decent angel of death    i felt like he wasnt directed well for his role   i liked the general theme of the movie of living a good life a life well lived with solid character and principle love of family    the ending kind of made no sense gives the message that love is really just all about looks not the person inside    she develops a connection and relationship based on the pure initial infatuation with coffee shop guy but its not the coffee shop guy she develops the connection that leads to even an sexual encounter fast forwarded through that cringe the concept was weird and why does hollywood feel they need to include a soft porn scene in every romance its death   she develops such a deep connection to him that just by just gazing into one anothers eyes she realizes who he really is    the death character loves her enough to agonizingly let her go and in the spirit of true love even brings back coffee shop guy for her happiness   as for her though so coffee shop guy is back in his body obviously a different spirit altogether but no problem hes still the  cute guy and thats all that matters for her    she was just going to seemlessly pick up what had been left off and tells coffee shop guy she loves him and speaks to him in the same manner as before  although its obvious hes not the same person and she knows it   basically i dont love you really i just love that face and body of yours     kind of gives a strange shallow message about love      i think it would given the movie a little more credibility if it had ended with the death and bill parrish characters going over the hill into the darkness together as susan looked on with tears in her eyes or something  cue credits and swelling music
May 20 2022,positive,a suprisingly fresh take on the romance genre which still holds close to the genres tropes but through the unique plotline of death taking a vacation and falling love  leads to a much deeper message about love true wealth and the meaning of life the love in this movie truly opens your heart and shows you what it means to be alive and how mere wealth while amazing isnt nearly as important as the connections you make in your life spectacular performances by brad pitt anthony hopkins and claire forlani
May 13 2022,positive,i can easily see why the critics rate it lower than the audience  critics will nit pick and find areas where it could have been better  where the critics found it meandering and long i found it that the scenes that critics probably feel the movie could do without i found they were needed as they built on character development and the story wonderful and poignant scenes on the helicopter with his daughter in his office describing the first time he met his wifeand the wonderful conclusion where the sound score is amazing and there is a happy ending  which i love and maybe even clouds my view on average movies  i love the cinematography even though its just mostly citywell the hamptons tooi suppose it was the hamptons and the music ive watched this movie quite a few timessometimes i just go to certain scenes to watch again  if you want a movie with a happy ending and some life messages interspersed throughout you will love this movie
May 9 2022,positive,an underrated gem  brad pitt anthony hopkins and claire forlani shine in this dark romantic comedy  i love this film
Apr 25 2022,positive,one of my favorite movies ever i can watch it over and over even if it is one of brads worst performances ever he was not directed well they forgot death has seen everything knows everything there is to know about humans apart from that the other actors do a wonderful job sir anthony hopkins is wow the sets are magnificent the story is urban fairy talefantastic
Apr 24 2022,negative,if you have an option between watching paint dry and this movie you will find the first much more entertaining  there has to be 40 minutes of brad pitts fave saying nothing in the three hours
Apr 17 2022,positive,clever twists in the film also funny at times  the scenes with the older dying lady in hospital are very moving also the love scene between the susan and joe was so tender it is a bit mushy and long but i still so enjoyed it
Apr 11 2022,positive,its a vacation comedy in my book  i truly enjoy it very nice story plot
Mar 26 2022,negative,im by no means a hard to please audience but this movie was hideous susans idk the name of the actress american accent is abysmal brad pitt had no idea how to act and is just trying to look pretty the story is very interesting and had a lot of potential but it was horrendously executed this movie was so bad that i made a rotten tomatoes account so i could talk about how bad it was
Feb 21 2022,positive,beautifully written cast filmed and scored absolutely excellent remake of death takes a holiday this film is far more than just eye candy the characters are well developed and the message is highly relevant today  if you understand it then the run time goes by in a blink if you dont understand it then i feel sorry for you
Feb 11 2022,neutral,its ok couldve done with much better editing could cut an hour off the movie performances were kinda mid brad pitt given a role with zero range of emotion only truly leaning into the fish out of water skit acting hopkins was wasted on a mediocre character music was ok im not too sure why everyones raving about it notes and motifs were relatively short and simple nothing complex but all in all this did not have to be 3 hours long
Feb 3 2022,negative,useless waste of time even if hopkins did a good job it dont make it better  
Jan 5 2022,positive,watched it again over many years and its even better  mysterious and beautiful
Dec 26 2021,neutral,okay this is getting an extra star just because the two main characters were both so fine but truthfully this movie was a dud the plot didnt really make sense and the ending was ass how is that girl supoosed to go with a new guy right after her old boyfriend  just died essentially and also like how can she be with that guy like thats so trippy anyway overall if you want a feel good movie or just broke up with someone give this a watch otherwise steer clear
Nov 21 2021,negative,i literally got a rotten tomatoes account to review this film because if i can stop at least one person watching this then it wasnt a complete waste of my time
Nov 16 2021,positive,best movie ive seen in a very long time  it helped me relate to the  thought of death  almost made me cry
Nov 1 2021,negative,despite top quality acting somewhat tedious to watch and hollow story line  too much of a good ending
Oct 11 2021,positive,value of live love and time well portraited
Sep 16 2021,positive,stunning movie the script is great and the vibe of the movie just takes you away to another place thanks to the incredible acting and chemistry of hopkins pitt and forlani
Jul 29 2021,negative,i have no shame in saying that i watched this film at 125x speed and it still felt like a way too long and boring melodrama considering the plot the film could have been over in one and a half hour but the director wanted to drag this tedious love story through unnecessary plot lines and ucomfortable close ups i love brad pitt and i think that hes a great actor as he shows in the first 20 minutes of the film but during most of the film he looked more like a wax statue than a real human being his lines were delivered through unbearable silences that even at more than the normal speed felt slow down the only ones who i can really apreciate in this film were sir anthony hopkins and thomas newman who did an overall good job unfortunately not good enough to save the whole film
Jul 22 2021,positive,does this movie know what it is no its not a chick flick although it tries to be its not horror its not drama it contains no laughs no tears no insights what is it its a show case for brad pitts fake blonde hairdo and antony hopkins dead pan delivery its a set piece in a beautiful manor it does contain a loveinterest but the suspension of disbelief required to buy into it goes way beyond the pale this kind of movie relies entirely on production value and star power  storywise it belongs in a book of fantastic spanish literature perhaps thats where they found it its boring but the production is like a long slow piece of candy
Jul 18 2021,negative,boring as hell excessively long cheesy dialogue urgh
Jul 6 2021,positive,this was a great movie on family loss and love it was very long though
Jun 30 2021,positive,good but the cheesy jamaican accent scenes could have been cut out
Jun 27 2021,positive,not giving it the whole 5 stars because of the length and general slow pace of the movie but for the most part i really find this to be a really amazing movie and brad pitts performance really blows my mind by the end of the movie you realise that there were so many deep hidden messages throughout the whole duration of the film and you didnt even notice because you were so absorbed on the idea that this is a movie that has a simple and kind of stupid plot to me this movie really is fundamental it teaches you to live in a new way and leaves you with a heavy heart but also full of joy and such a weir combination is not easy to achieve in my opinion
Jun 20 2021,positive,a brilliant and refreshing life enhancing story music direction and acting stand the test of time anthony hopkins performance really stands out as a man who is facing death with the brightest of eyes  warning spoiler to look back on his party and say yes that was good thing was a very memorable moment
Jun 19 2021,positive,whilst it is a little long nonetheless i have always found this film draws you in and keeps you in its grasp the plot is satisfying as i have always loved the twist and it is a real weepy the performances of the cast i think are warm yes anthony hopkins is phenomenal but brad pitts performance as death who is an alien in an alien world i think is well thought and as a piece of physical acting the way he learns to move in his new body is really clever i love quince drew is wonderfully creepy finally the other aspect of this film that should not be overlooked is the music it is very evocative
Jun 19 2021,negative,i really do pray that you had something more interesting to do than watch this movie
May 6 2021,positive,yes once again critics just dont get this movie whereas audiences do
May 3 2021,neutral,all i could say is this movie went far from convention
Apr 24 2021,positive,despite the 3 hour runtime it was pretty good as it had a good love story brad pitt and anthony hopkins had great chemistry it ran in a nice pace for 3 hours and had a beautiful ending
Apr 19 2021,positive,the idea is original the film is wellmade and the acting is extremely convincing
Apr 6 2021,positive,i enjoyed this movie cannot care less for the socalled critics
Feb 16 2021,negative,far too long despite some pretty good performances from the leads pitt and hopkins the grim reaper has well and truly worn out his welcome with this
Feb 9 2021,positive,i understand this is supposed to be a very moving film but its just far too dubious to take all that seriously i mean there are some really sweet moments and interesting discussions of life love and legacy but it just drags out far too long for such a hokey script
Jan 4 2021,positive,one of the most touching must see movies absolutely reccomended
Jan 2 2021,positive,i really love this movie it was a refreshing movie about love
Dec 27 2020,positive,dont care that others dont like this film i enjoyed it because of the gentle story easy to watch except for the distracting facial and eye movements of claire forlani which are enough to take it down a star or two as for death films this ranks as a b against  warren beatty in heaven can wait
Dec 27 2020,positive,having just watched this i can honestly sayi am ashamed of not watching this sooner    if you are a film buff who dislikes long movies then you would be forgiven for what you may find in this movie however should you dedicate yourself to watch this now as i did may rethink your hidden biasses towards long movies to put it simply if this movie came out in cinemas today i wholeheartedly believe it would win 4 oscars     based off the movie death takes a holiday the movie captures the imagination of the protagonists sir anthony hopkins  brad pit and puts you the viewer in a world of drama romance and escapism it is certainly a rollercoaster ride of emotions and quirky reallife situations that do not keep the viewer on the back seat     finally this movie is in my opinion pits best movie and he should have been awarded an oscar for best supporting actor accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack by thomas newman meet joe black is one of the best movies i have ever seen
Dec 21 2020,positive,a delicious romp through death the film is enchanting throughout with subtle hints of cinnamon and fermented lime
Dec 8 2020,positive,i watched this movie a couple of years ago and to be honest im surprised that there was anyone complaining about the length of a movie if you would sit for a three hour play then movies deserve the same respect the movie itself has a beautiful aesthetic and fine performances and while i doubt its anyones favorite movie it is still much better then the critics gave it credit for being
Dec 8 2020,negative,one of the most bewitching plot ideas to this day but somehow this movie is as glacial and unspectacular as a clay bowl
Nov 5 2020,positive,this movie is so beautiful so poignant would rec
Oct 6 2020,positive,a beautiful clever sad poignant film well worth watching
Sep 23 2020,positive,this a rare movie that makes you feel sadness like its suppose to feel 
Sep 20 2020,positive,30 minutes too long even though it didnt feel like a 3 hour film i certainly think the absorbing performances of hopkins and to a lesser extent brad pitt helped move things along but all the same this really is far too long with some pretty poor pacing and careless editing    another thing i wasnt happy with at all was the ending and i mean the very ending without giving away too much the ending i liked was with pitt  hopkins walking over the bridge out of sight  now that would have made a good dramatic ending    however what we get tacked on is a happyclappy romantic ending that just came out of nowhere and for me ruined the buildup up to that point
Sep 8 2020,positive,death and taxes great line
Aug 19 2020,positive,i personally loved the movie soundtrack was amazing and the movie felt as if it could legitimately play out in the real world 5 star from me
Aug 3 2020,positive,three hours is a long movie especially for a movie that has slow action and not a lot of dialogues  however the beauty of meet joe black resides in the close scenes where you feel like you understand the characters completely in a few seconds only there is so much that is not said but that is secretly shown in this movie its crazy  a picture is worth a thousand words perfectly describes it the dramatic scenes and the script will leave you unsure at the beginning but in the end it all falls into place and you can truly enjoy meet joe black and brad pitts performance however its true that the intensity can be annoying if youre not into the story a must watch if you love romance
Jul 25 2020,neutral,meet joe black is an interesting piece  on how fragile life is and how nothing is to be taken for granted  despite a solid premise uneven pacing and overall length drag this movie down strong performances by pitt and hopkins offer mild relief
Jul 5 2020,negative,it takes far too long to tell a slow and simple story
Jun 29 2020,positive,i found this movie to have a deeper meaning about life and even though it was long it had a very eery vibe about it the same vibe of standing in long empty hallways or standing in an empty shopping mall passed closing hours it may be extreme but this is my favorite movie and those are the reasons why
Jun 29 2020,positive,anthony hopkins is ammmaaaazing 
Jun 22 2020,positive,i remember when it was in theatres it had such poor reviews i didnt bother  it showed up in netflix recently and i finally thought oh well why not  i am so sorry that it has taken me this long it was a touching movie  the very end could have used a lighter touch but effective nevertheless never believe what critics say judge a movie yourself and oh my i didnt appreciate how simply beautiful brad pitt was in his younger years  the robert redford of his generation no doubt he had to age to be appreciated for his talent
Jun 6 2020,positive,one of my alltime favourite movies critics dont like it which makes me love it even more fantastic in every way
May 22 2020,positive,i can appreciate why a good shakespearean actor like anthony hopkins chose this role its rather like dr faustus but the camera dwells lovingly and ohsoslowly over the lavish decor and mr brad pitts pretty shellpink maquillage the young female whispers like audrey hepburn while brad pitt emotes like julie newmar playing that bewitching automaton in my living doll
May 19 2020,negative,completely full of silly cliches such a waste of screenplay for a fantastic cast
May 16 2020,positive,much of it is beautifully done but it is just too long
May 12 2020,positive,compelling concept with lessons on love and naive death
May 9 2020,negative,slow uneventful and uninteresting meet joe black is incredibly boring and entertaining
May 5 2020,positive,i seriously didnt get the ending
May 3 2020,positive,the film is ok but the script is not very well worked and it gets tiring
May 1 2020,negative,snooze fest slow dialog and completely expected ending the love interest keep repeating the same lines to each other i prefer hopkins as anibal lecter  stick to the classic death takes a holiday instead
Apr 24 2020,positive,i love it despite what critics say the music is aswome specially whisper of a thrill i love the plot and the side characters some are a bit superficial but it has its charm i didnt mind the 3 hours since the movie manage to entretain me and everyone ive seen it withand brad pit looks just his best in this movie
Apr 14 2020,positive,this is a great movie stop thinking and go watch it you wont regret
Mar 23 2020,positive,i still absolutely love this film anyone who hasnt seen it needs to
Mar 20 2020,positive,great story with a few nods to yolo life choices and reflections of what has been do not discount this movie because of its pace absorb it afterwards reflect on your own life and choices 
Feb 29 2020,neutral,quite possibly the firstdraftiest movie ive ever seen if there were such a superlative meet joe black has some terrific ideas in it but its all nearly done away with in favor of flowery dialogue nonessential narrative excess and a muddling of character     this is an odd movie for me to talk about as ive always found its concept fascinating ive also been clinically unable to unearth it from the old neverending backlog of movies i have to see until now that is this in mind though i dont think i would have expected this movie to be about what its actually about preconceived notions notwithstanding without giving away too much theres a tremendously awkward clunky and at times troubling dynamic involving how brad pitts death comes to be corporeal i just could not get on board with the idea even with the satisfying manner in which it comes to an end     as briefly alluded to up top this movies runtime is nearly unforgivable its three hours long it did not need to be three hours long cut something im looking at you unnecessary corporate shenanigans subplot     that said the score for this is quite simply some of the best music youll probably ever hear in a movie regardless of the fact that the accompanying images hold little to no weight for at least 85 of the runtime if you ever wanted to hear a composer work his proverbial ass off to make a movie a seem more interesting take a listen to what thomas newmans done here its sublime     all in all meet joe black means well and is handsomely crafted but i just felt unquestionably distant from the highfalutin nature of it all
Feb 15 2020,negative,there are many moments in meet joe black that you just feel blogged down with the repertoire at the time that the movie was released there wasnt many films creating such concepts and to have both brad pitt and anthony hopkins in the movie alongside clair forlani jake weber and jeffrey tambor the star power of the film was a great success however youre left feeling unappreciated with the overall ending the slow endless drag that seems to ask just who is joe black throughout much of the movie and then it feels almost hurried at the end of the film as the cast is thrown into trying to get the direction of the movie to point north after being thrown way too off course overall if you have three hours to burn through and you are bored out of your mind this movie will help keep you bored without so much of anything else to celebrate about
Feb 10 2020,positive,loved it thoughtful and emotional anthony hopkins and brad pitt
Feb 1 2020,positive,i loved loved loved this movie its a must see if you enjoy forbidden love and unselfish love
Jan 28 2020,positive,amazing film hands down
Jan 20 2020,positive,i watched it for the fifth time after nine years it is still one of the best movies i have ever seen and one of the only ones to bring me close to tears it has some sappy and sometimes idiotic dialogues at times but they all add to the drama and emotion from the childlike portrayal of death at first up to the return of coffeeshop joe i was entranced and felt the pain as a father and even as someone new to love a must watch for the helpless romantics like myself
Jan 18 2020,positive,didnt notice it was 3 hours long heartfelt
Jan 7 2020,negative,story didnt make sense  joe claims to need bill to help him yet theres absolutely no no evidence that bill did anything to help joe he just put up with him getting in the way im not trying to knock brad for his performance but over 2 and a half hours of watching his acting which would be extremely difficult to get wrong just made the whole thing boring brad pitt was completely wasted here they would have picked any old attractive headshot from the top of the pile for this  sex scenes which were so cringey i had to fast forward     the only saving grace was claire forlani who i personally felt was the only actor trying to add something real to the movie     in summary  story so lacking of life that not even brad and anthony could rescue it i was checking my watch every 5 minutes towards to end to check when id be free of this
Jan 6 2020,positive,waay to long and very slow paced without any significant reason the hopkins performance is awesome though pitt is good but sometimes misleading  the weakest part is the screenplay which was obviously undercooked
Dec 23 2019,positive,execellent with young brad pitt
Nov 30 2019,positive,the concept of the movie was goodif only it werent for the dragging silence in some scenes over all i like the story
Nov 19 2019,positive,gobsmackingly beautiful like a classic film but also perhaps one of the last of its class
Oct 13 2019,positive,amazing movie love it 
Sep 22 2019,positive,very enjoyable to watch brad pitt enjoy the feeling of a human form like a newborn baby with the quintessential anthony hopkins as his guide the two are able to share a range of emotions not surprising for mr hopkins but brad pitt was surprisingly affecting with the slightest inflections and subtle facial countenance a movie to be enjoyed slowly like a good glass of wine and then watch it again
Sep 15 2019,neutral,interesting premise but its slow and the characters were not fleshed out
Sep 1 2019,positive,i think it was a well written underrated excellently casted masterpiece
Aug 25 2019,positive,love this film great story and acting sad and yet happy as well 
Aug 10 2019,positive, a remarkable film with amazing cast and the music score are terrific
Jul 31 2019,positive,rather enchanting
Jul 20 2019,positive,how true love is meant to be damn the critics
Jul 14 2019,negative,weirdest movie ever almost hard to believe two of the most talented actors agreed to play in this film 
Jun 23 2019,positive,great chick flick eye candy galore  sweet emotional movie 
Jun 21 2019,positive,an engrossing romantic film that unsurprisingly some american critics hated the lead performances by anthony hopkins and all so perfect brad pitt and claire fotani swept me off my feet  it could have been cut off at 25 hours but it held my interest
Jun 12 2019,positive,simply magic romantic fantasy i never grow tired watching this film it is timeless 
May 31 2019,positive,  once again critics miss a great story
May 26 2019,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time hands down 
Apr 13 2019,positive,what an interesting romantic comedy with a heavy dose of the romance and quite a unique take on the comedy some similarities with ghost
Mar 14 2019,positive,what do critics know anyway
Mar 14 2019,positive,i saw it as a young adult when it first came out as an adult it still is as captivating as the first time there is something magical about it that seems to get a hold of you and not let go masterfully executed 
Feb 23 2019,negative,good potential but very slow pacing
Feb 18 2019,negative,awful cheesy lots of dead silences the movie could have easily had a normal length bad acting and onedimensional characters waste of time
Feb 5 2019,positive,yes the film is slow  but the performances by brad pitt and anthony hopkins are well worth the attention sometimes funny sometimes poignant meet joe black has a beautiful message if you arent too cynical to hear it
Jan 28 2019,positive,i love this movie its touching funny and dramatic it is a bit sappy but hey i like sappy movies if youve ever lost someone close to you you can relate and enjoy that theres something better out there 
Jan 22 2019,positive,i loved this movie so much i wish i didnt take twenty years to see it a little long
Jan 5 2019,positive,if i was to make a list of the best movies of all time this would have to be at the very top of that listso emotional and an amazing experience to watch it
Dec 25 2018,positive,anthony hopkins and brad pitt waht more is there to say
Nov 9 2018,neutral,meet joe black is ultimately a disappointment and an an exercise in how one should understand the pacing of the movie starring brad pitt claire forlani and anthony hopkins this is based on an older film called death takes a holiday 1934 brad pitt dies and is reborn as death and enters a wealthy moguls life to understand the meaning of life meanwhile falling in love with his daughter the pacing is a killer and sorry to say but the acting is pedestrian especially brad pitt it seems theyre all here to collect paychecks to buy mansion the likes shown in this film avoid
Oct 29 2018,positive,this movie has been on my watch list for years and after finally getting the chance to watch it i can honestly say while its not as great as i expectedi wasnt disappointed meet joe black starts off brilliantly but its pace slows down after the first hour or so then reaches the point of becoming completely uneventful it just drags on as the film focuses on the romantic subplot and entirely dismisses the main story but int he end a beautiful score and brad pitts handsomeness make it all worthwhile
Oct 23 2018,positive,hard to believe this comes from the same director as beverly hills cop but when it came out i was fully enthralled with meet joe black as a young man that young man would have this at five stars the more seaworthy me will give a level four stars now that i recognize the groggy pacing and length ive always loved the ending and the three leads especially the graceful forlani in perhaps her finest role
Oct 22 2018,positive,introspective beautiful and deep
Aug 19 2018,negative,meet joe black is ultimately a disappointment and an an exercise in how one should understand the pacing of the movie starring brad pitt claire forlani and anthony hopkins this is based on an older film called death takes a holiday 1934 brad pitt dies and is reborn as death and enters a wealthy moguls life to understand the meaning of life meanwhile falling in love with his daughter the pacing is a killer and sorry to say but the acting is pedestrian especially brad pitt it seems theyre all here to collect paychecks to buy mansion the likes shown in this film avoid

Jul 31 2018,positive,such an interesting movie with great performances this is one i never mind seeing again
Jun 28 2018,positive,best movie ive ever watched in my life dont blindly trust the positive or negative reviews just watch it at least 50 of it to realise its beauty its an absolute master piece ive been fortunate enough to stumble on it and rating it imdb rotten tomatoes and youtube so that people can share the joy of watching this movie
Jun 25 2018,negative,they still keep showing this unbelieavbly long nonsensical boring piece of crap on tv 
Apr 12 2018,positive,just goes to show you that critics are idiots     ok so its a tad long but never boring interesting concept highly original and well executed actors were top notch and a bit of a tear jerker well worth a watch
Apr 2 2018,negative,it wasnt terrible but the main leads lacked chemistry the scenes were bloated and melodramatic the film was overlong by an hour and  at the risk of being excessively disparaging  the movie as a whole is as overappreciated as brad pitts acting
Feb 19 2018,positive,another greatly underrated film  was a unique story idea that humanize death itself  it was mild but interesting through the entire movie  was very well done with great performances by the lead actors
Jan 29 2018,positive,absolutely brilliant movie loved it from the first viewing yes it is a long film but it really allows you to get to know the characters and their relationships it is about life and love passion family generosity and kindness but it also faces up to the inevitable for all of us death and as we face it walk towards it do we go with fear and regret of wasted time or do we go with grace and in the knowledge that when we leave we leave the world a better place
Dec 30 2017,positive,love this movie    lots of criticism about the edit and the length even posthumorously the star brad pitt himself has trashed on this film but personally i think its almost about perfect    i thought the casting was great    i thought the direction was great  sure the movie was slow but it gave so much room for the characters to be fleshed out one of the few movies where every character is given depth and you end the movie genuinely caring for every one    plus how else are you supposed to play death the eternal silent sentry just waiting for literally your entire life to collect you at the other end
Oct 7 2017,positive,i love this movie have watched it over and over again
Sep 23 2017,neutral,i still love sir anthonie hopkins under the circumstances
Aug 15 2017,negative,glacially slow uneventful
Jun 17 2017,positive,the more time passes the more i appreciate this film i am truly bewildered by the critical hate yes at three hours its long but its beautifully written beautifully shot and the thomas newman score is devastatingly lovely     finally i have no idea how this movie didnt make claire forlani a giant star
Jun 1 2017,positive,one of my all time favorite movies it pulls you in and allows you to emotionally feel love fear deathtaxes lol  beautiful cast but even better acting  wonderful dialogue  i am forever in love with anthony hopkins description of love while on the helicopter with claire forlani
Apr 18 2017,positive,who wouldnt want to live a life as full or as wonderful as bill parrish anthony hopkins    for anyone middleaged and upwards youll probably get it for anyone younger you may not no offence     for any father with daughters even one who wouldnt want a beautiful relationship like bill has with susan his youngest    a moving story beautifully told by director martin brest and superbly acted by hopkins pitt and forlani    i am moved to tears by parrishs huge character every time we watch it
Mar 4 2017,negative,very slow but somehow you must keep watching perhaps waiting for something spectacular that never happens or are we hooked by the beautiful people 
Feb 23 2017,positive,i keep wanting to watch it again and again thats a sign of a good one to me
Feb 13 2017,positive,beautifully inspiring and motivating lovely in all categories and is a movie i will never get tired of watching i recommend it to everyone not just because of the terrific acting but for the fascinating plot
Feb 7 2017,positive,a remake of the lackluster 1934 death takes a holiday this update is a lovely compelling story nicley done and it still wears well after almost 20 years
Jan 10 2017,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time interesting plot great acting musical score and twists watched several times and enjoy each one more
Dec 18 2016,positive,long but enjoyable need to check out broadway restaurant in new york now
Nov 23 2016,positive,definitely one of the best movies ive ever seen it moved me to tears sure there were parts that might have been a bit corny but even those parts were overlooked with the overall message of the film it truly inspired me to want to be a better person like the lead who anthony hopkins portrayed the music and film score was also very moving and touching the entire time while adding to the depth of the film and many times the music felt as though it was perfectly timed with how everything else was proceeding    i would absolutely watch this movie again
Oct 10 2016,negative,there are some good moments with the cast but the film gets weighed down by a three hour run time and never fully investigates the concept of death as a character  there are so many questions and loose ends that could have been further explored and capitalized on
Sep 28 2016,positive,a brilliant idea beautifully embodied with some fine acting and amazing dialogues deep and philosophical on multiple levels this is a movie about family love relationships work characterbuilding and everything in between life and death
Jul 17 2016,negative,a rare case of me agreeing with the critics  this was boring
Jul 11 2016,positive,clair and bradwow the perfect chemical reaction that makes you want to watch over and over  lets not leave out hopkins who gives another one of his magnetizing performance makes this movie an all times treasure
Jul 5 2016,negative,laborious and boring other than that no bad
Jun 27 2016,positive,it had a great cast but i feel the story lacked any relatable quality to the average audience and squandered the chemistry that the young couple displayed in their first meeting early in the picture
Jun 10 2016,positive,its kinda cheesy which isnt my thing but for some reason i just love this movie good acting interesting story line and the music works well to capture the emotion of each scene
Jun 9 2016,negative,the only redeeming thing about the movie is sir anthony hopkins delivering bad lines as best as he can
Apr 17 2016,positive,this is actually a great film even the lengthy run time some how reflects what it is trying to convey
Mar 30 2016,positive,slow but awesome movie big fun  of brad pit great acting my dad really loves it too even do he couldnt understand some english he said his like the old guy in the movie  i told him can you buy me a ferrari 
Feb 14 2016,positive,i mean most of the stars are for brad pitt in his prime as far as the looks department goes as for the movie its okay but it makes some choices that i feel limit the actual impact of the film why make death so clueless the guy spends all of his time watching people and killing them why wouldnt he know phrases or the concept of names or that peanut butter is a thing i guess i can get behind him experiencing stuff for the first time thats the most intriguing part but his feigned cluelessness added nothing to itespecially when that all gets flipped in the end anyhow for the like only plot twist of the film when he takes down the backstabber theres also a couple of scenes that just come across as laughable mostly when the movie pauses for 5 minutes to reiterate stuff to you re them walking away from the diner or just him getting hit by that car in general was fairly hilarious  all in all an interesting concept that wasnt only half executed well
Feb 4 2016,positive,great movie especially with the unique twist
Jan 4 2016,negative,the premise of the movie isnt bad and many of the actors are good in their respective roles but the movie drags its too long and the ending was not satisfactory
Dec 23 2015,positive,one of my favorite movies  still ball my head off after seeing it at least 30 times
Dec 13 2015,neutral,i wanted to like this one and can see the potential in it but the movie is way too long at 3hrs  the premise is decent enough for a fantasy film and hopkins and pitt are both compelling in it but the film gets lost in itself  i wouldnt say its ever really boring but some tighteningup would have made it stronger and more powerful  still may be worth a watch if a fan of either of the lead actors
Nov 29 2015,positive,another of my favorite movies meet joe black can be a bit slow at times but each time i watch it i seem to love it a bit more
Oct 4 2015,positive,long film but in a good way  fine acting and a wonderful story  encourages us all to stand up and be better than ourselves   proof that hollywood can still make a good film
Oct 2 2015,positive,as critics said theres a solid 95minute movie buried somewhere in here   such a nice story with such good actors almost sent to waste because of ridiculously long and useless dialogues especially in the end with 1h less itd have been a much better movie
Sep 28 2015,positive,despite having a wonderful love story and a beautiful performance from both sir anthony hopkins and brad pitt the movie has multiple cliches like that of a spoiled arrogant young businessman a rich benevolent father and so on however i indulge my own subjectivity the movie was a wonderful combination of love and drama making it deeply enjoyable
Aug 18 2015,negative,too long too slow too boring could have been a great 90 minute movie but it went waaaay beyond that i now use it to fall asleep when a bottle of pills wont work
Aug 17 2015,positive,in the same vein as classic projects like the greatest giftits a wonderful life the movie meet joe black seeks to remind audiences of what it means to live a truly happy life    brad pitts performance is perfectly bizarre and eery the highlight of the film    the story in my opinion was fine until the end i also question whether or not the overall message of the movie would more easily sink in if it wasnt wrapped in bill parrishs billionaire lifestyle of supersized mansions and privilege this aspect of his character seems to make the service of the message easier but not more powerful or relatable    overall the film is good albeit oddly lengthy and brad pitts performancecharacter is definitely worth the cost of a movie rental
Jul 29 2015,positive,i usually can not handle long movies but i wish this went on for another 3 hours brilliant
May 19 2015,positive,85  watched this on 19515  meet joe black is one of the most underrated films that i have ever seen most people dislike this film for its run time however martin brest has crafted an explicit movie with a superb story and a classic feel to it with vibrant cinematography and terrific performances from hopkins pitt and claire forlani pitt gives a nuanced performance and even gives close attention to the body language of his characters its got wonderful characters even the supporting characters are well drawn with superb acting all around however the ending is a downer instead of making a good use of its material it ends up being predictable and how you would imagine it to be
Apr 25 2015,positive,wonderful script and wonderful acting  a joy to watch some of the best monologues delivered with intensity and passion by pitt and hopkins
Jan 24 2015,positive,i had forgotten how great this movie was  i love the chemistry that showed between sir anthony hopkins and brad pitt  life and death is so very fragile
Jan 18 2015,negative,sloow  way longer than it needs to be and theres an awful scene
Jan 18 2015,positive,brad pitt porn say no more no wonder the critics hate it
Jan 17 2015,neutral,weird in a bad way  slooow this movie did not need to be 3 hours long and it has a bad scene
Jan 15 2015,negative,if the grim reaper could take the body of a pretty boy and fall in love sounds interesting but is just too silly and dull to watch and get into extremely corny
Jan 13 2015,positive,probably its a little bit too sentimental but still a very touching romantic story and one of the very best of the end of the millenium
Jan 9 2015,positive,not the best from brad pitt but still good enough
Jan 8 2015,positive,movies like this with actors like this grew brad pitt to who he is now
Jan 4 2015,positive,i love this film or at least each time i watch it i get teary eyed i may have enjoyed it more if there was a faster pace but then i have sat through several showings of solaris in the original time frame so i am thoroughly prepared to sit through this entirely again i absolutely fell to the charms of claire forlani and was  held captive throughout in the whole conceptual framework for the film i am not so cynical as some are about this film and keep my naivete on my sleeve not a visceral film for me but cerebral with many personal connections
Nov 19 2014,negative,is weighed down by a tediously slow pace and overwrought production values
Sep 14 2014,positive,one of the best movies underrated its not the beginning or end it matters  its the movie as whole i think the director and the actors have done their best to keep it going as a whole with sentimental humor serious n most important a message about life and death i do agree that susan parish character is bit down as susan always being too sentimental n overacting on her reactions  but as a whole is a wonderful movies   its not the best movie of all time but surely one of the best i have seen  iron man 3 has been rated 81 and meet joe black has been rated 51 in rotten tomatoes  imdb  i m 3  7410 and m j b 71 10  this  is completely insane
Sep 6 2014,positive,another case where critics show their mental incapacity to deal with sentiment this film is lovingly crafted  every frame is beautifully choreographed  the pacing the acting and the script are all superb  the critics who attacked this film need to visit a shrink
Aug 4 2014,positive,my all time favorite movie it exudes raw emotion you can feel the love and passion that this movie offers it gives hope that even the darkest things have a glimmer of light inside of them even death cannot escape humanity it gives a rare look into the human and non human emotion it proves the impossible is possible it will inspire you when all else fells please watch this movie if you need to be moved or need a good cry that offers hope while it is not a sappy love story  it is a film of integrity and friendship loyalty and love the very things we fear the most might just turn out to be the best things in our lives
Jul 16 2014,neutral,the story is good but not striking even so it can be considered as eyebath of brad pitt 
Jul 7 2014,positive,how many time i am going to watch movie today is probably my 8th time
Jun 12 2014,negative,3 words boring  slow
Jun 11 2014,negative,boring never watch it again
May 18 2014,positive,i love this movie brad is perfect in it and anthony hopkins is awesome one of my all time fave movies 
May 2 2014,positive,this is for some reason a highly divisive film but if youre in the half that like it youll love it remarkable performances powerful themes and a well spent 3 hours one of the best movies ive ever seen
Apr 8 2014,negative,despite a handful of fine performances and an intriguing premise meet joe black is an issuefilled venture  for one thing its drastically too long  it has way too much time to work with and very few events to fill in the cracks with  secondly it takes itself too seriously  its one thing to have a promising story  its a totally different thing to portray it as something unforgettable  and unconvincingly  in short the screen talent was exceptional  the script and directing not so much
Apr 4 2014,positive,this is a love storyfantasy movie along the lines of heaven can wait without the comedy element in that movie i thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it several times on directv of particular interest is the performance of claire forlaini which is one of the most nuanced and emotional performances i have ever seen from an actress i think she deserved more recognition at least an academy award nomination i dont get all the criticism
Mar 21 2014,positive,decent performances a stirring soundtrack and a refreshing take on the faustian theme make it an enjoyable criticism of rapacious greed
Mar 5 2014,negative,this movie is terrible and claire forlani cant act to save her life
Feb 28 2014,positive,although a bit too long and slow there is great acting and dialogue which goes well with the original script
Feb 22 2014,positive,nice enough to watch once
Feb 15 2014,positive,super underrated i cant believe it has such terrible reviews amazing heart felt film
Feb 9 2014,positive,great movie id seen it before but had forgotten about it glad i watched it again
Feb 9 2014,neutral,meet joe black is way too long and overly melodramatic but amidst that there is something charming and effective about this movie the final sequences is heartwrenching even if most of the movie lacks emotion meet joe black does have a good performance from brad pitt but everyone else is at most average and even though it is slow it features one of the greatest and most unforgettable deaths in film history
Feb 9 2014,positive,anthony hopkins is amazing and i always cry at the bridge scene
Jan 26 2014,positive,one of my favorite movies
Jan 25 2014,positive,done in such a smart and heartfelt way a true classic
Jan 25 2014,negative,gawd could it get any longer
Jan 22 2014,positive,not bad kinda slow at parts  the dialog between hopkins and pitt kept it interesting imo
Jan 17 2014,negative,cheesy is the right word to describe this movie it is too melodramatic too preachy and too soft for its two manly leads
Jan 15 2014,negative,a random little film starring brad  anthony hopkins nothing really new or thrilling in this story of an angel coming to take an old man with him to heaven still its enjoyable well shot  im sure a lot of girls will like that sort of film
Dec 23 2013,positive,lovely orchestration
Dec 16 2013,neutral,saw this bloated mess in the theater and its slow and rambling
Dec 9 2013,positive,this is the type of supernatural romantic comedy that hollywood did so well in the 1930s  1940s  they would take this plot populate the film with appealing stars and character actors and bring the whole thing in at 90 minutes  in fact hollywood did that with this story  death takes a holiday in 1934  this film has appealing stars and talented character actors  but it is 3 hours long and it makes you feel every minute of it  its what playing a 1 12 hour film at half speed feels like  its correspondingly massively serious and ponderous everywhere it should be light and breezy  its justifiably the first major nail in the coffin for brests career
Nov 3 2013,positive,good story though i didnt like too much pitts performance the carácter that he performs as dead must have been quite different but is aceptable plus anthony hopkins makes an extraordinary paper on this movie
Nov 3 2013,positive,i love this film its one of the few movies that are extremely long but that are worth watching every single minute the cast give powerful performances and brad pitt is hilarious as joe black aka death hes dark but also quite funny as this entity who stars to live and learn the emotions of the real world with human beings amazing
Oct 23 2013,positive,far longer than it needs to be and pretty silly at times but unforgettable and fascinating  theres nothing out there like this film  its a great look into the human mind and how it interacts with its environment as shown in pitts almost childlike portrayal of death  good story fantastic music and atmospherei just love how a lot of the scenes are set up in this film  very unique
Oct 21 2013,positive,found this romantic fantasy to be an excellent moviewhile some scenes may seem drawn out at times you truly get to see the involvement of death played fantastically by pitt learn how to live life and find lovethis is one of the more intense love stories i have seen
Oct 18 2013,positive,the best writing directing and acting
Sep 6 2013,positive,this is my guilty pleasure movie others have dirty dancingthis is mine  any movie who gets me thinking about getting it on with death is a winner in my book
Sep 6 2013,positive,i dismissed it when i was younger  however like a fine wine this movie gets better as i become older and have learned to appreciate it more after many more life experiences
Aug 10 2013,positive,i love this film im not sure why maybe its because its exactly how i imagine death would be if it were a person brad pitt does an excellent job portraying the confusion and all knowingness that death should have im not so sure about the ending but it seemed fitting even if it wasnt what you really wanted to see happen
Aug 9 2013,positive,like it but not sure why maybe its just brad
Aug 1 2013,positive,there are some mighty fine performances on show anthony hopkins is superb as are marcia harden claire forlaini and jeffrey tambor brad pitt looks the part and in some scenes is superb but maybe he didnt quite nail the part the sets are incredible the story line well crafted it is packed full of memorable lines and ends with a spectacular finale one of my favourite movies too long for some too slow for others flawed in places but for me a movie that oozes class
Jul 28 2013,positive,one of the best movies of all time
Jul 20 2013,positive,top notch lots of hidden humor and poignient moments
Jul 12 2013,positive,beautiful movie my wife and i love this one i am surprised it is not a lot better received by critics the film has so much going for it it is hard to know where to begin brad pitt at his absolute best claire forlani is a dream come true one of mr hopkins finest performances the story is stunning  the world of big business meets a mystical fantasy this one is in my top 50 of all time easy
Jul 10 2013,positive,a life lesson must see
Jun 16 2013,negative,god awful  i got about 20 minutes in  the scene in the helicopter where the helicopter doesnt move or shake or make any noise  forlani is a talentless hack  the director should be ashamed of his inability to compose a scene or get anything from the actors  brad pitt phones it in  hopkins goes for the oscar with his heart attack  i then turned it off
Jun 13 2013,positive,exquisitely done  everything from performances to cinematography to lighting to script was beautifully done  some may say the film was too long  i say they werent even watching  the extra time was brilliant in accentuating the finer elements that gave the movie depth and refinement
Jun 2 2013,positive,obviously from the number of pans not for everyone but this fact breaks my heart i could watch it over and over which is a bit of a curse because it is frequently on cable and sucks me in every time i love this film like somewhere in time a film that didnt make it for most people but is just right for me if you are a romantic give it a try with no expectations you might discover something very special p s   kudos to all concerned especially pitt who was unfairly panned and to the composer what a score
Jun 2 2013,positive,the cycle of life on earth hangs in the balance when death becomes emotionally involved in this romantic fantasy seriously i didnt love it but it certainly wasnt that awful interesting idea but meh i think this is one of those movies were the script was better the the actual film
Jun 2 2013,neutral,i can never negotiate the ending of this movieshe falls in love with a temporary soul another entity exteriorshmeksterior different man this is not a happy ending
May 22 2013,positive,well the parts with hopkins and his character are good the rest makes no sense
May 21 2013,positive,fantastic best movie of all time how life should be live and how everyone shod leave earth with a festival of life
May 8 2013,positive,not one person mentioned the real problem i have with this film  how could all of them miss it  the movie was sort of an awkward experience for me my issues with death being what they are and yet the film won me over saying something considering the men in control of the vision of this film      then near the end they dropped the ball by showing joe and the father go up over the rise and then joe comes back only it apparently isnt joe but the guy who died or joe is rewriting how he will be with the young woman      one of the phrases the woman says almost suggests that her dad is already dead and she knows it  a very awkward handling of an unusual premise  perhaps a women director and writer wouldve handled this better    anthony hopkins and claire forlani are the ones who really move me in this film  brad pitt brings what he can to his oddball character and does a decent job ultimately  810
May 5 2013,positive,be ready for a long and slow movie
May 1 2013,positive,an odd premise possibly unintentional comedy but it works anthony hopkins is great as always
Apr 29 2013,neutral,holy shit is this long
Apr 24 2013,positive,absolutely fantastic and fabulous movie worth every minute
Apr 23 2013,positive,meet joe black is a film with great elements that dont quite come together as a whole mostly sublime performances beautiful soundtrack and cinematography are all positives the lengthy running time however at almost three hours ensures that a lot of the emotional dimensions are watered down considerably and the compelling premise is squandered in favour of a number of seemingly pointless and drawn out scenes which do nothing to advance the plot i feel as if this film could have been another titanic had it been handled correctly instead what has been achieved is another indulgent drama which failed to live up to expectations
Apr 6 2013,positive,watching it nowfor the 20th time  great movie
Apr 2 2013,negative,wooohoo hes an alien what the hell ever this movie was retarded and mushy
Mar 31 2013,positive,havent yall noticed that no matter what movie he stars in brad pitts always eating something  hes awesome by the way  d
Mar 30 2013,positive,occasionally stoic from each of the lead actors
Mar 28 2013,positive,every time i watch this movie i end up on this page trying to remember how other people felt about a film that touches on some of the most profound things ive felt in my life is it perfect no nothing is but there is something quite definitely beautiful in its message at least as i see it ive also come to finally realize that movie reviews professional or otherwise often reveal more about the reviewer than the film so if im picking the one i like best ill take chuck rudolphs 2001 review for matinee magazine the latest masterpiece to fall victim to cynicism some people are just uncomfortable being made to actually feel something and they seem to be far more interested in trying to show off how difficult they are to impress its a rather sad existence personally i look to be moved by art i seek out the opportunity for it to happen and if i have to reach a little occasionally in order for it to be possible ive found that it is worth it more often than not there is a lot of emotion in this film and the journey is long but by the end if it can be watched without cynicism i feel like the journey is worth it
Mar 27 2013,positive,one of my all time favorites
Mar 27 2013,positive,this is a movie i enjoy watching multiple times and i still have a crush on susan make that claire forlani maybe thats why
Mar 25 2013,positive,all fathers should see this the last 13 is worth waiting for
Mar 22 2013,positive,peanut butter   mmm
Mar 19 2013,positive,i first became aware of this movie only because of the soundtrack that first contained over the rainbowwhat a wonderful world that was the only way to get the israel kamakawiwoole version during that time since then this movie has been on my watchlist as i am a great fan of sir anthony hopkins did not realize until then that this is a remake of death takes a holiday while also containing the orchestral arrangement of what a wonderful world by louis armstrong in which i was searching for a more stereo version at that time and finding out armstrongs recording was inducted into the grammy hall of fame in 1999 posthumously seeing the critics harsh reviews did not deter me from enjoying this strange but finally glad to see movie movies that make you continue to think after you watch them only satisfies and hopkins genius contributions along with brad pitt and claire forlani only give me even more respect to them as actors the two plus hour version should be the only version to watch to truly understand what hopkins character went through not sure about pitts comparison to his benjamin button persona but you just have to watch his every move and read close caption details to not miss how pitt conveys his characters discoveries this is a surprisingly feel good movie about death that cannot be said of most movies memorable and epic
Mar 19 2013,positive,i love this movie  but is so sad
Mar 18 2013,positive,great movie somewhat boring though but overall pretty interesting
Mar 10 2013,positive,death has a namejoe black
Mar 5 2013,positive,meet joe black is a cute love story
Mar 5 2013,positive,just watched meet joe black okay like the horse whisperer this is one of those movies which i was attracted to watch because of its soundtrack the soundtrack is glorious especially the ending theme that next place thomas newman is great as ever for the movie being a fan of anthony hopkins i will say that this is not the best movie he has acted in but to quote roger ebert theres so much thats fine in this movie and i find this to be true well ill admit the pacing was rather slow using excess time to dwell into moments which are quite unnecessary but overall the film is wellacted and wellproduced with pinches of humour in itsome which were admittedly quite awkward otherwise it is a good film
Feb 24 2013,negative,basically this was just a really long ode to how pretty brad pitt is
Feb 1 2013,negative,movie was oktoo melodramaticsome scenes are memorable

Jan 20 2013,positive,meet joe black is an amazing movie its touching humorous wellacted and engaging during all of the 3 hours i recommend it forget about bad reviews meet joe black is amazing what stands out is its ending and its acting brad and anthony are both amazing i loved ther perforamances and i think they could get at least a decent nom for a golden globe or even an oscar what i didnt like about it was claire forlani who could be replaced by a better actress i mean i dont mind people call her pretty but well shes not so good at act shes really annoying sometimes and that gave this movie an annoying atmosphere at some scenes but well she was a bit acceptable overall meet joe black is an amazing heart warming sometimes quite humorous film and i highly recommend it imagine a movie about death experiencing life and you get meet joe black an extraordinary movie that i loved and it didnt looked like i watched a 3 hour movie cause its superb acting writing storyline and amazing twists distract us we dont get to much of these kinds of films watch it fantastic movie    martin brest directed he did a good job brad pitt is great he was funny and serious i loved the guys performance brad is known from se7en inglorious basterds fight club the curious case of benjamin button moneyball and some other movies anthony hopkins was amaizng i loved his role and his characters feelings he was amazing anthony is known from the silence of the lambs hannibal red dragon and some other movies claire fornali was annoying i can now see why she didnt got so famous she clearily has to try how to act better claire is known from the rock mallrats and some other movies jeffrey tambor was fantastic as well at the two central performances calibre he was amazing i loved his role he was funny and he had a very solid role jeffrey is known from one of my favorite tv shows arrested development he is also known from my 2nd favorite movie the hangover he is also known from my 5th favorite movie the hangover part ii and some other movies sow as you can see this movie has a fantastic cast that brings you great performances fantastic cast    right about to turn 65 william parrish anthony hopkins a powerful and rich man with two lovely daughters is visited by death saying that hell die soon but first death will like to experience life and see how it feels death is know known as joe black brad pitt in a handsome body but during the process deathjoe black falls in love with wills daughter susan claire forlani meet joe black sooner or later everybody doeswhat i thought about the plot i loved the plot it was very interesting it had many interesting characters and it hold an amazing twist for its end some people may find it stupid but i dont at all it has humor and it has heart warming moments i think it was amazingly written and its a great story about life death and the end of those two things but let me tell you something im telling you that the story is awesome but you cant believe how awesome it is you just got to know its amazing ending that i just loved it was pure genius im not saying i didnt like it but drews obsession about john bontecou was starting to piss me off but he had what he deserved great plot    soundtrack well the soundtrack was amazing there was plenty of great themes very well composed that are catchy the production was no more no less than excellent    besides all that i am now going to tell you what i really thought about this movie first of all dont think meet joe black is a c movie or a c movie cause it aint its much more than that its a powerful movie that its not just based on a typical story it has a much bigger depth its superb in almost everything overall meet joe black is an amazing movie it has a fantastic cast fantastic performances a great plot an amazin soundtrack a fantastic production an amazing storyline and even with a 3 hour length it doesnt suffer from bore i hgihly recommend this movie and by the way aside from its acting directing twist ending whatever i loved the two details that they add to this movie 1º i loved how much death loved peanut butter 2º i loved when hopkins character starts to complain and sais a sequence of bad happenings and one of them is my daughter is in love with death pure genius watch it if you havent its worth it meet joe black 8510 fantastic    fantastic movie very recommended movie grade b
Jan 18 2013,negative,i couldnt finish this film its moves very slow and its not very interesting
Jan 13 2013,positive,a solid film that gets a bad rap for being long and a little slow i guess there wasnt enough  explosions and machine guns for folks in a movie about taking an inventory of your life which is what i did while i viewed it so i think it was successful acting was solid and the shooting well done the end does button up  a little too neatly and quickly and there is some lack of satisfaction with that but overall the message was presented well ok they could have gotten there a smidge quicker but is done well enough that i didnt mind at all
Jan 12 2013,positive,forgot what a great movie this is
Jan 12 2013,positive,the movie is undeniably slow yet still somehow very interesting   perhaps it is the oddness of it or the superb cast   death as a fishoutofwater greatly appeals to me  i dont know exactly what it is that makes me like it but i like it
Jan 12 2013,positive,some people will probably dislike me for it but i didnt really enjoy this movie it seems to be a fairytale yet there is no magic its so slow its just boring to follow the story what i did enjoy was acting by anthony hopkins which was simply state of the art
Jan 11 2013,neutral,there were many good things in this movie there were also many unnecessary things in this movie which resulted in it being wayyyyyyy too long however if death really looks like brad pitt i guess thats an ok thing
Jan 11 2013,positive,oh i love brad and his love for peanut butter
Jan 9 2013,positive,my very favorite moviegrim glorious romantic dramatic sensuallove this ride
Jan 8 2013,positive,one of the best movies ever
Jan 7 2013,positive,an interesting concept it could have been executed better but the film at hand is not at all a bad one
Jan 7 2013,negative,very long and got very boring at some points
Jan 6 2013,positive,excellent idea for a moviethought it could have been better but watchable nonetheless
Jan 5 2013,positive,marcia gay harden stole almost every scene she was in she and hopkins saved this movie overall i found it moving and entertaining
Jan 3 2013,positive,one of the great ones
Jan 3 2013,positive,anthony hopkins claire forlani and brad pitt are making some fantastic characters
Jan 1 2013,positive,watching meet joe black for the 20th time excellent movie with lots of angles goes beyond the girlie movie that everyone sees on the surface it is about leadership deception passion finding of ones self there are so many individual scenes that are so in dept i see something new everytime i watch it this movie is sooo deep that it is easily overlooked as one of the greats of all time
Dec 31 2012,positive, a captivating thought provoking film the two main problems  i had with it though is its seemingly experimental pacing which made it seem hard to concentrate on the movie and made it even harder for the actors to really hook you although they did a brilliant job its a matter of directing and producing and i just didnt like its slow sometimes even uneventful flow   also the score was beautiful but didnt really mash up with certain emotional elements that was portrayed in the film at times youd have one instance where they chose a remarkable song to back up an emotion and then another which felt like they just sort of didnt careran out of material   over all a good film and a must see if you have the time
Dec 31 2012,negative,this is an example of what can go wrong with a movie when more that one writer is involved in the project  in this case 8 eight
Dec 18 2012,negative,some where hidden in the 3 hour running time is a decent movie but way too much bloat here
Dec 9 2012,positive,the only knock against this movie is its length  however everything else about it is amazing  superb acting by all three main characters with great direction and beautifully shot
Dec 8 2012,positive,one of my fav i love this movie
Dec 7 2012,positive,romantic sad and the music touches you
Dec 5 2012,positive,a movie that weaves through the storyline lethargically meet joe black is a deliberately slow piece of cinema it works for the most part with good performances by brad pitt and claire fortani but its anthony hopkins that steals the show in a way that is altogether powerful to watch and also interesting while the technical points of the film may leave some feeling bored or confused and rightly so the movie is a drama and to that note the movie shines
Dec 3 2012,negative,it just felt like a waste of time
Dec 2 2012,positive,when this film came out in the cinema i was told it wasnt good and like a fool i believed it and didnt go to watch it years later i watched it and thought it was so good one of brad pitts best performances in my opinion and as per usual anthony hopkins was on form top acting top movie but you got to laugh at how he got run over by 2 cars
Nov 27 2012,positive,i loved it so suck it other people
Nov 23 2012,positive,long movie but i enjoyed it
Nov 20 2012,positive,a long drama about death that doesnt feel long at all brad pitt is utterly compelling as a chauncy gardener type while anthony hopkins is his usual brilliant self in this magical film
Nov 20 2012,neutral,so the main thing that keeps this movie slightly interesting is that death is in it it 3 hours long and slow moving it was just ok
Nov 16 2012,positive,brad pitt and anthony hopkins have awesome chemistry in this movie and hopkins quotes are gratifying and will stick with you long after the movie is over  the suite that the band plays towards the end of the movie is unparalled  one of the greatest movies ive had the pleasure of owning
Nov 12 2012,neutral,it was so slow and weird however i did not hate it up until the ending i would have like it more if it ended after they left
Nov 3 2012,positive,meet joe black is a very long film 172 minutes for a story about death taking human form to learn about life from the opulent managing director anthony hopkins who is literally at deathâtms door after suffering a heart attack in exchange for more time hopkins takes death in the form of bard pitt under his wing and they show each other how to live blar blar blar    itâtms actually a very well presented film with top acting the exception being the ever annoying claire forlani who plays hopkins daughter and deathâtms love interest the pacing is delicate the narrative is slow but never really boring but is way too long for the subject it seems to have been stretched out beyond all reason and does not need to be over 120 minutes if even that    the story has little peril and little in the way of incident just the overriding plotlines about hopkins lifeâtms work being usurped by his number one his desire for his daughter to find love and the his own impending death it is nice gentle and unlikely to offend but itâtms also ponderous at times    but this is the brad pitt complete with his early cheeky charm before oceanâtms eleven ruined him and made him into the selfassured cocky icon joe black along with his role in david fincherâtms se7en stand as proof that he was a great actor before he became the brad pitt of the naughties
Nov 1 2012,positive,meet joe black is one of those rare films that  leaves you breathless and in love with life itself it might fail with the hollywood scene but for those who can read past the script and special effects its a glorious success its a nearspiritual journey that transcends the trivial bigname for something far deeper watch it with an open heart and you will not be disappointed
Oct 30 2012,positive,this is an incredibly slow movie that managed to keep me on the edge of my seat that probably had to do more with my taste becaue i love to explore the capabilities and bells and whistles of love this movie is nothing but that exploration if that sounds interesting watch this
Oct 29 2012,neutral,so sad i cry when anthony hopkins goes to die
Oct 27 2012,negative,brad pitt is incredibly gorgeous in here but this movie is a dud
Oct 19 2012,positive,i have no idea what happens in this movie because i stopped paying attention after brad pitt got hit by that bus but that alone gets 3 stars
Oct 15 2012,neutral,interesting conceptwaaaayyy to long
Oct 14 2012,positive,spooky surreal strange melancholic very few to describe the theme but never loose its edge
Oct 2 2012,negative,i really want  to meet joe black
Oct 1 2012,negative,dreadful what were  brad pitt and tony hopkins doing in this drivel
Sep 27 2012,positive,still my all time favourite
Sep 20 2012,positive,claire forlani is amazing 
Sep 16 2012,positive,was fading in and out of sleep watching this seemed pretty good
Sep 16 2012,positive,interesting story but beautiful
Sep 13 2012,positive,meet joe black was quite calm and spiritual for a brad pitt feature  despite the fact that he got owned by traffic the movie still managed to maintain its peaceful stature while offering up an extraordinary 3 hour movie
Sep 12 2012,positive,anthony hopkins is in my opinion one of the greatest living actors and everthing in this movie was in perfect sync brad pitt is amazing in his role as joe black and the ending is very moving
Sep 5 2012,positive,very interesting movie  i like it a lot though
Aug 31 2012,positive,brad pitts best performance really a touching movie a new look at life and death
Aug 31 2012,negative,long movie hence boring
Aug 24 2012,positive,interestingcould have been an hour shorter tho
Aug 22 2012,positive,what a wonderful yet heartbreaking movie i loved it
Aug 20 2012,neutral,im not too sure about this film
Aug 13 2012,positive,yeah good moviegood storyline
Aug 11 2012,negative,dont bother its awful
Aug 11 2012,positive,absolutely love it this is a warm passionate and hilarious film in the most seductive way with lots of peanut butter 
Aug 11 2012,positive,waaaay too sentimental in places but still a fascinating what if scenario i liked it deals with love loss and some other things and has a couple of plot twists along the way
Aug 11 2012,positive,this is extremely slow however these days there is a fast forward button
Aug 10 2012,negative,worst waste of three hours ever
Aug 9 2012,positive,i have watched this movie three times and could easily watch it again right now  the story builds brilliantly so dont give up in the first 30 minutes if you think it is slow to start  there are quite a few things going on that only come to their conclusion at the end of the movie the three main actors are fabulous in their roles and i highly recommend this movie to everyone
Aug 7 2012,neutral,you know youre in for an improbable three hours when brad pitt plays the angel of death like forest gumpquite tedious considering the talent involved
Aug 5 2012,positive,the movie gets 25 stars but it deserves an extra star for one of the best scores ive ever heard it mixes perfect with the movie and it will draw you to the movie
Aug 3 2012,neutral,despite its ambitious length meet joe black falls short with slow pacing and somewhat weak scripting the set designs i will admit are a welcome delight as are the performances of pitt and hopkins overall an ok movie but one i would only recommend watching if you were truly dedicated to watching it
Jul 30 2012,negative,this is such a boring movie doesnt live upto the excitement it builds up in the beginning with its energy of brilliant starcast but it dies off within 15 minutes and then there is a limbo where the actors continue to act abnormally for the rest of 2 hours and 46 minutes a dead movie this is it gets you nowhere
Jul 29 2012,positive,fantastic writing beautifully haunting music goregous location and wonderful direction
Jul 29 2012,positive,too long but entertaining to say the least the idea alone will keep you watching
Jul 26 2012,negative,this movies has everything going for it a good script and a fantastic cast but the director muddled everything when he didnt edit the darn thing down to a normallength movie instead he had to drag out scenes that were already understood to be emotional fifteen minutes before they began and twenty minutes later only seem cheesy plus he had to smear his peanutbuttery violin music all over moments that could be been very dark and deep i dont understand his choice in pacing or music and i think this movie was laughable towards the end because of it
Jul 26 2012,positive,i gotta admit i was kinda sketchy about this movie when i first heard of this movie and when my freind recommended it but was blown away when i did see it
Jul 23 2012,positive,a wonderful movie different but in a good way
Jul 21 2012,positive,if not for susan a well interpreted character that redeemed the tragic flaws in the plot direction
Jul 21 2012,positive,ok its a bit longer than it should be still i always enjoy the surreal atmosphere of death walking among humans and affecting their lives
Jul 20 2012,positive,if i were stuck on a deserted island with only one movie for the rest of my life i would choose meet joe black 
Jul 17 2012,positive,didnt really grab me
Jul 8 2012,positive,could use a little trimming but all in all a great movie and a moving story
Jul 5 2012,positive,a charming cheesy movie that drags on forever but pitt and hopkins save the movie with amazing performances
Jul 5 2012,negative,just watched it for the first time slow as hell
Jul 4 2012,positive,didnt thnk i would like this  but the relationships between father and daughters fascinates me  i relate to the less favored daughter  her speech to her dad where she admits she was never his favorite but realized she never lacked for ay good thing  really touched me  the movie makes you think about the brevity of life and making the most of our time on earth
Jul 2 2012,positive,saw this movie at the theater 1998 guam and though the portrayal of characters was good script seemed a little too slow there were times i slept in the middle of the movie but still was able to understand the movie at the end overall its good
Jun 27 2012,positive,a very deep drama not to be missed  a remake but a good one for a change
Jun 20 2012,positive,claire forlani at her very best while hopkins and pitt are their usual phenomenal selves
Jun 18 2012,neutral,the hospital scene is pointless
Jun 17 2012,negative,oh my wow three hours to tell me that lust is not love and attraction is not love  ok theres no reason why death should know that i guess we all have to learn that just like susan but three hours     watching it was a lot like watching boxing helena it just dragged on and on taking forever to get to the inevitable end     i gave it half a star for the scenes in the hospital with the caribbean lady and half a star for the look on pitts face during the sex scene
Jun 16 2012,positive,death takes a holiday done modern style
Jun 14 2012,positive,anthony hopkins and brad pitt
Jun 11 2012,positive,3 hour movie that couldve been condensed into 2 but had some nice moments
Jun 10 2012,positive,i love brad pitt in this movie
Jun 5 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies love claire forlaini
Jun 2 2012,positive,an excellent movie that needed to be an hour shorter
Jun 1 2012,positive,another one i am going agree with audience poll here great movie enjoyed the performance from anthony hopkin brad was like a lost boy in some scenes but some people will call it getting into the character may be he really lost his way in between what can i say about claire forlani hmm agreed that i have a crush on her but i am the first to admit that her acting was not greatat times i was confused whether she was happy or sad its the truthgood concept and nice tidy ending good movie to cuddle up with your girlfriendpartnerwife not all at once lol
May 28 2012,negative,worth watching the start to see pitt get hit by not one but two cars
May 26 2012,positive,cheesy i know but still a great movie
May 23 2012,positive,about the angel  of death who strikes a dying millionaire in martins breats  box office miisfire
May 22 2012,positive,rare does a film come along that slips over you like a warm sweater and makes you embrace your own mortality thus is the accomplishment of the remake of death takes a holiday meet joe black   with its superb casting of sir anthony hopkins  brad pitt this film is given the dramatic gravitas that clearly could have been made laughable if in the hands of lesser  thespians and director   is this brad pitts finest acting hour no i feel comfortable saying that his role as tyler durdan was easily his greatest performance to date his role as joe death black brought him from pretty face to dramatic actor he shares the screen with the mighty sir anthony hopkins no easy feat and if legends of the fall was any clue these two guys work best together   from its heartwrenching score to the way it was superbly shot there is little the running time could have been trimmed to say negatively about this fantastic film  highest reccommendation
May 21 2012,positive,this movie really makes no sense but i still enjoy it a lot by the grace of the willowy and wounded claire forlani  death has been around since the beginning of time just ballparking it so how is he still so ignorant about friendship passion sex success greed revenge  the ways of the world essentially including colloquialisms about death and taxes  one would think hed have a human dalliance every decade at least  the character is written to be a wideeyed simpleton and they had to pick the actor with the worst face and voice for that  brad pitt  hes so deadeyed and dumbsounding
May 19 2012,positive,meet joe black had so much potential to create a titanic connection with the viewerseven affecting the deepest corners of their hearts but the film refuses to   make a good one however the endearing quotes the interesting premise and the unusual performance of pitt  saved it from the grave of nothingness
May 8 2012,positive,a little on the long side but an otherwise enjoyable movie thats wellacted touching and even funny at moments
May 7 2012,positive,meet joe black is an amazing movie its touching humorous wellacted and engaging during all of the 3 hours i recommend it forget about bad reviews meet joe black is amazing what stands out is its ending and its acting brad and anthony are both amazing i loved ther perforamances and i think they could get at least a decent nom for a golden globe or even an oscar what i didnt like about it was claire forlani who could be replaced by a better actress i mean i dont mind people call her pretty but well shes not so good at act shes really annoying sometimes and that gave this movie an annoying atmosphere at some scenes but well she was a bit acceptable overall meet joe black is an amazing heart warming sometimes quite humorous film and i highly recommend it imagine a movie about death experiencing life and you get meet joe black an extraordinary movie that i loved and it didnt looked like i watched a 3 hour movie cause its superb acting writing storyline and amazing twists distract us we dont get to much of these kinds of films watch it fantastic movie    martin brest directed he did a good job brad pitt is great he was funny and serious i loved the guys performance brad is known from se7en inglorious basterds fight club the curious case of benjamin button moneyball and some other movies anthony hopkins was amaizng i loved his role and his characters feelings he was amazing anthony is known from the silence of the lambs hannibal red dragon and some other movies claire fornali was annoying i can now see why she didnt got so famous she clearily has to try how to act better claire is known from the rock mallrats and some other movies jeffrey tambor was fantastic as well at the two central performances calibre he was amazing i loved his role he was funny and he had a very solid role jeffrey is known from one of my favorite tv shows arrested development he is also known from my 2nd favorite movie the hangover he is also known from my 5th favorite movie the hangover part ii and some other movies sow as you can see this movie has a fantastic cast that brings you great performances fantastic cast    right about to turn 65 william parrish anthony hopkins a powerful and rich man with two lovely daughters is visited by death saying that hell die soon but first death will like to experience life and see how it feels death is know known as joe black brad pitt in a handsome body but during the process deathjoe black falls in love with wills daughter susan claire forlani meet joe black sooner or later everybody doeswhat i thought about the plot i loved the plot it was very interesting it had many interesting characters and it hold an amazing twist for its end some people may find it stupid but i dont at all it has humor and it has heart warming moments i think it was amazingly written and its a great story about life death and the end of those two things but let me tell you something im telling you that the story is awesome but you cant believe how awesome it is you just got to know its amazing ending that i just loved it was pure genius im not saying i didnt like it but drews obsession about john bontecou was starting to piss me off but he had what he deserved great plot    soundtrack well the soundtrack was amazing there was plenty of great themes very well composed that are catchy the production was no more no less than excellent    besides all that i am now going to tell you what i really thought about this movie first of all dont think meet joe black is a c movie or a c movie cause it aint its much more than that its a powerful movie that its not just based on a typical story it has a much bigger depth its superb in almost everything overall meet joe black is an amazing movie it has a fantastic cast fantastic performances a great plot an amazin soundtrack a fantastic production an amazing storyline and even with a 3 hour length it doesnt suffer from bore i hgihly recommend this movie and by the way aside from its acting directing twist ending whatever i loved the two details that they add to this movie 1º i loved how much death loved peanut butter 2º i loved when hopkins character starts to complain and sais a sequence of bad happenings and one of them is my daughter is in love with death pure genius watch it if you havent its worth it meet joe black 8510 fantastic    fantastic movie very recommended movie grade b

Apr 18 2012,positive,okay movie  what i really love about this film is brad pitt  could he be any hotter in this film  no dont think so
Apr 18 2012,positive,should you choose to test my resolve in this matter you will be facing a finality beyond your comprehension and you will not be counting days or months or years but milleniums in a place with no doors
Apr 18 2012,negative,absolutely slow and horrible it makes  a 3 hour movie seem like 5 theres an average 90 minute movie in there somewhere
Apr 17 2012,positive,a remake that was very well done
Apr 11 2012,positive,hes expecting you          a romantic epic of pure heart and flawless originality  a sweeping and utterly vast story about the human condition morality mortality and of course the furious power of love  a science fictionfantasy film that will sweep you off your feet and catch you off guard  director martin brest scent of a woman midnight run is back in the directors chair and he crafts a powerful and visually lavish film thata eye popping and enthrallingly engaging  at 3 hours long meet joe black manages to never be overly sappy and monotoned it delivered everything id hoped it would  the concept of the film alone was enough to amaze me and keep me glued to the tv screen for the entire there hour runtime  im not the biggest fan of romantic films but this one is different the tone and the atmosphere of the film is just gorgeous  the cinematography alone is something to marvel at the lavish sets and costume designs are great and the originality that the entire project had was just absolutely absorbing  unparalleled in beauty and unmatched in originality meet joe black is one of martin brests best films since scent of a woman  a dark and subtle film about death and love that has a whirlwind of morals and lessons martin brest and company really get their point across with this one  derived from a 1930s play meet joe black was adapted to the big screen in a flawless and stunning fashion  its a story within a story thats wrapped in another story but its not at all confusing its told straight up and out to avoid any confusion  the plot of the film is spectacular and the story is wonderous  the ending sequence is one of the most beautiful and lavage scenes that ive ever seen no joke  a truly remarkable and beautiful film thats touching and inspiring        anthony hopkins and brad pitt star alongside each other for the first time since the equally beautiful legends of the fall and both roar across the screen in a thunderous fashion letting loose spectacular performances  marcia gay harden is beautiful as well as supremely talented
Apr 10 2012,positive,i loved this movie i thought it was very different and it was so cool and i thought it was cool that death had a personality in the movie i definitely give this movie a thumbs up haha

Mar 4 2012,positive,death falls in love the movie starring brad pitt its quite a premise that much is for sure and minus some dragged out scenesalmost a 3hour running time its actually good stuff claire forlani is mega beautiful here and pitt was a cool cat the one thing that really bugged me was the tacked on ending but other than that its good
Mar 1 2012,positive,this film is fantastic  brings a tear to the eye
Feb 17 2012,positive,meet joe black has a caught a lot of grief since its release in 1998  i believe that its cryptic storyline  subtle acting have been truly  undervalued in its time

Jan 22 2012,neutral,way too long of a movie to enjoyget it over with already
Jan 16 2012,negative,anyone else feel that this 3 hour movie could have been less than two and told the same story  two excellent actors brad pitt and anthony hopkins are stuck in a drawn out tearjerker  at points this movie attempts to be so ponderous about the nature of death life and love that the pace is tepid  thats too bad because the idea is interesting and there are a few good scenes and a magnificient score  i absolutely hated the very end but the events leading up to the final conclusion are well done
Jan 9 2012,positive,an interesting role for brad pitt anthony hopkins wasnt at his best but i still thoroughly enjoyed it
Jan 8 2012,positive,a love story to die for
Jan 8 2012,positive,one of my favourite films ever

Dec 1 2011,positive,brilliant premise great script believable characters great acting claire forlani
Nov 19 2011,positive,5 stars this utterly brilliant movie gets under my skin and stays there saw it first on dvd but just watched it on bluray and it sealed the deal for the 5 stars wonderful performances from sir hopkins claire forlani and brad pitt great script and the use of arvo pärts powerful composition fratres heard in the opening scenes made some serious chills run down my spine gets to me every time masterful
Nov 11 2011,positive,amazing movie all around story acting execution and my god the soundtrack is nothing short of heavenly
Nov 1 2011,positive,i hadnt really expected to like this so i was surprised to find that i enjoyed this movie i didnt like how slow the entire story moved and the romance was only sorta developed though i guess theres lots of symbolism and subtle deep emotion in there somewhere  but there is something about this movie other than watching brad pitt being gorgeous that makes this movie compelling i really enjoyed anthony hopkinss performance but overall thought it was draggy
Oct 28 2011,positive,peanut butter scene with brad pitt only reason to watch
Oct 21 2011,positive,it was an interesting movie i saw this movie when i was 10 years old and didnt really get what this movie was about but seeing it after more than 10 years has definitely helped me to get it  i loved the ending
Oct 17 2011,negative,the only good part is the kick ass scene where brad pit gets hit by like 3 or 4 cars whilst in midairso one star for that
Oct 8 2011,positive,most underrated movie of all times
Oct 4 2011,positive,good drama with good acting and slower pacing
Sep 25 2011,negative,unfinished cant bear the slow plot but perhaps one day ill watch again
Sep 24 2011,negative,i havent seen a movie that is so dependent upon death  what we got here is a monotonous overlongtrite
Sep 23 2011,positive,i really liked this movie my only complaint is its a little too long but overall an excellent film
Sep 22 2011,positive,this is not a great movie  you could cite a dozen flaws and i would probably agree with all of them  but i just loved this movie  its long yet i was never bored  pitts performance as death is uneven sometimes missing the mark but sometimes brilliantly hitting it  hopkins does a fine job and  claire forlani is enchantingly wonderful as hopkins daughter and pitts love interest
Sep 20 2011,positive,a good understated performance by brad pitt and anthony hopkins is as usual excellent  good supporting performances by the rest of the cast  a nice film on the theme of love and death
Sep 19 2011,positive,this is a really good movie i loved it
Sep 18 2011,positive,wow this was a highly ambitious movie but i think they pulled it off  the big names were great and all but for me claire forlani was the star of the show  the only reason i didnt give a 5 was because it was reeaallly long  it doesnt feel it though well maybe only the last scenes lots of swelling orchestra music  the production is beautiful and lighting is excellent  i originally started with 45 but i took an extra 5 because of the second ending they blew it someone just couldnt let the thing be  like what happened with ai  my advise is when you see the 2 men watch the fireworks and the movie seems like its ending turn it off  i feel like i want to take off another star but it was still good for the 130 mins    some interesting bits you can tell that the same reason brad pitt was picked for this is the same reason he was cast for benjamin buttons    also if you dont have a great big house with a fancy pool and wads of cash to throw a great big party youll really wish you did    if you do have the above youll definitely feel like redecorating that pool    the main characterss initals are bp could it be some attempt to instill a feel good factor    also the same character is very rupert murdockesque but with that strong im so good and honourable vibe same question as above    mere possible conspiracy theories of course    another bigup to twickenham girl forlani the romance her character is inolved in is developed brilliantly but she makes is special believable and just very sweet
Sep 12 2011,positive,unbelievable i cried my ass out
Sep 12 2011,positive,this movie was a bit different
Sep 10 2011,negative,the most boring movie i have ever seen  it starts it runs a long time during which nothing happens and then it mercifully ends
Sep 5 2011,positive,a delightfully touching and humorous film that also maintains a good balance of compelling drama and wonderful performances
Sep 3 2011,positive,the slow deliberate pace is at first effective but then wears out its welcome during the final act a good film but not a great one
Sep 3 2011,negative,death stepped out of lifestyle magazine from women    heavily stylised romantic lady literature suitable for emotionally unstable people teens and elderly ladies
Aug 19 2011,positive,love this movie seen it when i was young and i have seen it recently in my older years this movie hits all the points of life i recommend it for any one
Aug 19 2011,negative,an overindulgent fantasy thats a steaming pile of bullshit hell even for a chick flick this is terrible  on the eve of his 65th birthday a businessman is confronted by death they make a deal businessman lives as long as death understands the world death takes the body of brad pitt gets addicted to peanut butter lives amongst the rich and falls in love meanwhile unnecessary subplots take up a huge chunk of the plot as they have to do with a business merger a birthday party and a relationship  seriously this movie is a pretentious little well you get the idea a story that easily couldve been told in half its runtime has 3 hours padded on with stupid moments those subplots laughable scenes brad pitts death was hilarious and other stuff by the last hour sanity starts to slip as the last remnants of patience dissipate brad pitt is too cold to identify with or acts like hes an alien whatever justifies best but at least hes trying the supporting cast is so onedimensional by the way any hope for a thoughtful commentary on the bright side of death is replaced by corny dialogue forced chemistry really shows during that painfultowatch sex scene doesnt help that its boring drawnout emotionally manipulative senselessly directed and highly implausible  the only reasons why im not going to beat this martin brest person are because 1 anthony hopkins is really good and again brad pitt does show some effort 2 the scenery of course is lush inside and outside day and night 3 its a little effective but not very much after all i already sucker punched him with my two cents on gigli insert dramatic music  for the record i hated this movie no doubt that it has the worst of both genres its an ambitious failure yet somehow its managed to find a fanbase and its not because of that star wars trailer
Aug 18 2011,positive,beautiful and heart warming classic
Aug 8 2011,positive,death and taxes  nicely written
Aug 7 2011,positive,in my opinion the movie is way to long  i just couldnt stay interested
Jul 30 2011,neutral,i i were just judging its beautiful score it would be a ten if i had a brain about a 510
Jul 30 2011,positive,i want it to be better than it is mostly due to the cast  kudos to the automotive doubletap though
Jul 26 2011,negative,this film should be filmed under  bad films boring coma inducing claire forlani is very pretty but this film still send me to sleep this film will test the sternest bouts of insomnia
Jul 25 2011,positive,brad at his sexiest
Jul 24 2011,neutral,the idea of the angel of death wanting to be a human to see what its like may sound unusual but wanting to be brad pitt is not new
Jul 23 2011,negative,and only half a star because it wouldnt let me enter 0
Jul 20 2011,positive,absolutely fantastic and fabulous movie worth every minute
Jul 13 2011,negative,i would have given this film mode credit if it would have been 1 hour shorter
Jul 7 2011,positive,brad pit was awesome
Jul 6 2011,positive,although too ambitious at times meet joe black delivered what it promises an original story and lovable movie played magnificently by anthony hopkins and brad pitt i believe that meet joe black was not meant to be released in 1998 even though the movie leaves few plot holes and at times doesnt match up to logic explanation the main elements of the movie are still beautifully presented and at times undeniably heartwrenching i especially loved the lightning strike scene and the finale scene the most  i suggest you guys to give it a second viewing    ps where the hell is martin brest if we can pay to watch russell brand and sascha baron cohen in a movie we have to forgive this poor fellow as well he directed gigli    7810
Jul 2 2011,negative,a pseudo existential film that ends up being syrupy loveydovey schmaltz
Jun 21 2011,positive,one of the coolest premises in history death decides learn what it means to live a kind man guides him as he prepares to leave his life behind a story about great characters that uses the ability of two great actors and the power of its scirpt to be touching in a beatiful with honesty wearing the mask of wisdom   ps brad pitts performance showed me how good a performance can be this one is so good its hard to believe first performance that showed me how amazing a great performance can be one that joins the other 3 gretest performances of alltime heath ledger in the dark knight marlon brando in a streetcar named desire  johnny depp in pirates of the caribbeanfinding neverland
Jun 14 2011,positive,one of my favorite movies    love every character and the story  the critics are sniffing glue
May 29 2011,positive,ohlets all make love braod daylight in front of an open window for everyone to seehow romanticnot that was the only scene that made me mad other then that it wasnt that bad it was the years when brad pitt was at the height of his career
May 28 2011,positive,not as poignant on rewatching it a second time many years later still entertaining no doubt just that it spent too much time on the melodrama while glossing over some details that would have made it feel more realistic
May 28 2011,positive,one of the best of all time its like reading a book i love this movie
May 13 2011,positive,incredibly slow rhythm indulging on unimportant details all the time
May 11 2011,positive,if you cant get over movie length dont watch the film it is long but never meanders solid acting and an interesting take on coming to grips with mortality
May 9 2011,positive,if you can watch the coffee shop scene and not crack a smile you have no heart
May 8 2011,positive,just very touching in nature
May 6 2011,positive,proof that brad pitt can act and anthony hopkins can do more than hannibal still kinda middle of the road stuff though a romance movie a guy can sit though i suppose
Apr 30 2011,negative,eh i was a little bored
Apr 25 2011,negative,interesting concept that probably could have been communicated in a shorter time frame    length aside the film has other issues it consistently drags and becomes a cinematic mudslide where you no longer know where you are what you have viewed what it means or where it is going this is not because the film does not make sense but because it cannot consistently hold the viewers attention for the timeframe required scene by scene       it was also a massive mistake casting brad pitt in the role of joe black as the character is creepy haunting and although he played it well it just doesnt suit him    the whole undertone of the film is morbid and although the concept is very original and quite clever  the lack of editing and the films obscene length really let it down     recommendations    watch it if you liked watch it if you like brad pitt as a diehard fan will see beyond the flat production quality which i am sure was brests intention      dont watch it if you need a lot of action    could children be in the room there isnt really anything to expose them to
Apr 20 2011,positive,interesting premise and claire forlani is probably the most beautiful woman alive  the last scene called walkaway is very moving
Apr 20 2011,positive,cause the truth is honey theres no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love well you havent lived a life at all but you have to try cause if you havent tried you havent lived
Apr 14 2011,positive,havent seen all of it yet but seen it in bits
Apr 6 2011,positive,there is a good and a bad about this film it has rich values inspiration and has some great performances by pitt and hopkins the unfortunate is that this wonderful film had been stretched out so far that it looses its value and becomes very slow and bland a good film could have been great if it were condensed into 2 hours
Apr 3 2011,positive,good movie interesting story to how death sees and learns how to live and to feel the emotion of love   anthony hopkins had a very good performance and gave its character the deep and charismatic needed brad pitt was a cutie back then really i never though id seen a death so good looking  the movie was long but again if they had made it shorter it wouldnt make any sense at all so its ok not a complete waste of 3 hours the end of the movie was good but predictable    nice touch with the somewhere over the rainbow song in the final credits
Mar 31 2011,positive,this film takes loving death to a new level
Mar 28 2011,positive,a great film with charming performances
Mar 26 2011,positive,brad pitt shines in this unforgettable movie about death  brad and anthony make an brillant team in this eye opening film  towards the end you realize what really matters in life
Mar 21 2011,positive,all i could think through this film was poor marcia gays character i didnt dislike this film but hitting on the 3 hour mark made me really struggle to enjoy it and whilst most women would blabber their eyes out it failed to captivate me in that way but its not all bad brad and anthony do deliver good performances  march 25 2010
Mar 15 2011,positive,it was ok but expected better i do not want it on dvd it was an ok movie but expected better it starred brad pitt and anthony hopkins it was an ok film but thought it would be better
Mar 15 2011,negative,boring and unlogical     on one handthe death seems to be watching peoples life every day on the other hand when he arrived at bills house he looked like a child and didnt know anything this is very unlogical    and the pace of this film is too slow boring
Mar 14 2011,positive,a media mogul acts as a guide to death who takes the form of a young man to learn about life on earth and in the process fall in love with his guides daughter
Mar 13 2011,positive,it was a good story film tender and touchy in some sense loved the performance of anthony hopkins
Mar 13 2011,negative,boring unconvincing and pitts acting was the pitts    a shame that anthony hopkins talent was wasted on it
Mar 11 2011,positive,love this movie it can be a bit slow paced at times but i still like the story and how it plays out
Mar 10 2011,positive,i have always enjoyed this movie and its not slow it arrives precisely  when it means to
Mar 6 2011,positive,superb film it has everything very clever great lines excellent business twists beautifully acted with humour and romantic intensity will always be one of our favourites
Mar 6 2011,positive,i can never decide if brad pitts acting is appalling in this or if he plays the character pretty well   whatever it is he is unbelievably gorgeous in it and claire forlani sweet and the love interest    a fun film for us girls to go back to once in a while
Mar 5 2011,negative,only thing i can recall about this movie is bred getting hit by two cars while his crossing a road
Mar 3 2011,positive,whoever gave meet joe black a 50 rating does not have a romantic bone in their body  this is one of clairs best movies
Mar 2 2011,neutral,this was a good movie for bradmostly emotionless and dullall he had to do was look good for the ladiesanother rainy day movie
Feb 27 2011,positive,a very interesting film that i found to be really cool however not as great as i had expected it was very long an got stupid at times
Feb 21 2011,negative,boring  more than that irritating  brad pitts portrayal as death made me stop watching  he takes the naivetothepointofstupid routine to extreme lengths      plus while it appears on the surface like some sort of existential mindtrip it is just an elaborate setup for a commonorgarden romantic drama  so nothing new or exciting here    these and the extreme length of the movie 3 hours make it one to avoid
Feb 18 2011,positive,brad pitt and anthony hopkins were superb 
Feb 15 2011,positive,brad pitt several cars  ha
Feb 11 2011,positive,the death is goodlooking
Feb 5 2011,positive,i love love love this movie claire is such a beautiful actress and she plays her role so well one of my favorite movies from both brad and anthony perfect movie making 
Jan 25 2011,positive,theres brad pitts excellent job at potraying the two personalities a solid final act and a fair deal of other effective high points though not enough to distract from the biggest standout the inappropriate lenghtiness editing is looser than the teeth of a white trash boxer a deal of sequences go on and on and some are easy candidates for the cutting room floor if thats not enough the predominant culprit to this dragging is not just conversation but more so pausing still i exaggerate as its not too agonising of a chore to sit through but more along the lines of a bit of a nuisance really the more sighworthy flaws are unbelievable behavior ie the constantpausing occasioanal bad writing and some other cornyness such as my dreaded petpeeve the fishoutofwater humor seriously even death an eternal overseer of humanity doesnt know how to behave around certain people its a concept more horrifying than well death himself well he seems to be an ignorant buffoon so i dont know how scary he could be well this reviews going on almost as long as this movie so i suppose ill end by saying its a decent watch but mostly if youve either a lot of time to kill or are lucky enough to find that 129 minute cut thank goodness for alan smithee
Jan 22 2011,positive,quite entertaining and a bit deep but the music was comical and pitt didnt make such a big impression it felt like the makers had thought that this was a much greater movie than it turned out to be with the excessive dramatic music and that its 3 h long everything the cast did seemed to be in slowmotion they couldve easily cut out at least an hour and it would stillve been a decent movie  quite inventive story though
Jan 20 2011,positive,this is one of those love it or hate it films in many circles it is an epic drama with pitt and hopkins baring their souls for such an unusual story it has a rich classic feel that i appreciate and it takes time to divulge itself perhaps a bit too long for some claire forelani falls in love with a man who soon becomes death in the flesh hopkins expertly plays her father making a deal for more time while showing death all the sights the world has to offer death is cold and determined and yet displays some almost childlike responses to what he finds life has to offer a man  the cinematography classy feel to the picture and rich human emotions are worth every second these features along with hopkins performance and a great musical score were unfortunately overlooked for the most part when released in theaters it is a delicate balance between two worlds of here and hereafter then it takes on the fears we have about life and love and embraces them all at once it is a rare visionary tale and the fact that martin brest takes on such a challenging project is both commendable and fulfillinga
Jan 16 2011,neutral,its a drag the scenes with brad pitt and claire forlani are dull and emotionless but i could be wrong and brad pitts wooden acting might be his interpretation of death forlani on the other hand is annoying her acting seems to rely on eye movements alone for dramatic effect the length of the movie is painfully long considering the fact that im watching people looking at other people in an odd way the dialogue doesnt help at all anthony hopkins for me waslets just say great acting would mean hannibal lecter    i hope someone does a remake of the original story though a very good concept wasted
Jan 15 2011,negative,this is one of the most mind numbingly slow cheesy ass movies i have ever regretted seeing most ofcause claire forlani is beautiful and anthony hopkins is a good actorpitt acts like tom hanks in big oh and its 3 hours long 3 hours
Jan 12 2011,negative,like the critics said slow moving
Jan 9 2011,positive,watched this movie tonight for the first time awesome the music the story the acting all amazing
Jan 8 2011,positive,a bizzare story done with a great cast like this was great even though you know in the back of your mind it can only end one way you always hope for the best
Jan 5 2011,positive,amazing love story ranking with wuthering heights and the ghost and mrs muir    as the movie line goes  love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with
Jan 4 2011,positive,a little long but i liked it 
Dec 30 2010,positive,quite long for such a plain premise but its still a beautiful movie
Dec 28 2010,positive,contains the most beautiful sexual sceen but is also a great story
Dec 27 2010,positive,pitt and hopkins make this movie above the usual soap  which at times it threatens to be forlani is also quite captivating i enjoyed the premise  which was very amusing at times and thought pitt played the humor very well hopkins wasnt maudlin and i found the movie to be without a spiritual in your face which it also could have beenthe one sex scene was a little long  almost voyeuristic  and yet i keep returning to the premise and find myself  rather impressed with the work pitt did with his character i really enjoyed this film  didnt see it until now  and regret that i missed it glad i saw it on hbo
Dec 27 2010,positive,personal favorite of mine
Dec 27 2010,positive,a very slow movie but worth it if it can keep your attention
Dec 24 2010,negative,too long and predictable thus i found it pretty boring
Dec 21 2010,positive,brad pitt as death and anthony hopkins as his target theres more but isnt that enough
Dec 21 2010,negative,who doesnt love that infamous death scene lol
Dec 17 2010,positive,ahh where to start  ive only just watched this film in its entirety dec 2010 and im not ashamed to say that i loved it  ok i hear its 3 hours long but would you believe me if i say i didnt feel it      for me the theme of death inhabiting a borrowed body to take a holiday sounds interesting to say the least  and thats how i found it more to the point i found myself trying to relate to death to becoming well atleast behaving as a human being  as i expected death wasnt prepared for human life or rather the emotions and feelings that living brings  i enjoyed the childish and seemingly innocent narrative that joe bought to the film and watching him slowly feel what we feel in every day life    i suppose thats where for some it became a bit of a drag being 3 hours  for me i was especially chuffed to have anthony hopkins as semi lead i find him a comfort to watch  claire forlani was ok as the female lead im not sure why but i found her facial expression quite annoying almost as if she was trying to smize throughout  but for the most it was the story of william parrish having to come to terms with the fact that death had decided to visit his self and stay for a duration and during that duration realising that he only had the time that death gave him     the love story bewteen joe and susan was very sweet watching joe experiencing the emtions of love and pain was what i wanted to see growing to human nature  the ending i thought was wonderful more so the scene where joe and william walk over the bridge of steps was akin to the stairway to heaven or so i saw it  buti just couldnt get over the final where the original joe is back  shed come to love well death and here was the guy she met oncewould it work  the mind boggles    anyway i loved it and this is my first review probably including a tonne of spelling mistakes and not making much sense but there we gowe all have to start somewhere 
Dec 13 2010,positive,brad pitt plays such an intriguing character great
Dec 8 2010,positive,best first 20 minutes ever everything else was blegh
Dec 8 2010,neutral,wednesday december 8 2010    1998 meet joe black  drama      the story has brad pitt as joe black a person coming out of nowhere with its mission in which the audience would eventually would find out about as theyre watching this this all comes to a stand still when joe black falls in love  basically a remake of another film made in 1934 called death takes a holiday    the movie seems to drag with its more than two hours running time of 178 minutes  the chemistry with anthony hopkins and brad pitt can sometimes be interesting but the interaction with the love interest with claire forlani as susan parrish was unbelievably absurd and pointless     2 out of 4
Dec 3 2010,positive,its a very serious movie you have to have the stamina to stand long drawn out plots but brad pitt plays a great character
Dec 2 2010,neutral,its not the greatest movie ever madebut if you have nothing to doitll be worth watching
Nov 30 2010,positive,god its long and slow  its as if the writer just couldnt edit anything and tried to tell everything in one film  he tries to make death a sympathetic caracter make a rich white english millionaire someone we root for to find redemption tell a very akward love story and yet there is still something very epic to this very human story  it does give you the time to think about its themes while you watch it  its as if your life gets to slow down as you watch it  quite the trick but it takes a while to get you until then god its long and slow
Nov 29 2010,positive,high recommendation one of my childhoods favorites
Nov 27 2010,negative,in movies there is always a story that at its core wants to teach us or move us well the message of this movie is lost somewhere in the stagnant pacing the message that i got is that when i am old and ready to die death will come as a good looking guy and want to start a relationship with my daughterthat is wrong on so many levels    i mean it truly isnt a terrible movie and an overall theme about life and death and our last minutes is a touching idea but never seemed to reach that point of being touching to me particularly the ending with death giving back the body he barrowed to be on earth in the first place is like they want us to believe this anyway i digres it feels like most romance movies big budget and good acting but a really slow moving plot
Nov 27 2010,positive,this movie is void of special effects and loud bangs but does offer a really emotional warmhearted look at the full life of a successful businessman and the spurs of his family and friends it does feature fireworks though an idea that may have been done before or similar but this movie is so glossy in the way it does it brad pitt holds his nerve and tongue throughout preserving his mysterious identity while bill allows him to spend the last of his own time with him long running time lots of tears and emotions from both sexes and a beautiful soundtrack score one of my favourites of course
Nov 25 2010,positive,not bad claire forlani is a huge plus
Nov 19 2010,positive,could have been so much more too bad they made it such an ordinary movie like we all already know  the subject is quite unique but the ending isnt really the way it should have been i think dead walks in in a mans life and got to play a new role very interesting  i like the acting very much cause thats great  the beginning was absolutely lovely and the scenes at the party are so touching heartwarming and heartrending both but all in between it takes too much time  the chemistry between claire forlani man shes such a gorgeous woman and brad pitt was very visible    some scenes are really special were i got a lump in my throat im sure this movie will be on my mind but on the other hand it has lots of miserable uninteresting scenes taking too much time as well and that fucks the movie up such a pity    ps nice music and quotes in this movie  i have to say that you cannot unscramble scrambled eggs hmm so true very wise
Nov 18 2010,positive,a strange but immensely likable dramaromance with a very slight touch of dark humour very well acted and an interesting take on the i love her but cant have her story type loved it
Nov 18 2010,negative,saw it and it was rather boring
Nov 17 2010,positive,so death yep him the one with the sickle takes mortal form falls in love and learns what its like to feel the pain of love well if most of us have to go through this in our lives i dont see why death should be excluded  an interesting concept in a film that has some truly great moments but it is far from flawless  in this story for once we have a wealthy successful media mogul who is kind and loved by all hopkins performance as bill in this role means that you too cannot help but like him he is visited by death played by pitt and given an ultimatum they strike a deal and the story unfolds with death having an influence on bills career and family  there is much to like in this film when it hits it hits some serious highs and has some good humour the prospect of death visiting a hospital of all places was funny and the scene with the woman in the hospital is heartfelt and touching although almost ruined by some shocking west indian accents i also loved the relationship between bill and his family and especially enjoyed the scene with him and his other daughter at his birthday party the musical score is very good hopkins is great and pitt  forlani have a good chemistry when on screen  however i didnt enjoy pitts performance as much as i have in other films he seemed removed and cold for most of it and i realise that this is by design also the film at 3 hours is far too long and for every scene that is a hit emotionally there are equivalent scenes that do not get the balance right between genuinely moving and too sickly sweet at the end it left me thinking of what might have been as it has the essential ingredients to be a masterpiece alas it falls short of this but without doubt has it merits
Nov 16 2010,positive,i love this movie fantastic chemistry across all the leads many great lines  lots and lots of tearproducing scenes  especially anthony hopkins last dance with his daughter yes perhaps a few scenes could have been sped up just a bit youre  death but overall one of my most rewatchable favs
Nov 12 2010,positive,very long but has a good message and a good performance by brad pitt
Nov 8 2010,positive,its great the first timebut dont watch it a second time
Nov 8 2010,positive,i love this movie  mostly a romantic drama with some fantasy  death becomes curious and decides he doesnt know enough about life so he gets to know a man and his family  he discovers what is so great about lifelove  the script and score are incredible but yes it does move a little slowly  think about a real life conversation or dialogue with a loved one the characters here are allowed time to think before responding to one another  i especially enjoy the lines william parrish anthony hopkins is given hes wise and successful yet incredibly romantic  this is no action film i really dont get what the critics are so put off about i guess theres a lack of delight in human emotion
Nov 7 2010,positive,one of my favorite movies i can still watch it every so often and catch something new i like about it
Oct 27 2010,negative,really boring the only reason i give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is for one scene near the beginning of the movie where brad pitt gets hit by 2 cars best scene in the whole movie
Oct 26 2010,positive,the first two hours of this movie were pretty good  not great but better than average i suppose  by the third hour though i was really trying to watch it but it didnt hold my interest any longer    i think that a lot of the boardroommeeting scenes could have been cut out or shortened they added a lot of fluff to the movie  i appreciate when a playwright and director together can weave a story together into a spectacular 90120 minute film that takes talent
Oct 24 2010,positive,another teardropping film i regret i wasnt able to see upon its release i really sobbed with this    and i think im in love with brad pitt now lol well loving brad pitt is another way of saying im loving myself hahaha dont dare react xd
Oct 21 2010,positive,slushy  dont watch if youre a heartless bastard the film wouldnt be very good at all if wasnt for the amazing performance of athony hopkins  watch his acting its incredible
Oct 17 2010,positive,a very good movie with a good but very predictable story
Oct 13 2010,negative,boring awkward and creepy not in a good way this movie could have been so much more than an inexplicable romance
Oct 12 2010,positive,in my opinion a must see
Oct 8 2010,positive,this movies script is not upto the mark the huge plust point in the movie is obviously the cast which delivered very good performances especially brad pitt excelled in his role as death and anthony hopkins gave a solid performance but overall it is just a one time watch movie
Oct 7 2010,positive,a great movie with increasing insight it gets better each time you see it
Oct 2 2010,positive,this wonderful movie teach me to be grateful even to the little things in life that brings me joy it teach us not to take our life for granted its a lengthy movie but thats because it carried beautiful messages to the viewers in the end of the movie i realized my life doesnt seem so bad right now in fact not at all lifes can only get better 
Oct 1 2010,negative,i fell asleep in this movie and left halfway through it i would sooner gouge out my eyes with a rusty nail than see this movie again
Sep 29 2010,positive,hopkins and pitt did a much better job together than that garbage legends of the fall
Sep 27 2010,negative,high production values excellent cast appropriately emotional score by thomas newman but ultimately hollow and empty movie whose main fault is that while its about death with a capital d spending time on earth it doesnt have the slightest clue what it means by death watch roberd redford in that old twilight zone episode nothing in the dark instead at least that script had an attitude about death
Sep 16 2010,positive,what i love the most about this film are the performances pitt and hopkins and the beauty of the images the beauty of the atmosphere full of mystery and the beauty of the love story it tells a beautiful and mysterious romantic movie
Sep 16 2010,positive,one of my favorite films with brad pitt fountaine   hopkins give amazing performances as well kind of quiet and slow but beautiful cinematography and script
Sep 8 2010,positive,the biggest yay a classy and oldfashioned attitude towards the matters of life and death nay longish scenes endingand the rest
Aug 31 2010,positive,right up my alley would have been better without some of that extreme  american cheesiness though
Aug 30 2010,positive,brad pitts cute here 
Aug 29 2010,negative,just long pauses of silence and brad pitt looking like a maniquin my mum loves this movie
Aug 29 2010,positive,i really like brad pitt in this â
Aug 28 2010,positive,one of my most beloved movies of all time
Aug 28 2010,negative,too long didnt hold my interest
Aug 26 2010,positive,not very eventful and can be slow paced sometimes still has a good plot good performances and plenty of romance to please
Aug 26 2010,positive,instant favorite so sad but great
Aug 25 2010,positive,love is life love is miracle
Aug 25 2010,positive,stunningly slow but in a very good way you kind of get lost in the film and dont mind the pace of it at all some people say that the film is uneventful but i disagree yes not a lot happens but there is enough substance in the film to keep you entertained and a lovely ending that was to me unexpected
Aug 23 2010,positive,this movie is formidable great history great actors good production and most of all great message definitively a movie that makes you reflect value and realize that not everything is about money power and selfishness anthony hopkings character definitively is the center and best of the movie his quotes are among the bests of movies history
Aug 22 2010,positive,before supernatural romances had women falling for vampires werewolves wizards and whatall else this movie trumped them all by having death  walking the earth in human form  fall in love with a dying mans daughter anthony hopkins is superb the only sticking point would be the inconsistent characterization of death as a human otherwise it strikes all the right emotional notes
Aug 21 2010,positive,if ya didnt luv brad by this one ya did after u saw this movie
Aug 18 2010,positive,meet joe black is a very long film 172 minutes for a story about death taking human form to learn about life from the opulent managing director anthony hopkins who is literally at deathâtms door after suffering a heart attack in exchange for more time hopkins takes death in the form of bard pitt under his wing and they show each other how to live blar blar blar    itâtms actually a very well presented film with top acting the exception being the ever annoying claire forlani who plays hopkins daughter and deathâtms love interest the pacing is delicate the narrative is slow but never really boring but is way too long for the subject it seems to have been stretched out beyond all reason and does not need to be over 120 minutes if even that    the story has little peril and little in the way of incident just the overriding plotlines about hopkins lifeâtms work being usurped by his number one his desire for his daughter to find love and the his own impending death it is nice gentle and unlikely to offend but itâtms also ponderous at times    but this is the brad pitt complete with his early cheeky charm before oceanâtms eleven ruined him and made him into the selfassured cocky icon joe black along with his role in david fincherâtms se7en stand as proof that he was a great actor before he became the brad pitt of the naughties
Aug 17 2010,positive,if you can get over the threehour duration and its meandering pace theres a lot to like about this film  its charming innocent and has a lot of heart  the director isnt in a hurry to tell you the story of death as he takes a holiday among the mortals but what a ride  its by no means perfect  perhaps some clever editing would have beneficial  but a very enjoyable watch  i look forward to when my time comes and im ushered to the next world by brad pitt
Aug 16 2010,positive,it was too long but it had a nice balance between humor and heart
Aug 16 2010,positive,a pretty good movie very strange though
Aug 10 2010,positive,superb acting love this film
Aug 7 2010,positive,its about a new take on death and its changing perceptions its a surprising love story and a man comming to terms with his mortality and becomming content at the same time this is an awsome storythe fact that brad anthony and claire brought it to life the way they did made me forget where i wasand jeffrey  marcia couldnt have done better either     i love action as much as the next person but this movie makes you slow down and pay attention  a sequel is in order 3
Aug 2 2010,positive,brad at one of his best plus hes sexi
Jul 31 2010,positive,not all films are beautiful there are interesting films intriguing disturbing funny and scary but definitely not all of them are beautiful and i can say with lots of certainty that meet joe black is a beautiful film i felt it more like a poem than an actual film its a movie that takes its time to reveal itself which is why it may seem too lengthy for some a movie that is not pretentious nor ambitious it just tells a story and it focuses entirely on that it doesnt go any farther neither it wants to go there     the storyline is a very simple one an old man bill parrish immensely rich and owner of a communications company receives the visit of a strange young man who presents himself as death he states that he is there to take him but he is willing to give him more time if he could be his guide through earth and human life bill doesnt think it twice and agrees in including death who he later renames joe black into his everyday life changing in one way or another his relatives and friends especially his daughter susan who starts to have feelings for joe  so yes the story is very simple and its told that way it doesnt get complicated at any point and it fulfills its cycle it has a beginning and an end basic storytelling thats just what it is still the movie is also never boring we get to see the transformation in each and every of the characters bill parrish goes from fearing death to fully embracing it joe black himself goes through an eyeopening journey through earth in which he discovers what makes life so worth it susan falls in love with a man who she doesnt know and doesnt care regardless of its length the movie is told in a flowy smooth manner and it never gets stuck at any point the three hours had a reason to be    the acting is not the best part of the film but it contributes a great deal to its final impact anthony hopkins delivers definitely not his best performance but a very worthy one of a man who has to incorporate death into his life brad pitt in his early acting stages which i think worked better for him than the current ones makes a charming awkward and naïve impersonation of joe black but still without losing the mystery and darkness that characterizes death the chemistry between these two was probably the best part of the film they seemed to understand and respect each other perfectly and that could clearly be translated into their performances the supporting cast was good as well probably highlighting marcia gay harden as the loving but not loved second daughter of bill    the movie is definitely told from the heart as i said its more a poem told as a movie than a movie itself one where the silences count more than any dialogue and where the things we find mundane everyday such as peanut butter or turning chairs are of extreme importance and beauty the discovery and voyage of death wandering earth is simply delightful his awkwardness delight and surprise with everyday things we give no importance to a movie that talks about so many things fatherdaughter relationships making every day count appreciating the little things what really makes life worthy and i know that many others are being picked up by individual people i can say that meet joe black is one of the few films i find beautiful now beautiful doesnt mean good or remarkable by any chances yes the movie has its flaws and its definitely not for anyone its meant to be appreciated meditated and felt and not merely watched but think of a song a poem or a painting and then youll know what im saying the beauty is there but its made not for everyone to see it
Jul 29 2010,positive,very clear with its plot at times funny and always loving there are so many elements of dramatic principle but overall its a winner
Jul 29 2010,positive,death walks among us
Jul 28 2010,positive,while silightly slow moving i still love this movie this movie represts life and death i feel it is potrayed in an intresting fashion i find this movie to be thought provoking in so many ways i also like certain catch phrases and quotes that are in this movie this movie is a definite reminder of that we should all try to live our lives to the fullest because you will never know what will happen and when
Jul 25 2010,positive,for what meet joe black is 3 hours is a tad extensive and could have the same impact at a shorter duration it is a great film although with some strong performances from anthony hopkins and brad pitt worth the watch in the end
Jul 23 2010,positive,i just dont like claire forlani she bothers me
Jul 21 2010,positive,brad pitt was absolutely beautiful in this movie
Jul 16 2010,positive,one of my faves really great acting
Jul 16 2010,positive,never got around to actually make time for this one a good story good acting and the pretence of emotion and depth however the first 2â¾ hours are slow the last 15 or so minutes its wrap it up and hurry home which is unfortunate
Jul 14 2010,neutral,sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring  and thats coming from someone who watches documentaries and likes them
Jul 14 2010,positive,so long but you can fun with it 
Jul 13 2010,positive,loved this film it is a sad movie
Jul 12 2010,positive,i have no idea how anyone could dislike this movie its one of brads bests

Jul 2 2010,positive,brad pitt looked so hot in this movie
Jul 2 2010,positive,i was not so into brad pitt but ihad to change my opinion  verry entertaining and great performaces by hopkins and pitt
Jun 29 2010,positive,my favourite romantic comedy ever
Jun 28 2010,negative,this movie is so boring people have told me that its amazing but i was completely and utterly bored and pitt and hopkins are amazing actors too i dont get it
Jun 16 2010,positive,pitt is haunting but hopkins steals the show its long and drawn out
Jun 13 2010,positive,i watched this only because brad pitt looked delicious haha
Jun 12 2010,positive,brad pitts expression is very impressive innocent like a child who could avoid that face its all about the appearance the story is just different from my knowledge and out of my mind unless the death is not from the evil one
Jun 8 2010,positive,amazing  everyone must watch  how can it be bad with anthony hopkins in it and brad pitt as bonus
Jun 3 2010,positive,one of my alltime favorite movies great storyline amazing performances by anthony hopkins and brad pitt
Jun 2 2010,positive,it definitely has its fair share of cheesy moments and dialog  some weak plot moments  but honestly this movie teaches civility manners and a multitude of other values    the soundtrack is amazing
May 31 2010,positive,meet joe black was one of the best movies i have ever seen brad pitt did a marvelous job as always and anthony hopkins did really well too the story was so different from anything i have ever seen and was so well written i also loved how the long film was three hours it really gave a lot of time getting to know each character i canât wait to own this movie
May 30 2010,positive,great movie well worth every minute of how long it is
May 30 2010,positive,great seeing it again 
May 28 2010,positive,this film is moving  its heartfelt and makes me tear up
May 26 2010,positive,i think i had a hard time grasping that death was taking a human form it knows everything but nothing at all at the same time so that bothered me death has had so much time to observe people but so completely horrible with people oh at the end it has to be said how did she figure out her dad was dead no one is that bright and then she just completely forgets about her dad at the end so i didnt love the ending  weird movie
May 25 2010,positive,crisp shots bright colors  great story
May 24 2010,positive,this film is really long but it is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine  i think the acting is great and anthony hopkins gives a great monologue towards the end
May 24 2010,positive,its kind of slow but i love the overall story and the ending between hopkins and pitt
May 24 2010,positive,brad pitt yumm 11yrs later hes till got it going on loved the storyline and how she still ends up with him in the end
May 23 2010,positive,may 14 2010 when my eyes caught this quote         love is passion obsession someone you canât live without if you donât start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and whoâll love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart iâm not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youâll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havenât lived a life at all you have to try because if you havenât tried you havenât lived      â meet joe black    in the movie this dialogue was delivered by bill to his daughter susan  giving her advise about true love    i requested tristanross to download the movie meet joe black  its a 1998 movie  tagal na pala  babe and i watched the movie together  its an enchanting love story  bata pa ni brad pitt  indeed love conquers all  somehow this movie made me love life in this world and fear death  fear death or shall i say fear to leave your loved ones  we just didnt like the ending  babe said he wanted to see how bill died  i hate the last scene when susan followed bill and joe going somewhere faraway  its not possible a daughter would no longer mind to look for her father when she already saw the love of her life i like the  version of somewhere over the rainbow played at the end of the movie 
May 18 2010,positive,a movie that addresses the subject of death in an original way  a clever idea that could have been great but ultimately suffers due to its extreme length
May 16 2010,negative,one good performance from an average actor cant hold this film together
May 13 2010,positive,great movie ladies will love brad pitt  its a very original storyand told in a beautiful wayi love how everything comes full circle at the end great movie 
May 10 2010,positive,such a great movie one of my favourite of pitts also some good quotes in this movie
May 10 2010,neutral,from the watermark 112698  a slightly entertaining piece of fluff which is too much of a good thing death has decided to pay a visit to earth and wants to learn about life death be not proud and death be not stupid either he doesnt just assume the body of the first ernest borgnine or ross perot he finds he uses young firm bleachblonde pitt wouldnt you he has come to take the life of  a successful and wellliked business tycoon hopkins but instead cuts a deal if hopkins shows him life hell postpone hopkins death so pitt tags along with hopkins everywhere he goes behaves strangely and causes befuddled onlookers to react in embarrassment then death and hopkins youngest daughter forlani fall in love and things get sticky  the film is three hours in length  an thats an hour and a half too long even though its beautifully photographed director martin brest scent of a woman uses an overwrought lookhowartisticwecanbe style that eventually wears very thin he can take up to five minutes to get out three lines of dialogue then tack on so many climactic endings a big party fireworks teary goodbyes lovers reunited that after a while youre wondering if this isnt james cameron directing harold pinter the film is saved by the exceptional acting especially hopkins who goes from fearing death to literally fighting it pitt should also be commended for making his annoyingly clueless character palatable strong supporting performances from marcia gay harden i love her name and jeffrey tambor also keep this fluff from floating too far away still i hope my own death isnt this long and overdone
May 10 2010,positive,love this film such a great story and the perfect ending
May 10 2010,positive,nothing is certain but death and taxes and everybody loves peanut butter
May 10 2010,positive,loosely directed but still and mysterious and interesting tale which the lesser it explains the better it gets
May 5 2010,positive,how have you lived so far has it been a meaningful one to you  others  pitt was awesome so did hopkins
May 4 2010,positive,a loose remake of mitchell leisens 1934 romance death takes a holiday which was based on alberta casellas famous play this lengthy film from director martin brest who previously directed 92s scent of a woman and would later become notorious for his 2003 gaffe gigli which not ironically is his last directorial effort is one that has been the subject of both the favor and dissatisfaction of audiences neither without reason meet joe black is a movie that will either engulf its viewers with its sweeping beauty or frustrate them with its leisurely pace and overstated countercliches yet despite its shortcomings brests film manages an impressive presentation of breathtaking imagery and fine performances that make it a justified pleasure and certainly worthy of ones curiosity    william parrish sir anthony hopkins is a new york citybased media magnate who lives a life of privilege success and wealth after suffering a nearfatal heart attack however he is forced to view death as something more near than far just prior to his 65th birthday however parrish is confronted by deaths human personification brad pitt who gives william the opportunity to prolong what time he has left by agreeing to adopt death whom he subsequently presents to his family as joe black into his lifestyle and show him lifes wonders yet even more problematic is that the body joe has taken belonged to a young man who williams youngest daughter susan claire forlani had met and become enamored by just hours earlier at a local coffeehouse after which the man was killed    over the course of blacks 3hourplus runtime joe the angel of death discovers the essence of what hed sworn to take from others through board meetings which he attends as a business associate of bills parrish family gettogethers an everevolving though hopeless romance with susan who justly assumes that the object of her fiery passion is the same man she fell for in the coffeehouse and childlike exploration  he stumbles across the glorious inimitable lifechanging luxury of peanut butter    as far as performances go theyre all good but the celluloid nearly burns off the reel whilst filming sir anthony hopkins whose stint as the befuddled billionaire hes actually never confirmed or addressed as a billionaire in the film but who doesnt enjoy alliteration is commanding and very affecting as death falls harder for susans lively charm he rewrites the agreement to fit his own selfish desires leaving bill parrish angered yet helpless to the imminent pain that susan will suffer  not from the loss of her father rather from the departure of joe andor the demise that shell have to endure to stay with him if he chooses to allow it    additionally claire forlani is respectable  in fact very good  as susan as is jake weber as drew an auxiliary of bills who is also dating susan at the time of joes arrival less prominent though perhaps more noticeable performances by veterans marcia gay harden as allison parrish bills oldest daughter and jeffrey tambor as allisons husband quince also a business affiliate of bills accentuate those delivered by everyone else including the films star brad pitt who provides his dead character with sparkling charisma and faint humor  both necessary trappings to a movie that otherwise wouldve eventually reached a tiresome bore    riding the excessive talent of its actors the enchanting original music of thomas newman and the visual magnificence of emmanuel lubezkis cinematography black treks toward a solid albeit sometimes eyerolling cinematic experience leading up to its misguided finale which attempts  and initially succeeds  at symbolism only to lose it to a progressively incomprehensible sequence that beholds susan realizing and quickly accepting that both her fathers gone and joe isnt  and never really was  joe treating the confused situation as though its a frequent occurrence that grants her loves submission to a man she apparently understands is not the man she fell in love with nonetheless meet joe black is fun for its idyllic quixotic fantasy and though it may not be a fullcourse film its an adequate appetizer that should satisfy the taste buds of the patient the romantic and surely the dreamy
May 3 2010,positive,the end of the movie is good and touching  however although it doesnt seem like a 3hour movie to the point where it gets boring and tedious i do feel that it was too drawn out  if it were a little shorter i think it may have been a better film
May 1 2010,positive,i loved this movie
Apr 29 2010,positive,a wonderful story all around
Apr 29 2010,positive,a very unique and engaging story that unfortunately falls short in the overall acting and directing departments  claire forlanis character is about the only truly interesting one as everyone else is pretty wooden and bland  pitts acting is uncharacteristically stale and his portrayal of death is obnoxious and inconsistent  although a somewhat charming and entertaining film its simply way too long and way too mediocre

Apr 28 2010,neutral,it drug on a bit with some cheesy dialogue but over all i liked it its the messages that count for me  the acting and writing is only supposed to support the message it was alright
Apr 28 2010,neutral,havent seen in a loong time
Apr 23 2010,positive,brad pitt so innocent here and lovely
Apr 17 2010,positive,a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of this world     i agree that meet joe black is rather uneventful but it is the singularly composed dialogue that is important here it establishes a very delicate balance between the characters and the dramatic tension is created by the doubt whether such balance can be maintained
Apr 15 2010,positive,death ws handsome    the way he loved the peanut butter  this movie is a reminder tat we wil die no matter what   simple movie  not to watch it with logic though  can watch for fun 
Apr 15 2010,positive,astounded that this movie was not rated more highly hopkins is superb and pitt did well again brilliant screenplay and a highly better movie than shakespeare in love
Apr 14 2010,positive,great movie  might be better than 35 stars  wish i would have watched it earlier
Apr 12 2010,positive,im not sure how i feel about the movie overall there were def some really good parts not sure i really liked that ending either but i like the messages throughout good movie in general
Apr 11 2010,positive,awesome concept and well executed by brad pitt and claire forlani  i will definitely see it again

Apr 5 2010,positive,watched it for the 3rd time and always the same great
Apr 4 2010,positive,22whos the actress
Apr 4 2010,positive,i have to say that i enjoyed this film but it kinda ruined itself by spending to much time being a romance     the first half of the movie makes me thinks that the filmakers were trying to make a comedy realized it wanst funny then tried to do the rest as a drama there are several scenes where you wonder if they were trying to make you laugh and it simply wasnt funny    why is this movie a romance it would have been several times better if it had been more about a man dealing with death and his family and less about death falling in love brad pitt and his love interest dont have chemistry and anthony hopkins is not on screen enough     the director has the patience of a saint and he expects the same of the audience there are alot of pauses for dramatic effect but they take so long you start to wonder if the actors have forgotten the lines this movie really needs to hurry up i agree with the critics when they say that the movie has problems with pacing the story simply doesnt merit its three hours     the acting is good anthony hopkins as always delivers a great performance as the man facing death brad pitt is interesting in his performance as death itself and you really believe he has never interacted with a human being he also amazingly pulls off a jamaican accent    this movie has an interesting premise and good acting that overcomes its flaws
Apr 3 2010,negative,this is not a bad movie but it is about a very sad topic and it makes me cry so i give it a lower rating than it probably deserves
Apr 1 2010,positive,everyone said it was long and boring the first time i watched it which was a year ago i guess i was so into it that it flew right by me i enjoyed this movie even though it was a bit of a bore in the beginning
Apr 1 2010,neutral,i just canât get my head around this story  maybe iâm notâdeep enough uh huh whatever the more i watched the more puzzled i felt so death decides to take some sort of vacation it takes some poor guyâs dead body funniest death scene iâve seen in my life by the way and heitwhatever falls in love  all of it is just so absurd the premise is so stupid really i have no other word for it     death the termination of the biological functions that make an organism live stops being a state like the state of life and becomes some sort of being some sentient entity which is not a new concept of course weâve always had that idea for centuries of the grim reaper personifying death but this was just some wrong and weird idea that is supposed to be some serious fantasy itâs a drama after all and which is executed in the cheesiest way possible with the most melodramatic music ever composed i liked that score though by thomas newman as well as the soundtrack chosen at the end     but i mean death falling in love having sex eating peanut butter in the most retarded annoying way he claims in a scene that somehow amidst his vacation he is still taking care of the worldâs death issuance he doesnât explain how exactly but whatever so while he was having sex with the girl in one scene his first time of course a was he also taking peopleâs lives around the globe or something i just donât get it thereâs fantasy and thereâs idiocy and this was definitely idiotic     or maybe they just chose the wrong person i believe brad pitt is a good actor not great but good enoughâfight club se7enetc but in some films itâs like he just canât help being so boring monotone and wooden and that was exactly what he delivered here same case as benjamin button looooong and sloooooooooooow     this movie had a few pluses he looked so gorgeous it almost hurt to stare the kind of man who is just not handsome but beautiful in a manly kind of way the cinematography also contributed with stunning rich colors   anthony hopkins does the best with what he is given and heâs frankly the filmâs only worthy element his elder daughter and her naãve but goodhearted husband are also noteworthy     but back to hopkins his character is a man who is informed his days on earth are coming to an end a reaffirmation of what he himself already felt coming you love this man from the first time he speaks who doesnât love anthonyâs voice too you admire his calmed and composed character and his resignation before the immediacy of his death as anyone he would like more time but he just accepts his fate heâs thankful because heâs had a good life enriched not only materially but spiritually i could relate to this character i could feel the human warmth in him his pain and his happiness but brad pittâs character just gave me the creeps and made me feel confused
Apr 1 2010,positive,this is truly a wonderful movie
Apr 1 2010,positive,brad pitts just the best
Mar 30 2010,positive,a film that proved over and overwhat the hell do the critics know  beautiful picture about death taking a vacation on earth so to speak  and how life here on earth is so precious when we are among the living  joe black death played by brad pitt falls in love with anthony hopkins daughter claire forlani during his time and a meaningful ending that cant be given away here
Mar 28 2010,positive,a truly wonderful film that warms the heart and fills the soul with joy like all great films it makes you stop and think what if  full of heartfelt quotes    love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived    and    i thought i was going to sneak away tonight what a glorious night every face i see is a memory it may not be a perfectly perfect memory sometimes we had our ups and downs but were all together and youre mine for a night and im going to break precedent and tell you my one candle wish that you would have a life as lucky as mine where you can wake up one morning and say i dont want anything more sixtyfive years dont they go by in a blink    to name just two

Mar 20 2010,neutral,brad pitt has the uncanny ability to look like he hasnt a single brain cell in his head in any role acting at its finest in other news the best part of the whole movie is in the first 20 minutes or so

Mar 18 2010,positive,dark but a movie youll fall in love with
Mar 18 2010,positive,this is one of my least favorite pitt movies  i expected more than just the corny typical romance out of this film but what can you do  its not so bad
Mar 18 2010,positive,this was one of those movies that was interesting and well done without a lot of fan fair pitts monotone voice was perfect for this part and made the movie all the more believable
Mar 17 2010,positive,fascinating brilliant magnificent that is what movies are all about mystery and magic something that touches you definitely one of hollywoods best productions of the 90s everything in this movie fits together the actors the soundtrack the story this is a must see movie
Mar 13 2010,positive,ill be the first to admit that i may have prejudged this movie i dont knowmaybe it was brad pitt claire forlani love storyblah blah blah angry father anthony hopkinsblah blah blah but damned if this story wasnt intriguing one character is leaving life and one character is experiencing it for the first time the questions that it raises what is important  what it is to love be it the love of a father for his daughters or the love between a couple when faced with the eventuality of death the mundane things deteriorate and the bare bones are revealed and what counts  is seen for all its value this movie did to me what many movies try to do and that is have me see life diferently
Mar 11 2010,neutral,take infinity and multiply by depths of eternity and youll scratch the surface of how long this film drags on for

Feb 23 2010,positive,very beautiful spiritual and graceful
Feb 15 2010,positive,cant remmber much about this movie except that it was weirdununderstandable  that brad pitt was drop dear gergeous  his character loved peaunt butterand that marcia gay harden performance was unique  amazing as usualneed 2 watch it again to give my matured brain review
Feb 14 2010,negative,every scene in this movie should have moved twice as fastand even then we would have something wrong
Feb 13 2010,positive,this was a okay movie just okay its too long and it was kinda annoying because it isnt really worth your tine so i wouldnt watch it brad pitt doesnt help the movie so dont think that
Feb 13 2010,neutral,strange to see pitt in this character role definitely not similar to ghost whisperer
Feb 11 2010,positive,ah yes death this is not the seventh sign by any stretch however its not a bad movie pitt and hopkins are quite good although theres some nitpicking to be done first 3 hours seriously we could have cut this down a bit so be sure youve got plenty of time i hate to say this but pitts hair was distracting and one would think that death would have a little bit more understanding of the human condition i mean hes been around since the beginning of time right so i was bit putoff by how new everything was to him  like he just fell out of the sky like jeff bridges in starman and the ending is a bit too sappy you know it sounds like i hated it but i didnt i thought it was really quite good how do you react in the face of death how do you show death what its like to really live life helps if youre a media mogul with money to burn yes i wonder what would happen if death asked some regular joe to show him what it means to live would that be a more interesting movie all in all i give it a solid b almost a b but 3 hours and the ending cant do it
Feb 11 2010,positive,this movie is a bit like a pretty young girl admiring herself in the mirrorif you like that sort of thing youll stay with iteven if its silly and boring at timesand if you do stick around youll be rewardedsome nice performances by the main charactersand i liked what it attemptedeven if it was a little naive overall
Feb 10 2010,positive,hard to grade this one it is rather slow and takes a long time but this is one of brad pitts best films he did a very good job acting as death however i was sad during this whole film i was very emotional but they did a good job connecting and acting just to long of a movie lol
Feb 9 2010,positive,though it runs a little long this movie is an excellent reflection of life death and seizing an opportunity to be happy with the ones you love
Feb 4 2010,negative,the movies running time was way too long and the hokey story and mindnumbing performances made it feel way longer
Feb 3 2010,positive,yes i just saw it now hopkins is great big time all of them brad pitt and claire great acting
Feb 3 2010,positive,even they have emo issues lots of truths about living your life with integrity love is such a wonder even those whove moved on long for the lessons given and earned
Feb 3 2010,negative,turned it off part way into it because it was pretty boring
Feb 1 2010,positive,this is the best movie ever its my favorite i dont care what some people say about this piece but for me is masterwork great massage
Feb 1 2010,positive,bill parrish is a successful businessman running a major news company of his own creation and enjoying his two beautiful daughters susan and allison but one day he begins hearing voices followed by the appearance of a strange gentleman claiming to be the embodiment of death itself death makes a deal with bill if bill shows him around this modern world and keeps him entertained like a vacation death will give him more time on earth    this is a very wordy film which is to say the dialog is excellent unfortunately this is one of the most longwinded stories ive seen in a good long while that is unfortunate because there doesnt seem to be any real charge or hook to this film its bland the premise is not without interest in the least and dozens of simpleminded comedies could be spawned from it but it just drags on so drolly for the first hourandahalf that its difficult to keep interest but the acting is so well done and that combined with the great character work makes it nigh impossible to tear away from the second half and the excellent romance that develops really makes the film   as i previously mentioned dozens of comedies could be made from this concept  that fact is not lost on these writers a few good laughs come from the sheer absurdity of the situation without devaluing it and the marvelous performances from anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani keep it satisfyingly emotional unfortunately there are still more negatives the ending seems to stretch into uncomfortable and strange territory overall its chock full of great acting has a fine romance  sold emotional work mixed with an interesting plot and script that dont take themselves too seriously but the majority of its good points reside in the 2nd act the 1st act is painfully slowmoving and very dull due to the lack of trulyengaging direction and the overlydramatized introduction to the plot but it did set up for such a great second half and establish the fine characters but the runtime of a solid 3 hours is nearly unbearable  makes this film nearly impossible to enjoy casually but if you get a chance to view this film in its entirety i highly suggest you take it if you enjoy romance and good acting such a great film is bogged down by so many equally great problems its a shame but ill give meet joe black 75 tie knots out of 10  when i introduce you and i tell them who you are i dont think anyone will stay for dinner bill parrish  i cant believe you people i come for you and you want to stay i let you stay and you want to go  joe black
Jan 31 2010,positive,best of the best  meeting the best

Jan 27 2010,positive,a 3 hour film every minute worth watching i would recommend this to anyone ultimately points out the good in both life and death and to enjoy life to its fullest unfortunately brad pitt is the epitome of the trendy 90s from his bleach blond hair to his perfect surfer body every character is heartfelt and enjoyable
Jan 26 2010,neutral,a love story with a twist

Jan 16 2010,negative,bland acting all around i dont get the point of the story or at least the importance of the events in it at all what did we learn for all this
Jan 16 2010,positive,i thought this was a great movie anthiny hopkins is one of the best actors around and a bonus to have brad pitt in it too claire forlani did a good job too but i will watch anything that anthony has been in great movie

Jan 7 2010,neutral,this movie was way too long i saw this on tv last night and it was 4 hours with commercials still anthony hopkins is always fun to watch and brad pitt was his 90s long blonde hair gives a solid performance if you like dark romancedramas this might be one to watch not for me though

Jan 4 2010,negative,shit film but when pitt gets it from the van funny as all hell
Jan 3 2010,positive,ill be a little biased and say that the concept of the grim reaper has always be fascinating for me because the reaper is fearsome yet inevitable powerful yet mysterious wise but so silent so when a piece of media decides to represent himher i always want to see what that representation it that said lets get my one complaint out of the way    wow this movie is long it feels long too not longer than it actually it but by the end of the movie youre aware that youve been sitting a long long time now as far as the quality of the movie goes its probably better that you feel like youve spent a long time with the characters of this movie because by the end of the film you feel sad because you know of what supposedly is inevitable to come for certain characters and you hope for something of a good ending    anthony hopkins character is easily one of the best parts about this movie he has that classic charm about him and acts both as responsible business man and loving father yet he shows his fears in very mature manners never overreacting and characters in other movies might do in similar situations    death in this movie is a little strange for me before even appearing hes speaks with such a confident and fearsome manner of speech that it gets you excited for his actions throughout the movie but then he actually appears and at first hes just so awkward i know death is meant to be mysterious but in this version he acts alot like a curious child but then again thats the point of the film death learning about the ways of earth it just feels weird after getting such a big introduction only to have him standing around looking confused at various things    the final 30 minutes is spectacular heartwarming moving and complete with all the loose ends tied up ending the film on a more happy note overall its a good film just be sure youre ready to sit for about 3 hours when you watch it
Jan 3 2010,neutral,lol i saw this film again on tv and i actually realised how much i so dont like it the relation between joe black and that woman is so distant i hardly could connect to any of them and brad pitt looks plain stupid as joe black the idea is quite romantic death falling in love but brad pitt sucks as joe black didnt liek claire forlani either but i loved antony hopkins hes the shining light in this film
Jan 1 2010,positive,to reevaluate or reassess what really matters this is truely whats important especially since the clock just keeps on atickingooops times up
Dec 29 2009,neutral,it overstays its welcome and doesnt do its job  i think im in agreement with many others who have said that the best scene happens close to the beginning when brad pitt get hit by a car
Dec 26 2009,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen three hours and nothing absolutely norhing happens i will never understand what this movie wants to tell us it is so boring and awful unbelievable

Dec 18 2009,neutral,i adored anthony hopkins performance in this but brad pitt and claire forlani i dunno brad had some good moments death and taxes comes to mind but there were a few too many moment of looking pretty at the screen or cast membercharacter he can do better and so could she not bad but not good marcia gay harden as allison stood out pretty well excellent performance jake weber as drew was pretty effective also jeffrey tambor as quince was a nice addition good performance     overall an interesting concept but a slightly dodgy execution id wait to catch it on tv to get the most out of it  5410
Dec 18 2009,positive,a bit to long saw it a long time ago but i still really liked it
Dec 17 2009,positive,for once brad pitts wooden performance fits the role hes also surrounded by some class acts that make this an entertaining way to spend 3 hours
Dec 17 2009,neutral,well if you love brad pitt youll love this film and chances are the film makers were in love with him even more it may be little more than a vanity project but it has its moments and the scores beautiful
Dec 16 2009,positive,a great story about how death takes a vaction and tries to discover what it is that makes humans human this is not an action packed film but a story of how someone who has no real knowledge of people slowly learns about them    deep and moving although a little slow in places however this occasional lack of pace does not detract from the film
Dec 15 2009,positive,this modern fantasy stars anthony hopkins as william parrish a wealthy new york city media mogul who suffers a heart attack on the eve of his 65th birthday although he survives he senses that his death is near

Nov 2 2009,positive,you either love it or hate it  bottom line  i think it is a beautifully depicted romance  my only beef with the movie is the way it drags to a conclusion in the final act
Nov 2 2009,positive,the devil in disguise
Oct 31 2009,neutral,not  a bad film easy to watch but brad pitt used his interview with the vampire voice which was a bit stilted good role by hopkins who was a professional as ever could nt quite get my head aroung his eldest daughter though as she made such a big impression in the mist i think she might be typecast in my head now
Oct 29 2009,negative,i liked when he got hit by the car
Oct 28 2009,negative,easily my least favorite movie brad pitt has ever been in even worse than the mexican
Oct 28 2009,positive,you never know lightning could strike    wasent expecting a chick flick but amazing movie for one hahaha
Oct 25 2009,positive,anthony hopkins and brad pitt this could be maybe the best work of brad the movie its kind interesting and try to show in a very original form how really we are but in the deep how we are corrupted by power and for bill the oportunity of knowing himself as a good person  and about death and his love know how to differenciate a real pasionate love from something else  for my tastes this is a good dish to try
Oct 24 2009,positive,one of my fave movies
Oct 24 2009,positive,its very long but it kept me interested somehow  it must be a decent movie

Oct 5 2009,positive,this is one of my favorite movies
Oct 2 2009,positive,although it finished according to my anticipation but i was waiting for the ending with bated breath however observed brad pitt in a very strange character surely it was a tough role for him    selected dialogue  if food is the prose of a party then lights are its poetry
Oct 1 2009,positive,this film is fantastic  brings a tear to the eye
Oct 1 2009,positive,in general its one of the best movies in which starring brad pitt martins brest direction is almost perfectthe movie combines magically an interesting plot with wonderful scenes impressive cast emotion and sensuality in this movie also presented one of the most extraordinary characters joe black
Sep 29 2009,negative,crap crap crap crapyou get the idea

Sep 15 2009,positive,a little slow but clare forlani is the new most beautiful woman on the planet
Sep 15 2009,positive,beautiful and delicate and strange and brad pitt at the apex of his hotness this movie is full of droolworthy moments anthony hopkins is a bit onenote but its anthony hopkins and therefore its awesome

Sep 13 2009,positive,i was always saying i wanna see meet joe black and people around me answered good luck you can see it without me that one is boring  i dont think so though predictable meet joe black is a very interesting film and brad pitt introduces a great humor scenes for example the peanut butter which was one of my favorite   this one i wont forget
Sep 13 2009,positive,brilliantly amazing
Sep 12 2009,neutral,interesting movie but i couldnt buy the relationship between brad pitt and claire forlani it runs for too long and the ending is drawn out way too much the movie is beautifully lighted
Sep 9 2009,positive,when the movie started i thought the story was gonna be about a girl liking a perfect guy she meets in a coffee shop but then suddenly the guy is killed by a car accident  the story later begins about death taking the shape of a person  who happens to be the guy who died  to learn about earth and take away the life of anthony hopkins    its a creepy idea but it turned out to be a lovely film   brad pitt and anthony hopkins are awesome together i loved how out of all the food in earth death was amazed by peanut butter and ate it by spoon  that was fun to watch
Sep 9 2009,positive,its great better watch this too
Sep 8 2009,positive,i really liked this film wish they made more films like this one really good cast loved brad pitt in it
Sep 8 2009,positive,oh my god  do i sound like a teenage girl  well this film makes me that way  what a story what a music what a performance romance like very few others
Sep 5 2009,positive,seen this so many times but still enjoy it every time
Sep 4 2009,positive,love it best eminor music i know im going to cry every time i start to watch this lol fuck that eminor fuck it
Sep 3 2009,negative,this was not the movie i was expecting anthony hopkins proves he is a great actor since he can make such painfully dull material interesting even if it is just for the scenes he is in brad pitt who otherwise is a great actor delivers a role as death that is so bizarre i cant even begin to discuss who would death who has been around forever and is fluent in every language have the brain capacity of a 4 year old and have an affinity for peanut butter
Sep 2 2009,positive,my man brad pitt is so hot in this movie no emotions what so ever
Sep 2 2009,positive,probably my favourite brad pitt movie other than oceans 13  11
Sep 1 2009,positive,good human story interesting
Aug 30 2009,positive,amazing story amazing acting
Aug 30 2009,negative,how long is this film holy shit the best bit is when pitt gets run over and thats near the start
Aug 30 2009,positive,a wooden actor pitt makes great choices in movies no exception here
Aug 29 2009,positive,the movie is possibly a little confusing at first but its one of those movies that i love enough to watch over and over again i also really love the soundtrack
Aug 27 2009,negative,didnt really enjoy it
Aug 26 2009,neutral,i get that death is supposed to be emotionless but when you take that and add it to a three hour long movie it gets sort of boring and oh god just let anthony hopkins fucking die already so that i dont have to watch any more of this if i hear brad pitt say one more word about stupid peanut butter i swear
Aug 24 2009,positive,excellent premise for a movie  keeps you interested until the very end ive watched it again and again
Aug 24 2009,positive,i completely fell in love with this movie
Aug 23 2009,positive,great cast such an interesting movie
Aug 19 2009,positive,a true classic that many have failed to notice this is a mustwatch
Aug 17 2009,positive,the ending is way to drawn out
Aug 17 2009,positive,an interesting film that could have been shortened and an end that could have used some serious revamping
Aug 15 2009,neutral,i didnt understand this well not at all
Aug 12 2009,negative,the best part of this movie was seeing brad pitt get hit by a van haha
Aug 11 2009,negative,an intolerable brad pitt movie in which he walks around a bunch of expensive furniture and you begin to see how much his acting style resembles that of furniture the slowest movie ever made
Aug 11 2009,positive,death and taxes    the only role in which i actually like brad pitt  and anthony hopkins is amazing as always
Aug 8 2009,positive,this is a nice storya solemn ambiance a serious type but still i appreciate it
Aug 8 2009,negative,considering that almost any movie that anthony hopkins is when reading the script i dont think he knew how slow and horribly written this movie ended up being
Aug 6 2009,positive,brad pitts jamaican accent was interesting
Aug 5 2009,positive,in this overly long romantic film joe black or death brad pitt was introduced by dying corporate tycoon bill parrish anthony hopkins to his lovely daughter susan claire forlani  and they soon would fall in love accompanied by a few protracted intensely slow and tender kisses between the couple first in the library of the home and then a lingering lovemaking scene in which the two slowly undressed each other and stood naked kissing and then reclined back and made love for the first time  
Aug 2 2009,positive,this is truly an amazing film  i cried so much
Aug 1 2009,positive,i went to see this with my mom it also made me love peanut butter
Aug 1 2009,positive,just a quick rating of a film seen in the past
Jul 30 2009,neutral,meet joe black  20  40 stars    a very interesting story that falls just short of the fresh tomatometer  brad pitt deserves the honor of best actor in the movie for his performance of death while anthony hopkins gets an award for most annoyance    a very wealthy old man has been hearing a voice inside his head claiming to be death  when he finally meets death in person death tells him he does not have much time to live  death begins to follow the old man around for the entire duration of the film and learns what it feels like to be among the living  the film begins to introduce more symbolic messages to the audience like death knocking on his door and death and taxes etc  death really just needed to see how much a person can strive off life and be happy with what life has given to them in return    why did this movie fall just short  for one it really drags  the movie is understandably stretched for its purpose in bringing out the meaning of love hate and life to the audience  but honestly i find most of the scenes could have been shortened by at least a good two minutes making the film about thirty minutes shorter and still have the potential quality of a good movie    another killer to the film was the addition of a couple of elements to the plot  we meet the old mans family for the first time when they are setting up his 65th birthday party  the plot wants the family members to be included throughout the film but if they were not shown for the rest of the movie it would not drive the main story away at all  death the old man the one daughter death falls in love with and the buisness scandals are all that need to be directed to still pull off what the producers wanted to show    so the tomato just seems to be slightly rotten  such a shame too for the plot was very intriguing when first introduced  the movie was not awful but it was not amazing  i recommend this film to those who want to relax and enjoy a brad pitt movie for three hours
Jul 30 2009,positive,laid back movie with an impact
Jul 29 2009,negative,the longest movie ever made
Jul 29 2009,negative,about twice as long as it should be and not at all intriuing nor beautiful or lovely or anything like that

Jul 15 2009,positive,there is something very watchable about meet joe black whenever its on i tend to watch it no matter where in the movie i pick it up from     watching it last night i was surprise by both how good hopkins is in this movie and how bad forlani and pitt are at times in fact i can convinced that theyre using music here to soften some of the hard acting edges in scenes between these two    anyway still watchable
Jul 15 2009,negative,how could so many good actors make such a corny show
Jul 15 2009,positive,i really liked this  brad pitt was brilliant in this  not normally a fan of pitt but he excelled in this

Jul 8 2009,positive,creative and sweet love story  indicating how love can inspire and transcend spiritual boundaries as a possibility
Jul 6 2009,negative,has hopkinsbut not a good  movie
Jul 4 2009,positive,good acting badly written
Jul 3 2009,positive,a thoughtful look at a contemplative charecter a light hearted yet deeply thought provoking charecter analysis with strong performancea from the cast
Jul 2 2009,positive,possibly the greatest soundtrack to a movie ever
Jun 29 2009,positive,i loved the dialogue and score to this film one of my faves
Jun 28 2009,negative,one of the most boring overdone overlong movies ive ever seen despite a talented cast meet joe black succeeds at being a completely pointless journey of jargon
Jun 28 2009,positive,good but not extremely memorable
Jun 27 2009,positive,some of the acting and dialogue is wooden and contrived but the premise is ultimately engaging enough to last nearly three hours making this a shamelessly entertaining love story
Jun 27 2009,neutral,at times touching and thoughtprovoking at others i almost vomited because that sex scene seriously went on for hours and was completely unnecessary and for all that its touching that death gives him back at the end dont you think thats a bit creepy oh hey um we had tons of sex while you were dead uh i mean i had sex with your body but er uh you wanna get a coffee or something
Jun 26 2009,positive,i love the taste of peanut butter pitt put his face so lively
Jun 25 2009,positive,great although a bit too long it is a great film worth checking out
Jun 24 2009,positive,a wellacted movie with a great script anthony hopkins is amazing as usual the problem with the movie is its bloated and overlong ending which although provides a nice closing to the film just drags on and on overall worth watching though
Jun 23 2009,positive,i actually enjoyed it
Jun 23 2009,positive,good story great acting by my favorite actor brad pitt
Jun 21 2009,negative,lousy movie but great closing song during credits

Jun 20 2009,negative,slow slow slooooow and a wonderful job overacting mr pitt
Jun 17 2009,positive,love it soooooo much and cry every single time anthony hopkins is the best actor and brad pitt at his hottest
Jun 17 2009,positive,hopkins and pitt at it again
Jun 16 2009,negative,dont blow smoke up my behind it messes w the xrays
Jun 14 2009,positive,very good drama but with an unusual ending happy ending oo nonetheless good actors that lure your hidden emotions about life death and love to come out
Jun 14 2009,negative,for over 2 hours long was still waiting for something to happen at the end waste of a good cast
Jun 13 2009,positive,mula2 cerita agk boring n we need 2 think a lot tp such a nice one juga even until now aku pn xtau sape joe black sbnarnye mgkin ms tu x fokus kot mcm misteri kn
Jun 12 2009,negative,oh boy oh boy oh boyan acquaintance insisted that i watch meet joe black his favorite movie and one that he was sure would change my life i remembered it as being a critically reviled movie that prompted one of two responses â its so bad its good or its so bad itsâjust bad     meet joe black is quite possibly one of the worst movies that ive ever had to endure the script or the mess that resulted from reassembling the shredded remains of a dozen rewrites was so bad as to be funny on several occasions my wife and i laughed out loud at the mock sincerity and vapid attempts at meaning and depth the entire thing sounds like the laughable doom laden poetry of a maudlin teenager the actors left with nothing of any substance to work with and operating under a director who clearly has intellectual aspirations far above his capabilities struggle to create characters that amount to anything more than shameless pouting and vacant stares into the middle distance     buried beneath the portentous dialogue the awkward performances the dull production design and wildly inconsistent storyline there is a kernel of a decent story had we been able to focus on joe black and follow his own emotional journey as he weaves between the variously dysfunctional members of the parrish family playing with the irony of death healing these peoples wounds something of value may have resulted but alas its not to be even my wife a hardcore fan of every romance put to screen found the whole thing to swing wildly from embarrassment to tedium    the blame for this entire mess can only be laid at the feet of martin brest a director of very little evident talent who created a reasonably enjoyable buddy cop movie 20 years ago and has been riding on the wake of its success ever since he should stop deluding himself his actors and audiences that he is capable of subtlety or intelligence hopefully gigli will be the death of him
Jun 12 2009,negative,well they caught brad pitt during a good hair era
Jun 12 2009,negative,basically this was just a really long ode to how pretty brad pitt is
Jun 11 2009,negative,its long and dull  only worth it for the car accident scene at the start
Jun 11 2009,negative,its long and dull  only worth it for the car accident scene at the start
Jun 11 2009,positive,i watched this movie on the nth time and still looking for more
Jun 10 2009,positive,this is a great movie you really should watch  it seems a bit long though and it does kind drag in some places but over all i would watch it again
Jun 10 2009,neutral,this was a remake of death takes a holiday make no mistake about it  it was long boring and ill have to forgive hopkins for signing on to do it
Jun 8 2009,positive,wonderful power cast
Jun 8 2009,positive,have a thought about your life and receive answers when they come no matter how simple they seem
Jun 8 2009,positive,i cry everytime i watch this movie    it really gets to me
Jun 7 2009,positive,my favorite line  love is passion obsession something you cant live without i say fall head over heels find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find them forget your head and listen to your heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense in living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived
Jun 6 2009,positive,all i could think through this film was poor marcia gays character i didnt dislike this film but hitting on the 3 hour mark made me really struggle to enjoy it and whilst most women would blabber their eyes out it failed to captivate me in that way but its not all bad brad and anthony do deliver good performances
Jun 6 2009,positive,i like the premise of death personified looking for some kicks on earth some of the writing is amusing but the last few minutes is fractured and illogical
Jun 4 2009,positive,loved this movie could watch it again and again the acting was fantastic
Jun 4 2009,negative,this film is bad its overly long where it should be short and what should be focused on for a long amount of time is done only for a short period with a classical score in the background consistently being irritating to hell anyways good idea shame that it doesnt seem to be pulled off as well
Jun 3 2009,neutral,its a bit long and drawn out but if you tough it out through all that it isnt that bad
Jun 3 2009,positive,i love anthony hopkins  one of my favorite actor
Jun 1 2009,positive,claire forlani deserves more popular roles like this
May 31 2009,neutral,this movie is weird i cant decide if i mean that in a good way or not
May 31 2009,neutral,the three hour cut of this somewhat remake of 1934s death takes a holiday is an unoriginal depiction of betrayal love and hope pushed in our faces smeared with cheese and it doesnt let go for a long time while there were many instances of good script and dialogue that made some nice repetition the movie dragged on there are also instances of decent acting but as a friend put it the characters themselves are just too weepy too whiny too needy heres a man who has everything he ever wanted and now two people are trying to take it all away its not hopkins character who is out of line but the rest of them they all want what hopkins has and have no other way of showing that than through childish tempers of want the music was not there to enhance the film but rather to drive it i didnt want the music to tell me what i was supposed to be feeling but it did there are many story elements that im glad turned out the way they did but overall its just a long love story thats presented in a hardly unique way it was however quite beautifully filmed and i have little against martin brest just his choice of story
May 28 2009,positive,just because you see the end of this coming does not make this anything but a great movie
May 28 2009,positive,slow paced but good
May 27 2009,positive,not what i expected
May 27 2009,negative,brad pitt getting hit by a car made me laugh in the theater when i saw this
May 26 2009,positive,why all the good movies start in a way you cant go to pee and then transform into 3 hour melodrama where a good idea is lost nonetheless i love the movie pitt is irresistable girl very touching and hopkins brilliant
May 26 2009,positive,i fell in love with this story of a daughter and fathers time together a last moment the gentleness of an angel brad sent us to the end of the with a grand performance

May 21 2009,positive,i actually knew a guy named joe black
May 18 2009,positive,good but a little too long
May 17 2009,neutral,too romantic and too long the ideas are good the importance of living your life fully and  the importance of first impression
May 17 2009,positive,a media mogul acts as a guide to death who takes the form of a young man to learn about life on earth and in the process fall in love with his guides daughter
May 16 2009,neutral,a lousy movie but anthony hopkins is mesmerizing in it
May 16 2009,positive,the 1st making love scene is described with an extraodinary act of brad pitt was like his first touch his first kiss n theyr so sweet that for the first time in his damn takinganother life feel the human love truth be told i dont know how theyr in fact but brad pitt gives me a way to know it somehowi think for someone that looking for their love might bet their rest of life to feel itthats the way people always say thereis a half of u in this world even though ur a deathhahahai like the father character either

May 11 2009,positive,omg my movie of all time anthony hopkins and brad pitt for the 2nd time after legends of the fall
May 11 2009,positive,hopkins and forlani great but pitt seems to have visited the keanu reeves school 4 acters as a wooden plank was more convincing than him
May 11 2009,positive,easily on my favorite movie list everything about this movie is likable the acting the characters but the overall idea was the best the character death depicted like this was pure genius on so many levels i dont think anyone could have pulled it off more brilliantly then brad pitt and throw in anthony hopkins was a good move to he and brad pitt work so well off each other this movie shows a realistic side of human nature to something even as cold as death
May 10 2009,positive,i liked it okay  dont give me crap
May 9 2009,positive,brad was great in this
May 8 2009,positive,brilliant story delicately portrayed by hopkins and pitt as mr death  claire forlani and hayden provide the eye candy

May 4 2009,positive,gee now i know how most devil trades
May 3 2009,positive,pretty good movie didnt feel like it was three hours but the concept was interesting anthony hopkins and brad pitt are two of my favorite actors and they do a really great job as does the rest of the cast but it was a neat movie and i enjoyed it a lot
May 1 2009,positive,most people dont like this movie  i actually enjoyed pitts performance of someone who is unfamiliar with feeling emotions  decent flick
May 1 2009,positive,i love claire forlani and you cant beat a brad pitt flick
Apr 27 2009,positive,my alltime favarorite movie cry every time
Apr 27 2009,positive,a bit long but a good film

Apr 24 2009,positive,i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived  meet joe black
Apr 23 2009,neutral,not bad unnecessarily long the car accident near the beginning  looked great for its time would have been funnier if it was called meet jack black
Apr 23 2009,negative,martin brests handsome remake of the 1934 film death takes a holiday is rather ponderous overlong and somewhat thrown offkey by the casting of the genial brad pitt in the admittedly unplayable role of the grim reaper its nearly impossible to fathom what the point of this ornate fantasy might be as it attempts to muffle the emotional and physical pain of death in the trappings of wealth while pitt is miscast and is clearly in over his head with the epigrammatic dialogue his performance is not without the charm that hes shown in previous work as the virtuous and beloved multimillionaire about to meet his demise anthony hopkins does a splendid job with a thankless role making one almost believe that there might be some substance behind this weightless premise jeffrey tambor and marcia gay harden are also excellent as hopkins semicompetent soninlaw and his lessfavored daughter greatly benefitting from being the only believable characters in the film claire forlani as the moguls daughter has little to do other than look pretty and since looking pretty is a great deal of what this film is about its worth noting that the domains of the superrich are beautifully photographed by emmanuel luzbecki while the film fared badly at the box office adding to pitts string of commercial failures it apparently did little to tarnish his career
Apr 21 2009,positive,what a story of life not about death at all
Apr 21 2009,negative,one of the only films ive walked out on after paying admission
Apr 21 2009,positive,this movie is so terrific because of how well it captures a variety of human emotions while many claim that it is long every scene including the extended pauses serve an important role in solidifying this film as true work of art    for anyone who has ever loved or lost or both this film accurately and effectively portrays the beauty and tragedy of human relational experience while leaving the viewer in the end acutely aware of how truly wonderful the journey of life and death is
Apr 21 2009,negative,brad pitt gets hit by a carwhich is good  but then hes on screen forever which is bad
Apr 20 2009,positive,hopkins and pitt playing off against each other with gusto  only one flaw the soppy hollywood happy ending  yak

Apr 18 2009,positive,even if you put aside the fact that its 3 hrs of brad pittits a great movie  interesting really funny and oddly enough not all that predictable  not sure what i thought about the end though but i guess it was a cute way to end the movie
Apr 18 2009,positive,wow  this was the first time i saw brad pitt as a real actor not only a cute man and hopkins is wonderful as always
Apr 17 2009,positive,meet joe black was an interesting moviealways a pleasure to watch brad pittas it conserns hopkinseveryone knows what an actor he is
Apr 15 2009,positive,this movie is one of a kind it shows how love can force a person do the impossible and how it chose even the most unlikely to be chosen if you think you know what love story is think again and watch meet joe black
Apr 15 2009,positive,wish it would have ended happier but still awesome
Apr 13 2009,positive,the rather dull list of approved critics got this one wrong it is a great film     i am a boy but brad pitt as joe is beautiful as is the love story in general     the best i have seen anthony hopkins
Apr 13 2009,positive,good but far too long
Apr 13 2009,neutral,brad pitt is beautiful and everything but enough is enough the story wouldve been told in an hour
Apr 12 2009,positive,tear jerker for sure another one of my wifes favorites
Apr 12 2009,positive,this movie has a real unique twist to it boy meets girl boy gets girl  did i mention that the boy is the angel of death  i thought the premise was obviously really interesting and different  although the ending was a bit lame  not all of the ending  just a few pieces to it  overall i really enjoyed the movie
Apr 11 2009,positive,have never seen this cant believe it its so good loved it

Apr 1 2009,neutral,brad pitt is most far away from being death who is naive   anthony hopkins jake weber and marcia gay harden are remarkable   claire forlani gives me a choke in the throat somehow   meet joe black is boring
Mar 30 2009,positive,william parrish love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived

Mar 27 2009,negative,best carpummelsman scene ever hilarious
Mar 26 2009,positive,sure the dialogue could have used some work and claire forlani could be outacted by an uncoiled slinky but when it comes to pretentious existentialist blatherings you cant go wrong with this
Mar 26 2009,positive,seems corny in retrospect but i remember it seeming well handled and original
Mar 26 2009,positive,its far too long it has pitt and hopkins in it and its extremely slushy but for some reason i dont mind this film claire forlani is probably the reason

Mar 22 2009,negative,sounds like it should be an interesting movie  too bad the delivery and script suck
Mar 22 2009,negative,suspension of disbelief might have helped enjoy this movie had the pacing be not so sluggish it simply gives too much time to think about the characters illogical actions when it ought to have moved swiftly there are simply too many flaws in the movie to be able to enjoy it enough

Mar 2 2009,negative,ahahaha gotta love brad pitt getting hit by a car
Mar 1 2009,positive,anthony hopkins is phenomenal
Feb 28 2009,positive,exceptional acting every character is crucial to the script here the script is truly rich for eevry character even tambors quince a truly minor character is especially paramount to understanding this movies characters if you can accept the premise and i dont see why it is so hard for so many then this movie is well worth your time and to all those who say less is more maybe it is a bit too long but no movie is perfect and most all the dialogue and deliveries are amazing and i sat through braveheart the same as all of you and loved it if a movie is interesting ill stay it is smart dialogue with an excellent score fantastic cinematography superb direction and a great cast
Feb 27 2009,positive,i like movies that makes me cryand this one did so i liked it unusual concept though but interesting to watch i dont know why i enjoyed watching itmaybe because of brad pitt or maybe because i was confined in the hospital when i watched it and there was really nothing to do but to watch it and it was the only movie featured on the tv that day but indeed it made me cry and left me crying the whole night after seeing it and i like peanut butter toosee the movie but mind you its a long film
Feb 26 2009,negative,joe black put me to sleep this story is a 100 chick flick and i just didnt get it if you have any tesosterone stay away from this movie
Feb 25 2009,negative,im giving this 1 star because of pitts hilarious jamaican accent during the hospital scene
Feb 25 2009,positive,hopkins as always a great performance
Feb 25 2009,negative,horribly horribly horribly boring this movie could have been half as long if they had taken out all the sweet desperate longing glances or rather stares
Feb 25 2009,positive,the ending doesnt do it justice but otherwise still a great movie
Feb 24 2009,positive,one of my fav i love this movie
Feb 24 2009,neutral,nice it gets you thinking
Feb 23 2009,positive,a highly underrated film that suffered from being a bit too long for massaudience appeal
Feb 23 2009,negative,brad pitt looks great but the movie was booooring
Feb 22 2009,positive,i am obsessed with this movie and not just because hopkins gives a killer going away speech at the end i now use it pretty much whenever i have to speak in public the coffee shop romance is just beautiful and brad pitt is amazing at being incredibly stoic i seriously hope he is how death really does look because that means im going to heavenjk
Feb 22 2009,positive,a beautiful beautiful film pitt is a revelation emotionally intense well handled and underrated
Feb 21 2009,positive,i really love anthony hopkins and brad pitt in this movie

Feb 21 2009,positive,its really beautiful i love it
Feb 20 2009,positive,this i think is the better of mr pitts movies
Feb 20 2009,positive,love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived    william parish hopkins is a millionare about to celebrate his 65th birthday death himself has come for him but instead of taking him he has a proposition hell delay bills death for a tour of life   enter brad pitt the body death has borrowed joe black  bills daughter susan starts to fall for joe and he threatens to change the rules   bill is left to fight not for his future but for those he loves in this tale of life and death    beautiful touching   superb acting i love it when pitt and hopkins collaborate it always turns into a masterpiece    img src
Feb 19 2009,positive,i honestly expected to not enjoy this movie but got given the dvd so thought id give it a go i was more than a little pleasantly surprised    ill be honest its a stupid idea for a movie really stupid however the characters are likeable and well acted and its engaging and interesting throughout    i predicted what the resolution of the film would be at the beginning but the movie doesnt rely on clever twists to work it is how the story is told not the intricacies of the story that make it enjoyable it didnt seem like a long film and it undoubtedly is and that for me is a mark of quality
Feb 19 2009,positive,a martin brest work this was a facinating portrayal of death death personified william parishanthony hopkins is a business mogul who is about to die joe blackbrad pitt is the grim reaper who has come to claim him there is a certain chemistry evident between hopkins and pitt and this makes the movie more enjoyable there is a great mix of love and drama and humor brad pitt was well chosen for this role he executes perfectly the innocence wonder and pure joy of discovering everyday things like peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love there is an irony parish is embracing his death while he is alive whilst deaththink grim reaper learns what it is like to live although this movie was a hefty 3 hour long viewing like all lengthy movies its worth the watch    william parrish love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived   susan parrish love passion obsession all those things you told me to wait for well theyve arrived what are you afraid of dad that ill fall head over heels for joe well i have     first a word of warning this is a lengthy film 3 hours and tends to be very slowly paced if you are averse to either or if you do not like any of the three principals hopkins pitt and forlani id advise you to avoid the film     a film about death its better than it sounds trust me 
Feb 18 2009,positive,one of my all time favorite movies
Feb 18 2009,positive,we popped this little ditty into the dvd player a fortnight ago because my wife in her infinite movie mediocrity as a teenager had an actual life and didnt spend it in the darkened movie theater half as much as i did watching brad pitt and anthony hopkins you are reminded what great actors with a great script can do pitt is sensational and oddly underrated in almost everything he has ever done but this is one of those movies that he doesnt get his due for playing multiple roles and using the same face is something few actors can pull off sure put a fat suit and wig on eddie murphy and hes mama klump take the fat suit off and hes buddy love but for pitt playing multiple roles with no makeup is a master to watch hopkins is endearing and engaging as the foot in the grave henry higgins for death the movie runs three hours and martin brest smartly leaves everything on screen not since the green mile has a three hour running time not enraged me to the point of declaring i will not watch this movie without a weekâs supply of mountain dew and a catheter as an aid   if you love beautiful movies with a script thats as smart as its director you should watch this one if youve already experienced it trust me this is one to revisit it is far superior to benjamin button
Feb 17 2009,positive,the first movie just couldnt get enough of its a story about love
Feb 16 2009,positive,this movie is very good and awfully cute
Feb 15 2009,positive,when death falls in love
Feb 15 2009,positive,this was an especially good movie to watch after having seen the curious case of benjamin button  it was kind of surprising to see how well brad pitt plays somebody who just doesnt exactly know how to act in the given situation  the vulnerability of the character plus the beautiful look to the entire show made this movie a winner for me

Feb 13 2009,positive,i am embarrassed for liking this

Feb 13 2009,positive,i melt with this movie
Feb 12 2009,positive,very sexy this movie was a relief seeing that claire forlani finally managed to shrug that prinzejr monkey off her absolutely divine back

Feb 5 2009,positive,mmmmmpeanut butter lol this was a good movie love the premise and anthony hopkins
Feb 4 2009,positive,basically this is brad pitts edward scissorhands or attractive nonhuman who wants to learn be a human movie it had several legitimately cutegoodromantic moments but the pacing was extremely slow and the ending fell on its face and asked who am i could have been a much better film in terms of theme and payoff
Feb 3 2009,positive,brad pitt as death  alright thats cool i guess
Feb 3 2009,positive,long but good brad pitt and anthony hopkins are both outstanding in their respective roles and this movie gives death a new face and a new concept very interesting and im very glad i watched it

Jan 21 2009,negative,most pathetic boring and stupid movie i have seen in a long time what is so wrong about it is how serious but absolutely pathetically it deals with fundamental topics of life u wait for relief in form of its end finally and it does not come because there are all these further pathetic dialogs u have to sit out her father has to die for her to get her lover and she is happy  worse she actually does not know him but only has dealt with the looks of different person shed actually met how worse can it get how can one write such a stupid story
Jan 19 2009,positive,i am huge pitt fan and the kissing scene is one of the best
Jan 19 2009,positive,one of the best u will see
Jan 19 2009,negative,1998 bp at the bottom of his game
Jan 19 2009,positive,its blockbuster classification overshadows the great concept and script that brings me to tears every time i watch the film  it forces the viewer to consider life and death through a different lens much like the curious case of benjamin button and does it in such a simple yet poignant way
Jan 19 2009,positive,the story is fascinating pitt and hopkins are fabulous in their roles
Jan 18 2009,positive,loved it all the acting was great sound trackthe script and dialog was wooooooooow

Jan 14 2009,positive,great great movie  anthony hoppkins and b pitt on their best
Jan 13 2009,negative,the original was far far better maybe if i liked brad pitt id consider this two hours well spent just gazing at him as i am totally indifferent to his charms hopkins had to tackle the heavy lifting that is remaking a cinema classic and hoping not to bomb
Jan 13 2009,positive,is gorgeus is a beautifull romantic story
Jan 12 2009,positive,brad pitt actually did a good job in this one who would have guessed
Jan 12 2009,positive,this one always makes me cry at the end it also helped me discover the hawaiian version of the song somewhere over the rainbow which i just love

Jan 7 2009,positive,peculiar and thoughtful
Jan 6 2009,negative,never quite sure why this movie had to be so long it was terribly slow and just dull  not a favorite by any stretch
Jan 6 2009,positive,quite clever throughout pitt plays a humanoid persona of death who is there to accompany anthony hopkins to his death whilst this is happening through the move pitt falls for business mans hopkins daughter and it turns itself into a tense romantic movie very well shot and very romantic
Jan 6 2009,positive,wonderfull love story
Jan 6 2009,positive,kinda slow at certain times hopkins does great pitt is pretty good and forlani is beautiful this is worth seeing
Jan 6 2009,positive,i would give it 5 star if i didnt guess out how the final ending would be a beautiful movie in every regardsthe scene after coffee shop is classica great execution of using the syncopate rhythem in film the chemistry between main charactors just come out so natually and dont forget about the music the lyric and beautifull melody fit the atmosphere perfectlyi really didnt feel the time going inalthought it is three hours long

Jan 2 2009,positive,this is one where you either love it or hate it luv it  a creative idea with a musical score that draws you into the moment  wont let you go
Jan 1 2009,positive,one of my all time favorite films
Jan 1 2009,negative,seemed like a mildly interesting plot death comes  in the form of brad pitt of course to inform anthony hopkins that he is going to die and consequently falls in love with his daughter everything else about the film failed to deliver however  it dragged on unremarkable in filmmaking techniques which despite best efforts are not masked by the overdramatic music almost entirely composed of groanworthy dialogue and peppered with cheesy and obnoxiously weepycharacters acting was less than spectacular disappointing in a film starring pitt hopkins and harden perhaps much of my dislike for the film came from my distaste for the actress who played susan a detestable character to begin with
Dec 31 2008,positive,anthony hopkins is scathing brad pitt is convincing and claire forlani is the glue that holds it together as brilliant  interesting idea and great performances moves really well very fresh
Dec 30 2008,positive,the heart of the film can be found in hopkins william parrish a dynamic man who has been chosen by death for observation as the best humanity has to offer as hopkins plays him with tremendous verve and sympathy he is all this but the character also seems impossibly idealized truly without flaws never is there an indication of the ruthlessness that must have been required to get as far as he did he is even the perfect widower forever living in the memory of his adored wife without a woman to replace her    by contrast pitts joe black is an odd egg indeed at times joe looks as though he hasnt a clue what to do or say in polite company while at others he appropriately appears to be several steps ahead of everybody else looking dashing and slightly impish at times pitt isnt particularly effective in the moments he must carry the screen alone or in his attempts at physical comedy hes better in the romantic interludes in which joe experiences love and sex for the first time and best of all in his scenes with hopkins suggesting that he would excel in ensemble pieces cast opposite strong actors rather than toplined alone
Dec 29 2008,positive,interesting conceptgood acting
Dec 29 2008,positive,heart felt and brad mmmm
Dec 27 2008,positive,beautiful film  simple and elegant
Dec 26 2008,positive,cute film nothing special though its an original idea and a great cast but a sometimes notsogreat dialogue agreeable and fun   the whole peanut butter thing was hilarious love brad pitt
Dec 25 2008,positive,a little slow and long winded but worth it  brad pitt does death well
Dec 25 2008,negative,oh i get it hes death
Dec 25 2008,positive,in the end way too long but it makes you think about life
Dec 25 2008,positive,slow weird but i liked it
Dec 25 2008,positive,would you fall for death
Dec 24 2008,positive,a great movie makes you think about your own life and what you are doing and what you will leave behind
Dec 24 2008,negative,the original was so good as much as i love looking at brad pitt the original was better
Dec 24 2008,negative,this movie is what i hate about movies you can tell there was no real research done into death or even the character of death and what a stupid plot the score is absolutely terrible as if the story wasnt bad lets play some shitty music on top of it not to mention this was 3hours of predictable script this movie is laughable in every way and here is the funny part its not a comedy there were some redeemable qualities to it like some of the lighting and the sets and art direction but i mean this was just a piece of shit terrible writing and i wont judge the acting because this goes to show actors like hopkins can do bad movies to
Dec 22 2008,negative,brad pitt looks hot but the film is waaaaaay too loooong
Dec 21 2008,negative,quite possibly the longest movie ever at least it seems that way
Dec 21 2008,positive,original idea and very very interesting i think its a must see
Dec 19 2008,positive,captivating movie anthony hopkins delivers a serious performance
Dec 19 2008,positive,beautiful not a fan of brad pit but the grand master sir anthony hopkins is at his best as always
Dec 19 2008,negative,oh how i want my three hours back
Dec 17 2008,positive,a deep movie that shows the depth of true love for family and the flame
Dec 16 2008,neutral,mediocre but does has its fair share of excitement in terms of script quality plot is rather weak considering that its supposed to be death an eternal being who has seen us pathetic humans for all eternity but he acts like a child in so many unnecessary instances ultimately its the cast that saves and drives it away from suffocation
Dec 16 2008,negative,so sickeningly sappy
Dec 15 2008,positive,one of the most likeably unique love stories that ive ever seen besides having a great cast and engrossing dialogue meet joe black is elevated from the normal romance fodder by considering real morality issues in life and death what do we leave behind once we die how will we be judged after our passing why do life love and loss all seemingly coexist ive heard this movie described as boring granted it is 3 hours long but the ideas that it ponders require a bit of rumination i dont see the movie as boring at all it does move at its own pace but that makes it all the more poignant
Dec 14 2008,positive,another tear jerker that gets me every time a great score too
Dec 12 2008,positive,i really enjoyed this moviei didnt want to miss nothingit made me cry it made laugh and feel lots of emotions
Dec 12 2008,positive,i like claire forlani in this one the rest is  a way too long pitt is ok and thats it the plot makes me laugh i mean death wants to know about life who knows life better than death yeah nice romance but it is missing some flesh around the bone to satisfy myself
Dec 12 2008,positive,i didnt like this movie the 1st time i saw it but it grew on me besides brad pitt is totally hot if death looked like that noone would mind dying
Dec 11 2008,positive,i looooved it not because of brad pitt the story was really great 
Dec 8 2008,negative,way too long and boring
Dec 8 2008,negative,stiff acting all around
Dec 5 2008,positive,worth a watch just for brads death
Dec 4 2008,positive,slightly humorous look at death himself good romance story and lifereflecting movie
Dec 4 2008,positive,i liked the idea and liked brad pitt and claire forlani not to mention anthony hopkins he doesnt have to say anything to be great
Dec 4 2008,positive,actually a good movie dont know why its good enough to cry in for the ladies but it was good and ive secretly had a crush on claire forlani for centuries
Dec 4 2008,positive,the car crash is the best bit of this film the rest is rather dull and pointless
Dec 4 2008,positive,a little too long but good anyway
Dec 3 2008,positive,good but long and slow
Dec 2 2008,positive,i love movies that make you think about choices in life
Dec 1 2008,positive,i remember kind of liking this when it came out
Nov 30 2008,positive,i love anthony hopkins
Nov 29 2008,positive,the cast  acting was perfect the story was great buuuut the love story was just creepy im not a big fan of love stories but this one bothered me  deeply haha
Nov 28 2008,negative,watch out for that cab
Nov 25 2008,positive,even if you dont enjoy romantic movies like meet joe black its worth it just to see brad pitt smoked by abruptly hit by two cars
Nov 25 2008,positive,anthony hopkins is dynamic throughout and pitt shows how versatile he can be with this apt depiction of death lives for a day the pauses and silence throughout give good power to the statements made and though some of the film is formulaic it comes off as so much more than ordinary
Nov 25 2008,positive,truly captivating piece brad pitt  sir anthony hopkins  brilliance
Nov 24 2008,positive,what a beautiful movie so romantic and so moving  i fell in love with brad after watching this moviei couldnt take my eyes of his lips a mouth that definitely needs kissing
Nov 23 2008,positive,i love this film its one of my favouritesim sooo soppy i know but found myself totally into this movie and yes it did make me cry both happy and sad tears
Nov 23 2008,neutral,i liked it so sue me the peanut butter scene is funny
Nov 23 2008,neutral,claire forlani is divine i really liked this
Nov 22 2008,positive,this is one of my all time favorite movies it is a much deeper movie than people give it credit for it is a love story but it is more about how life can pass you by and then when the end is near and you know it the things that you should love and cherish are not the things that you spent your life focusing on in the end relationships are what count  it stirs a such a great depth of emotion in me this is a special movie and a message
Nov 21 2008,positive,the most touching sad beautiful movie ever
Nov 19 2008,positive,one of my best movies the fact that death itself can find love and its pure poetry
Nov 19 2008,positive,you have a good cast and a really interesting story that should have more closely followed anthony hopkins character but instead gives megastar brad pitt and the sexy wonkeyed claire forlani about an hour of awkward silence romance because thats what sells  it got a lot of flack right after it came out but its not terrible  not great either  the penthouse is pretty cool
Nov 19 2008,positive,great cast even if personally i find claire forlani annoying interesting story pitts characters is utterly lovable i just want a spoon and a jar of peanutbutter when i watch this film
Nov 18 2008,positive,loved the first 5 minutes you dont see it coming but its good for rewinding and rewinding and rewinding i may be a bit morbid
Nov 16 2008,positive,the best movie ever
Nov 16 2008,positive,i just upped and watched this film last night not knowing what the hell it was about but it was one of the most enjoyable movies ive ever seen i missed out on the first part of the movie but read the script on wikipedia so i was kinda glad i was a little bit confused durring the movie it actually made it more enjoyable because you didnt know what to really think     anyways its just a good movie
Nov 15 2008,positive,pretty weird overall bonus points for that i guess
Nov 15 2008,positive,anthony hopkins was so great in thisas usualgreat film
Nov 14 2008,negative,more like meet a crappy movie that never ends  i hate unnecessarily long movies especially movies that suck  brad pitt was incredibly annoying  there is so much overacting in this movie i was going to punch something  the only saving grace is the amazing anthony hopkins  seriously though the actress that played the daughter in love with death worst overacting of all time  and the ending made no damn sense  she just suddenly knows that her dad is dead and that the guy she is talking to wasnt the guy she was talking to all along and shes fine with that  and the two of them just walk off to watch the fireworksummreally  not going to check on your dad or anything  what a crapfest
Nov 14 2008,positive,not a bad movie but definatley odd
Nov 13 2008,positive,was a nice movie watchable
Nov 11 2008,negative,cant remember it have no desire to see it again so 1 star
Nov 11 2008,positive,loved the version i was watching vi presento joe black catchy title  unnecessary scenes but pitts acting skills quite intriguinghmm
Nov 10 2008,positive,great story line
Nov 10 2008,negative,i think i fell asleep during this
Nov 9 2008,positive,its kind of like a dark sadistic romance sadistic in that brad pitt is death and you find yourself liking him hehe it is a long movie though nearly 3 hrs i recommend it though
Nov 9 2008,positive,i dont know what is it about claire forlani its some ineffable mix of seduction and playfulness just wow as for the movie its a bit long but there are a lot of good performances from the likes of pitt and hopkins actually pitt was pretty damn funny throughout the movie with his its my first day persona def worth it if you can spare the time 3 hours
Nov 8 2008,positive,beautiful film incredible performance
Nov 7 2008,positive,how death found love                              my favorite flix wit brad

Nov 7 2008,positive,flawless performances from hopkins pitt and forlani one of the best scripts ive ever known great directing and atmosphere one of my favourite films though many may say its too long
Nov 6 2008,positive,this film is boring but everytime its on i cannot stop watching it so deeply compelling at the same time weird but i actually really like it
Nov 5 2008,positive,i love this movie and i dont give a f what u think
Nov 5 2008,positive,i liked the film i thought it was a strong movie the directing plot and acting was all very good but it felt really long far too long and i really didnt like the ending all that much but brad pitt was amazing as usual
Nov 5 2008,positive,the film that has brought out the most emotion in me
Nov 4 2008,positive,doesnt get better than brad pitt and peanut butter 3
Nov 3 2008,positive,up there with usual suspects excellant a must see

Nov 2 2008,positive,one of my favotite movies ever
Nov 2 2008,positive,greatsad at the end but great i love the peanut butter sceneshilarious
Nov 2 2008,positive,before i took time to watch this film i had the notion that it was another routine romance flick and the first 15 minutes just flipped my head upside down  this film though in disguise as a romance has extraordinary tones and messages very few films hold your spirit in wonder as this does the characters remind me of an ensamble of modern day religious figures  like the character of drew who reminded me of a judah for example      the length is very long but the finale is spectacular in my opinion    the birthday party is magical and anthony hopkins fits almost too perfectly in this part      so if youve ever wondered how death takes a holiday look no further
Nov 2 2008,positive,this movie was cool brad pitt did a really good job but i thought some parts of it were long or too predictable
Nov 2 2008,positive,i want to sing with rapture and dance like a dervishyummm  can watch this over  over
Nov 1 2008,positive,everytime someone talks about getting hit by a car i think of this movie
Nov 1 2008,positive,best movie about dying i have seen
Oct 31 2008,neutral,the only good part is when brad pitt gets hit by the car  i watch that repeatedly
Oct 31 2008,positive,good enuff but very drawn out
Oct 31 2008,positive,love this film nout better to watch when ur on a comedown or have a hangover
Oct 30 2008,positive,a tad overlong but the start still gets me and it is quite a touching end
Oct 30 2008,neutral,brad looks yummy in this onemmmm
Oct 30 2008,positive,despite it being brad pitt a good movie
Oct 29 2008,positive,the original death takes a holiday is a good weird film where you kinda go wow and start thinking same thing goes for this one
Oct 29 2008,positive,great cast all beauty of hollywood
Oct 29 2008,positive,i thought anthony hopkins and brad pitt were great in this filmit makes you think how precious and dear life is
Oct 29 2008,positive,i still dont understand this
Oct 29 2008,positive,the storyline was soso but i do love the suits they wear in the movie
Oct 28 2008,positive,great film with great performances from the lead actors the twist at the end is brilliant well written and executed movie
Oct 28 2008,positive,i love this movie to watch brad pit go from death to a normal guy was amazing a must see
Oct 28 2008,positive,death never looked so hot
Oct 27 2008,positive,yay brad pitt when he was young          good movie too p
Oct 27 2008,positive,this film has all the makings of a boring old flick about death however once it starts you realize that this is not the case anthony hopkins is a successful businessman nearing the end of his life and brad pitt is death in the form of a human acting as a guide through hopkins final days death is supposedly void of sentiment and feeling however during the film he falls for claire forlani hopkins daughter this adds an intruiging twist to a potentially dull plot if you are anything like me dont worry if youre not because i know what im talking about then you will love how these people and brad pittthink about it evolve this film is well worth it
Oct 27 2008,positive,i love brad pitt what a great movie meet joe black is a charming delightful and romantic movie wonderful acting by anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani the ending was quite a suprise
Oct 26 2008,negative,brad looks so cute in this movie
Oct 26 2008,positive,i just replay brad pitt being hit by a taxi over and over again
Oct 25 2008,positive,this is one of those movies that really gets to me and draws tears thats for sure on my list a classic i love claire forlani and anthony hopkins and brad before he ruined his imagine by leavin his wife anyway beautiful story
Oct 24 2008,positive,if it wasnt for anthony hopkins i would have despised this film  claire forlani was annoying as alway does she constantly crywhy are her eyes so squinty  and i hate not a strong enough word brad pitt  unfortunately he has some excellent roles but he annoys me  putting that aside he played this part well but i still have to be strongly persuaded about him
Oct 22 2008,positive,really interesting but too long
Oct 21 2008,negative,a great premise and good acting but a little long
Oct 20 2008,positive,not really but its okay hehee
Oct 19 2008,positive,i loved every aspect of this movie i cant believe i had never seen it probably one of brad pitts most convincing acting jobs
Oct 19 2008,neutral,ended up delivering pretty well on what it promised despite the stilted dialogue and pitts and forlanis flatlining performances while the characters never had me as thoroughly as id have liked hopkins presence helped compensate for a lot
Oct 18 2008,positive,5 stars just for the way brad pitt dies in the beginning
Oct 18 2008,positive,its sort of slow but very good
Oct 18 2008,neutral,seems sorta dumb but i actually cried during this
Oct 17 2008,positive,hopkins at his best brad puts in good performance as well very moving film
Oct 16 2008,positive,aaaaah death learns to love  a heart warming tale well told  i especially love the jamacian woman haha  strong solid recommend on this one
Oct 15 2008,positive,this is a great movie  thats all i can say
Oct 15 2008,positive,if youre in the need for something long this romance will set you straight anthony hopkins role is very boring to more focus on the romance
Oct 14 2008,positive,cant imagine that i didnt c it before 
Oct 13 2008,positive,watch the bus scene over and over and it gets five stars
Oct 13 2008,positive,actually though maligned by critics my favorite bp movie
Oct 13 2008,positive,interesting way to look at death
Oct 13 2008,positive,it was nice but they dragged it for tooo long i was starting to lose interest brad pitt was cute the story was good
Oct 13 2008,negative,everything that can possibly go wrong during the course of bringing a bad story to screen is on display here oh and its 3 hours long
Oct 12 2008,positive,really good story acting etc but its way too long if you can stay awake through it its a good movie
Oct 12 2008,neutral,what ever happened to claire forlani
Oct 12 2008,neutral,im sorry but when pitt was getting pinballed i totally thought it was funny
Oct 12 2008,positive,saw this movie for the second time yesterday after such a long timei think its both hopkins and pitts best performancesit steers up a good mix of emotionshad a good story linea dark romantic edge to it too
Oct 11 2008,positive,brad pitt at his best
Oct 11 2008,positive,very original i love brad pitts acting in this and i cry what else do you want from me
Oct 10 2008,positive,are you ready to loose whom you love
Oct 9 2008,positive,life is a gift   i like the idea that joe black is a life taker become a human he conveys an innocent and pure joy of humans elements  anthony hopkins as usualamazing and provoking as a dad and a powerfull bussinessmanoo i cant say much of it just loved it
Oct 9 2008,positive,this film is a must see brad pitts characterization of death is phenomenal one of sir anthony hopkins best portrayals
Oct 9 2008,positive,imeet joe blacki is a beautiful film with a talented cast because it is unique the plot enables humor to be weaved within the dramatic and romantic elements the music composed by thomas newman truly enhances the movie the many string and piano melodies are beautiful and fit smoothly there are so many memorable moments like fatherdaughter conversations and scene in the coffee shop brad pitt in his portrayal of death displays naive and vulnerable feelings skillfully in sharp contrast his behavior at the beginning of the film while some criticize its length and unrealistic aspects of the plot i found it to be so captivating and quite wellmade
Oct 9 2008,positive,this is a remake of the 1930ish movie   death takes a holiday  it is a wonderful well made remake
Oct 8 2008,negative,the most boring flick ive seen in years
Oct 8 2008,positive,i love this film ive seen it about 6 times and watched it again the other night  brad pitt when he was just down right gorgeous before angelina sucked all the life force out of him fantastic acting as usual from anthony hopkins
Oct 8 2008,positive,brad pitts worst movie
Oct 7 2008,negative,slow as hell thought brad pitt looked hot back then but he really didnt
Oct 6 2008,positive,ive watched this 45 times and im still not bored of it brad pitt acted so well along with anthony hopkins a mix of fun sadness and love
Oct 5 2008,positive,weird at first interesting cute funny great acting wellmade ending altogether great
Oct 4 2008,positive,with the exception of it lasting around 3 hours i really enjoyed this movie im not a huge fan of brad pitt but i found that i could tolerate him and actually found him very sweet and innocent the story itself was pretty easy to follow after the first 30 minutes so the rest of the 2 12 were spent wondering how the whole deal would turn out and such again anthony hopkins was great as always and i wouldnt mind seeing this movie again
Oct 4 2008,positive,brad pitt is sooooo sexy in this movie 3
Oct 3 2008,negative,i think i fell asleep watching this

Oct 1 2008,positive,romantic  quite lovely movie it lasts almost 3 hours nevertheless its still full of romance
Sep 30 2008,positive,honestly i am very biased with reviewing this movie  great concept with an awesoming cast but i just dont like brad pitt  the reason is because every female in the world does just because of what he looks like and i do not think  he is very attractive personally  so i cant be honest or fair
Sep 30 2008,positive,brad pitt is good in it silence
Sep 30 2008,positive,say stuff you want to people while they are still alive you never know how long you have them for
Sep 29 2008,positive,somehow this movie had a way of making one think had something about it that i really liked
Sep 29 2008,positive,one of brad pits best films
Sep 29 2008,negative,terrible having this movie in the que on a transatlantic flight is the third circle of  hell the only good part was watching pitts character get plowed under by traffic
Sep 28 2008,negative,the movie was ok pitts hair looked great
Sep 28 2008,positive,he should have got an oscar
Sep 27 2008,positive,i could just melt in brad pitts eyesi fall into a trance

Sep 27 2008,positive,i love watching this film its sad but i cant help but see it till the end 
Sep 26 2008,positive,this is how i feel in public
Sep 26 2008,positive,one of brad pitts best acting roles
Sep 26 2008,positive,the pittster irritatingly handsome as death put in his place by sir tone of hopkins
Sep 25 2008,positive,my favorite movie    its meaning remains with you long afterwards
Sep 25 2008,positive,im a sucker for tragic love story cos in reality it happens
Sep 24 2008,positive,liked the last half an hour rest is too draggy
Sep 23 2008,neutral,a long drawn film with pitt far to serious for fans only
Sep 23 2008,positive,original n beautifully emotional storyline and all of the actors are at their best anthony hopkins rocks
Sep 23 2008,positive,this film is soooo sad iv seen it tons of times its about a man who is dieing and dont know it and hes daughter meets this bloke but he dies and she dont know he comes back as a gardian angle to show her dad  were he belongs which is in heaven the man and hes daughter can see joe black but but he is really dead its a very good film my advice is watch it if you belive in goats and stuff you like this film i do
Sep 23 2008,positive,a fish out of water tail death goes on holiday the grim reaper takes the body of brad pitt and decides to live with and disrupt the remaining few days of big shot anthony hopkins life in the meantime acquiring a fondness for peanut butter and falling in love with hopkins daughter claire forlani who happened to meet the real earth bound brad pitt character early that day in a coffee shop its all very silly but the director trys to play it like a serious drama its overlong and simply cringeworthy in places brads portrayal of death on earth is all childhood innocence and stiff limbed movements its pretty unbelievable that claire would fall this version of the guy compared to the animated young man she met at the coffee shop how she never figured something was amiss with the guy is beyond me and the ending is just daft i think maybe the wrong approach was had here they should have played it more for laughs then tears i reckon that it had an ideal set up for a romcom
Sep 21 2008,positive,seems a love it or hate it movie i love it its long and the story is told slowly and gently never been a particular fan of anthony hopkins but hes great in this as are all the performances
Sep 21 2008,positive,it moves me i am in love with it
Sep 20 2008,positive,damn good moviebrad pitt is pretty hot
Sep 20 2008,neutral,its ok a little boring
Sep 20 2008,negative,too long weak plot it was well shot costumed and pitt did a wonderful acting job  i just couldnt buy the plot i wanted to know blacks motives better i hated that there would be scenes 5 minutes long of just starring at eachother too slow too long ridiculoous plot
Sep 19 2008,positive,an entertaining performance by brad pitt
Sep 18 2008,positive,its much too long but i like the characters and what it has to say it would get five stars if they had kept it shorter
Sep 18 2008,positive,pretty strange movie but pretty good film pitt is great in this movie and so is hopkins strange storyline but good story and plot it was a little hard to follow but in the end is an enjoyable film
Sep 17 2008,positive,this is a dark movie but very enjoyable  brad pitt is great as always
Sep 17 2008,negative,yes but brad pitt  brad pitt
Sep 17 2008,positive,i cry every time i see this movie  you are drawn into the characters  anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani really make you care about what happens to them  marcia gay harden and jeffrey tambor gave excellent performances as well  i had to find the theme song from itunes and buy it      one of those movies that makes you think about it for quite a while after
Sep 17 2008,positive,i liked this movie which is surprising since i dont seem to like many movies with anthony hopkins in them bram stokers dracula is the other one that i can think of  oh mission impossible series of films too i suppose  all the main characters were great likeable hateable whenever they were supposed to be    the dialogue was super intelligent at times and simple at others but always seemed to convey what was meant either way  an example of this is whenever brad pitts character had visited the old jamaican woman in the hospital hed speak with dialogue that matched whomever he was speaking too  also coincidentally brad pitt speaking in a jamaican accent  hilarious    one of the things i didnt like about the film besides the 3 hours of movie  too long for this type of film was the ending spoilers just because death  joe black reverting back to the guy whos body he posessed just ruined his relationship with anthony hopkins characters youngest daughter she fell in love with someone who turned out to be somebody completely different  sort of like drinking chocolate milk for a few sips then it turns into regular white milk and stays that way and youre left with itspoilers    camera work was fine directing was awesome and the story could have had some trimming but it worked especially conveying the emotion of a man  and those around him  knowing just him and joe that his last days are upon him and how he chooses to spend those days
Sep 16 2008,positive,beautifully shot film
Sep 16 2008,positive,not the best movie but the love story is completely captivating pitt is perfect for the role and hopkins is so wonderful to watch the script is very good and hopkins has the best lines
Sep 16 2008,positive,eventho i m not really into romantic movies and love storry  this film really striked me great cast very well made
Sep 15 2008,positive,its got an amazing story line but its sooo slow
Sep 15 2008,positive,william parrish love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived

Sep 9 2008,positive,i ran across meet joe black this evening it is another of those movies that i hold in high regards  meet joe black is a story of media tycoon bill parish just when he is about the celebrate his 65th birthday death literally comes knocking on his door personified as a man who is very curious to learn about people the two come to a bargain of sorts time in exchange for teaching about the wonderment that is human life  this movie is a bittersweet tale of fighting for what you think is important passion and excepting the grander scale of things   anthony hopkins is a phenomenal actor his portrayal of bill parrish was heart felt a rough and tough around the edges business man with an inner softness brad pitts performance as joe black was genius he brought an innocent often enigmatic and funny fervent side to death claire forlani is an often under rated actress she brought great compassion to the role of susan bills daughter martin brest did well in casting the supporting actors in this film as well seasoned performers such as marcia gay harden and jeffery tambor make this movie an even more enjoyable treat   meet joe black is enchanting  this film also has one of the most memorable quotes about love   love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived   i think i need that one a pillow or in a frame somewhere in my house  every time i see meet joe black  i laugh and i have to make sure i have a box of kleenex handy

Sep 6 2008,positive,they were hugging all the time in this film its pretty good though
Sep 6 2008,positive,a feel good movie a bit sappy but well acted
Sep 5 2008,positive,if you dont have a man cruch on brad pitt in this one your lookin balls have some malfunction  claire forlanis look is pretty perfect for the character as well  hard to describe why but it was a pretty good one
Sep 5 2008,positive,i really loved the innocence that brad pitt portrayed in this moviehe showed a side of the reaper of angel of death that most people would never imagine it was a lovely mix of discovery and child like innocence that really set this movie apart it was romantic but held enough of a story that it wasnt all mushy and claustrophobic in its telling i know several men that actually liked this movie besides the fact you have a great cast anthony hopkins was of course as always brilliant just with the cast it was impossible to go wrong it had some twists turns and shows that not all romance movies have to be either blissfully happy or horribly tragic to be damn good entertainment
Sep 4 2008,positive,i know its a chick flic but its good a rereadaptation of death takes a holiday from 1971 and 1934  some clever bits of writing woven amidst positive messages surrounding integrity supportiveness family and facing death  a deliberate pace but that serves to set the proper tone  beautifully shot  perfect lighting  claire forlani is mesmerizing  brad does a respectable job and anthony is always fun to watch
Sep 4 2008,positive,great acting  a bit long but i enjoyed every minute of it
Sep 3 2008,positive,a very intriguing and romantic movie i wouldnt say this is brad pitts best role ever but it sure is one of the most entertaining i thought the movie was perfect up until the last 3 minutes if those were cut the movie would have been flawless

Aug 30 2008,positive,nice little love story with the reality of death love the meaning of love from the dialog of hopkinswell acted brad pitt and hopkins were great
Aug 30 2008,negative,the biggest problem with the movie was that it was draggy one of the main reasons why the movie was so draggy was because the characters took forever to complete their stupid dialogues    whats with the concept   death decides to take a holiday and falls in love while holidaying so what comes next  death decides to retire have a family and settle down    forlani was annoying and pitt was far too ordinary hopkins however was brilliant there are a few laughs and some of the dialogues are decent but the length of the movie just ruins everything
Aug 29 2008,positive,one of the most engrossing films ive ever sat through brad pitt is god
Aug 29 2008,positive,i kinda liked it but it was sad sometimes
Aug 29 2008,negative,good grief b pitt as death i was soooooooooooo bored wiv this movie that i actually found myself looking from scene to scene to see if the continuity person had done a good job yawn

Aug 29 2008,positive,this film is something else a must see
Aug 28 2008,negative,brad pitt as his cheesiest  i dont think i liked anything about this film
Aug 28 2008,positive,i absolutely love this movie i cant articulate my reasons perhaps its the fact that we as a human race do not know everything there is to kow and that is the way god planned it  also i am one of the few females who dosent really get the obsession with the pitt however i have a new found respect for him as a result of this movie
Aug 28 2008,positive,haha love the beginning
Aug 26 2008,positive,can a sexy ghost come and sweep me off my feet
Aug 25 2008,negative,dude that scene you know the one find it on youtube and forget about the rest of the movie

Aug 25 2008,positive,an interesting film with a very original idea
Aug 24 2008,positive,ooh brad pittwhat else can i say
Aug 24 2008,negative,have to see it again fell asleep before the end
Aug 24 2008,negative,brad pitt plays the incarnation of death but the anthropomorphic avatar that ultimately visits all of us during this movie is morpheus see wat i did thar
Aug 23 2008,positive,a completely unexpected joy this movie swept me away must see
Aug 23 2008,positive,jst lovd d idea manso brilliantly actedafter watchin dis ur sure 2 b a fan of anthony hopkinsn brad pit too ofcourse
Aug 23 2008,negative,okay only 19 years behind in watching this epic film  a 3 hour movie that should be 90 mins cheesy 12 love story  14 business  14 spiritual film which means nearly a chickflick  hopkins as always nails his role  pitt and forlani are also wonderful  its the story that has weakness and gaps  the ending is by many questionable and undone
Aug 22 2008,positive,bp at his handsomest
Aug 22 2008,positive,loved both hopkins and pitt in this moviesuperb performance
Aug 22 2008,negative,holy shit i wanted to die

Aug 18 2008,positive,truly amazing performance from pitt and hopkins i really really enjoyed this movie im not one for romance films that much but this one just stole my heart very good film
Aug 18 2008,positive,i finally just saw this i never understood why it was always on tbs for 4 some hours but now i completely understand its a damn good movie and its 3 hours no no no no it doesnt feel like three hours seriously it doesnt i was really captivated by the story and there were times where i thought spoiler alert there would be some cgi elements for death but no there werent which actually made it better than it actually having it so the story is about spoiler alert a guy who has 2 daughters runs a really big company and  death follows him around basically death has observed him for a while and anthony hopkins has led this great life and he wants to see what the world is like and feel what its like to be human in exchange for being deaths guide around everywhere hopkins gets more time to live which is really sad cause when death is not fascinated then the journey is over it all sounds good but im just warning all the guys out there that this is the combination of a heartfelt supernatural romantic twisted chick flick this movie kinda makes itself into a new kind of chick flick category thats manly enough for men ill admit that i felt like tearing up after seeing this and if by the end you dont youre a nazi anyways this is really an amazing film and its definitely going in my top 1015 favorite films go watch it
Aug 18 2008,positive,i laughed my ass off when he got hit by the car lulz
Aug 17 2008,positive,honestly i am very biased with reviewing this movie  great concept with an awesoming cast but i just dont like brad pitt  the reason is because every female in the world does just because of what he looks like and i do not think  he is very attractive personally  so i cant be honest or fair
Aug 17 2008,positive,theres little direction in the questioning of this death character development but then again i dont feel hes in topic of this movie at all just playing the part of the waves carrying a ship of meanings to shore no hollywood fantasy mumbo jumbo here just a delicately laced love story pulled through and over life the core of human emotions its consequences and facing the end of it tinged with the platform of class beautiful script unique front the little bits of literary humours backed by gabriel yareds beautiful compositions i just simply love the flow there are so many lines in this movie i probably wont forget was a little edgy with pitts acting but i think he managed it otherwise a little distracting but yeah lol i love the discovery of peanut butter scene he was quite adorable with the whole pb obsession lol p  somewhere over the rainbow
Aug 17 2008,positive,the one thing i got out of this movie is that there are so many tiny details in our lives that if only we paid a little more attention to we would appreciate gods infinite bounties
Aug 17 2008,negative,boringboringboring went on for ever with neverending scenes and horrible cliches
Aug 16 2008,positive,so good but im still trying to figure out the theme
Aug 16 2008,positive,a touching story i have never seen brad pitt look as cute not in a physical way as he did playing as an innocent death
Aug 16 2008,positive,good amount of humor but a sad ending
Aug 16 2008,positive,peanut butter rocks  claire forlani does not
Aug 15 2008,negative,another remake for no damn good reason

Aug 9 2008,positive,one of my all time favourites phew brad
Aug 9 2008,negative,this film seemed to never end boring
Aug 9 2008,positive,one of the best brad pitt movies ever created this is a very slow movie but you have to watch it at least once
Aug 8 2008,positive,brad pitt is death and he falls with this chick the catch is he is supposed to take her father fucked up
Aug 8 2008,positive,i can watch this movie a million times and yet i still cry every time this is my all time fav
Aug 7 2008,neutral,i never really understood the motive of the film and was confused for the most part
Aug 6 2008,positive,this is a great love story
Aug 5 2008,positive,meet mr black and let him fall in love with you
Aug 5 2008,positive,although some may argue that its too long for its own good hopkins and pitt keep you interested the whole time great piece of film making and a truly touching story
Aug 5 2008,positive,going in to this 180minute treck i knew not one thing about this other than the cast i never expected to see what i saw i never expected to cry like i cried the romance is wonderful but the fatherdaughter relationship is beautiful and so deep
Aug 4 2008,positive,i know i know but i actually liked it
Aug 4 2008,positive,i cant really point out one reason why i liked this movie so much but it was probably because anthony hopkins is just great no matter what part he is playing
Aug 4 2008,positive,fave bit the unexpected hit by car bit classic
Aug 4 2008,positive,well brad pitt is popping up a lot on this list but what can i say he is a great actor this film from beginning to end show cases some of the best writing direction and cinematography that hollywood has to offer once again brad pitt is not given the recognition he deserves for the superb job he does simply because hes always tagged as the pretty boy
Aug 4 2008,positive,not a big brad pitt fan but what a clever way to present death awesome love scene
Aug 4 2008,positive,really great i think even though a bit long for one evening and maybe the oversweeted happyend could be less sweet
Aug 3 2008,neutral,to not have loved is to not have lived  anthony hopkins is amazing in this movie  im a huge brad pitt fan but i felt like he brought this movie down  i think he got confused and portrayed a retard  a little long but a good story  kind of like city of angels and a little like encino man  but maybe thats just because of brad pitts performance
Aug 3 2008,positive,brad is pretty  hopkins is great as usual forlani looks like she has something in her eye in every scene
Aug 3 2008,neutral,conventional but nice and brad is really goodd why does anthony keep doing these
Aug 3 2008,positive,a wierd premise but you know i actually really liked it
Aug 2 2008,neutral,watching brad pitt get hit by a car rewinding it and watching over and over again makes this movie worth watching
Aug 2 2008,positive,like this moviebut the overemoting of claire forlaini was a bit over the top
Aug 2 2008,positive,most of my friends seem to really hate this movie and so do many critics but this film is probably one of my absolute favorites anthony hopkins rich president of a media corporation offers you several memorable quotes of advice to his friends and children that youll be sure to remember brad pitt plays one of his most unusual roles as a man whom bill parishs hopkins daughter meets in a coffee bar and then is later hit by a bus and death takes over his body in hopes of seeing the world as humans do most people do not know claire forlani but she has played parts in several movies such as the rock mall rats and mystery men her part as susan parish is sure to remind most men of the sweet american girl that you met in high school who was perfect many complaints of the film are that it is too long 3 hrs and lacks little or no special fx but i disagree a good film shouldnt always require fx to tell a great story and the films length is perfect in the way that it allows you to soak up the story inch by inch the music is amazing as well and more than makes up for the lack of fx
Aug 2 2008,positive,cute handsome brad pitts expressions
Aug 2 2008,positive,good but i expected it would be even better
Aug 1 2008,positive,one of my most favorite movies of all time

Jul 29 2008,positive,just was wondering if life ater death is like that and it had a good message
Jul 28 2008,neutral,the only reason i like this movie is when brad pitt gets hit by the car probably the funniest thing pitt ever did  i used to rewind and replay that part over and over
Jul 28 2008,positive,death or notill follow brad pitt anywhere or anthony perkins for that matter
Jul 28 2008,positive,has brad pitt in it  need i say more lol

Jul 26 2008,positive,intriguing  the ending always makes me cry no matter how many times i watch it im a daddys girl too
Jul 26 2008,positive,no one could ever beat love not even death
Jul 26 2008,positive,brad pitt and claire forlani have such chemistry as coffee shop guyjoe and susan    the script is so quotable  youll be thinking about the soundtrack long after the movies over  xd
Jul 25 2008,positive,nearly a perfect movie  its got everything going for it so what could foul up the works  call central casting they might have a clue  although incredible as a rich wannabe revolutionary in terry gilliams twelve monkeys brad pitt is simply out of his depth here his boynextdoor awshucks routine wearing thin after a minute  he has to play death taking the guise of a human and pitt himselfis just too young to understand the finality that that might imply  he triesbut its not enough and his inexperience undercuts every scene hes in  anthony hopkins as always almost effortlessly brings nothing but the goods  claire forlani surprises  marcia gay harden and jeffrey tambor are rock solid  and jake weber had me wondering why he wasnt more visible  a great might have been
Jul 25 2008,negative,death in a suit  cant sit through it
Jul 25 2008,positive,an under rated film  still waters run deep pitt is always a better actor than i think hell be  who knew peanut butter could be so wonderful

Jul 23 2008,positive,anthony hopkins e un film abbastanza interessante ma non imperdibile
Jul 22 2008,positive,great movie and dealt with some interesting issues surrounding the odyssey which is life  although a little too pretentious for mainstream middleclass audiences this is still worth a watch and elegantly played by the likes of hopkins and pitt
Jul 22 2008,positive,ahh brad pittone of the main reasons i have watched this a lotalso though because it is goodit always touches me i guessmakes you actually feel somethingrather than just watching it for the sake of doing somethingits just surrounded withwonder i guessit definately can stand on its own

Jul 21 2008,positive,this is the slowest moving movie ive ever seen
Jul 21 2008,positive,i enjoyed this  brad pitt is so easy on the eyes
Jul 21 2008,positive,careful bill youll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation    the finality of death is inarguably the greatest sadness faced by humanity at any instant any of us could cease to exist without any warning its a morbid and depressing reality but every single one of us is going to die someday if your life was to terminate in a few short days how would you spend your final hours on earth with loved ones would you pursue the fulfilment of your lifelong dreams watch your favourite movie and listen to your favourite music just once more give up and simply mourn your imminent passing running at a hair under three hours meet joe black  director martin brests loose adaptation of the 1934 motion picture death takes a holiday  is an absorbing contemplative examination of death the protagonist of the movie is faced with his imminent demise and confronted with the question of how he should spend the final days of his life    meet joe black posits the idea that the grim reaper wants to tour the world as a mortal human to be his tour guide he selects multimillionaire and successful corporate tycoon william parrish hopkins whose soontobecelebrated 65th birthday will be his last during the leadup to his birthday bill begins to hear a mysterious voice inside his head after dismissing this as a mere hallucination hes soon visited by death adopting the name joe black pitt personified in the body of a recentlydeceased young man bill is told hes about to die but will be given more time in exchange for acting as deaths earthly guide as long as the grim reaper remains interested he will remain on holiday but once he tires of life and wishes to return to the next place hell take bill with him during his selfappointed vacation death is educated in valuable lessons about humanity in addition to learning about love as he develops strong feelings for bills daughter susan forlani    after martin brest was initially intrigued by the premise of death takes a holiday he spent several decades developing a screenplay for his own take on the premise with which he felt comfortable after completing scent of a woman in 1992 brest turned his attention to meet joe black which was at long last released in 1998 for universal pictures the movie probably seemed like a great idea but gradually developed into something of a nuisance it ran overbudget and its production period was far longer than scheduled with its threehour runtime the film received predominantly negative reviews and it underperformed at the box office although the film curiously manages to remain enthralling over its runtime the threehour runtime for such a simple story seems unnecessary    in human form death doesnt possess the aura of authority one would expect and seems virtually childlike in his lack of familiarity of the simplest human behaviour however the script cheats with joe black by keeping his character inconsistent whenever its convenient for joe to be perplexed and naïve he is placed in that position yet there are times when the character must exhibit power and understanding in order to further the plot and thus joe suddenly speaks and thinks in ways which were seemingly impossible to him earlier for instance just as a viewer accepts death as an untutored individual he suddenly summons the ability to converse with a dying woman in her native jamaican dialect why is it that hes unable to speak simple english but is fluent in jamaican in addition joe has no knowledge of how to conduct himself during board meetings but seems to know a great deal about the business world when he needs to turn the tables in bills favour    the intention of this review is not to compare the film with death takes a holiday since brests adaptation is an independent entity which just further explores the underlying concept yet meet joe black lacks a crucial constituent which was a major feature of death takes a holiday exploring how the universe would cope with the grim reaper on vacation the original movie potently illustrated a world with sickness and injury but without death but this fascinating aspect is almost entirely ignored by meet joe black which spends its threehour duration concentrating on a budding romance and a corporate takeover scheme the only shred of evidence of this concept being explored in brests film is in a subplot involving the aforementioned dying jamaican woman however this womans pain is superficial  she implores death to take her but we never really feel her pain another pertinent flaw is the overuse of dramatic pauses with brests camera observing the characters as they exchange unnecessarily prolonged longing glances    regardless of its flaws theres a great deal to appreciate about meet joe black its excellent mature entertainment and in no way is it an overly bloated or indulgent affair  its merely in no hurry to examine the lives of its protagonists the film occasionally feels its threehour length but it keeps you interested thanks to wonderful acting and sublime visual allure the 90 million budget is employed effectively with terrific production design and a truly wonderful score courtesy of thomas newman    anthony hopkins it would seem is incapable of delivering a dud performance this role affords hopkins a number of scenes in which he can convey the humanity and reflection of a man who has lived a great life but is forced to come to terms with the fact that its drawing to a close hopkins is strongwilled as william parrish hes somewhat comical at times while intimidating and chilling at other times brad pitts performance as death is enormously effective pitt plays his character with admirable conviction and his demeanour is beautifully understated naïve and unique conveying that his character has no idea what it means to be human meanwhile claire forlani submits a tremendously nuanced portrayal of bills daughter susan  shes convincing and engaging though at times she resembles a deer caught in a cars headlights jake weber is suitably contemptible as drew while topshelf support is provided by marcia gay harden and jeffrey tambor    with sharper editing tauter direction and a few script revisions meet joe black couldve been a far superior motion picture be that as it may this is a film of limitless charm which is certainly worth watching for its penetrating views of mortality and its audacious intentions long but curiously never boring and spiritual but never soggy this is a brand of cinematic entertainment hollywood rarely gets right while the definitive version of death takes a holiday is yet to be made meet joe black remains an admirable engaging attempt
Jul 20 2008,positive,young love and great movie to watch
Jul 20 2008,negative,this thing just meanders and meanders and meanders  your time which this movie tries to demand far too much of would be better spent contemplating the mechanics of eating razorblades or watching a kickass prison drama like oz
Jul 19 2008,positive,it was a great brad pitt moment again who knew death is as beautiful

Jul 17 2008,positive,a modern fairy tale for adults note the manass and ladynipples might not be appropriate for the kiddies beautiful cinematography and very wordy yet interesting dialogue help to craft a somewhat hyperrealistic world at 3 hours it is a bit on the long side but anthony hopkins overstated performance and brad pitts understated one make it worth sticking around till the end this is classic romantic filmmaking and no im not gay for brad pitt
Jul 17 2008,neutral,the problem with this movie was it was too darn long  if the pace was quicker length would not have been a problem  the movie wasnt so boring that it was unwatchable but i still felt like i couldnt wait for it to get over

Jul 15 2008,positive,oh my god its a proper chick flick lushbut get u hankies ready
Jul 15 2008,positive,hate to admit it but it makes me weep every time i see it  the opening scene with hopkins having a heart attack brings back painful memories of my father
Jul 15 2008,positive,watched this one about the sixth time last week i could never tie watching pitt in this one his character is amazing so witty and charming not forgetting hot i like how openended the film is and the turn of events is fantastic i even found this one spiritual to a certain degree  one of my all time favorites
Jul 14 2008,negative,talk about overblown and boring  this is both
Jul 14 2008,negative,when joe gets hit by the car hilarity
Jul 14 2008,negative,plodding and meandering the only movie i can think of where the comic highlight is a fatal car accident
Jul 14 2008,positive,true masterpiece  this film is so complex yet so simple that one would have to listen to me in person describe this film  i not only adore it for brad pitt and anthony hopkins but the spark the film shines for the viewer is almost unreal
Jul 14 2008,positive,watched again still one of my favourites

Jul 13 2008,positive,great film watched this around 2000 if my memory serves me well i can still remember some parts of it actually back then claire forlani was one of my favourite actresses and i loved her in this brad pitt and anthony hopkins were both great as well
Jul 12 2008,positive,great movie but they didnt know how to end it    it would have had a much better impact if they didnt try to over dramatize it
Jul 12 2008,positive,lightening could strike
Jul 12 2008,positive,you just have to love the peanutbutter scene
Jul 12 2008,neutral,overrated ladies sorry
Jul 12 2008,positive,i like chick flicks and this is actually a very well put together movie
Jul 12 2008,positive,im sure im not the only person who upon hearing the concept of this film thought to himself how wonderful it would be to be carried away to the afterlife by brad pitt anywaythinking on the essential life of an entity such as death by symbiosis of human life may seen wishful at the least but then again death has been historically know to create bonds unite love and family and even say the lives of those left behind so the philosophy works of course death being disgustingly beautiful helps too
Jul 11 2008,positive,review will be written whenif rewatched probability low    first viewing 22091999
Jul 11 2008,positive,i loved this movie  even though its 3 hours long it was interesting enough that it didnt feel any longer than a regular movie  i highly reccomend that everyone see it at least once
Jul 11 2008,positive,one of my favourite movies it has a great storyline with morals and emotions fine actorsactresses however the movie on way to long it could have been condensed down to bout 2 hours at most
Jul 11 2008,positive,it may be over long and soppy but its also excellently filmed and has a great hopkins performance
Jul 10 2008,positive,good movie but dragged out way too long
Jul 10 2008,positive,all i can  say is brad   pitt aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Jul 10 2008,positive,im apparently in a phase where im rediscovering movies ive seen before and i happened to come across meet joe black yesterday evening this was the third time i was watching it and i was ever more impressed by the great movei it is catching on to a whole new array of subtle things i hadnt caught on to the first two times    the concept itself is already a very thrilling and inspiring idea and brad pitt plays out his part as death in a very deep and emotional way the point is to show death as an entity who wants to discover what exactly life is and even though he has his flaws being powerful and threatening at times he doesnt come out as the big bad evil like some modern representations would do instead he comes out somewhat naive and curious though it doenst make him look foolish but quite on the contrary confident death has no idea what human culture is like so he has a hard time grasping on to certain elements of human behavior and emotion  especially at the beginning of the movie   indeed along the way death partly lets go of his deity apearances and beyond just exoperiencing the physical world that we inhabite he lives a much deeper experience becoming a bit human and knowing things such as emotions this transformation is especially expressed through the love story that develops between him and susan the daughter of the man hes decided to follow throughout this experience on earth    the three hour length is not necessarily a bad thing as long as youre able to stay focused on all the action for meet joe black is not a movie of great action no special effects were used but rather one of emotion and so this goes through a lot of dialogue and passive scenes if youre able to get into it and to keep up with the story which isnt very difficult to grasp other than the length over which is develops i think the experience of this movie can be a great one for it is packed with immense emotion which made me shiver several times throughout the viewing
Jul 10 2008,positive,kinda slow but i loved it i could watch it a million times over and not get tired brad pitt is amazing as death i never thought he could really act until i saw this movie anthony hopkins was awesome as always  
Jul 9 2008,negative,anthony hopkins superb acting as always is destroy by even the mention of the namebrad pitt
Jul 9 2008,positive,one of the best performances of brad pitt
Jul 9 2008,positive,a rare good brad pitt movie  one of my all time favorites
Jul 9 2008,negative,honestly kind of retarded the plot holes are many and spread thick on the ground
Jul 8 2008,positive,slow moving at time and a 3 hour run time is a negative but if you can sit through those slow times it truly is a good movie    stop blowing smoke up my ass youll ruin my autopsy  the best line in the movie
Jul 8 2008,positive,i cried so hard at the end
Jul 8 2008,positive,at first i find it boring but its okay since brad pitt is the actor he was so cute especially when he acted ignorant and eating peanut butter but what i like most in this movie is the theme it talks about life death and love splendid
Jul 7 2008,positive,one of the best films i have ever seen excellent character development and a musical score that truly enhances the depth of the story
Jul 7 2008,positive,an amazing movieshear brilliance and anthony hopkins meets pittin this movie was spectacular

Jul 7 2008,positive,beautiful story of loving and loosing i do know the feeling
Jul 6 2008,positive,awe i love this movie and peanut butter
Jul 6 2008,positive,somewhat of an anomally this one  a three hour long fantasy romance where nothing much happens that has been made some fifty years after this sort of thing stopped being popular    it may not have been a success critically or financially but it just plain works  i have never seen a three hour long movie that flows as easily and gently as this one does  nothing much happens but its paced so perfectly that it feels like a tight 100 minutes  the direction is very straight and unshowy but the look is crisp and gorgeous and the performances are fantastic all round  nobody is sidelined and they all leave their mark  brad is a joy to watch in this  the character itself may be lacking a little in the potential darkness that lies beneath but all in all its a wonderfull creation  hopkins of course displaying all the dignity and power that only he can but its actually jeffrey tambor who steals every scene that hes in  it is a rich and wonderfull tale and it has one of the best pedestrian vs car deaths in movie history
Jul 6 2008,negative,love pitt and hopkins on the same screen a bit to slow and long
Jul 6 2008,negative,good start but clicheed  boring pitt has as much charisma as a bowl of cornflakes
Jul 5 2008,positive,i thought this film was very touching and very well done  though the film is very long the large amount of time allows for well laid character development  the main characters are very well portrayed  i tip my hat to brad pitt whose characterization took me by surprise  anothy hopkins was superb as usual  this is the first time ive seen clair forlani in a major role as opposed to her smaller roles in films such as the rock and mystery men and i felt she did well and brought good emotion to her character  overall i found this film to be very enjoyable
Jul 5 2008,positive,this movie really touched me deeply
Jul 5 2008,negative,on the plus side theres something about the pace that i liked but not for this story wow this was bad
Jul 5 2008,positive,a little strange but good
Jul 5 2008,positive,great movie a reflection of truth better than the first time made
Jul 5 2008,positive,totally original  the only film i can watch again and again  only brad could play death and be so sexy

Jul 1 2008,positive,awh such a fantastic cast anthony hopkins was great so was a very naked brad pitt
Jun 30 2008,positive,puts life into perspective if you can survive the 3hour runtime
Jun 30 2008,positive,a fabulous tale of death itself learning the value of life this film stands on simple truths that all of us should live by but for the most part choose to overlook its a great film yet its undeservedly underappreciated the acting was very good especially from hopkins my only complaint was the run time this couldve easily been cut to 220230 instead of 3 full hours
Jun 30 2008,positive,hmm thoughtfuland a good turn by brad as well i thought
Jun 30 2008,positive,a strange but interesting movie brad pitt plays death very well its occasionally moving but on the whole its a little slow
Jun 30 2008,positive,theres only so much look at brad pitt isnt he adorable watch him slyly smile and look away one person can take and 3 hours really
Jun 30 2008,positive,ooooooh now this is a true love story the love of a man and a woman but also the moving tale of the love of a father for his daughters own it
Jun 30 2008,positive,another excellent film
Jun 29 2008,positive,this movie definitely took me by surprise i was expecting one of those often recycled love stories you know the ones with the rich girl who falls in love with a poor bloke and argues with millionaire daddy about love conquering alli wondered how anthony hopkins could act in such crap this was beneath him   but thensurprise this movie actually went beyond dumb romanceand made death seem humourous i was so wrong to think for even a moment that anthony would act in a dumb romance flick as millionaire daddy who doesnt beleive that love conquers all this is definitely worth a watch even if only to watch death discover the hidden nuances of peanut butter
Jun 29 2008,positive,not a big brad pitt fan but this movie rocked
Jun 29 2008,positive,i totally remember seeing this movie in the theaters with my mom and calling it when joe got hit by the car
Jun 29 2008,negative,brad pitt another statuelike performance

Jun 28 2008,positive,cool story  great cast well except for the girl  i dont believe her character so much  i dont know if its the acting the character itself the writing or the direction
Jun 28 2008,positive,only seen half of it twice but i love anthony hopkins
Jun 28 2008,positive,i could watch brad over and over and over again and again and again in this
Jun 28 2008,positive,very slow but not bad
Jun 27 2008,positive,different to what i thought it was going to be however i did enjoy it  a little confusing at parts too
Jun 27 2008,negative,ahhhh it goes without saying that this is the worst movie of all time i challenge anyone to find me a worse one  and before you ask i saw it with my grandma
Jun 27 2008,positive,took 10yrs butno one spoiled it and i really enjoyed it despite the running time i really liked it
Jun 27 2008,positive,really good movie if you want to rent a movie get this one it is slow but i love it
Jun 27 2008,positive,this movie is still touching to see through it seems on the dry side  a good movie to cry over
Jun 27 2008,positive,i can sum it up in one wordsexy
Jun 27 2008,positive,all you need is a glass of vino and you are in heaven just sip and gaze sip and gaze sip and 
Jun 27 2008,positive,much maligned movie very slow but it has some interesting parts i have seen a lot worse than this
Jun 26 2008,positive,a curious dramatic film brad pitts death portrayal was good  most of the time but the real acting here was done by anthony hopkins you could feel this character emotions in every scene amazing soundtrackthis film seems fresher everytime i catch it on tv claire forlani was smoking hot here too andehhyeah her acting was cool too ha ha ha
Jun 26 2008,positive,love this film makes me think
Jun 26 2008,positive,oh jesus i cried like a little girl through this movie really nicely done but good lord keep tissues on hand
Jun 26 2008,positive,excellent writing i can watch brad get whopped over and over and over thank god for rewind great flick to boot nice story
Jun 26 2008,positive,its a good movie to watch just to learn from it bad or good
Jun 25 2008,positive,the only show where i think brad pitt looked good and sexy
Jun 24 2008,positive,everyone is gorgeous so you dont care that she might have slept with the devil or something
Jun 24 2008,positive,brad pit looks hilarious when he gets hit by a carthe only real part i remember about the movie
Jun 23 2008,negative,if theyd said he was an emissary of death maybe it wouldve made a little more sense  face it the only worthwhile thing of the movie is the 6 seconds bing bang run over
Jun 23 2008,positive,brad pitt anthony hopkins need i say more
Jun 23 2008,positive,okay so i heard good things about it and was really excited about watching it but the movie drags on a bit the idea is great but i would have appreciated more of a backstory more about the parrishes brad pitt as death is brilliant and his acting is the best thing in this film i must say
Jun 23 2008,negative,only when he gets hit by the car i like it
Jun 23 2008,negative,this movie is quite dull and has the worst acting ive seen of these guys  the best part of course is right near the beginning and its all downhill from there
Jun 22 2008,positive,the premise of this movie is so painful but fascinating philosophical and tender anthony hopkins redeemed himself after his awful lotfall performance  dignified tough and very human brad pitt was almost charming claire forlani was excellent  and just so lovely
Jun 22 2008,positive,didnt thnk i would like this  but the relationships between father and daughters fascinates me  i relate to the less favored daughter  her speech to her dad where she admits she was never his favorite but realized she never lacked for ay good thing  really touched me  the movie makes you think about the brevity of life and making the most of our time on earth
Jun 22 2008,negative,i didt like this movie all that much  claire forlani is a terrible actress and she ruined most of this movie for me
Jun 22 2008,negative,an update of death takes a holiday meet joe black is a brilliant film even though it wasnt accepted rather well the acting saves this movie the directors choice for moments of slow scenes without dialogue got a bit old after a while but its still a good watch
Jun 22 2008,positive,very well acted and interesting story loved the slow pace but some scenes could have been cut out cuz some bits r a bit unnecessaryall 4 brad and the car accident tho
Jun 22 2008,positive,so sweet the mood the story the characters perfect

Jun 21 2008,positive,brad pitt at his most gorgous
Jun 20 2008,neutral,its okay if you like chick flicks
Jun 20 2008,positive,one of the great hollywood mysteries to me along with why owen wilson is a bigger star than his brother luke is what happened to claire forlanis movie career  she had it all looks talent and the lead starring opposite golden boy brad pitt in his newest star vehicle meet joe black  unfortunately the movie flopped   then she disappeared  well at least well always have nyc and the hamptons    say what you will and many critics did meet joe black does have its charms  a competent updating of the old classic death takes a holiday mjb provides a showcase for brad pitt and his colorist to prove hes not just another pretty face  hes a pretty face with hair men and women have died trying to attain  the cast hes surrounded by are all top notch but the most important aspect of this movie for me are the sets  this movie is architechtual digest porn to me  i could watch it forever and still never get enough  recommended
Jun 19 2008,negative,all women like it so it must be worth something i know
Jun 19 2008,positive,a wonderful piece of acting and filmmaking

Jun 18 2008,positive,absolutely love this movie i watched it wen i was small yet i remember how much i loved it the story line maybe simple but there were a lot of emotions displayed throughout the whole movie making it very touching and sweet its also the first movie that made me realise brad pitt is actually quite good looking
Jun 17 2008,positive,this might seem horrible but the whole reason i like this movie is the scene where joe gets slammed by two cars  it makes me crack up every time
Jun 17 2008,positive,must seen movie so romanticeven the evil can feel love 
Jun 17 2008,positive,do you have any penut butter
Jun 17 2008,positive,an interesting story about life and death with a somewhat bizarre approach i really liked the majority of the movie but found several parts to be a little awkward or having poor dialog overall quite good though
Jun 17 2008,positive,a little predictable but pretty good
Jun 17 2008,positive,it was release in 1998 i came up to see this movie and cruel intentions in 1999 after one and another since thn i become big fan of this movie  simply i loved it
Jun 17 2008,positive,i love this film brad is fab in it
Jun 17 2008,positive,good movie not what i expected
Jun 16 2008,positive,woww brad just rrrrrrr
Jun 16 2008,neutral,worth it to see brad pitt in the gnarliest car accident ever turn off after that thoughso pretentious
Jun 16 2008,positive,really long movie  i think it could have been done in a smaller cut of the film though i still do love it its subtle in its story but still very emotional
Jun 16 2008,positive,my favourite moviei watched it for my 7th time today
Jun 15 2008,positive,well this one thank you jeannine now im in love with yes joe blackbrad pitt your so hot

Jun 15 2008,negative,seeing brad pitt get hit by a car twice is undefinable awesomeness
Jun 15 2008,positive,i loved this movie
Jun 15 2008,positive,really dark and really sad but a great movie nonetheless
Jun 14 2008,positive,a lot of people didnt like pitts acting in this movie i thought it made it curiously entertaining anthony hopkins is brilliant as usual
Jun 14 2008,negative,slow and made for the purpose of showing what exactly a 100 million dollar drama looks like this was one of the most expensive non special effect film ever made and where the fuck did all the money go besides brad and anthonys pockets the plot was soso concept interesting but underused and its loooong as hell
Jun 14 2008,positive,i really enjoyed watching this one it was a bit slow at times being three hours long but it kept my attention throughout brad pitt and anthony hopkinscant get much better than that
Jun 13 2008,positive,i just hope they made a better ending
Jun 12 2008,negative,only my sister knows my feelings about this movie
Jun 12 2008,positive,not bad till the ending which consisted of the most awkward forced contrived unbelieve hash of garbage dialogue i ever sat through  for this film
Jun 11 2008,neutral,gag but i really like claire forlani now that ive seen this
Jun 10 2008,negative,like a turgid souffle of vomit and cheese overbaked and then surgically stripped of all charm
Jun 10 2008,positive,yes it is long and slow but it is a great movie
Jun 10 2008,positive,it takes a little getting into but its a great story and proves the oldies are the goodies 
Jun 9 2008,neutral,overall an ok movie   but  both main actors have a scene or two that really stands out
Jun 9 2008,positive,young brad pitt is so cute
Jun 9 2008,positive,proof that amidst the 90s hollywood still knew the importance of asking the big questions and answering a few of them too also any movie where death falls for peanut butter is a musthave
Jun 9 2008,positive,a wonderfully unusual premise death takes a vacation from the ole reaping of souls and decides to visit the mortals on earth sounds simple enough  until death pitt falls in love with alan parishs hopkins daughter forlani     then things get complicated  aside from death learning about life in much a similar way as kittens learn by play  the movie itself centers around the relationship if you can call it that between death and parish    there are 1 or 2 amusing moments the peanut butter part and the bit near the end where death exposes his identity but not in the way youd expect    all in all a good movie  its a shame about the ending though that could have been done so very differently but perhaps a sequel starring the undead any takers
Jun 9 2008,positive,kinda strange but a good movie
Jun 8 2008,positive,its amazing i love this film i even have a quote from it in my profile brad pitt sends shilvers down my spine playing a dead person how did he ever do his research on how to play a dead person i always cry at the end loveee it
Jun 8 2008,positive,brill movie brad pit actually acts amazing in this movie one of his best i think
Jun 8 2008,negative,im sorry death falling in love with a human is completely ridiculous

May 30 2008,positive,i really enjoyed this movie but you have to have patients while watching it of course they could have sped up the movie and still got the point across but for a 90s movie it was great terrific acting and a very nice surprising ending
May 30 2008,positive,fantastic brad pitt is marvelous as is of course anthony hopkins
May 30 2008,positive,this movie threw me for a loop also i really think brad pitt is a terrific actor who is overshadowed by his sexsymbol status

May 28 2008,positive,love the soundtrack more than i like the movie
May 28 2008,positive,i thought this movie was amazing and a great plot the acting of brat pit anthony hopkins and claire forlani were fantastic i really loved joe blacks acting when he becomes death and how he has to learn things and how he discribes things too i did feel that the plot line went on a bit too long although it was funny and serious enough to keep you going i did think this is the first movie where the mc dies and you arent sad about it
May 28 2008,negative,good movie to watch with your partner bradd pitt plays an excellent part
May 28 2008,positive,death loves peanutbutter
May 27 2008,positive,big reason to why i like this movie is brad pitts acting i loved the whole speech dialogue from him he was like a puppy discovering life
May 27 2008,positive,this movie is a masterpiece
May 27 2008,positive,anthony hopkins is one of my favorite actors he is so precise but the film didnt turn out as i imagined kind of girly for my taste very sad girls will probably cry great movie to watch with a chick exellent plot though didnt know what i was in for
May 27 2008,positive,fantastic moviei know its been around a while but i just saw it
May 27 2008,positive,beautiful acting on the part of brad pitt i havent seen too much of his work shocking i know but this film gives me hope that hes more than just hype a poignant and touching story
May 27 2008,neutral,such a waste acting by both anthony hopkins and brad pitt is great but too many weepy music interludes and significant pauses while looking at the beautiful people    i was pretty disappointed overall
May 27 2008,positive,this one was long but oh so good
May 26 2008,positive,screenplay and dialog are nearly perfect

May 26 2008,positive,bring out the tissuesits a tear jerker
May 26 2008,positive,anthony hopkins and brad pitt  doesnt that say it all
May 26 2008,positive,this is one of the few movies i actually own i saw a buddy of mine review it on here and it made me want to get it out and watch it all over again i havent done that yet but its brilliant whether i watch it again or not
May 25 2008,positive,meet joe black is a great exercise in the expression of true love conquering all including death itself or himself but the film most especially at its conclusion faces missed opportunities that stand out as obvious and frustrating the behavior of these characters often feels nonrepresentational of the genre and surroundings they are a part of additionally it should be noted that a picture of this type does not require three hours of reeltime and thus begins to loiter exhaustingly this is probably brad pitts weakest performance he is obviously only built for select roles and not such heightened challenges but kudos to legendary characteractor jeffery tambor for his phenomenal portrayal of the complex entertaining binding character quince
May 25 2008,positive,the ending does it for me
May 25 2008,positive,omg its the great
May 25 2008,positive,i love when brad pitt eats peanut butter
May 24 2008,negative,martin brest would go on to direct gigli but this threehour yawner is to my mind more disastrous
May 24 2008,negative,martin brest would go on to direct gigli but this threehour yawner is to my mind more disastrous

May 24 2008,positive,an excellent movie that needed to be an hour shorter
May 24 2008,positive,forgot how good this movie actually was
May 24 2008,positive,although it was long its pretty good
May 24 2008,positive,i just watched this movieagain probably for the third time still in love with it i mean it has a one of a kind storyline making it unique at the same time you wonder if you were visited by death and told that you days are numbered what would you do how would you react suddenly everything else doesnt seem so important anymore the acting was good but the score by thomas newmanit  was perfect as it allowed the viewers to feel each character and understand what they were going through thumbs up watch it
May 23 2008,positive,i love itone of my favourites the story is  really nice and the actors are really good especially brad pitt can someone stay emotionless while watching it
May 23 2008,positive,loved this film can watch it again and again
May 23 2008,neutral,thomas newmans score and strong performances from hopkins and pitt make this overlong mess much better than it should be

May 23 2008,positive,i thought this was quite a touching poignant and it made me cry seen it a few times

May 22 2008,positive,honestly i still dont get the ending of this movie but i think its amazing its a simple movie to fall asleep to as a find myself doingnot because its boring but because its not very much action of crude language not intense just a simply drama that you could either watch while fully awake or pop in as you are turning in for the night plus angelina jolie is totally lucky to get to lay in the arms of the beautiful brad pitt
May 22 2008,positive,there should be more movies with our favorite stars getting hit by two cars
May 22 2008,positive,i dont what it is about this movie
May 22 2008,positive,really surprising this was an excellent movie with some long parts but i think that even if i would of cut them off they make the movie more emotional a good way to force people to think about something no one will escape death
May 22 2008,positive,theres a soft spot in my heart for claire forlani after mallrats
May 22 2008,negative,i remember thinking it was unfortunately too late to get my 5 back
May 22 2008,positive,a powerful and thought provoking movie this movie was great to watch and the story line was something truly different it showed a different side of the angle of death or death itself claire forlani looks like an angel in this movie would recommend it to anyone 
May 22 2008,positive,first of all whoever wrote the synopsis for this film has obviously never seen it it is dead wrong   at first glance one might think this is a classic chic flick starring brad pitt but that is so not true  this is a movie about anthony hopkins character facing the end of his life  there is a brilliant relationship between he and deathjoe black is deathyou really feel this big powerful man respecting his life and all his loves  claire forlani is so delicate in this movie you can hardly breathe watching her  the feel of this movie is just raw emotionloved it

May 20 2008,positive,this movie comes as close to perfect as can possibly be done the acting was perfect by all the storyline was great and a nice mix of emotions evinced by it some humor some seriousness but no sadness i kept envisioning one ending but ended up with another mind you the actual ending was what it should be but i kept thinking it would be different but as it turns out the ending was perfect and i wouldnt change anything    well thats not exactly true but i wont say what because i dont want to spoil it anyway i suggest everyone see this movie 45

May 14 2008,positive,cool movie although i feel that despite the great potential that this movie had in terms of the clever premise for the story it wasnt utilized well with the directors mistake on capitalizing too much on the love angle of the film i know that it was supposed to be a love story but he couldve atleast given more background on brad pitts character he was supposed to be death for christs sake

May 5 2008,negative,rip off of city of angels
May 5 2008,positive,a mans time on earth has come to an end but the angel of death impersonated as joe black decides to wait before taking him its interesting to see peoples reactions to joes presence thinking hes just a normal guy what i like about this movie is that it really makes you think about what you value in life as the old lady in the hospital says at the end of life if we lucky we got some nice pictures

May 1 2008,positive,great film intriguing fantasycool ending
May 1 2008,negative,the longest most boring movie everrrrr even with brad pitt
May 1 2008,positive,very likely the best chick flick of all time
May 1 2008,positive,yess good interesant
May 1 2008,positive,breathtaking mouvie i love the story and the main actors have done a graet job a hopkins passion and bpitts serrrenity love it
May 1 2008,neutral,meet der tod und die steuer     dont like parts where they show something would is very privat very expensive to pay the actors and on the other hand very cheap and what you can imagine yourself
Apr 30 2008,positive,ok but very boring and long
Apr 30 2008,positive,this one gets an extra star just for that scene where pitt gets hit by the car
Apr 30 2008,positive,i liked this but not sure why
Apr 30 2008,positive,a beautiful film worth watching emotionally endearing
Apr 30 2008,positive,a most intriguing bit of story telling death falling in love learning about life i did feel at the end that it could have offered somewhat more than it did it lacked a little something in the end
Apr 30 2008,negative,when brad gets hit by the cars at the beginning i laughed hysterically  then i fell asleep
Apr 30 2008,positive,outstanding brad pitt you make a very curious death
Apr 29 2008,positive,i saw it when i was in my depressed days it brought me love  warmth
Apr 29 2008,positive,this film is wonderful if there is a more emotionally dynamic movie i have not seen it    every two characters have this lovehate relationship that pulls heartstrings in all different directions it really is a joy to watch the events unfold everyone involved who has felt wronged finds satisfaction and everyone who is wrong finds justice    this is one of few films that not only puts the viewer through a full gamut of trials and sentiments but leaves just the right amount of things ambiguous to have them asking what just happened
Apr 28 2008,negative,the secret is brad pitts dead there 3 hours saved
Apr 28 2008,positive,i loved this film  its a shame it received such poor reviews  it was an interesting concept which was mightily done by pitt and hopkins

Apr 26 2008,positive,oftencriticized as overlong crap too long but i enjoyed it so hey  anthony hopkins is good
Apr 26 2008,positive,watched for the 100th time last night and still fab
Apr 26 2008,positive,pitt and  hopkins  good  one
Apr 26 2008,positive,c forlani is very attractive in this movie the cinematography is fantastic purely from a closeup standpoint though youd have to see a film print and bpitt and a hopkins are absolutely silly together in this goofy premise yet somehow you just want to keep watching for 3 hours
Apr 25 2008,negative,so weird and slow moving that i just lost interest
Apr 25 2008,positive,outstanding emotional and alluring
Apr 25 2008,neutral,this was like a billion hours long
Apr 24 2008,negative,longest film of my lifestill never seen the end
Apr 24 2008,positive,this movie is the ultimate explanation of what love really is lightning passion and all that yes but it is also sacrifice and selflessness a wonderful bond develops between bill and joe that brings tears to my eyes every time if you havent seen it do yourself a favour
Apr 23 2008,neutral,needs to be shorter
Apr 23 2008,positive,one of my top ten movies

Apr 23 2008,positive,sometimes i forget brad pitt is actually a fairly good actor this movie illustrates that
Apr 23 2008,negative,it was pretty to look at and very long thats all i remember about it and dull
Apr 22 2008,positive,bit strange but a love story all the same and who doesnt love anthony hopkins
Apr 22 2008,neutral,this movie shouldve been about 60 minutes shorter
Apr 22 2008,positive,true the story lacks that special something but it is a beautiful film
Apr 22 2008,positive,brad pitt gets hit by two cars in a row priceless oh and i love the whole death personified thing too
Apr 22 2008,positive,this was ok bit silly
Apr 22 2008,positive,this movie is beautiful  the plot is weak but everything in it is visually striking  it is a movie you can watch with the sound off and maybe you should because the story is not really up to par
Apr 22 2008,positive,anthony hopkins is a darlin  always want pea nut butter after i watch this lady mamma x
Apr 21 2008,positive,pitt is the man in black
Apr 21 2008,positive,well well  quite long but id say its worth it  brad is a good impersonator of death i mean his acting job in that one is good  when u have time ahead of you its a good movie to watch
Apr 21 2008,positive,this is such a good film with an amazing cast brad pitt plays death superbly just generally a great film one to watch
Apr 21 2008,positive,yeah i know im alone on this one but i really enjoyed it i gotta have my sappy ridiculous bullshit sometimes
Apr 21 2008,positive,i can watch this over and over again
Apr 21 2008,positive,alright goes too long whats with that brad pitt
Apr 21 2008,positive,both haunting and profoundly moving the performances are amazing but the real star of the film is thomas newmans incredible and operatic music score this is a truly great film perhaps a misunderstood masterpiece it drives me to tears every time i see it
Apr 20 2008,positive,a highly entertaining and thoughtful film
Apr 20 2008,neutral,ultra long  but has highlights
Apr 20 2008,positive,claire forlani is hawt
Apr 20 2008,positive,great story line this definitely wasnt pitts greatest acting but anthony hopkins was greatas usual
Apr 20 2008,positive,it was different i liked it
Apr 20 2008,positive,brad pitts body is hijacked by death as he wants to see the world possibly pitts greatest acting role ever great casting
Apr 20 2008,positive,a decadent romantic drama of epic proportions with some powerful performances from a solid cast  and yes it made me cry my eyes out
Apr 19 2008,positive,wow the sexual tension and reserved faces make this slow moving story freeze in images of  final relief and revaluationsat the end you say aloud wait what
Apr 19 2008,positive,oh my gosh i love this movie its awsome and haveing brad pitt being the mane acter didnt hurtwhen a movie can go for 3 hours and your not bored of it and when its over you still want more i must be good
Apr 19 2008,positive,a perfect film enough said
Apr 19 2008,positive,this movie i so long i started it to late at night to begin with but it was a cool story some parts didnt really make sense but the acting is really good
Apr 19 2008,positive,i love this film brad pitt is at is handsome best in this
Apr 19 2008,positive,the first time i watched it i fell asleep after half an hour but i decided to give it another try   this movie may be a little slowgoing but it is a movie that touches and that  if you are that kind of a moviewatcher  might leave you sobbing at the end
Apr 19 2008,positive,beautifully done from start to finish  claire forlani brings magic to the screen  pitt was solid  i am a big fan of hopkins but he failed to always be there brest was in total control of this unusual and touching story
Apr 18 2008,positive,one of my favourite movies bradd pitt does such an amazing job and the amount of work put into production in gorgeous a must see movie
Apr 18 2008,positive,despite the fact that each character waits five minutes before responding to one another this is a pretty good movie
Apr 18 2008,positive,great acting by anthony hopkins and brad pitt    i just love how this movie brings up the fact that people overlook the simple but important parts of life while constantly striving for success fame etc    the whole death falling in love with a girl who just happens to be the daughter of someone that is supposed to die is an fun addition to the themes helps people stay interested if u are not into the whole meaning of life thing    but ya  great movie
Apr 18 2008,positive,very nice makes you think
Apr 18 2008,positive,very interesting storyline worth a watch
Apr 17 2008,positive,wonderful story line
Apr 17 2008,positive,there is something about this movie that kind of boils life down  makes you realize that maybe perfection success accomplishment arent the things that will matter  maybe what we have and what weve done will not matter at all  rather how weve done these things how weve lived our life will matter  it cant be about saying the right thing or doing the best thing all the time  it has to be about wanting to say the right thing and wanting to do the best thing  that is all we can expect of ourselves and it is all we can really enjoy from ourselves  at the end of the day that is what lies at the heart of this movie  it is a reminder well worth the time to watch this movie
Apr 17 2008,positive,brad pitt  peanut butter  win
Apr 17 2008,positive,i loved this movie  all together now a
Apr 17 2008,positive,i really enjoyd it though twas qyt strange by the way im a movie junkie
Apr 17 2008,positive,i was expecting some lame chick flick but anthony hopkins is a badass and i have a mancrush on brad pitt and i thought it was a pretty original idea for a movie i was however curious how death knew how to have sex but he didnt know what peanut butter was or how to kiss youd think he might have observed a few human manerisms and activities aside from doin it
Apr 17 2008,positive,i liked this movie i liked the story but something about the movie just made it an enjoyable movie to watch
Apr 16 2008,neutral,couldnt sit all the way through it
Apr 16 2008,negative,i love brad pitt but did not like this movie

Apr 16 2008,positive,best over all love making scene in the history of cinema
Apr 15 2008,positive,very well acted and paced  ends well with that rare feeling of having watched a good movie
Apr 15 2008,negative,worthless  but watching it with josh was priceless
Apr 15 2008,positive,i loved brad pitts character until he turns into the angel of death  and haunts anthony hopkins the entire movie  a similar film called here comes mr jordan was made starring robert montgomery back in the late 1930s i think and was much betterhopkins has a couple good monologues and the story offers an interesting take on life and death and other such questionsi suppose the movie was well done and the acting wasnt terrible but just frustrating to me
Apr 14 2008,positive,its a very interesting movie worth watch
Apr 14 2008,positive,best death scene ever
Apr 14 2008,negative,my memory fails to remember this movie  except for the sex scene t
Apr 14 2008,positive,good film but from the start i knew that there was never going to be a way to create a satisfying ending and i was right still its an entertaining film and probably worth a watch
Apr 14 2008,positive,a beautiful impossible love story
Apr 14 2008,positive,gets an extra star for the introscenebut overall just too dadgum long
Apr 14 2008,positive,slow and ponderousotherwise pretty good
Apr 14 2008,positive,i liked this movie it had depth many different symbols and alot of romance and filosofy but the movie could have been shorter and i wasnt all satisfied with the endning but all in all a good movie with a very hot sex scene p
Apr 14 2008,positive,great movie staring death
Apr 14 2008,positive,oh shoot me nowplease
Apr 13 2008,positive,lightning strikes thats what i like
Apr 13 2008,neutral,brad pitt is overrated

Apr 13 2008,positive,havent caught it in 10 years very looooong but interesting and amazing soundtrack kinda liked it
Apr 13 2008,negative,the scene when he gets pummeled by the car is awesome otherwise incredibly boring
Apr 13 2008,positive,ive never seen mr pitt act so innocent in a movie it was very refreshing
Apr 12 2008,positive,good film i thoroughly recommend it slightly sad at times
Apr 12 2008,positive,strange but it worked for me
Apr 12 2008,positive,best love story ever just above the notebook

Apr 11 2008,positive,makes me want to get married and have daughters
Apr 11 2008,positive,2 for the film 1 extra for claire forlanis tits
Apr 10 2008,negative,instead of meeting joe black meet my balls  itll take far less time and youll feel better about yourself afterwards
Apr 10 2008,negative,brad pitt cant act
Apr 10 2008,neutral,slow and painfully stupid at times misses a lot of philosophical questions for a movie of this nature for someone whos been around aeons death seems pretty naive    on the plus side anthony hopkins gives an excellent performance and claire forlani is purely captivating she sure knows how to bat her eyes lol    i recommend only to people that can tolerate slow movies perhaps youll find pleasant surprise
Apr 10 2008,positive,this movie is great i mean what more can u ask for a settle drama good acting the picture was almost perfect
Apr 10 2008,positive,this is my favorite romance movie ever brad pitt anthony hopkins clarie forlanithey all did a fantastic job in this film the scene in the airplane where anthony hopkins is describing to his daughter what love truly is and if you havent tried you havent lived is my favorite scene in the movie and quite possibly my favorite scene out of any movie the innocence of brad pitts after character in this movie is beautiful and his love for claire forlanis character is impacting and delicate and i love how you almost feel like youre experiencing everything for the first time right there along with brad pitts character i love his bond with anthony hopkins in this movie and how he seems to really get him to open up its a beautiful yet tragic yet hopeful love story and im pretty sure it will always continue to be my alltime favorite love story
Apr 10 2008,positive,what a strange movie  very intense  forlani was spectacular
Apr 10 2008,negative,i fell asleep during this one
Apr 10 2008,positive,it is an epic love story with the human heart and soul  it reminds us to live life to its fullest and love as if there is no tomorrow  even death finds it hard to leave  good movie with some great moments and lines  hopkins is in top form
Apr 9 2008,positive,truly great moviewith an awesome love story a truly fantastic way to fall in love only downside is its 3 hours long could have been a little shorter
Apr 9 2008,positive,well u gotta admit brad pitts hot but i didnt rate this film because of that i loved the music n how it made me wanna eat peanut butter 
Apr 8 2008,negative,way too long not enough happened yawn
Apr 8 2008,positive,amazing filmmust see
Apr 8 2008,positive,a must see i have not yet seen a movie with the same absolutely fantastic way to fall in love just imagine
Apr 8 2008,positive,it was way too long but also thought provoking and powerful  its alternately funny and depressing and i had mixed emotions at the end  i just wish i hadnt been sitting there thinking get on with it throughout half the dialogue scenes
Apr 8 2008,positive,death in person  almost too strange  but in this film is the best makinglovescene d ive ever seen  expecially the music  fantastic
Apr 8 2008,positive,brad pitt ahhhh  oh and its not a bad story either
Apr 8 2008,positive,chick flick but my god brad pitt in his finest hourplus it was actually a really good storyand almost a tear jerker
Apr 7 2008,positive,very interesting concept but god what an awkward delivery
Apr 7 2008,positive,im in love with brad he makes me cry in this one
Apr 7 2008,positive,i have discovered that everyone in the world loves to put the moment where brad gets hit by a car on ab repeat and play it over and over until they pass out from laughter that bumps it up a full star
Apr 7 2008,positive,anthony hopkins and brad are superb they deserve oscar 4 it
Apr 7 2008,positive,scared the crap out of me when i saw it in theaters when i was 12 but i love it now
Apr 7 2008,positive,very very long film but it did keep me hooked throughout hopkins and pitt are superb it is painful to watch with a combination of sad moving and some comic moments brilliant ten yrs old wow
Apr 7 2008,positive,probably one of the best romance films ever made  i cried for hours  brad is gorge aswell
Apr 7 2008,positive,the highlights anthony hopkins and the first character of brad pitt  the rest are knocks against this film its length the mysterious lack of any sufficient knowledge on life by the angel whose job is to end it and the lack of thought into how a person can just adjust to loving someone else and then back again while thinking its the same personwatch it if you are bored
Apr 6 2008,positive,yes is the answer to your quesion
Apr 6 2008,negative,its funny to reply the part he gets hit by the car
Apr 6 2008,positive,who wouldnt fall in love with an angel that looked like brad pitt  
Apr 6 2008,positive,it had some really good moments yet they were all drawn out by the loud and unnecessary soundtrack even though it was beautiful and the long and painful stares that they all gave each other it was just too drawn out and i dont like the end i agree that it should have ended two minutes before it did
Apr 6 2008,positive,love it and always will definitely a classic
Apr 6 2008,positive,woweven if ive seen this movie many years ago it remains one of my fav cause   it has a very profound message and the actors are awesometheir act is much beyond simple wordssir athony hopkins is a genius but the bigest surprise for me was the act of brad pitt as i didnt expect him to act in a such profound movie especially playing deathso he showed that he is a very very good actor not only a beautiful face i would like to be taken by such death when ill die
Apr 6 2008,positive,in my opinion brad pitts best acting job to date save maybe for fight club think he might have deserved at least an oscar nom for this also claire forlani is just absolutely beautiful  which she starred in more films anthony hopkins is amazing as always
Apr 5 2008,positive,great movie although its 3 hours long its worth watching again and again
Apr 5 2008,positive,this movie is so great  it really took me by surprise  its worth its length
Apr 5 2008,positive,ive never watched this movie past when he gets hit by the car  and that was pretty awesome by itself
Apr 5 2008,positive,original concept and i think it was carried out fairly well quite long but definitely entertaining and the random hitbyacar moment is amazingly good
Apr 4 2008,positive,if not for claire
Apr 4 2008,positive,saw it yesterday again on tvi love iti dont know why thoughha habut it is one of my favourite moviesmaybe because the girl is amazing
Apr 4 2008,positive,this is actually one of my fav chickish flikishes amazing story a wam for poor brad he gets crushed a few times hehaha jf he and anthony make this a classic already wonderful to watch film that will be around for many years to come the film keeps you thinking the whole time lol one guys can get away with to watch and enjoy thumbs up both of em
Apr 3 2008,positive,beautiful both brad  the movie
Apr 3 2008,positive,one of the most beautiful movies that i have ever seenits kinda impossible to happen but it makes sensei just love the whole thing from the blending of the cast the setting and the story itself
Apr 3 2008,positive,ok this is my greatest tearjerker film  so moving and brad pitt shows what an actor he is  incredible x
Apr 3 2008,positive,i really like this movie and it has five star moments in my opinion but there are other moments that just feel a little awkward
Apr 3 2008,positive,its kind of hard to categorize this one the concept is original albeit kinda dumb there are arguments that pitts performance is so cardboard that its mindnumbing then there are arguments that thats what the character calls for the only thing that really bothered me was the sheer limitless amount of money in this family whereas im struggling to make rent but i guess hopkins character worked hard for it sure
Apr 3 2008,positive,overall a great idea and good film
Apr 3 2008,positive,this is tight as hell
Apr 2 2008,positive,brad pitt was hot in this movie
Apr 2 2008,positive,it has its moments at least it is beautiful for someone who has lost her father but as a movie its not a masterpiece
Apr 2 2008,positive,this is by far my personal favourite of brad pitt he has done an amazing job playing joe black oh and the scene where brad gets hit man that was something hopkins fame reaches far anyways it is a nice unseen topic very well treated in style and in music
Apr 2 2008,positive,brad was sommmmmmmmm  his close up wow so so brad  his smile was so awesome i love this film
Apr 1 2008,negative,such a fucking pretentious bore
Apr 1 2008,positive,it was really good it was a different subject but still good
Apr 1 2008,positive,i really enjoyed watching this film despite the illogical side of having death visit us  i still enjoyed the the story line and the meaning behind the lines spoken
Apr 1 2008,positive,i loved this movie wo brad pit was amazing in this as usualand anthony hopkins was beyond words 
Apr 1 2008,positive,5 stars solely for the fact of how awesome it was to see brad pitt hit by two cars simultaneously i didnt watch anything past the car accident and still feel that i dont need to nothing could be beat the random awesomeness of that unexpected needlessly graphic car accident also claire forlani cant act ever
Mar 31 2008,positive,one of my favs brad pitt looks the best ive ever seen him love it brilliant films cup of tea big bar of choc pjs well away
Mar 31 2008,positive,a very clever film make syou wonder what you would do if you knew you were going to die in a few days
Mar 31 2008,positive,if i remember correctly this was really long
Mar 31 2008,positive,splendid stuff original solid script and a decent love story that if you can spend the time is  emmersing
Mar 31 2008,positive,a bit on the long side but a good story
Mar 31 2008,positive,boring and overrated
Mar 31 2008,positive,so close to being 5 starsterribly funny at times at other times terribly sad stellar acting performances throughoutparticularly from pitt and hopkins and tambor most surprisingly the movie runs nearly 3 hours but never feels like it is dragging out or moving slowly or anything    unfortunately some ridiculous dialog in the final 20 minutes takes away the movies chance at 5 stars a significant chunk of bad dialog anywhere else would not have been so bad but in the end of the movie it makes the conclusion feel like a desperate quickie attempt to  somehow wrap the movie up the ambiguous comments like somehow well figure it out between the two romantic characters pitt and forlani considering the events that led up to it feel totally ridiculous shes not stupidshes figured out to a certain extent that the pitt she met in the coffee shop and the pitt that ended up glued to her father are separate consciousnesses thus a more appropriate conversation would go something like the last thing you remember is leaving me at the coffee shop yeah its weird how long ago was thatetc so what is your name anyway because she cant keep calling him joe black    sigh still a great moviejust a somewhat flawed great movie
Mar 30 2008,positive,martin brest did it right with this one  the acting and the chemistry between hopkins and pitt and forlani are incredible  this is a must for all  dont miss it
Mar 30 2008,positive,truly wonderful love story with the ultimate gorgeous bodoh and his face is not bad either brad pitt in a tux
Mar 30 2008,positive,great castpowerful movie
Mar 30 2008,positive,extremely long study of a promising premise has hopkins made a bad film if you can keep from dozing off its a good film
Mar 30 2008,positive,it is soo good and soo sad but i love it
Mar 30 2008,positive,best brad pitt movie absolutely a little too slow for most but i find the pace to match the story
Mar 30 2008,positive,too long for me but i loved brad pitt eating pb the ending was just too weird

Mar 29 2008,positive,long and slow but worth it
Mar 29 2008,positive,fascinating captivating experience
Mar 29 2008,positive,outstanding performances by hopkins and pitt  compelling story of closure and beginnings
Mar 28 2008,positive,great movie that shows you the meaning of life death and even love great cast i recommand it to everyone even though it is 3 hours long
Mar 28 2008,neutral,it benefits from good sense of humour but lacks consistency
Mar 27 2008,positive,one of my fave movies
Mar 27 2008,positive,i like movies like this but i dont like watching them all the time sometimes the thought of death can get overwhelming
Mar 27 2008,positive,aint seen this for a bit but still a cool film
Mar 27 2008,positive,what if you met joe black
Mar 27 2008,positive,although everything and everyone is prettyfied and unrealistic the movie is still a really great fairytale and claire forlani really adorable to my taste
Mar 27 2008,positive,what can i say
Mar 26 2008,negative,brad pitt gets hit by a car  twice  whats better than that
Mar 26 2008,positive,martin breast surely doesnt know how to kill his darlings probably everything shot was used in this overlong movie
Mar 26 2008,positive,one of the best performances of pitt but obviously hopkins steals the movie 
Mar 26 2008,positive,lengthy but worth it
Mar 26 2008,positive,i wasnt a brad pitt fan until i saw this  it was the most amazing piece of acting and it is a standard to which i hold others  its why i could never fall for an actor they are only who they are paid to be and their real self is inaccessible to us
Mar 26 2008,positive,i just love the story
Mar 26 2008,positive,brilliant and original concept  acting superb made me cry and i loved this movie x x will always be a favourite
Mar 25 2008,positive,is it sadistic to love the part where he gets hit by the car
Mar 25 2008,positive,this is a good movie i love peanut butter too
Mar 25 2008,positive,the plot may be far fetched death falling in love with a girlrrright some parts a bit of a cliche but hopkins perfomance is as always flawless and  quite surprisingly pitt doesnt do that bad either all in all i rather enjoyed this quite long movie
Mar 24 2008,positive,i really liked it love claire forlani as an actress but it is a big long
Mar 24 2008,positive,i actually like this flick  whatever happened to claire forlani
Mar 24 2008,positive,great idea for a story  at a running time of 2hrs and 50mins it is a little long but its a very well told story great direction some beautiful cinematography and hopkins and pitt do a brilliant job i thought the script was as great as the acting an often underestimated movie that is a perfect balance of drama and fantasy
Mar 24 2008,positive,pretty good brad pitt was better than i expected and so was the plot kept me entertained
Mar 24 2008,positive,love family life and death it has it all but most of all how i see my dad and love
Mar 24 2008,positive,i have to say it took me 4 years since its release to watch this movie i erm how you say it underestimated mrpitt before well he sure prove me wrong there a very enjoyable movie great cast great acting from the legend mr hopkins and surprisingly brad pitt did great well overall if u are looking for a slow pace movie with a good story line and great act this would deliver id enjoyed it
Mar 23 2008,positive,as far as the grim reaper goes i have to admit that brad pitt is a rather picturesque sp version quality actors lifts this production which at the best of times is a weird story i prefere bergmans reaper by the way
Mar 23 2008,positive,tries a leetle too hard but its got brad pitt is soft lighting so there were some redeeming elements
Mar 23 2008,positive,this movie is really touchy
Mar 23 2008,negative,this film was obviously made on the strength of the actors to hold the audience but the script does not help long and slow this is just a yawn
Mar 23 2008,neutral,the story is goodbut too long brad pitt is so handsome in it especially when the guide to death in his body
Mar 23 2008,positive,not unlike the seventh seal olny this time death lives on earth for a few weeks  experiences new things from a human perspective

Mar 22 2008,negative,best bits brad pitt getting the shit knocked out of him by 2 cars for which it gets 1 star but 1 star less for being so fing long and slow great idea for a film death goes on holiday to get some human experiences but overly long 3hrs and very slow in parts with lots of long scenes  anthony hopkins plays his usual role dont think i have seen him play anybody else apart from himself in different situations including silence of the lambs etc brad pitt does the job needed by being eye candy for the ladies im sure that bleach blonde curtains was all the rage back in 98 watchin in 08 he looks like a twink     saw this movie when it came out which i cant believe that i sat in a cinema for 3 hrs should remake it at half the running time more comedy  cast jim varney as the female and call it ernest shags death

Mar 16 2008,positive,interesting psychological story  anthony hopkins fits his role very well
Mar 15 2008,positive,ive decided to make more than little comments on movies occasionally so here is my critics analysis this one is a winner im a recentlydeveloped fan of anthony hopkins who is a good actor to put it bluntly brad pitt of course just gets better and better and claire forlani is a perfect match for her character  she really pulls off the innocent naive girlish young woman that she portrays the storyline if you want to know is that claire meets brad forgot the character names its been a while in a coffee shop while she is a prospective bride to an ass who treats her like insert horrible object here brad is in this brief scene as a man who instantly makes any fans heart pump encouraging her to be a strong independent woman and describing the kind of respect she would deserve both exit the shop and there is an adorable scene in which they walk in opposite directions and keep taking turns looking back then moving away and going back again just missing one anothers inconviction in the end they get away from each other and brad is subsequently tossed around between several cars as he crosses the street distractedly he dies death thats a capital d honey takes over his body and becomes involved with claires little family most directly at first with her father the masterful anthony hopkins the thing is anthony is told by death who assumes the random alias of joe black that he must die in exchange for acquaiting joe with the meaning of life and the experience of a happy man anthony gets a few extra days clair and joe fall in love theres a steamy little scene in which were supposed to believe that brad as death is a virgin snicker snicker so there are trials and scenes and action and such and by the end death and anthony walk off into the night and disappear with death learning that love is a sacrifice of desire anthony learning that death is okay and claire growing up a little but denying the truth to protect herself from the pain of realizing death who she loves is actually death not joe black death sends brads body back to claire with its original coffee shop soul and theres a question mark ending in which we know that they get together and live happily ever after anthony is a masterful angryaboutdying character who sees the light and brad is just a hot man who loves peanut butter but as always hes more than a pretty face and body and oh no distraction witha a capital d back on topic this is a mustsee but i wouldnt see it with a parent who is shy about an uninhibited innocent sexscene yeah
Mar 15 2008,positive,one of the finest love storiesever

Mar 12 2008,positive,a loose remake of mitchell leisens 1934 romance death takes a holiday which was based on alberta casellas famous play this lengthy film from director martin brest who previously directed 92s scent of a woman and would later become notorious for his 2003 gaffe gigli which not ironically is his last directorial effort is one that has been the subject of both the favor and dissatisfaction of audiences neither without reason meet joe black is a movie that will either engulf its viewers with its sweeping beauty or frustrate them with its leisurely pace and overstated countercliches yet despite its shortcomings brests film manages an impressive presentation of breathtaking imagery and fine performances that make it a justified pleasure and certainly worthy of ones curiosity    william parrish sir anthony hopkins is a new york citybased media magnate who lives a life of privilege success and wealth after suffering a nearfatal heart attack however he is forced to view death as something more near than far just prior to his 65th birthday however parrish is confronted by deaths human personification brad pitt who gives william the opportunity to prolong what time he has left by agreeing to adopt death whom he subsequently presents to his family as joe black into his lifestyle and show him lifes wonders yet even more problematic is that the body joe has taken belonged to a young man who williams youngest daughter susan claire forlani had met and become enamored by just hours earlier at a local coffeehouse after which the man was killed    over the course of blacks 3hourplus runtime joe the angel of death discovers the essence of what hed sworn to take from others through board meetings which he attends as a business associate of bills parrish family gettogethers an everevolving though hopeless romance with susan who justly assumes that the object of her fiery passion is the same man she fell for in the coffeehouse and childlike exploration  he stumbles across the glorious inimitable lifechanging luxury of peanut butter    as far as performances go theyre all good but the celluloid nearly burns off the reel whilst filming sir anthony hopkins whose stint as the befuddled billionaire hes actually never confirmed or addressed as a billionaire in the film but who doesnt enjoy alliteration is commanding and very affecting as death falls harder for susans lively charm he rewrites the agreement to fit his own selfish desires leaving bill parrish angered yet helpless to the imminent pain that susan will suffer  not from the loss of her father rather from the departure of joe andor the demise that shell have to endure to stay with him if he chooses to allow it    additionally claire forlani is respectable  in fact very good  as susan as is jake weber as drew an auxiliary of bills who is also dating susan at the time of joes arrival less prominent though perhaps more noticeable performances by veterans marcia gay harden as allison parrish bills oldest daughter and jeffrey tambor as allisons husband quince also a business affiliate of bills accentuate those delivered by everyone else including the films star brad pitt who provides his dead character with sparkling charisma and faint humor  both necessary trappings to a movie that otherwise wouldve eventually reached a tiresome bore    riding the excessive talent of its actors the enchanting original music of thomas newman and the visual magnificence of emmanuel lubezkis cinematography black treks toward a solid albeit sometimes eyerolling cinematic experience leading up to its misguided finale which attempts  and initially succeeds  at symbolism only to lose it to a progressively incomprehensible sequence that beholds susan realizing and quickly accepting that both her fathers gone and joe isnt  and never really was  joe treating the confused situation as though its a frequent occurrence that grants her loves submission to a man she apparently understands is not the man she fell in love with nonetheless meet joe black is fun for its idyllic quixotic fantasy and though it may not be a fullcourse film its an adequate appetizer that should satisfy the taste buds of the patient the romantic and surely the dreamy

Feb 24 2008,positive,ahh a young brad pitt with a face more like death than youd expect brings most of the humour to this three hour romp that sits uneasily between romanticcomdrama beast and meditation on death and what makes for a good life  should have ended 5 minutes earlier but its got everything definite bad guy definite good girl morally grey central characters humour romance sex and death

Feb 23 2008,positive,if theres anything in this superb movie that i should complain about is claire forlanis disconnected performance but all in all it is an amazing and emotional twist on the themes of death and love maybe those two are a little bit too literal in context of the movie

Feb 22 2008,positive,one of my alltime favorites

Feb 22 2008,positive,awesome death scene for brad pitts character before he becomes death incarnet
Feb 22 2008,positive,i was harsh in judging this movie when it first came out everybody seemed like they were all just sooo into brad pitt that i never even bothered to watch this straight atleast until today     the story starts of slow prim and purely conversational and thats what gave me the idea before that it was a dull movie and everybody was just overexaggerating about it cuz brad pitt was in it      after 10 years wow its been that long i finally sat thru the whole movie and even suprised myself that i actually enjoyed it     the first quarter of this movie was a bit of a snooze but they made up for it eventually and had managed to leave its viewers highly strung on emotions at the very last scene    a good ending doesnt deserve 5 stars tho p
Feb 22 2008,neutral,ok but have seen better from all involved in this
Feb 22 2008,positive,one of my favorites i love anthony hopkins a take off of death take a holiday which was filmed in 1935 saw it years ago but havent seen it since

Feb 21 2008,positive,one of my favorites  it was so remantic  this is the best brad pitt has ever looked  he was so charming and eloquent in this film  i could watch it over and over again
Feb 21 2008,negative,i would give this movie a negative number of stars if it were possible  this piece of crap came on cable and i somehow got sucked into watching it  when it ended i literally felt violent because it was so damned horrible  what the hell was that ending  two guys go over a bridge one comes back  the chick doesnt even wonder where her father is  his dead body had to have been laying on the other side of the bridge  she doesnt care  what the hell  i am going to go into cardiac arrest myself because i hate this movie so so so much  i wish i could unmeet joe black

Feb 20 2008,positive,very creative idea for a movie however there could have been more depth to the story on a positive note this film contains the best pedestrianvehicle accident of alltime
Feb 20 2008,positive,any movie where the main character even death loves peanut butter is a good movie to me
Feb 20 2008,positive,pitt is one of those few actors who really acts hes played soooo many different types of roles and did them all well but this one just might be his best performance ever when his character the angel of death takes the body of a human  just so he can experience all those human emotions for the first time he has no idea what hes getting himself into when we watch him eating peanut butter or having sex  for the first time  youd swear it really was his first time the body language and facial expressions are perfect all throughout hopkins and forlani also give great performances but my favourite line comes from the brotherinlaw when death asks him how do you know when youre in love and if the other person loves you back  his response was something like its  when you know the very worst thing there is to know about each other  and still want to be together  now that is the best description of love ive ever heard watch this movie
Feb 20 2008,positive,great but very very long
Feb 20 2008,positive,omg not a bad movie if youve got what will feel like 8 hours to kill so many of these scenes couldve been cut shouldve been cut

Jan 30 2008,positive,brad pitt is awesome in this role  death the lover

Jan 29 2008,positive,i love the fact that death takes over a young man to have a nosey at life in the 20th century and manages to fall in love
Jan 29 2008,positive,i must admit to have been slightly hesistant when i first heard about meet joe black because of the subject matter and its length however i found this film to be superb    the acting was believable the cinematography of the film was well thought out and extremely picturesque the soundtrack by thomas newman the shawshank redemption went from chilling to the most beautiful melodies that i have ever heard giving in my humble opinion any classical composer a run for their money adding an extra depth to this film    there are no inbetweens in this film you will either love or hate this film however i can say that this film is one of the most uplifting and life affirming movies that i have ever seen it left me both moved and confident that the world was not such a bad place after all just like the shawshank redemption told us that hope is not a bad thing so meet joe black tells us that indeed love can conquer all better than titanic ever could
Jan 29 2008,neutral,overlong and silly at times especially at the nude scenes between pitt and forlanithe ending was a  bit forced tooit is salvated by sir anthony hopkins and his descent appearence
Jan 29 2008,positive,very dramatic which i lovei think the idea of the story is wonderful but  it almost becomes to big for itself for a three hour movie i still wanted to see more development somewhere but brad pitt is at his prime in this visually
Jan 29 2008,positive,if you can get to the end of this film without crying you need to buy a heart for your hollow tin chest great acting by everyone in this brilliant storyline good film all round

Jan 26 2008,negative,this was only made so women could drool over brad pitt
Jan 26 2008,positive,this movie is made by the quality of the acting and the incredible music score
Jan 26 2008,positive,i liked it not an all time great but i think it has a nice message to it  and once again brad pitt proves to us all that he sure can act plus he looked extremely hot in this movie
Jan 26 2008,positive,i think that this is a cool movie   the concept of death coming to live with you far out  this movie had some interesting plot twists and i enjoyed every one of them  kinda weird though why did she not wonder where her father was at the end  was she just too excited that she got what she wanted
Jan 26 2008,negative,claire forlani couldnt act her way out of a wet paper bag with scissors in her hand
Jan 26 2008,positive,powerful but sooo long

Jan 23 2008,positive,anything with brad pitt
Jan 23 2008,negative,i think i saw half of this movie  and that was still two hours of my life    a peanut butterobsessed brad pitt comes back from the dead to haunt a confused looking anthony hopkins and unwittingly fall in love with ms forlani    it was a remake solidly in the why column
Jan 23 2008,positive,brad is totally the devil
Jan 23 2008,positive,im not one for love movies but this has to be one of the best movies ever  i guess its because of my edgar allan poe heart that thrives on the strange and macabre
Jan 23 2008,positive,luv the bit in this film where he got knocked dwn twice pmsl
Jan 22 2008,positive,i am agree with michael vermulm it is funny to watch a human of death only in this movie you could see death who likes peanut butter right

Jan 22 2008,neutral,i saw this forever ago but from what i can remember it was pretty good
Jan 22 2008,neutral,doesnt really deliver but has its moments
Jan 22 2008,negative,overblown and pretentious this film may impress a few people who think the idea of personifying death as brad pitt is innovative and deeply philosophical but really its just heinleins stranger in a strange land repackaged okay  i admit i have a bias ive read neil gaimans interpretation of death in the sandman series so this maudlin brad pitt vanity piece seems very cliche to me perhaps im judging it too harshly anthony hopkins acts with his usual poignance claire forlani is beautiful and brad pittwell brad pitt does a good job of appearing blank and absent as death ohand brad pitt getting hit by a bus that has to be the funniest bit of comedy ever although of course it was not meant to be funny
Jan 22 2008,positive,fantastic movie to watch for the ladies when there alone and feeling soppy brad pitt looks great in it
Jan 22 2008,positive,a little long but a great concept
Jan 21 2008,positive,its sophomoric in parts such as the hilarious car accident in the beginning yet its a brilliant concept and the latter part of the movie is very enthralling love the philosophy
Jan 21 2008,positive,its long but heartfelt
Jan 21 2008,positive,i cant believe i had never seen this up until now  knew it was out there and was familiar with the basic premise but i had just never actively sought it out  well lucky for me on a slow night back home it just happened to be on tv  i thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish  ms forlani was subtle and charming and pitt worked his role exceptionally well but this was sir anthony hopkins movie entirely  hopkins is such a class act and thats really all that needs to be said
Jan 21 2008,positive,its an interesting look at death i liked joe even though you know hes there for something u dont want to see happen the ending is good has good closure

Jan 21 2008,positive,a strange concept but very intriguing  well acted by both anthony hopkins and surprisingly brad pitt
Jan 21 2008,positive,well i spent the majority of my life thinking this was that movie about the giant monkey and when i watched it last night i realized my mistake i do like this movie but more than the movie i think i just love the actors the story was a little slow and boring
Jan 21 2008,negative,minus a few of anthony hopkins lines and the ridiculous scene when brad pitt gets taken out by a bus this movie is a snooze
Jan 21 2008,positive,why did it take me so long to enjoy this  i had understood till now  maybe its a right of passage
Jan 21 2008,neutral,i really enjoyed this i love what if movies and anything odd weird supernatural or spiritual or philosophical appeals to me this was great maybe better if there wasnt a romantic element but it was cool

Jan 20 2008,positive,long but welldone the plot was very interesting
Jan 20 2008,negative,dull and longand dull
Jan 20 2008,positive,sad long melodrama that works because the performances are stellar  hopkinss character may just be the most accepting man on the planet and more chutzpah than a driving range
Jan 20 2008,positive,a thought provoking and well written story hopkins is great as usuall
Jan 20 2008,positive,very cool consept with death trying to see what life is like anthony hopkins and brad pit are of course fantastic

Jan 17 2008,positive,little bit too nonsense story to begin with but still very touching one the only really annoying thing i can remember in this are some stupid dialogues every once in a while one that particularly annoys me is when joe try to explain claires character who he really is and they hold each other almost in the end and she seems like understanding something wich wasnt really told kinda lame and confusing the irs excuse was also a bit stupid for me but still a good flick i must say
Jan 17 2008,positive,death and taxes baby

Jan 9 2008,positive,beautifully made movie from my perspective the movie teaches us about how relationship between a man  woman should be in the age of individualism in the coffee shop brad talked about how man should take care a woman because nothing wrong with taking care a woman since she is take care of you and when you want  to fall in love you should find someone as i quote from anthony hopkin character in the movie said   love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived

Jan 5 2008,positive,a great film about life and death and the choices you have to make hopkins and pitt join forces again see legends of the fall for another great one makes me cry every time because its definately a weeper of a film a little on the long side but so worth it

Jan 5 2008,positive,excellent movie even if a bit long anthony hopkins at his usual excellence
Jan 4 2008,positive,fantastic movie yes the movie is drawn out and slow but if you knew death was waiting for you youd want to drag life out as much as possible and enjoy every moment of it if youre a hyper fire like person the way hopkins character lived his life you probably wont enjoy this movie as much even though i believe thats the type of person that the message of this story was written for

Dec 27 2007,negative,the only worthwhile scene in this entire flick is when kilmer is hit by a car then another the editor should have just looped that scene for 2 hours
Dec 27 2007,positive,ok ill be honest this is one of the only films which i admit bought a little frog in my throat not literally cos that would be silly it may not be cgi blockbuster material but it is arguably one of the most underated best characterstory based films of the nineties the acting is perfection anthony hopkins is in top form as usual and a suprise performance from mr pitt one of his best acting performances if you havent seen this its pefect to watch with your partnerwifelover etc soppy as hell but a breath of of fresh air all the same check this out only â2 to buy

Dec 22 2007,positive,meet joe black definitely has its flaws but i cant help looking past them the movie is quite long and there are definitely flaws to the story i dont know if its the musical choices or brad pitts way of experiencing every little thing as a little boy for the first time but i thoroughly enjoy this movie the struggle for the meaning of life and love comes across through every scene and questions the value of every day anthony hopkins is great as always playing the loving father figure and brilliant businessman brad pitt gives a strange dynamic that is almost hard to watch at some places because of how awkward his character is and claire forlani plays the love interest beautifully

Dec 20 2007,positive,yeah ok it is a nice idea i dont know if anyone has ever used it before but its very original for me  brad pitt is as nice as a door and thats what makes his performance good the devil or death isnt supposed to have emotions thats why hes so robotic  but the movie sins in the same manner he isnt supposed to have emotions he shouldnt have fall for the girl then thats the only wrong thing in the whole movie for me  nice message for life

Dec 10 2007,positive,hopkins and pitt were amazing in this movie it is a far stretch at death but it worked with the actors and actresses present in it i think this is a movie that was overlooked immensly and should have gotten much more recognition i did have to watch it a couple of times to truly understand it but it is well worth seeing more than once

Dec 6 2007,positive,a movie starring brad pitt is always a good thing  a movie with brad pitt as death  as death coming to take anthony hopkins  even better  though its a little long the intensity of this movie is amazing  and if the ending doesnt make you cry get yourself to a doctorbecause you have no heart
Dec 6 2007,neutral,the idea of death taking a holiday isnt new but if youre going to have brad pitt in this movie bring something new to the fold while this wasnt totally a terrible movie they didnt really bring the movies premise to life no pun intended

Dec 3 2007,positive,a great life lesson played with elegant minimalism  claire forlani plays extremely well againsts the giants of pitt and hopkins i very much appreciated her portrayal of the feminine ideal within what was not spoken but still acted on her part  i thought the love scene was a bit gratuitously out of character for her overall loved the entire narrative and the brilliant literary devices were illustrated perfectly by great players

Dec 1 2007,positive,omg such a good movie brad pitt is sooo yummy in this
Dec 1 2007,negative,love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived 
Dec 1 2007,positive,this is probably the third or fourth time ive seen this movie i love it everytime its so emotional i hate emotional or movies that leave you sad but their is something about brad pitt  or lee pace who isnt in this film that just gets me i also love that anthony isnt a bad guy in this film he makes a wonderful sophisticated old man reminds me of my father the way he is smart and well kept
Dec 1 2007,positive,this is the first time i see an actor playing death awesome
Dec 1 2007,positive,on my way to watch the usc vs ucla gamei caught this on usa network i give it 5 stars only for this phrase from the moviea star for each word thank you for loving me got me thinking about how we forget that simple courtesy for something that we easily take for granted for a pure movie rental reviewmaybe 3 stars
Dec 1 2007,positive,sure this may be pitts biggest pretty boy film after the abominable legends of the fall  but his eerily toneless rendition of death and sir anthonys reserved but accessible performance create a deeply affecting modern fairy tale that nonetheless feels aptly timeless  and the scene where pitt is run down is indubitably the most realistic car accident ive ever seen in a film

Nov 26 2007,negative,not a bad film but the unnecessary and fairly pretentious 3 hour running time is an omen to martin brests career pregigli pitt has never been so wooden in his 17 million payday that makes you wish every penny went to the saps who paid to see this in theaters

Nov 22 2007,negative,the only good part is when he gets run over
Nov 22 2007,neutral,i reckon that this was a much better movie than is generally thought what on earth is wrong with brad pitts acting here  hes supposed to be bloody death after all even an anthropomorphic grim reaper wouldnt have had a load of practice at sex and peanut butter but the ending was total and absolute shite  completely wrecked the whole thing  after all that length too

Nov 19 2007,negative,stinks on ice     this movie is a one page brad pitt gq advertisement and every bit as boring    pitt is at his stiffest and plays the role of death with appropriate lifelessness  pitts role would more appropriately be called brain death     hopkins owes the world 2 more movies as good as silence of the lambs to make up for taking the check to make this bomb     i kept waiting for hank kingsley to liven up the plot by shouting hey now and introducing larry sanders but no such luck
Nov 19 2007,negative,was this movie purely brad pitt eyecandy  it sure seemed that way
Nov 19 2007,neutral,the peanut butter is pretty great and brads body serving as a pingpong ball is pretty great also that part where she pauses on the stairs which will forever remind me of emily

Nov 16 2007,negative,i think this movie has a good idea to it as it is based off death takes a holiday this could be a really beautiful heartwrenching film in some parts it comes really close but never hits the mark its much too long and drawn out every line in the movie is an epic speech with the actors going on for much too long with drawn out awkward pauses if this movie had been shortened by an hour with less prepackaged feelings it would have worked much better

Nov 15 2007,positive,this is such an incredible film brad pitt as death reminds us all what a truly great actor he is and anthony hopkins in his role of a powerful man experiencing true vulnerability for the first time is as always brilliant the rest of the cast is equally strong in their supporting roles i can really only complain about claire forlani who is beautiful but always looks like shes about to fall asleep there is so much insight into human nature in this movie from joe blacks scenes with the dying woman in the hospital to allisons last conversation with her father to quince sobbing at the bar with joe as he confesses what he did then there are the light touches of comedy as joe gets used to being in a human body definately one of the best films from the last ten years

Nov 4 2007,positive,so reminds me of my father
Nov 4 2007,positive,meet joe black is a movie about the life of bill parish anthony hopkins and his family  bill parish is visited by death and is given a little bit of time to make amends with his family and ultimately himself susan bill parishs daughter is the next main character who is at crossroads in her life does she settle for the comfortable life without the risk of being hurt or does she pursue love at the cost of risking it all even if that love is death  these are the two main characters in the movie and death played by brad pitt is just the comic relief and driving force for those two characters  therefore one could argue that the film would be more appropriately titled meet bill parish  martin brest directs the movie much like a symphony bring one thing up and lowering another as needed  the ending of the movie is perfectly done because it compliments both characters equally well bill parish resolves unfinished business and susan while losing her father gains a fuller life  by having death experience life for the first time highlights lifes little gifts making the loss of life at the end more powerful and meaningful  meet joe black is a movie about a good man in the closing chapters of his life and shows the significance of life itself and how remarkable it is

Oct 31 2007,positive,effective alternative take on the grim reapers modus operandi
Oct 31 2007,positive,i started to like brad pitt after this movie
Oct 31 2007,positive,img  meet joe black  1998 178mins 12  director martin brest  cast includes brad pitt anthony hopkins claire forlani jake weber marcia gay harden jeffrey tambor     released in 1998 to harsh critics and sloppy boxoffice the failure of imeet joe black iwas made even more painful for movie execs due to the huge budget the picture had run up indeed at the time it was the largest amount of cash pumped into a movie that wasnt a blockbuster the film is essentially a remake of a classic little 1930s picture called ideath takes a holiday iin which the reaper decides to take a break and live among us mortals for a little while  imeet joe black ipretty much develops on the idea and adds a little more humanity at the expense of the originals more comic elements however this isnt a crippling blow the way iscent of a women ihelmer martin brest has pieced together the production was clearly never intended for big laughs  the story begins with bill parish anthony hopkins a high power buisness exec getting weird voices in his head sending cryptic messages and indeed its not long before death brad pitt confronts him telling him that after some 65 years his time is up however death has a slight propisition which will allow hopkins a little extra life as long as death is happy to vacation on earth and stay in bills home bill can have that precious little time to live  on earth death grows fond of many things but its bills daughter susan claire forlani who captures his attention to the highest extent  i can understand why some would tire of imeet joe black iindeed at nearly three hours in length i was ready for it to end yet there will be those who have grown bored by the 30 minute mark those with short attention spans will hate imeet joe blacki but those who can struggle through the expansive running time will find plenty to like and enjoy  the performances are all top class brad pitt was heavily bashed for his perception of death but i find the almost wooden stance taken by the actor highly effective after all death is like an awkward young  boy the greater aspects of the world are unknown to him and whilst he has the greatest power of all he still hasnt experienced alot of living its also worth noting that whilst some find pitts performance a pretty boy wooden piece of pap only a year later he rocked their screen in ifight club inot a fluke in my mind indeed i find pitt to have always been a talented actor  anthony hopkins makes a sympathetic subject we fear for bill at first but as death and him strike up a friendship its very clear that bill has no fear over leaving as is to always be expected from hopkins the character is believable and speaks to the audience claire forlani is a good love interest not one of the all time greats but she gets the job done to a high degree with minimal fuss or irritation seeing as the film has a more protracted length smaller characters still get generous screen time as backstabbing cad drew jake weber is nasty and quickly makes the audience dislike him jeffrey tambor is reasonable as a man tricked into hurting one of his good friends and marcia gay harden is a little screechy as bills other daughter  the story is strong snd engages along with entertaining the people in the audience imeet joe black iarrived a few months after brainless summer clutter like ilost in space iand igodzilla iand its a more enjoyable film than eiether indeed imeet joe black ifeels largely like entertainment with a chunk of heart indeed the makers had more than cash on their minds when the expensive production beganmartin brest does a reasonable job here i dont particularly rate brest as a director and hes guilty of his usual crimes here but the screenwriters have provided him with a much stronger script on which to lavish them brest does make it a little overly sentimental at points and there really is no excusing the runtime the story could have been told just as well at 30 minutes shorter but he bakes up a brilliantly affecting finale and retains your interest throughout  a final mention must go to the score a wonderful blend of pitch perfect melodies and haunting sounds only adds to the films positives in the end whilst imperfect imeet joe black iis still a darned good picture and deserved alot more praise and money when it went on initial release
Oct 31 2007,positive,if brad pitt is death ill sign anytime and some of the dialogues are really great
Oct 31 2007,neutral,brad pitt who anthony hopkins its about claire forlani this movie
Oct 30 2007,positive,underappreciated at best this movie is definitely worth watching
Oct 30 2007,positive,the story of this movie is fascinating it captivated me on its release and it captivates me now the strong ideas it brings about life is what i find makes it so powerful
Oct 30 2007,positive,the accident was intense
Oct 30 2007,positive,okay wht is with the end hes going to go back to the party as joe black and he wont know why people keep calling him joe black the ending sucked and was not thought out too many holes
Oct 30 2007,positive,its just romantic hauntingly so  i think its magnificent brad pitts acting is decent but look past it and get to a better understanding of the films message plus the score is killer
Oct 30 2007,positive,i saw it because of brad pitt and im super that i did brad is an amazing actor and like always so it hopkins a wonderful film
Oct 30 2007,positive,i liked it anthony hopkins is a truly great actor also the soundtrack was enjoyable as well
Oct 30 2007,positive,its a beautiful slow takes you in film slightly morbid in the fact that the female protagonist is in love with death i dont know i really like this film for some reason
Oct 30 2007,positive,omgbrad pitthe was so cute who would have known the angel of death could look so good
Oct 30 2007,negative,love the concept love the last 10 minutes but brad pitts performance sucked in this movie sucked hard
Oct 30 2007,positive,long film without seeming so likeable characters in a very different filmvery romantic
Oct 30 2007,positive,one of the best romantic tales ever told and i dont just mean the love story the entire movie is romantic if you can see this and feel nothing out of the wishes of a truly dying man an eternal and lonely entity or a young woman you my friend are made of stone
Oct 30 2007,positive,great thinking movie the only problem is that it was way too long great story line
Oct 30 2007,positive,probably the first movie where i sincerely enjoy to watch bret pit in  a fulllength movie way before the oceans trilogy  i really enjoy watching this movie jebred pig aside its not exaggerating and  well its just there its not too cheesy as well  though i dont really like the ending its not predictable yet  too usual  i dont mind watching it over and over again though  with or without bret pid
Oct 30 2007,positive,i love this movie great acting great story this is the movie along with twelve monkeys which converted me to appreciate brad pitt
Oct 30 2007,positive,this was the first dvd i ever had back when dvd was as common as laserdisc  so sad and yet joyful the transition from this world to death  anthony hopkins mastered every role he ever had and this is no exception brad pit works well in both roles   claire forlani is her usual quiet and reclusive self which makes her happy times all the more joyful  a movie to watch again and again
Oct 30 2007,positive,dark and romanticshame about the hollywood ending should have ended when death left
Oct 30 2007,positive,crappiest story everbut didn realize it wen i was watchinpitt nd sir hopkins were gr8
Oct 29 2007,positive,very well done plot and character development
Oct 29 2007,positive,from allmovie   though brad pitt is clearly in over his head with the epigrammatic dialogue his performance is not without the charm that hes shown in previous work as the virtuous and beloved multimillionaire about to meet his demise anthony hopkins does a splendid job with a thankless role making one almost believe that there might be some substance behind this weightless premise jeffrey tambor and marcia gay harden are also excellent as hopkins semicompetent soninlaw and his lessfavored daughter greatly benefitting from being the only believable characters in the film claire forlani as the moguls daughter has little to do other than look pretty and since looking pretty is a great deal of what this film is about its worth noting that the domains of the superrich are beautifully photographed by emmanuel luzbecki while the film fared badly at the box office adding to pitts string of commercial failures it apparently did little to tarnish his career
Oct 29 2007,positive,brad pitt has a pretty interesting ability to emotionally remove himself as death i gained respect for him when i watched this
Oct 29 2007,positive,this movie made me wish i were a spoon dipped in peanut butter but im glad im not because i like you so much
Oct 29 2007,positive,anthony hopkins to my mind never fails to deliver and brad pitt is joe black  i love this film  it is a real weepy one  every time i watch it i  cry so make sure you have your standard issue box of tissues for this one  beautiful
Oct 29 2007,positive,some of the best acting i have ever seen
Oct 29 2007,neutral,yea i fell asleep during this

Oct 29 2007,positive,brad pitt and sir anthony hopkins2 of my favs i love when brad speaks with a jamaican accent
Oct 29 2007,positive,i laugh at the beginningis that sadistic
Oct 29 2007,positive,this was a really good movie until he came back and the girl was like yay you came back i love you even though ive never met the real you because until now ive been in love with the grim reaper as he possessed your body  that was the opposite of righteous
Oct 29 2007,positive,very good film strange story line but as a whole a very good watch
Oct 29 2007,positive,i love when he gets hit by the car
Oct 29 2007,positive,a bit too long but i love brad pitts acting in this and the music is great

Oct 29 2007,positive,why does brad pitt look like a barbie on the cover  oh sorry i mean a ken
Oct 29 2007,neutral,if you can make it through this over extended movie it is actually satisfying
Oct 29 2007,positive,sometimes you can just buy romance this one sold it to me extreme well crafted movie with hopkins at his best

Oct 28 2007,negative,i dont know wasnt that exciting
Oct 28 2007,negative,this film didnt really give brad pitt a chance to act as we all know he can eg fight club seven hopkins didnt seem convincing to me at all and seemed a bit detached from his character as did all the performances also the love story seemed a to happen to easily and fast overall this film lacked any depth that it had the potential for and wasted 3 hours of my life ps 3 hours is to long for most films let alone a film as bad as this
Oct 28 2007,negative,im not sure whether the peanut butter licking is sexy or just annoying

Oct 22 2007,positive,a nice romantic movieit touched meand i wonder whyduring the scene that brad walking away from the bridge
Oct 21 2007,negative,you know what i remember most about this movie  the teaser for the phantom menace played in front of it but that still wasnt enough to get me into the theater  its an intriguing idea although you cant give credit to this movie since its just copying what was done before it and theres some potential in the cast  still its mired in schmaltz and some scenes that go on  for way too long  and then theres the unintentional hilarity of getting hit by a car
Oct 21 2007,positive,this is gooood and funny
Oct 21 2007,positive,very watchable but at times painfully cringeworthy
Oct 21 2007,neutral,seemed far too long
Oct 21 2007,positive,the only reason this is getting 3 stars is because of the scene where he gets hit by 5 cars

Oct 21 2007,positive,pretty good pitt and hopkins are on top form

Oct 21 2007,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  i felt as if dragged on and many of the scenes could have been shortened like the 5 minute pointless sex scene but i did really enjoy the plot and the acting was great  im now a huge claire forlani fan and really felt like the 3 main actors really carried this movie  as i said this movie definitely could have been 2 hours long but i still enjoyed it
Oct 21 2007,positive,and thats lifewhat can i tell you
Oct 21 2007,negative,theres sappy agonizing suicideinducing massmurderinducing a few more grades of shit then this
Oct 20 2007,positive,the only drawback here is forlanis weak acting which is made up for by being in the shadows of hopkins and pitt one of my alltime favorites absolutely phenominal movie hopkins and pitt are dynamic
Oct 20 2007,neutral,only saving grace was claire forlanis amazing eyes oh and seeing brad pitt get hit by a car
Oct 20 2007,positive,call me crazy its in my top 5

Oct 19 2007,positive,i shockingly liked brad pitt in this movie anthony hopkins is of course brilliant lovely movie overall
Oct 19 2007,positive,this is one of my all time great movies
Oct 19 2007,positive,a romantic movie and a perfect ending creepy to think that even a god of death likes to have a tour walk in our world
Oct 18 2007,positive,i watched it over and over again
Oct 18 2007,positive,im actually not a fan of brad pitt but in this film he was perfectly cast and delivered a warm and rich performance  that hopkins was brilliant really goes without saying
Oct 18 2007,positive,its long and some reason when hes eats all the peanut butter off the spoon i laughed
Oct 18 2007,positive,top movie could have cut some bits out of it but overall good movie
Oct 18 2007,positive,i like itbut its a bit werid  the cycle of life on earth hangs in the balance when death becomes emotionally involved in this romantic fantasy william parrish anthony hopkins is a tremendously wealthy and powerful man who oversees a worldwide multimedia empire despite the loss of his wife whom he dearly loved william is content with his life and hes very close to his two daughters allison marcia gay harden and susan claire forlaini one night as william is fighting a hostile takeover of his company and allison is planning an elaborate party to celebrate her dads 65th birthday william begins displaying the symptoms of a severe heart attack and he is visited by a mysterious stranger joe black brad pitt joe is actually the angel of death who has taken the form of a man who recently passed on to pay william a call it seems that william is due to move on to the next world but no great surprise he doesnt want to go joe on the other hand is curious to know what life is like for mere mortals so the two men strike a deal  william will have some time to get his affairs in order and joe will wait and see what its like to be a human being joe decides that he likes it very much when he falls in love with susan but negotiating the slippery slopes of romance is no easier for joe than for any ordinary man meet joe black is an updated version of alberto casellas play death takes a holiday which was adapted for the screen in 1934
Oct 18 2007,positive,i love this film because it such a romantic film and it just makes me think that there is someone for everyone you never know you could bump into them on the bus or see them in a coffee shop
Oct 18 2007,positive,sends shivers down my spine every time i see this and the ending always leaves me emotionally stirred up
Oct 18 2007,positive,who knew that death was so handsome
Oct 18 2007,neutral,interesting plot and well played by good actors  very long  dont watch it if youre tired
Oct 18 2007,negative,all i remember is seeing brad pitts freakishly muscular chest

Oct 17 2007,positive,yes is the answer to your question
Oct 17 2007,neutral,after 3 hours i did more than meet him
Oct 17 2007,positive,meet joe black features a somewhat cornball performance by brad pitt not to mention an awful 90sera haircut but if you are a fan of anthony hopkins its well worth checking out the script features various musings on things like death and taxes and while it also features an unnecessary corporate takeover subplot hopkins and pitt when theyre together raise the movie to more than solid levels claire forlani is beautiful and does her best but its hopkins movie from beginning to end
Oct 17 2007,positive,i just love this fuckin movie  and then you will say oh but its so long  and ill be all shut the fuck up
Oct 17 2007,positive,very good brad pitt was awesome in itnot just because hes brad pitt it was pretty longbut worth it
Oct 17 2007,positive,that is the best movie ive been seen before  i love it

Oct 17 2007,positive,its a silly movie but i like the idea
Oct 17 2007,positive,anthony hopkins is a fantasty mr parrish and brad pitt show everybode hes not only a beutiful body 
Oct 17 2007,positive,awesome he is so hot as death
Oct 16 2007,negative,doesnt brad like peanut butter in this movie i like peanut butter but not stupid movies
Oct 16 2007,neutral,to hell with pitt id bone anthony hopkins
Oct 16 2007,positive,the girl who was the love interest annoyed me this movie was way too depressing and sad
Oct 16 2007,positive,not perfect but the dialogues are just very very good
Oct 16 2007,negative,i thought my eyes would actually bleed some of my favorite actors and i wanted to hange myself with a lamp cord
Oct 16 2007,positive,very long but theres something i love about this movie  the drama and the unique twist on death are big selling points for me
Oct 16 2007,neutral,too many rich people
Oct 16 2007,positive,long one but i always seem to cry at the end of it
Oct 16 2007,positive,excellent the character development was perfect the relationship between pitt and hopkins was flawless each one comes to understand the other and that allows them to accept their own role top 1010
Oct 16 2007,positive,what a perfect match on screen brad pitt as an angel as if he isnt heavenly enough already
Oct 16 2007,negative,does it really take 3 hours to meet joe black  but how about when brat pitt gets hit by the cars  laughed my ass off

Oct 16 2007,positive,loved it loved it not to mention mr pitt
Oct 16 2007,positive,my favourite weepy film
Oct 16 2007,positive,very nice to watch for many reasons
Oct 16 2007,negative,this is a really dire movie overlong pretentious and the only issues it seems to solve is that true love is dependent on first encounters beauty isnt skin deep and if you think someones as charmingly handsome as mr pitt it doesnt matter if they act like a complete tit  brads acting is awful particularly his jamaican accent mon and spends most of the film gawping like a mongoloid and eating peanut butter claire forlanis character is wooden and lacks credability  anthony hopkins tries his best in what is the scripts only believable character but a better screenplay is needed  thomas newmans music is cute but does it have to play throughout the entire movie  the only person id recommend this movie to is girls with no comprehension of romance

Oct 16 2007,positive,makes no sense whatsoever but love it all the same
Oct 16 2007,positive,any kubrickesque film that you can happily sit through for over 3 hours again and again must be a success perhaps cinemas most engaging recent pairing  brad pitt and anthony hopkins  are at their most masterful again for such a highconcept film but with so much dialogue and good acting necessary you needed a great cast and this has got it from the terrifying beginning where death whispers in hopkins ear in his own voice to classic neo music the premise is instantly intriguing although theologically all over the place then we get the scene with pitt and forlani an instantly enticing beautiful actress flirting to a wonderful script that makes you fall in love with both of them before the harrowing conclusion then the film continues with its highintrigue clever and emotional dialogue and superb acting the erotic tension between death and forlani is palpable making this one of the greatest most complex love stories ever told thomas newmans score makes the most of the films erotica and tension the film is shot perfectly making the most of a stunning mansion especially at the party climax pitt shows his versatility essentially playing 2 or possibly 3 characters if you count his creole voice and the supporting ensemble are wonderfully cast however sir hopkins is on the form of his life perfectly cast his voice is so nice to listen to especially when saying fuck and some of his timing and intonation is hilariously realistic lifting the already crackling material even higher its been so long since ive seen such an inspired inspiring film making me want to start writing such lifeaffirming stories right now

Oct 4 2007,positive,i like this movie a lot not because of brad pitt he acted like a âwoodâ in the movie it was anthony hopkins that moved me the most  in the movie he made a statement in his birthday party âi donât want anybody buying up my lifeâs work and turning it into something it wasnât meant to be  a man wants to leave something behind  and he wants it to be run the way he ran itâwith a sense of honour of dedication of truthâ  it somehow inspired me  hopkins loved his daughter and the last scene made me cry for half an hour when i first watched it  this movie also reminded me of one thing i will always cherish the time i have with my fatherâ

Oct 1 2007,negative,the cinematic equivalent of a slow death
Oct 1 2007,negative,one of the most forgettable films you will ever encounter  ever  brad pitt and his womanly peroxide induced haircut can go shit bricks because not only was it an epic long waste but it just plain horrible  anthony hopkins had to be wheeled from the hospices headquarters to play in this catscratch film and claire forlani isnt even a noticeable actress any damn way  that sex scene was horribly shot my eyes were burning with searing pain at the sight of those two ugly women beating the bush together oh wait brad pitts a man  anyway i fell asleep and then fell asleep some more watching it just about went into a cryogenic coma and was hoping a mosquito would suck my blood and wake me up four years later  martin brest can suck a breast because his directing skills are transparent just like the ghost that was brad pitt  just hittin that dye like there was no hope for humanity  overall this film deserves a distinct f for lack of effort and paralyzing visuals at a paralyzingly slow ass geriatric paraplegic pacing  i wouldnt advise my enemies to even see this film its pure torture to the most heinous degree
Oct 1 2007,positive,its a little bit surreal but it doesnt really matters i like the word behind the story

Oct 1 2007,negative,in by worst 5 of all time

Sep 30 2007,positive,what a film so good and the actors were great
Sep 30 2007,negative,anthony hopkins is amazing and everyone else involved in this movie did him a horrifying injustice by being so inadequate the plot doesnt make any sense and its a love story and brad pitt was heinous
Sep 30 2007,negative,why did i watch this
Sep 30 2007,negative,this movie wasnt bad but it sure wasnt great brad pitt was looking very hot anyway to stay on subject to see death adjust to his body was actually cute and funny in some ways but my biggest problem was this movie being so damn long it started to just drag on and on until i wondered when it would end also i wanted a happier ending but when your dealing with death you cant expect a happy ending  i cant say i would watch it again because it was pretty boring most of the time
Sep 30 2007,positive,different but good different

Sep 24 2007,positive,many are put off by the length of this film and normally the combination of length and relative lack of action and plot development  would be a disaster but meet joe black takes its time to bring you through it gently and it makes the drama that much more intense as it approaches the end the sheer power of this film is what makes it great i saw a tv version which was trimmed down and it was not nearly as good hopkins is fantastic as usual forlani is beautiful and intelligent and even pitt seems almost shakespearian
Sep 24 2007,positive,i hate when he gets hit by the car

Sep 16 2007,positive,brad pitt  you are so handsome
Sep 16 2007,positive,death is very goodlooking  love
Sep 16 2007,positive,brad pitt in a tux
Sep 16 2007,positive,a fascinating movie in which brad pitt plays death despite its underuse of an actor as able as sir anthony hopkins this is a very enjoyable movie my favorite part is when brad pitt talks in a caribbean accent to an old woman from one of the caribbean islands
Sep 16 2007,positive,a lot of people didnt like this but i loved the romance in it
Sep 16 2007,neutral,this movie rules because it shows brad pitt getting annihilated by a buick less than 20 minutes in  thats the only part i remember
Sep 16 2007,positive,this movie i like because brad pitt is in it and he is just extremely good looking but its kinda sad i cried when i watched it but thats prolly because my brother stole my candy when i was watching it lol

Sep 16 2007,neutral,i really enjoyed the bw film death takes a holdiay   this on the other hand was long meandering and full of philosophical mumbo jumbo  pitt  hopkins are good  but the movie itself was not something i will watch twice
Sep 16 2007,positive,a must see movie
Sep 16 2007,positive,amazing cast great storyline what more can u ask for
Sep 16 2007,positive,another underrated critically derided film  the most common problem is people didnt understand what was going on they take the death character literally  folks hes a metaphor for the fathers thoughts about his own impending death and his daughters flirtation with suicide ok  remember highschool symbolism  if you dont try to figure out how every second will make logical sense and just go with it the film seems profound and thoughtful
Sep 16 2007,positive,decent concept but an hour too long
Sep 16 2007,positive,one of the very few movies that i can watch over and over again
Sep 16 2007,positive,this movie is like an affair to remember it always gets me in the end
Sep 16 2007,neutral,too long and selfimportant

Sep 15 2007,positive,i must say its tough playing death and brad did a good job but stand out acting is from anthony hopkins he is truly amazing  such a raw actor he pulls you right in i loved the fatherdaughter relationships great script
Sep 15 2007,positive,wow an amazing lineup and an amazing movie
Sep 15 2007,positive,its soooo romantic not because i like brad pitt but the atmosphere it creates is so attractive another moving  romantic choice
Sep 15 2007,positive,this was an interesting movie  you really have to like brad pitt to sit through it all though
Sep 15 2007,negative,oh god why is this so long

Sep 15 2007,positive,very mysterious and quiet  and dark underneath but with humor thrown in
Sep 15 2007,positive,this movie was kinda mind bending really makes you think or ponder
Sep 15 2007,positive,this is a great movie
Sep 15 2007,negative,terrible and too long
Sep 15 2007,positive,a very touching elegantly paced and poignantly told story excellent casting and brad pitt is the ultimate virgin thomas newmans score is chilling yet fairytalelike and the themes linger well after the film has finished the film was deemed a chickflick by many but i think it goes deeper than what it seems to be and it is one of my favourite films hitting all the right notes
Sep 15 2007,positive,i have bad personal experiences connected with this picture but nevertheless it is fucking good
Sep 15 2007,positive,the movie was great and had a very good ending totally unexpected
Sep 15 2007,positive,could have been terrific if the two main characters opposed each other more  slow film  does death really not know what peanut butter tastes like lousy ending
Sep 15 2007,positive,brad pitt and hophkins is so great
Sep 15 2007,positive,second masterpiece of pitt with hopkins
Sep 15 2007,positive,it is quite drawn out but it is a brilliant story i quite enjoyed it
Sep 15 2007,positive,sad long depressing story of a sad event that all must face

Sep 14 2007,positive,a classic movie about a young doctor forlani an aging father hopkins and a conniving businessman oh yeah and brad pitt reincarnated as the grim reaper in this classic fishoutofwater tale
Sep 14 2007,positive,i totally fell for brad after i saw this movie lol
Sep 14 2007,positive,very long though beautiful and genuinely moving whod have thought brad pitt can act
Sep 14 2007,negative,i have never been so bored during a movie it dragged and was way too long
Sep 14 2007,negative,i actually like all of the main actors involved and i was pretty disappointed
Sep 14 2007,positive,a strange story but brad pitt and anthony hopkins pull it off well
Sep 14 2007,negative,best car knock down ive ever seefor that it gets an extra half
Sep 14 2007,neutral,i vaguely remember this movie
Sep 14 2007,negative,really quite quite shite
Sep 13 2007,positive,the brad pitt death scene was the best
Sep 13 2007,positive,one of my favourites
Sep 13 2007,negative,interesting premise but waaaaaaaay too slow
Sep 13 2007,positive,i actually really like this movie its both funny and sentimental a rare but perfect combination
Sep 13 2007,positive,a surprising good quiet drama  really in order to understand just how well crafted this story is you must realized that it is 1 3 hours long 2 stays at a relatively slow pace for the entire 3 hours and 3 never loses your interest each of anthony hopkins scenes is the slow unwrapping of one mans life and what he wishes to leave behind how he wishes to be remembered like a multilayered birthday present while brad pitts character attempts to decipher what it means to live and love   not such a big fan of how they chose to end it though but that is a minor quibble that i will solve by skipping the last ten minutes or so from now on an excellent film
Sep 13 2007,negative,long so very very long
Sep 13 2007,positive,this is my favourite movie
Sep 13 2007,positive,this truly a great movie seen it a million times very emoptional

Sep 13 2007,positive,first i thought sappy crap and then i was crushed good flick
Sep 13 2007,positive,every time this movie comes on tv i watch it again some find it over long but i never tire of it anthony hopins and brad pitt are a weird pairing but work well together clair forlani is also a treat for the eyes
Sep 13 2007,neutral,like a 6 hour moie or it felt that long
Sep 13 2007,neutral,i hated the ending loved the rest
Sep 13 2007,positive,this film had me balling like a baby great performances from the leading cast will always love this one
Sep 13 2007,positive,i thought it would be interesting but it was even better than i expected  it was long but not boring  there was one aspect of the ending i thought was kinda dumb but i wont ruin it for anyone  brad pitt is very pretty as is claire forlani though the former cant seem to find suits that fit his shoulders and the latter looks like a twig thats been whittled down further to create some curves
Sep 13 2007,positive,mark and i have watched this over and over  we never tire of it its got a great score too
Sep 13 2007,positive,very underrated watch it 
Sep 13 2007,positive,rated five stars for the opening sequence where pitts character dies in a horrific car accident
Sep 13 2007,negative,hopkins brings a lot of class to this remake of death takes a holiday pitt doesnt have a lot to do in the film other than play very innocently blank and forlani is pretty blah disappointing after the more compelling scent of a woman by marvin brest
Sep 13 2007,positive,good idea for a film
Sep 13 2007,negative,tries hard but this movie cant pull it off too slow and disjointed
Sep 13 2007,positive,anthony hopkins is good in anything

Sep 12 2007,positive,i really like this movie its long but  there is something about
Sep 12 2007,positive,i rewound the hit and run scene like 6 times and laughed harder and harder each time the movie its self is not great but it is good enough
Sep 12 2007,positive,i wish i could meet joe black slow paced but worth the wait
Sep 12 2007,neutral,watch this movie until brad pitt gets hit by a busso 10 minutes maybe
Sep 12 2007,positive,intriguing 3 hours of hooked to the screen the movie is very subtle and you not sure why you are hooked to despite its long length
Sep 12 2007,positive,if you can survive the first 3 hours of this movie the scene of brad pitt getting hit by two cars might be able to satisy you
Sep 12 2007,neutral,slow selfabsorbed and pretentious
Sep 12 2007,positive,great film though a little weird and not one that you necessarily get first time around
Sep 12 2007,positive,last chance to wrap it all up anthony hopkins is outstanding

Sep 11 2007,positive,an excelent hopkins  beautiful forlani
Sep 11 2007,positive,i like the concept of the film quite a lot as a story an interesting twist on deals with the devil so to speak however  perhaps some very serious editing is in order
Sep 11 2007,neutral,another weird movie
Sep 11 2007,positive,brad pitt is hot but this movie was long

Sep 11 2007,negative,this is absolute poo
Sep 11 2007,negative,i dont remember anything except the scene where joe meets the taxi
Sep 11 2007,positive,wow that would be wierd to have death hovering over you like that kinda ironic that his chosen body was the young man the lady met the day before
Sep 11 2007,positive,i remain fascinated by brad pitts performance how does one even begin to characterize death and make ithim interesting its hard to let go isnt it and thats lifewhat can i tell you

Sep 10 2007,neutral,a pretty face pitt lousy remake
Sep 9 2007,positive,okay i thoroughly enjoyed this movie i found it original and just a good storyline that i rather enjoyed  i loved the beginning of this movie i think hopkins was a brilliant choice as william parish and i liked the mystery and wonderment at the beginning where we arent sure as to what is really going on and the voice in his head is captivating and the mystery which helps hook you from the start  although the movie is rather long and i thought the story dragged a little towards the end it was very emotional and i was close to tears i loved the way that in his final days he sets his affairs in order and makes everythng okay with his daughters  this movie is worth the watch it is lovely funny drama
Sep 9 2007,positive,morbidly i loved the car wreck at the beginning  but this was an odd story that had a slow sometimes painful pace
Sep 9 2007,positive,omg i love this movie
Sep 9 2007,neutral,i just like the part where joe gets hit by the car  i could watch that on loop for days
Sep 9 2007,positive,movies these days are all about pushing the viewer to a hasty conclusion  this movie is wonderfully patient and allows the power to come from within
Sep 9 2007,negative,brad pitt gets hit by a car
Sep 9 2007,positive,the best bit is where he gets fucking creamed while crossing the street
Sep 9 2007,positive,i loved this movie it really makes you think about life and death do any of us every actually sit down and say wow peanut butter is really amazing
Sep 9 2007,negative,i lost interest 10 minutes into the movie

Sep 7 2007,positive,this was a very good moive
Sep 7 2007,neutral,soundtrack is amazing i liked the actress claire forlani shes so down to earth death is such an intriguing character the endings a little drawn out and i was slightly disappointed with joes choice and i think if it had ended with his final conversation with anthony hopkins it wouldve been better i liked pitts character before he disappeared in the beginning and i felt bad for the end result for susan it wasnt a masterpiece but it an intriguing work
Sep 7 2007,positive,fantastically original and honest
Sep 7 2007,negative,remake of death takes a holiday
Sep 7 2007,positive,perfect movie in my opinion couldent get any better loved the actors in it and brad pitt and anthony hopkins were superb a tale with death litterally knocking on the door so many emotions was running through me while watching it great screenplay beautifully portraid movie and had some great quotes in it loved the firework scene at the end absouloutly fantastic movie  cant beleive its 10 years ago

Sep 7 2007,positive,the best and the best sorry to everyone who does not like it but this is the all time best along with the game
Sep 7 2007,positive,cant even remember the whole thing but peanut butter comes to mind
Sep 7 2007,positive,peanut butter never looked so good
Sep 7 2007,positive,the sex scene in thislet me tell ya back in the day it had me confused today i find it amusing 
Sep 6 2007,positive,okaythis movie was pretty much just strange storywise and weak characterwise most of anthony hopkins monologues were just long and cliched and regardless of his everemenating hotness the relationship between brad pitt and claire forlani is totally unbelievable in the beginning his lines are lame and in the middle hes too dull what im trying to say is the movies watchable but not rewatchable
Sep 6 2007,positive,the sex scene was kinda funky and its kinda slo but still such a good story
Sep 6 2007,negative,crazy  it is good but who falls in love with death
Sep 6 2007,positive,the brad pitt favtor  obviously helps this film  i love the concept of it though and claire forlani is absolutely stunning too  i want those eyes
Sep 6 2007,negative,decent but way too long
Sep 6 2007,positive,this is one of my favorites i dont care how long is it i really enjoy it everytime

Sep 6 2007,positive,smart idea great acting just dont like brad pitt
Sep 6 2007,negative,claire forlanimmmmm oo  but the movie was boring like the accident though
Sep 6 2007,negative,i actually loathe this movie it was so painful to watch that it really angered me its a terrible terrible movie
Sep 6 2007,positive,a lot better than i was expecting
Sep 6 2007,positive,the beginning and ending are good the whole middle part of the movie i could have done without like 2 12 hours
Sep 6 2007,positive,a very well acted movie by all actors and actresses and found it good and interesting to watch
Sep 6 2007,negative,an incredibly slow film  that even anthony hopkins cant save  does have the happy advantage of showing arm pitt getting creamed by a truck
Sep 6 2007,positive,way too long for this story but cast is game with hopkins especially fine
Sep 6 2007,positive,contains one of the most awesomest dude getting hit by a car scene in all of motion picture dom  aside from that pitt and hopkins put on a clinic  the movies a wee bit long but nevertheless i enjoyed it immensely
Sep 6 2007,positive,i thought the casting in this was inspired coldnt work out who was prettier though brad or claire
Sep 6 2007,negative,brad pitt is the worst actor i hate pretty much everything he is in
Sep 6 2007,positive,ah mrpitt was going through my blonde guys phase and he was fineeeeeeeand he was in a suit what more can a girl ask for lolflim wasnt the beststoryline was ok but acting was not spectacular
Sep 6 2007,positive,exstremly good acting
Sep 6 2007,positive,this one is a guiltypleasure but frankly i think this is an absolute masterpiece which is somewhat ruined by an unneccasary and really long sex scene in the middle of the movie  brilliantly understated acting amazing photography and one of the best music scores ever written this is a page right out of frank capra himself  and i love my frank capra  nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be and actually a brilliant film if you like its mischevious and melancholic tone
Sep 6 2007,negative,i give it a star for the simply amazing death scene  watch it and youll know
Sep 6 2007,neutral,not a bad movie but i found it too drawn out with all the awkward pauses
Sep 6 2007,negative,i love the peanut butter scene but thats about it oh and his death scene  getting hit by two cars ouch
Sep 6 2007,positive,this is a movie you should watch from beginning to end without interruptance im not a fan of brad pitt but i havent seen him this good since kalifornia damn good acting from everyone here and claire forlani is very beautiful too
Sep 6 2007,positive,interestingcould have been an hour shorter tho
Sep 6 2007,positive,im not a huge brad pitt fan but i really liked him in this
Sep 6 2007,positive,brad pitt seduces me everytime i watch this movie
Sep 6 2007,positive,ok movie and the sex scene is really romantic
Sep 6 2007,negative,if they cut out all the awkward pauses this movie would have been 30 minutes long its got nice atmosphere everything else sucks
Sep 6 2007,positive,i watched this movie over and over and over again not just because brad pitt is in it but i just liked the concept
Sep 6 2007,negative,basically somebody owes me about three hours of my life back for this one
Sep 6 2007,positive,i pretty much will watch any movie i give bonus points to movies that have great acting plots that dont drag on for a long time and movies that have a good message regardless of if its good or bad meet joe black accomplished 2 and a half of those things i loved anthony hopkinss performance and the charisma that brad pitt brought to the role also the message of learning to appreciate your life made gave the movie a good ending which overcame its morbid plot but bits of the movie did tend to drag on im willing to look past it because although meet joe black runs in the neighborhood of 3 hours it really is an extraordinary movie
Sep 6 2007,positive,this is a beautiful tale this was probly my first brad pitt movie i found him endearing
Sep 6 2007,negative,veeeery long but somehow nice story maybe not really among my favourites but for some reason got selected anyhow

Sep 6 2007,positive,i actually liked this remake better than the original because it was filmed so well  direction was well done and anthony hopkins does a great job  it was long but  i cant think of where i would begin to make cuts
Sep 5 2007,positive,brad and anthony make it a must see
Sep 5 2007,positive,sooolonnggthe pacing of this film is so overdrawn and slow   the only spike in quality to this film was anthony hopkins he did what he could do best it was an okay film on a whole but without him more people would be less forgiving brad pitt was alright and wooden but i guess thats all he could do to interpret death claire forlani was alright kind of annoying with the squinty eye acting blinking to express her emotionsthe romance in this was okay i guess    it only makes me interested in the play
Sep 5 2007,positive,very interesting storyline a long story but at the end you will find it deserve it
Sep 5 2007,positive,a great moviei watched this one with my dad
Sep 5 2007,negative,youd think it would be cool
Sep 5 2007,neutral,you feel the full weight of the movies three hours since the filmmakers only had 90 minutes of plot

Sep 5 2007,negative,yuck one of his worst and that girl terrible actress

Sep 2 2007,positive,a very good movie with an interesting idea
Sep 2 2007,positive,makes you think about how precious and valuable life is and especially the ones you love everything can end in an instant and this movie teaches you to appreciate everything you hold dear to you because in an instant it can be gone fear of death  love are two of the most compelling emotions a human being is exposed to incredible acting by brad pitt and sir anthony hopkins truly worth the 5 star rating
Sep 2 2007,positive,this is an unrealistically long movie  the acting is great but damn is it long winded  there were times that i needed to take a break from it  for that reason and a fairly flat ending i dont think that this movie was as good as it could have been
Sep 2 2007,positive,i love this movie its serious but funny yet sweet but sad the ending always makes me cry but i love it 
Sep 2 2007,positive,for those who havent seen it and have the ability to sit for awhile this movie is bar none amazing brad pitts subdued performance as death is far overlooked the emotional tones of the movie are perfect and it is a truly remarkable film
Sep 2 2007,positive,what would you do if death knocked on your door and told you times up how would you wrap your affairs what would you tell your family the beauty in this film is how death himself is shown what makes being human is all aboutbeing able to lovegreat music score

Aug 29 2007,positive,if you do not like brad you may find this movie classical and somehow boring if you like brad you will understand how angel and devil go into a human body like brad pitt he can be strong and rough like he is in fight club and could be gentle soft and innocent as joe in the movie
Aug 28 2007,positive,this movie sent a very good message to me and ever since seeing it i feel more grateful that im alive and that im just breathing and walking on this earth it made me realize to cherish every moment of life even in times of darkness the scene at the end is so moving between joe and bill its just one of those things that was stuck in my head the moment i saw it thats life what can i tell you
Aug 28 2007,positive,this movie was unbelievably long the filmmakers couldve cut this into a one hour and forty minutes movie that easily instead they gave us a movie that has a three hours running time full of cluttered backstories for instance i thought the bit about the company conflict was a bit overdone there was an unnecessary villain and an extended a bit overdramatic finale granted i did like the feel of the film and i liked the plot other than that this is an empty gargantuan shell i dont know perhaps i wasnt feeling romantic when i saw this film on the other hand its also not sensible to create a romantic fantasy thats as long as a third of the long of the rings saga skip this one if you can
Aug 28 2007,positive,what an interesting movie brad pitt as death i can buy but in seriousness the characters weave a believable tale of love and death that makes it seem  natural

Aug 27 2007,positive,only saw this last week moody and deepbradd pitt is swoonesum
Aug 27 2007,positive,brad pitt meets buss is just a bit sad but worth the rewind all the same
Aug 27 2007,positive,i have no idea that the death could be so gorgeous and charming who wouldnt wanna die then maybe it was supposed to relate a message to us dont be afraid when your time is come and just make the best out of your life i still think it would be nice though eating peanut butter wthe death himself oo well only if he does look like brad pitt

Aug 24 2007,positive,this movie is excellent  it draws you into a world of character development that is unsurpassed  the issues of life and death are creatively portrayed  what do we want out of life  what do we want to leave behind  and all this is wrapped up in a believable in spite of the unbelievability of it love story  remember this is a movie a drama and we are suspending our disbelief so that we can be enchanted by the fantasy this is a love story that tackles whether we marry for passion or safety  this is also a love story about a father and his daughtersabout family loyalty faith and forgivenessall of it overshadowed by the inevitablle meeting with the grim reeper that we all will face one day

Aug 23 2007,positive,brad pitt so handsome n tender in the movie
Aug 23 2007,positive,i loved this movie  this is in my opinion one of brad pitts finest performances  he plays death in such a unique but logical manner  childlike in his approach to the foreign aspects of humanity yet utterly confidant in his power and status as death and rightly so  anthony hopkins is amazing as usual  and claire forlani is one of the most beautiful women ive ever seen
Aug 23 2007,positive,although its a slow movie i found it very interesting

Aug 22 2007,positive,sixtyfive years dont they go by in a blink
Aug 22 2007,positive,maybe ort of a chick flick in some ways but it definitely has got more to it than that

Aug 21 2007,positive,i like the way all the characters carry themselves with flair
Aug 21 2007,positive,a great movie about never couting your chicks before they hatch and of course claire forlani is oh so sexy when she is sad

Aug 16 2007,neutral,not bad although long
Aug 16 2007,positive,this is one of my favourite films  i think a lot of people say it dragsis too long but it comes across to me as gravitasse something sadly lacking in most films  its wonderful that its never really determined whether the film is about death or life

Aug 15 2007,positive,very long very sappy but extremely good
Aug 15 2007,positive,i love this movie fist of all because it introduced me to claire forlani who is just gorgeous a remake of the old death takes a holiday but very very well done and one of my favorites
Aug 15 2007,positive,anthony hopkins is simply fabulous in this love it love it love it
Aug 15 2007,positive,great moviebrad pitt was so cool
Aug 15 2007,positive,some say its too long i say its very balanced dont expect the same pace as in other movies but feel how every piece of dialogue comes at the right time its very romantic in a noncheesy way thoughtful peaceful and yet disturbing the main theme adds something fatal to the whole thing the only thing that made me rate it short of maximum is brad pitts overly naive facial expression at times its not always appropriate and sometimes nasty to watch
Aug 15 2007,positive,very spooky brad pitt performance  he can act you know
Aug 15 2007,positive,oooh ooooh brad pitt 
Aug 15 2007,positive,absolutely adorable you cant help but empathize the genuine childlike curiosity and stubborness is portrayed most excellently
Aug 15 2007,positive,the body language in this is superb ultimately we are all cintrolled by one thing only
Aug 14 2007,negative,how did television trick me into watching this i dig the idea of  death being personified its a sick start but then they put a soundtrack that is just gushing cheese brad pitts island accent was pretty fuckin silly anyway yeah it was boring not enough hopkins i guess i didnt dig claire forlani ahah
Aug 14 2007,positive,this film protrays a mood in the perfect wayfrom the first word i was intriguedyes which is repeated throughout the filma genuinely perfect story of life and lovewhich fittingly involves death at every turnbrad pitt as joedeath a surprisingly perfect choice for the rolebrad pitt plays it perfectlyhow the two men he played only one breifly they both seemed different and greatanthony hopkins is great as alwaysbut what i found brilliant about this film was that afterwords left me thinking of life and deathlove and loss in a different ways then beforeto live the first great life what would that be like and what about letting it all goit will be very hardand the ending one of my favorites from death gave joe lifefinally what i thought was interesting was that it seemed that susan knew her father was dead and this man was different this joe
Aug 14 2007,positive,the premise was alright and it was pretty interesting but brad pitt while amazing at parts was simply terrible at points like when he talks with the jamaican accent hopkins is as usual awsome
Aug 14 2007,positive,love anthony hopkins not a brad pitt fan  but nonetheless a pretty good movie  pitt did a good job portraying someone who has no idea whats going on  and claire forlani is beautiful
Aug 14 2007,positive,this was a funny movie death and taxes then the part where he ate peanut butter for the first time it was all good except for they had commercials every 2 secs and they were dirty filled commmercials talking about male inancments and stuff so ya disgusting
Aug 14 2007,positive,really neat meaning to the movie it is a bit longer but keeps you interested throughout it all
Aug 14 2007,positive,yeah i would be a hardass if i were death too
Aug 14 2007,positive,a kinda bizarre movie but funny in some parts as well overall i was glad i saw it
Aug 14 2007,positive,the meaning makes the movie
Aug 14 2007,positive,death likes peanut butter  thats all that needs be said
Aug 14 2007,positive,gut wrenching at times hopkins seems to be able to make me weep on command fantastic performances brilliant art direciton if i end up richi want it to look like this movie
Aug 14 2007,positive,some amusing parts mostly because of the great way brad pitt portrays his character ultimately it is somewhat haunting
Aug 14 2007,positive,i think what did it for me was the mood of the movie pensive mostly just like an author tries to set a mood for a piece of literature and if death looks like brad pitt then 1yes id date him and 2death take me away
Aug 14 2007,positive,i love this movie  its a beautiful story with a great cast  anthony hopkins is amazing  i love the romance between joe and susan pitts performance was perfect uncomfortable and real  the soundtrack is amazing
Aug 14 2007,negative,this movie has been subject of many a drunken chatthis film has an interesting story great cast good performances etc etc etc but for some reason i just didnt like it its really strangeive seen films before with seemingly no redeeming features and liked them this has all the elements of a classic film but it just doesnt work for me
Aug 14 2007,positive,sad and difficult also joyful and moving
Aug 14 2007,positive,see there is a pattern herei love brad pitt so all his movies get 4 or 5 star ratings from me
Aug 14 2007,positive,totally love itbrad pitts best movie ever
Aug 14 2007,positive,anthony hopkins claire forlani and brad pitt in a role that he doesnt sit just comfortably in plus a lovely soundtrack the thing about this movie is that if you do connect with it and really enjoy it you could be left feeling unsure why when as far as editing scenes for a film audience that migth find them too long or the ability lead romantic role to steal womens hearts as a confident allofmeondisplay character it would appeat to miss the general mark   i these are fairly reasonable points you want to just see a movie but i feel the choices add something more here brad pitt gives an uncomfortable feeling in the role which i think actaully enhances the realism of the death character falling in love in a mortal body add that soundtrack which jumps between swinging music of a lively nature and otherworldy medolies whispered or carried on the wind and i have trouble not falling in love with clare forlani in this film   everyone should listen to indivdual numbers on this soundtrack such as whisper of a thrill peanut butter man or least least enjoy how cute it is to the scene and the final track somewhere over the rainbowwhat a wonderful world again at the top of my favourites   its eerie and truthful dark and warm as well as amazingly romantic
Aug 13 2007,positive,meet joe black begs to ask what if death fell in love
Aug 13 2007,positive,very interestingi just cried with tis too

Aug 13 2007,positive,i enjoyed this movie placed slowly beautifully really i enjoy watching all these actors they just eat the screen is that the term the music adds to the atmosphere created in anthony hopkins world as we join him in a most extraordinary part of his life the movie is a love story at its corefantasy that it may be a well told one at that

Aug 13 2007,positive,even death can fall in love
Aug 13 2007,negative,why the hell is this movie so long  for the unwarranted duration alone im giving it a bad rating
Aug 13 2007,positive,found this movie very moving and both sad and hilarious at the same time pitts character of blackdeath was very funny to watch but i also enjoy the fatherdaugther scenes between bill and susan
Aug 13 2007,positive,one of the bestnot sure if it was the story or brad pitt or the combination simply loved it great cast too
Aug 13 2007,positive,the bonds between people and fear of death are given with an excellent wayapart from that it points out that simplicity together with intelligence can fuck money fame or whateverhopkins is great so as pittwatch it
Aug 12 2007,positive,the story isnt very interesting but brad pitt is soooooo handsome haha
Aug 12 2007,positive,brad pitt is good as death but anthony hopkins steals the show
Aug 12 2007,positive,dont know why i have a soft spot for this movie its really slow and its really long it could be the minimalist feel that i like the movie is very clean allowing for subtle effective performances claire forlanis character isnt very memorable but she looks radiant brad pitt plays a clueless guy really well  and i mean that in the best possible way anthony hopkins birthday speech is my favourite part of the movie my second favourite part is brad pitt jamaican patois

Aug 11 2007,positive,this movie always makes me cry even if i just see the last 2 minutes of it

Aug 9 2007,positive,awesomeand brad pitt doesnt look too bad either
Aug 9 2007,neutral,one of the best kissing and sex scenes ever haha
Aug 9 2007,neutral,a truly unique film  a pacing and calm rarely seen or perhaps more importantly allowed in hollywood productions hopkins is ridiculous as usual pitt gives a solid and interesting performance  the casting is quite good in general  it has lost some its freshness for me  this would have been a 3 a year or so ago
Aug 9 2007,positive,its not very manly to admit but this film i thoroughly enjoyed it has such a stupid premise too which makes it even more agonising to admit it was basically a vehicle to cash in on the pittmania that was in existence during brad pitts early career but stilli cant deny it i like this film
Aug 9 2007,positive,475 only one bad thing about this movie

Aug 8 2007,positive,god this movie was long
Aug 8 2007,positive,something about this movie  many love to hate it but this one really means something  brad pitts finest performance is matched by an equally good anthony hopkins  there are some lines in this film like hopkins opening lines with his daughter and the farewell speech that make me push pause sit back and ponder life and existence  very few other films will do that
Aug 8 2007,positive,moving emotionally do you ever wonder whether everyone who dies knows that they are going to die beforehand but are powerless to inform their loved ones

Aug 5 2007,positive,amazing i watched couple of times to understand this movie  love the act of brad pitt
Aug 5 2007,positive,the script is totally beautifully made
Aug 5 2007,negative,turn it off after he gets hit by the cardo it
Aug 5 2007,positive,a beautiful movie its sometimes too sappy and it almost overstays its welcome but anthony hopkins and brad pitt could not be more perfect beautifully directed as well
Aug 5 2007,positive,long movie but it has some amazing dialog and makes you think about everything death and taxes 65 years multiply by infinite etc once you see the movie those will make sense theyre great

Aug 5 2007,positive,this is a surprisingly good movie for brad pitt
Aug 5 2007,negative,hated it  one star for brad being hot

Aug 2 2007,positive,this movie is one great piece of film  the acting is phenomenal  completely moving  the love story is handeled very delicately and honestly  anthony hopkins shines on screen yet again with a character who knows his destiny and runs to it head on  brad pitt embodies a character  full of curiousity passion and the duty of following through with life paths  the music is the perfect backdrop to one of the best films made in history  great job martin brest on keeping a very tired genre alive

Aug 2 2007,positive,i like it a lot one of my favourites
Aug 1 2007,positive,riviting and different it is interesting how pitt played death and how he pulled all of the things he saw from others and adopted it to deaths attitude and personality intreging you almost want them to stay together but you know that it just cannot be

Jul 31 2007,positive,man does brad pitt look young in this meet joe black is a nice little morality love tale that has a really nice performance from anthony hopkins and looks fantastic the main problem with it is that it is just way too long i think they could have cut 45 minutes and still told the same story it also has brad pitt doing an island accent that is just great which makes it totally worth seeing by itself
Jul 31 2007,positive,i was really surprised by how good it was watching death find out what it is like to live is a very creative idea

Jul 31 2007,positive,a nice what if tale of death falling in love it is 3 hours but they go by at a very fast pace claire forlani is nice to see in the film too bad her career after this sucked other then that brad pitt and anthony hopkins are excellent once again
Jul 31 2007,positive,excellent movie i loved the whole feel of it theres a beautiful fatherdaughter interaction displayed and a great script the acting was really good too incl brads somewhat innocent portrayal of death tasty 
Jul 30 2007,positive,if you ike anthony hopkins and would liketo see him in some thing other than hannibal ectthan this is perfectbrad pitt is death and has come for poor anthony hopkinsbrad falls for miss forlani and then finds out she is anthonys daughterwowtotal tear jerker and if you love your daddy watch this itll make you love him even morei cried you know its a good movie when i cry
Jul 30 2007,positive,a really good performance from anthony hopkins made this film a really good watch slightly too long but the storyline keeps you hooked the main reason i rate this film as highly as i do however is because brad pitt gives one of the best performances of his career up there with tyler durden the contrast in his performances as the nice guy and death is the greatest attempt to play two characters in a single film that ive ever seen his performance alone makes this essential viewing
Jul 30 2007,positive,he is interesting in how he meets people and how he takes them back
Jul 30 2007,positive,this one is strangelongbut you should see itit resolves itself quite nicely

Jul 23 2007,neutral,i was expecting big things from this i suppose and it turned out to be a bit of a let down hopkins was solid as ever but the love story between pitt and forlani seemed contrived and tightly wound there was nothing natural about the chemistry between them and i did not believe it for one second on a final note is it bad that i burst out laughing when brad got hit by a pair of vehicles at the beginning of the movie

Jul 21 2007,negative,it was incredibly boring  i did enjoy the twosecond clip of brad pitt getting hit by two cars  i played that over and over and we laughed our asses off
Jul 21 2007,positive,meet joe black is a fantastic romance drama  it doesnt follow any hollywood formula and stays true to an imaginative idea for a story  brad pitt is really young in this movie but is one of my favorite roles for him  the transitions his character goes through from beginning to end and the movie is pretty long develoop at a realistic pace and envelope the audience to identify with him  claire folani and anthony hopkins also perform at praiseworthy heights  on top of which forlani is just gorgeous  i wish she were in more films  definitely see this movie on a sunday when you have nothing to do and watch it with someone who will appreciate the romantic side to the movie  it has a wonderful plot moral and is a well directed film
Jul 21 2007,positive,a bunch of networks show it but i personally enjoy it most when viewed on the wb brad pitt makes me feel bad about having any romantic emotions whatsoever because my hair isnt s sleek and goodlooking as his

Jul 17 2007,positive,img     fontcalibrisize3color000000the first time i saw meet joe black i was in a plane many many moons ago i didnt try to analyse the movie as i didnt have a blog then they didnt exist nor did i know of archetypes then nevertheless i was deeply moved by the end of the movie and i somehow felt that the movie told an important story about love i didnt know why then but the movie brought tears to my eyes colorsizefont     fontcalibrisize3color000000so when i watched meet joe black again now many years later i tried to keep an open mind to watch it with fresh eyes as i did when i watched it the very first time without any preconceptions of archetypes as the movie developed it became clear to me however what universal truth this movie was telling us the movie portrays the tragedy of the love affair between the archetype of love and deathcolorsizefont   img  fontcalibrisize3color000000the archetype of love embodied by susan shows us how love makes us blind susan a typical fathers daughter meets a stranger and lightning strikes as her idealised animus projections hit the target of a total stranger the next time she meets the stranger again she knows as little of him as she did at the first meeting but as it is in all beginnings of loves affairs her attraction toward him is fed by the unconscious projection of her idealised and unintegrated animus maybe even the self upon the perfect stranger colorsizefont     fontcalibrisize3color000000not knowing that this strangers body has been borrowed by the archetype of death who has come to guide her father a dying king archetype to the underworld she falls in love or becomes infatuated with joe black joe black who is in reality the archetype of death cant reveal his true identity not even to a woman he unexpectedly falls in love with colorsizefont     fontcalibrisize3color000000and so it is the movie shows us how every time we fall in love with a person we are incapable of truly showing ourselves afraid as we are of losing the love of the beloved nor can we ever know that the person we are smitten with who we would follow to the other side of the world is who we thinks she is colorsizefont     size3color000000fontcalibrithat susan is also a doctor in the move the archetype of healer is not a coincidence at all in my opinion universally the healer archetype and the archetype of death are forever intertwined and linked with each other their destinies are bound together by a fate that knows no freedom they are almost two sides of the same coin on any important journey of transformation we undertake fontcolorsize  fontcalibrisize3color000000colorsizefont   img     size3color000000fontcalibriit is through meeting susan the lover and the healer that deaths understanding of love is transformed into a higher form of love before death was confronted by bill the dying king and wise man archetype about the true nature of love he wasnt aware of the consequences of just taking susan with her to his world through the meeting with the wise man archetype death however is transformed from an infant mind notion of love to grasping the complex and selfless nature of a love that is true and ordained in the end when death understands what true love would do love transformed the heart of death himself fontcolorsize  fontcalibrisize3color000000colorsizefont   img  size3color000000fontcalibri  although death believes arrogantly that he is all powerful and frightening the dying king and wise man teaches him that even deaths life can be lived walking in the light

fontcalibrisize3color000000the end scenes of the movie are the most profound one as it shows us the heartbreaking truth we all ultimately learn through the initiations of the archetypes of love death and the healer in these moments of truth death realizes that there is no place for love in the underworld where he belongs and where he dwells eternally he knows that love belongs to the world of life that if he were to reveal his true identity he would lose love the archetype of love wouldnt understand the fact that she actually is in love with a projection rather than who he death really is colorsizefont     fontcalibrisize3color000000death deeply moved by his own decision to forego exercising his power to take love with him to the underworld a world he knows she doesnt belong chooses to love from a higher place a selfless place the decision is sealed by her revelation to him that she believes death is the man she met in the cafetaria colorsizefont  fontcalibrisize3color000000death realizes that without truth there is no true love and he tells her that where he is going she cant follow and as death learned through his transformation of the heart susan is also a healer after all that true love means sacrifice and giving selflessly rather than taking death sends back from the underworld the man whose body he borrowed believing that susan loves this man colorsizefont

Jul 17 2007,positive,i found this movie long and drawn outi dont think every scene in it was absolutely necesarryand what scares me is that this was edited by someone out thereit was just a test of endurance for me

Jul 16 2007,positive,a wonderful movie different but in a good way
Jul 16 2007,positive,the perfect movie  original compelling you lose yourself within the 3 hours from its undying affection and constant protrusion of life showing its beauty and it coming full circle acting was brilliant magnificent
Jul 16 2007,positive,basically death makes a deal with a man time in exchange for a tourof life superb cast hopkins is king pitt fits the role and claire forlani is elegant a must see
Jul 16 2007,positive,in my opinion brad pitts best acting
Jul 16 2007,positive,i didnt really like brad pitt in this parti dont knowhe just wasnt believable maybe it was his acting maybe it was his role i dont want to blame it all on the role because the plot was originaland great i dont know its a goodok movie in my opinion
Jul 16 2007,neutral,way too long kind of cheesy and claire forlani is kind of irritating
Jul 16 2007,positive,love this moviebrad pitt is so so so hot but in met joe black he proves hes the man
Jul 16 2007,positive,one of the slowest films youll ever see but well worth sitting through  pitt is excellent as is forlani but as usual hopkins steals the film every time the camera rests on him
Jul 16 2007,positive,meet joe black is a tough film to analyze as a movie it is by no means a knockout and there are several problems the pacing is rough at 3 hours there are so many cinematic moments of cheese and over the top parts the bottom line though the thing that makes this movie work is the characters anthony hopkins is a man who has no regrets and is even more ready to accept death than death itself with pitt you have him playing death who simply wants to get a piece of life forlani is gorgeous but naive the movie really is about characters relationships loves flaws and honesty and focusing on those qualities really makes the movie work in spite of its own flaws
Jul 16 2007,positive,he played a great character claire forlani is stunning
Jul 16 2007,positive,i still havent managed to see the film in its entirety  but i love joe blacks character the child like wisdom

Jul 7 2007,positive,my favorite movie of all time
Jul 7 2007,positive,joe black i dont care bill i love her  william parrish how perfect for you  to take whatever you want because it pleases you thats not love  joe black then what is it  william parrish some aimless infatuation which for the moment you feel like indulging  its missing everything that matters  joe black which is what  william parrish trust responsibility taking the weight for your choices and feelings and spending the rest of your life living up to them and above all not hurting the object of your love  joe black so thats what love is according to william parrish  william parrish multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what im talking about  joe black those were my words  william parrish theyre mine now     regardless of its alist cast this movie requires a simple yet monumental concession to love it  which i do  you have to accept the idea that god is incapable of understanding just what it is like for a human to love another as demonstrated in the quote above and as is prevalent in the movie originally a play entitled death takes a holiday one is not surprised that a movie written by a human about our creator would portray god or in this case one of his disciples death in a flawed human form according to christian scripture god understands all the story of job is an excellent example so to allow this movie you have to accept that death has not been given by god the divine perceptive to understand love     or you could say screw religious implications and just love the scene where brad pitt takes his shirt off
Jul 7 2007,positive,this is a beautiful movie about life death family love and relationships of all kinds brad pitt plays a man hit by a car who becomes death or rather death takes human form by entering his body its a very touching a moving story though perhaps a bit long definately worth the viewing though
Jul 7 2007,positive,not too bad not too good 
Jul 7 2007,positive,this i think is the better of mr pitts movies
Jul 7 2007,positive,i missed the endingbut it was pretty interesting
Jul 7 2007,positive,this movie made me feel sad and umm tears come out i guess very moving

Jul 7 2007,negative,this is the most boring film ever yawn yawn

Jul 7 2007,positive,love this film romantic beautiful great acting except for brad pitts west indian accent
Jul 7 2007,positive,i was surprised i liked this but i found it to be incredible pitt and hopkins both deliver moving powerful performances that somehow make the seemingly ridiculous storyline about death taking a holiday on earth work possibly brad pitts best ever performance
Jul 7 2007,negative,some might say that this film is a load of sentimental codswallop and of course theyd be right this film weighs in at a hefty three hours and the majority of that is lovey dovey stuff dont get me wrong i like a nice love story but the way its done in meet joe black is more than a little over the top and a lot of the time only serves to roll eyeballs thank you for loving me yuck ok so this film is a romantic drama but still enough is enough happily though meet joe black is saved from being totally rubbish by the original story that tells of brad pitts death asking a dying anthony hopkins william parrish for a tour of life before he takes him interesting however all too soon death runs into parrishs cute daughter and the rest is history nevertheless the acting is very good and pitts hair is annoyingly perfect no change there then
Jul 7 2007,positive,i think we all need a little help going to the other side lucky him a trully touching film

Jul 6 2007,positive,this is a beautiful movie about life death family love and relationships of all kinds brad pitt plays a man hit by a car who becomes death or rather death takes human form by entering his body its a very touching a moving story though perhaps a bit long definately worth the viewing though

Jul 5 2007,positive,it isnt the acting that makes this movie amazing although the allstar cast does an impecibly stellar job and it isnt the music although its my favorite soundtrack of all time   for meet joe black its the direction not just normal direction the artistic direction this movie is shot like a play it gives you 25 seconds before any action to completely envelop the atmosphere of any scene you feel like youre literally a third party player in the entire film thats not only what forces me to give this film 5 stars but it forces me to state this movie as my favorite of all time

Jul 3 2007,positive,brilliant movie nice concept treated with a gentle touch one of the best film soundtracks and a triumph for thomas newman  very emotional and maybe very schmoltzy but if you need something to make you smile or think about life that is readily available on the shelf of a video store with a little patience this could easily become a favourite  some very memorable moments

Jun 29 2007,positive,i didnt even feel the 3 hour movie it was one of the best written screenplays ive ever watched incredibly sweet but a bit unrealistic without revealing the supernatural factor would susan have accepted joes sudden character change so quickly maybe thats what they were refering to as the lightning i just thought it was very sweet

Jun 28 2007,negative,finally a 3 hour movie about brad pitts hair on the other hand that scene where he gets hit by the car is priceless

Jun 28 2007,positive,touching movie it really makes you think about life and the way you live it brad pitt is outstanding in this film
Jun 28 2007,positive,i usually hate slowpaced movies this one is extremely slow but i enjoyed every minute of this one  characters are interesting weve got death who likes peanut butter a sister knowing shes not the favorite and finds it acceptable
Jun 28 2007,positive,roles that you dont usually find pitt or hopkins playing wonderful movie if youre in the mood funny and sweet
Jun 28 2007,negative,would have been very good if they had cut out about 45 minutes of film you dont need 10 minutes of screen time for a character to silently contemplate peanut butter before deciding they like it sheesh

Jun 27 2007,negative,were they trying to make death the most boring character ever
Jun 27 2007,positive,the moral here seems to be if you have brad pitts face and body it doesnt matter if youre a different person top moments include joe black getting run over when he eats the peanut butter and his confused sex face

Jun 22 2007,positive,love it one of my favourites of all time  my two favourite scene are the coffee shop scene and the scene where anthony hopkins talks about love in the airplane
Jun 22 2007,negative,depressing the whole movie is slow
Jun 22 2007,positive,probably one of my favourites when you consider the topic is quite unusual that death is doing his thing and gets a taste for life and falls in love the acting from all concerned is astounding and is all that carries this amazing film it has a good deal of everything you could ask for in a film
Jun 22 2007,positive,i liked it a lot of deep meaning found thru out
Jun 22 2007,negative,this is without a reflection of a shadow of a doubt one of the worst films ive ever had the displeasure to watch the film must have gone on for over 3 hours that dragged by the way and there were countless scenes that or parts of scenes that i strongly felt could have been cut out simply because there was no purpose for them for instance the first time joe has sex we watch as every single piece of clothing gets taken off im pretty sure that people would have gotten the point when claire forlani started undoing brads third undershirt jesus christ two good things came out of this movie in my opinion one jeffrey tambor was great but underplayed to an extent that you couldnt possibly enjoy him and brads death was so over the top but you cant help but wish the director had just made a short film called a man gets hit in the head twice by two 80 mile an hour automobiles dont tell me you wouldnt watch that on youtube seriously how does a guy who directed a classic film like midnight run go and make this worthless time wasting life sucking piece of crap
Jun 22 2007,positive,i had a hilarous experience trying to tell my mother that brad pitt who is very lovely in this film was actually death  she thought i meant deaf and didnt click until half way through the film  the love seen is one of the most touching moments i have ever seen
Jun 22 2007,positive,i would be creeped out if death fell in love with mebut it was interesting bravo
Jun 22 2007,negative,best part is seeing brad get hit with a car
Jun 22 2007,positive,this actually wasnt too bad  but still kinda bad
Jun 22 2007,positive,good movie just love hopkins and pitt
Jun 21 2007,negative,aww death has a soulbullshit
Jun 21 2007,positive,one of the only romance films ive ever truly loved or cried at yeah im a baby it may be a love story but it has a slightly twisted edge to it that sold it for me anthony hopkins is one of the finest actors to ever grace the silver screen and his legend will never die his role in this film shouldve won him an oscar and i just found out it won a razzie award wtf damned fascist academy i want to get into filmmaking if i ever recieved a razzie for a film like this needless to say i would not be showing my face around hollywood again ill make it on my own anywho great movie see it if you like brad pitt see it if you like anthony hopkins see it if you like claire forlani whoo hoo or see it if you like the idea of death seeing things from the other side and taking a vacation any way you slice it you win
Jun 21 2007,positive,oh my god i love the humor in it lol i never thought humor would be in a movie like this but holy crap xd all in all i would totally recommend this movie to anyone wellexcept the younginshaha there is a little sex scene in it that i didnt particularily care for

Jun 21 2007,positive,amazing and i love peanut butter
Jun 21 2007,positive,not bad it is a long movie
Jun 21 2007,positive,i know this movie is ultimately a romance but i really could have done without the whole thing between joe and susan i thought bills relationship with death his daughters and the company were so much more compelling for instance that scene between bill and allison just before the party brought me to tears it had little to do with the overall storyline but i thought scenes like that were a lot better than the complete and utter awkwardness between joe and susan yknow
Jun 21 2007,positive,despite some poor acting and bad writing i love movies that deal with death
Jun 21 2007,positive,brad pitt dies who doesnt love this
Jun 21 2007,positive,this was a great movie it had its seriousfunnyromantic parts definitely worth a watch

Jun 21 2007,positive,slow but brad pitts dialogue rocks
Jun 21 2007,positive,i like it the idea is sick
Jun 21 2007,positive,cool premise brad pitt and anthony hopkins both do great and claire forlani though weird looking has a great figure especially in that dress at the end mmph but anyway brad pitt as death is just great
Jun 21 2007,positive,im not usually a fan of romance films but this was actually quite good brad pitt plays a excellent part and the direction and music of the movie is also very good
Jun 21 2007,positive,i hope the angel of death is as cute as brad
Jun 21 2007,positive,i love this movie it was good and made me cry sometimes
Jun 21 2007,positive,interesting storyline good acting very long though
Jun 21 2007,positive,wkd film about meeting the devil in human form quite intresting
Jun 21 2007,positive,one of the better movie quotes  love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love  well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived
Jun 21 2007,positive,actually this was quite lovely a bit lengthy but it was beautifully done congrats to mr pitt on a great performance i think what kept me going for the movie was just thinking so what are they going to do next with all that time
Jun 21 2007,positive,death is not bad as we think and while you live enjoy it and do what you think is right
Jun 21 2007,positive,sooooo great wonderful story line  unique and sweet
Jun 21 2007,positive,ok ok im definitely a girl but not cos of brad pitt forget itjust think abouth when the father at his birthday is talking with the oldest daughter and she said to him something likei know she is the favourite it doesnt matter you can have a favouritethe point is that you have been mine

Jun 21 2007,positive,the one that fascinates me death who is eternal wants to love and die as a human being great themes excellent acting
Jun 21 2007,neutral,i think that i only liked this movie because of the scene that he gets hit by a car horrible i know but i replay so many times
Jun 20 2007,positive,i found this movie amazing the problem with most people who try to watch they watch it as the would most movies to just sit and be entertained this is a film u dont look at just the main big picture but u read between the lines and look to the things being done to the side this film has a wonderful underlying message and meaning all the actors did outstanding performances epsecialy anthony hopkins
Jun 20 2007,positive,claire lights up the entire movie
Jun 20 2007,positive,traditionally a more girly flick but a moving film with a great thoughtprovoking story im unashamed to claim it as one of my favorites
Jun 20 2007,neutral,interesting and the music is good although pitt seems a little high throughout hardly a daunting death
Jun 20 2007,positive,i think brad pitt has his finest preformance playing a man who is death you see the contrast in the harsh cold attitude towards anthony hopkins that seems the typical nature of death but than a tender human side as well that makes this truly an intriguing movie
Jun 20 2007,positive,very good a little strange and a little long but good
Jun 20 2007,positive,i never felt compelled to watch this movie until i stumbled on it while flipping through the channels  i stayed for the better part of it and i felt myself watching it guiltily all the way

Jun 20 2007,positive,who can miss the innocent brad pitt
Jun 20 2007,positive,so good  it makes me cry hard
Jun 20 2007,positive,honestly i really liked this film maybe its because the idea of death taking human form as brad pitt intrigues me because its a new approach but the movie runs a little too long great date movie if your date doesnt mind taking a few breaks to stretch their legs
Jun 20 2007,positive,i find something mysteriously fantastic about this movie yes it is considerably long it runs about three hours and is certainly not brad pitts greatest performance however it is intresting to watch and hits at themes that many films have not touched on before
Jun 20 2007,positive,brit pitt is so hot in thisi like a man in a suit
Jun 20 2007,positive,i really liked the premise of th emovie but found the execution a bit disappointing  still a watchable movie and claire forlani is stunning whod have thought shed be going out with the ugly guy in csi now
Jun 20 2007,negative,if the star wars trailer hadnt of been playing a second time after this movie i would have left after the first 5 mins i swear it took a min for each word to be spoken it was painful
Jun 20 2007,positive,man this movie is amazing  brad pitt is soooo hot
Jun 20 2007,negative,i think i saw this  and by i think i saw this i mean it was so boring i dont remember very much about it except that it was excruciatingly long  bleh
Jun 20 2007,positive,this is my favourite film in the whole wide world it makes me cry everytime but i love the story behind it xx
Jun 20 2007,negative,bad movie  not in a good or awesome way
Jun 20 2007,positive,although it is long this movie packs together incredible acting sentimental writing and an out of this world score to present a genius movie loved it
Jun 20 2007,neutral,addresses the meaning and quality of lifes journey as deep as that all is this movie is not too hard to put together
Jun 20 2007,positive,drags on for a bit too long but its a great movie
Jun 20 2007,positive,long movie definite chick flick and yes i cried
Jun 20 2007,negative,overy long overly sentimental and appallingly acted by pitt the whole film felt like a missed opertunity for a good concept
Jun 20 2007,positive,one of my alltime favoritesgreat story and screen playbrad pitt and anthony hopkins perform great togetheri love how everything seem so reali can watch it over and over
Jun 20 2007,negative,way too longbut pitt is hot so that makes up for it
Jun 20 2007,positive,long but very interesting story about death and its allegory coming to life one of pitts best original acting at first u dont expect the subject to be as deep but then originality takes its wayvery enjoyable
Jun 20 2007,positive,outstanding watched it again last night one of the most moving films i have ever seen
Jun 20 2007,positive,i wanna see it again cuz i missed it 
Jun 20 2007,negative,my inability to leave a film halfwatched really annoys me when  i am trapped watching this drivel
Jun 20 2007,positive,this is one of my favortie movies it really makes you think about wat you do with your life i loved it
Jun 20 2007,positive,a little longwinded but ill be damned if brad pitt isnt gorgeous in this claire forlani is tolerable how is one supposed to play the character of death anyway like this the sex scene is very gentle and tender i think i might be gay
Jun 20 2007,positive,this has to be the movie that i have always been unable to sell to anyone  the 180 mins just terrifies everyone away and those who do attempt it always come back with the its sooo slow nothing happens in the movie after watching maybe 25 minutes of it  to that and to anyone who refuses to give this movie a chance i say that this is one of the movies that needs to be 3 hours long  its as simple as that  this is not ace ventura its not rocky you actually do have to pay attention and be willing to mesh with the movie  if you can get over the length and the perceived slowness of the movie what you will discover is that this is quite an excellent film  the story is unlike anything you have ever seen  brad pitt delivers a pretty strong not life changing performance as an intrigued death  anthony hopkins duels the entire movie with reality vs the very human fear of what we have meant to the world in our lives  the movie touches on many different levels from the simple pleasures of peanut butter to the complex issues of love and what it means to have really accomplished something in life  sure there are scenes in the movie that are farfetched and sometimes it does drag  what i will say is that the acting and the story will ultimately guide you to what i think is one of the best endings i have ever seen in a movie  claire forlani is beautiful and her character is at times a little weak but she shines through in the back half of the movie  i think that this is an amazing movie that given the proper chance and attention will take you on a journey that leads you to find that while there are only two certainties in life that the trip can take many different paths
Jun 20 2007,positive,saw this for the first time last night and it really struck a cord with me about how love should feel and work ended up bawling my eyes out to it

Jun 19 2007,positive,for a while i kept on seeing parts of this movie never the whole thing well i finally saw the entire film and i found myself kind of in a debate about whether or not a liked it i do like the message of it and its very clever plotwise the part that tore me was the pacing of it on the one hand the movie is way way way too long and too slow but on the other hand if it wasnt so slow we wouldnt have claire forlanis amazing reaction shots i swear you can see every minescule thought on every characters face in this movie its probably the best example of internalmadeexternal acting work ive ever seen so that alone gives it a good rating from me add the beautiful cinematography and lighting and in the end i decided yes i actually do like this movie

Jun 18 2007,positive,this film tells a beautiful tale of a mans grip on his life  brad pitt is of course wonderful as an alegory of death aka joe black  anthony hopkins and claire forlani are also wonderful  this is a bizzare twisted love story intertwined with a man trying to cope with his own death  i love it  if the film didnt take three hours longer than neccesary in this case to communicate its message it would have a higher rating

Jun 18 2007,positive,great performances beautiful film
Jun 18 2007,positive,meet joe black has a plot so captivating and characters whose chemistry is so intense that the viewer doesnt even notice that it is a three hour film this movie shows what a drama should be no sudden actions just characters and real lives the soundtrack guides the audience through the many emotions the movie awakens including admiration of claire forlani who in my opinion is the most beautiful actress in hollywood its the eyes since lauren bacall this film is a great date movie as well as a good way to use three hours of a day and to help the viewer appreciate the fragility of life
Jun 18 2007,positive,this movie looks so beautiful thats its big thing the colors the shots everything is perfect the music and acting are pretty good and the script has some very deep things to say about life and about the stupid things we worry about my only complaint is the running time it was a bit long and i felt it took a very long time to get where it was going overall a very enjoyable movie
Jun 18 2007,positive,best car accident scene youll ever see 3 hours is a bit of a trek but worth it

Jun 16 2007,negative,wanna know what this movies about  its about 3 hours too long
Jun 16 2007,neutral,on the one hand it stars anthony hopkins on the other hand its really really really long and the story takes forever to develop but then again there is anthony hopkins this is a great movie for people who love introspection and inexplicably long running times for movies its a decent watch but make sure youre mentally prepared to make the effort to stick it out

Jun 16 2007,positive,brad is super hot in this movie
Jun 16 2007,positive,this movie first off is not for anyone with an attention span of a twoyearold it is an intellegent thoughtprovoking and very emotion movie about life and how you live it    brad pitt is perfect in this film his acting is topnotch and his character representation is flawless anthony hopkins as always is amazing the chemistry between the actors is also very good the story is written and carried out very well     at three hours long it gives itself time to set up the characters and their stories also this time length allows the movie not to seem forced     amazing i wouldnt change anything about it
Jun 16 2007,positive,one of the best romantic movie i ever seen
Jun 16 2007,positive,too long  too sentimental  yeah probably but im glad its both  this is a classy film that might just be the best role of hopkins career  he truely is brilliant  brad pitt pulls off an incredibly believeable performance for a character that could easily be pretty unbelieveable  not much of the films idea makes any kind of sense in realistic terms but it doesnt matter  go with it theres an amazing love story here

Jun 16 2007,neutral,has some good points but its overlong and tries too hard to be profound
Jun 16 2007,negative,the whole logic in this movie bothered me and a romance with death in someones body is just kinda creepy
Jun 16 2007,positive,great movie dont miss the introduction scenes  up to leaving the coffee house  could have been easily set up for both a spiritual ending interpretation and a nonspiritual ending but instead only does a spiritual ending  not sure if spiritual is the right word  i mean one where joe black could have been death a guy who brings spirits of the dead to wherever they need to go or he could have just been a guy who suffered a head injury
Jun 16 2007,positive,its a wonderful story about family having a second chance and trying to finish your business it so wonderful to know how your willing to do a lot of things for a person you love and get love in return
Jun 16 2007,positive,i love brad pitts jamaican accentis there anything he cant do the collision scene was wikked too

Jun 15 2007,positive,best movie in the entire world
Jun 15 2007,positive,alright brad pitt plays the devil but i like this approach giving the ruler of death such a deceiving face i love forlanis mimic play her reactions to pitt everytime i see her i want to pet her and protect her from anything evil shes got something delicate about her its slow peaceful and has the occasional moment of tragedy mixed with revelation another underrated movie oh so sad
Jun 15 2007,negative,only good thing of this movie is brad pitt getting hit by a car

Jun 15 2007,positive,best movie ive ever seen ive watched it so many time the cast was amazing and so was the plot we played
Jun 15 2007,negative,panned by critics this movie isnt actually all that bad  some strange acting choices make it hard to watch at times  you wonder if they were just phoning in their performances especially hopkins but in pitts case you can see that hes actually just making a choice to make his character blank  still this movie could have been far better  interesting premise
Jun 15 2007,positive,this was really good just make sure you watch it with someone who knows where to push fast forward

Jun 14 2007,positive,if your in the right frame of mind this is a great movie  long ass shit tho
Jun 14 2007,positive,watching this movie is an intersting processbased in part on a novel meet joe black has some ignorable scenes that baloon its run time too 3 hours with material not suitable to fill a 2 hour onebut there are sequences of heart and feeling and what makes being human and being in a type of love that is indescribable that make the endeavor all worth it
Jun 14 2007,positive,this movie is one of my favorites because of the whole death is a man and just an entity at the same time thing  i love how he came to earth and he was so innocent and lovable even though he was death and supposed to be feared and hated  pitt did a wonderful job and the casting was good  i own this movie and it could possibly be a favorite  the only thing i didnt like was that i thought it was a bit too long

Jun 13 2007,positive,in a way this movie is really awkward sure thats the point how do you tell people that the guy standing next to you is actually death himself and you have a deal that youll show him around until he gets bored  and then kills you    the silent what should i say moments are too many and too long while the character dynamics are pretty great the story is still missing something it isnt sharp enough almost three hours of random silence and awkward moments when death aka joe black is trying to figure out the way of human life just doesnt work    anthony hopkins is pretty good though even better than brad pitt with his evasive eyes

Jun 11 2007,positive,i love it sooooo much
Jun 11 2007,positive,probably my favourite film of all time could watch it every day if it didnt take most of one to watch it anthony hopkins and brad pitt are mesmorising on screen the story is so well written it doesnt seem as ridiculous as it is in reality the last ten minutes have me sobbing like a twat every time
Jun 11 2007,positive,this was so brilliant  and how hot does brad pitt look in this film  oh i wish i had been claire forlani

Jun 10 2007,positive,anthony hopkins is just pure genius  dont blow smoke up my ass  youll ruin my autopsy  such a great line
Jun 10 2007,positive,i liked it all throughout  but i couldnt shake the feeling that the whole movie was glorifying brad pitt in an overly sexualized way  the sex scene for example  i would have much rather seen the girl over brad pitt but nooo they show most of brad pitt more than anything else  anthony hopkins inner struggle in dealing with a planned death was palpable and understandable in that you sense his passion for what he loves and the need to leave a legacy  the ending does it for me it was great
Jun 10 2007,positive,this movie is formal feeling very subtle and very enjoyable it draws you in not through action but through how human and reserved the movie is
Jun 10 2007,positive,anthony hopkins is fantastic and brad pitt is a very convincing character that is experiencing everything for the first time especially love the peanut butter joe black is the perfect mix of complete naivety and yet has the ultimate power this film is poignant and exceptionally well done i can watch it again and again and still appreciate it as much as i did the first time

Jun 7 2007,positive,one film where brad pitt actually acts quite well
Jun 7 2007,positive,i only saw this recently but it immediately went to my favorite list hopkins as always is wonderful but pitt for the first time in any movie i have watched of him shows us why he earns all that money the music and silent acting is what is best in this movie

Jun 7 2007,positive,one of my favourites  death is depicted so well and cleverly in this movie  brilliant performances and very hot brad  such a beautiful movie i cried from my soul
Jun 7 2007,positive,of all things its the music that i like most about this movie  the music was beautifully matched to the story and i felt was at its best when the music was allowed to carry a scene without having a character interrupting it  claire forlanis acting has always felt forced to me but particularly so in this movie  she seems to have been cast in this movie because she is beautiful at times it is distracting for me that so much attention seems to be paid to her looks and her character just seems so shallow  i actually liked brad pitt here for his subtle comedy such as the scene with the peanut butter  i didnt care for anthony hopkins here as much as in some other films  his portrayal of an aging corporate businessman left something to be desired but he played a loving father beautifully  a wonderful love story all around despite the actors shortcomings and the cinematography was beautiful
Jun 7 2007,positive,great movie the funny thing is that now everytime i eat peanut butter i think of brad pitt
Jun 7 2007,positive,pure class brad pitt is hilarious and anthony and clare are great to

Jun 2 2007,positive,always loved that movie
Jun 2 2007,positive,actually pretty good
Jun 2 2007,positive,rich yet long romance about death coming as the form of a man only to fall in love with the daughter of the man hes suppose to take claire forlani is exceptional in this film its a wonder why she didnt have much of a career after this and pitt shows some range

Jun 2 2007,positive,oh my what a movie brad pitt sexy as ever and anthony hopkins is quite the actor what a movie
Jun 2 2007,positive,not a bad film its just too long many scenes really take their time to get to the point which is a bit bothersome but the actors do a good job at keeping the viewer entertained hopkins always does a perfect job at conveying emotions sure the scene when he remembers how he met his wife is a bit cheesy but i loved that moment though the score is used a bit too much in the film i absolutely love it one of my favorites and whenever i watch the film it reminds me of a conan obrien conan on the aisle sketch you had to see the sketch of course to laugh but whatever it was funny
Jun 2 2007,positive,this movie makes me cry every time it is a remake of the old movie death takes a holiday in this movie brad pitt plays death he trades bill parrish anthony hopkins a very successful businessman time to remain alive in exchange for time on earth what i find most phenomenal about this movie is how the lack of spoken words throughout the movie are so powerful there are many moments in which there is no dialogue but facial expression between the characters alone speaks for itself ie when brad pitt and claire forlani leave the coffee shop after meeting for the first time i recommend this movie to anyone the story is absolutely mindblowing and the acting is of the highest caliber one of my absolute favorites
Jun 1 2007,positive,a simply stunning movie about how death might work

May 22 2007,positive,at about 3 hours its a little epic and the pace is slow but if you give this film the time and thought it needs you will come to realise that it is rather spectacular i can appreciate why it isnt often listed as a great film but i thought the casting acting music directing and everything else was just right in this film its a rare thing to find so many qualties coming together in one film  respect it even if you cant love it

May 4 2007,negative,the only movie ive ever walked out on in the theater
May 4 2007,positive,ambitious but not stellar overacted two dimensional characters but it has a charm and is thought provoking  disgusting in a way the wealth and extravagance of hopkins characters party  another example of great concept with poor execution

Apr 30 2007,neutral,lengthy very lengthy
Apr 29 2007,positive,during its time this was the most expensive film without special effects    i did not find the length of this film to be a problem  you can not tell a story like this in under two hours    this is one of the most underrated films in my opinion  thomas newmanabsolutely amazing job on the music the music made the movie what it is    everything about this was artistic  anthony hopkins and brad pitt were very good together    the ending of this movie does things to me that no other film has watch it and see if you can see what i see and feel what i have felt
Apr 29 2007,positive,a bit out of expectation to mr blacks character nonetheless the loving feeling was detaily described
Apr 28 2007,positive,great film you got to watch it

Apr 27 2007,positive,wouldve been better if it were an hour shorter
Apr 27 2007,positive,this movie grows on me  the story is interesting the relationships formed are special and the acting was great    i didnt realize until i did some research that this is the third time this story has been filmed  the first two are called death takes a holiday  in 1934 and 1971  i found the story intriguing  death trying out life  i will have to see the earlier versions
Apr 27 2007,positive,death personified nice little touches make this movie very heart warming
Apr 27 2007,positive,many philosophical quotes that i love
Apr 26 2007,positive,if you wanna learn love watch that

Apr 20 2007,positive,i cried boohoo i know i am a cry baby
Apr 19 2007,positive,better than i thought it would be  be warned  this is a long movie  an angel that takes lives decides that he wants to know what hes been taking away for oh so long  life  so he steps into a fresh dead body and starts learning life all for himself  brad pitt did a great job  the story takes an expected ending but it was never actually said but i think the angel stays

Apr 17 2007,positive,this was a long ass movie but it was a very good movie to
Apr 17 2007,negative,it just keeps going long after everyones lost interest and moved on
Apr 17 2007,positive,i found this movie both heartwarming and tearful in places  an great movie
Apr 17 2007,positive,a rather unique drama that is well directed and ultimately quite memorable anthony hopkins gives a strong performance and bard pitt also shines in a deeper more reserved role who knew death could be so handsome lol
Apr 16 2007,positive,anthony hopkins always give a great performance no matter what and i was really impressed with brad pitts he did a really good job going from emotionless to learning emotions convincing
Apr 16 2007,positive,we meet our deepest fear to come face to face with death meet joe black is a three hour tale of romance death and fulfilness one definatly worth watching 
Apr 15 2007,positive,for once a beautiful sex scene
Apr 14 2007,positive,mr brad is too hott
Apr 14 2007,positive,it is really cool i think that if you havent seen it you need to

Apr 13 2007,positive,interesting story not too deep but also makes you wonder what if from a few angles
Apr 13 2007,positive,william parrish when i introduce you and i tell them who you are i dont think anyone will stay for dinner
Apr 12 2007,positive,a different twist to a movie well done good actors and actresses

Apr 9 2007,positive,this movie wowed me it inspired me for a second it made me think it was about true love that lasted only for a while sweet life sweet love sweet death the love of a father for his daughter how strong and deep  love flows respect responsiblity it made me look at things as if it were for the first time how refreshing

Apr 7 2007,positive,falling in love with one of the worst things that can happen to somebodyi loved it
Apr 7 2007,positive,beautifull and touching
Apr 7 2007,positive,despite being based on a short story this movie turned out incredibly long worse than that it felt long and was a struggle to complete despite how cute brad pitt is his performance here was terribly flat and unemotional but not in a good way considering he was trying to bring to live death personified
Apr 6 2007,positive,brad pitt is hotter than the sun
Apr 6 2007,positive,a classic that everyone should see
Apr 6 2007,positive,made me cry love a good weepy
Apr 6 2007,positive,its just too long to be on the regular rotation watch list but it is one that you cannot go through life without seeing at least twice once so you can say youve seen it the second time to catch all the stuff you missed until the end of the first time
Apr 6 2007,positive,mmmm   good love it
Apr 5 2007,positive,if death looks like that he can come knocking on my door any day
Apr 5 2007,positive,was it brad pitt or anthony hopkins that made this so good hmmm maybe it was just the great plot
Apr 5 2007,neutral,manages to make the grim reaper look like a romantic though not a dumb movie the idea itself is kind of weak

Apr 2 2007,positive,a little weird but a wonderful movie
Apr 2 2007,neutral,anything with hopkins is great nice setting but sort of dull actually
Apr 2 2007,positive,my favorite movie i love it because its almost poetic
Apr 2 2007,positive,i love this film which is bizarre because i hate needlessly long films but the beauty of mjb is that it is elegant in a way that few films are these days or have been since the 1940s and 50s its toptotoe gorgeous with a nice unpredictable story that takes many interesting turns and refuses to sensationalise its highconcept premise whats more anthony hopkins delivers what is arguably his best ever performance or second to  silence of the lambs at the very least
Apr 1 2007,positive,yes  yes is the answer to the question youve been asking  do i seriously consider this film a favourite  yes  i do believe the reason this film works the most is due to some excellent casting and subsequent chemistry and an excellent script thats well directed  i have many many favourite moments in this film that touch me deeply even after several sittings  not just scenes but simple expressions  i like the parrish family meals  i like deaths diffidence  i like hopkins round pearshaped tones particularly as he tells his daughter that love is passion obsession  someone you cant live without  and later as death addresses him in the study in his own voice  i like black talking to the dying woman in the hospital and the way she sees him for the obeah that he is  i like the first meeting between susan and joe in the coffee shop  when lightning strikes  i love bill parrishs party  i love quince and the way he relays how much he loves his wife when he talks with joe depressed because he thinks hes let down the man he most admires in the world  his expression as he almost starts crying is gold  as is blacks movement to pat his head  i love the music  i love the quiet as we zoom in to the parrish penthouse after joe has been taken because death needs a body  i lovethis whole freakin film
Mar 31 2007,positive,the first time we saw anthony hopkins and brad pitt was in legends of the fall and they were amazing in this movie the duo are even better this is a true romantic movie that shows you that everybody has a heart the only thing that i didnt like that much was claire forlani she didnt quite fit

Mar 21 2007,positive,drew we all know this deal is as certain as death and taxesjoe black death and taxesdrew yesjoe black death and taxesdrew yesjoe black what an odd pairingi jumped into this movie on moviecentral last night having missed the first twenty minutes i skipped the setup and knew that there was something otherworldly about pitts character but wasnt sure just what does this qualify me to really review it i missed a fair portion of the setup in what is largely a concept film still it was relatively easy enough to put the pieces together and the movie plays pretty welldeath has come calling for media mogul bill parrish hopkins literally with his 65th birthday just around the corner parrish is told of his imminent death and strikes up a deal to put off his exit by a few days until his birthday bill will guide death through life but to do that death would need a body and thats where things get tricky as if they werent tricky enough yet the body he possesses pitts shared a chance encounter with bills youngest daughter susan forlani just prior to becoming host to the reaper they begin to fall for each other and through her love death begins to appreciate life could i have been more saccharine with my description not really my fault though the movies pretty schmaltzyif i were to sit you down and describe just what this movie was about or certain things that happen within it for example brad pitt shares two scenes with an elderly woman from the caribbean and speaks with an island accent throughout both you might laugh hell i could play it up and it would be hysterical and yet somehow the movie itself works there are a few moments whose absurdity make the drama ring false but for the most part the movie is interesting and involving a credit to the cast i suppose as with lesser actors this could have been disastrous the supporting players are fairly strong as well the main problem is that with a concept like this its difficult for the script not to lay it on too thick  something its definitely very guilty of still worth a look an interesting film for surejust one thing meet joe black thats the best they could do youve got to be kidding no wonder id never bothered seeing it

Feb 24 2007,positive,from the rating it just missed that certain something from keeping it from being unbeatable  those two last songs you hear in the movie hurt it a bit and perhaps they could have focused more on deaths character understanding life here on earth a bit more  i mean ok love is an important issue but grow up  theres more to it than that  a good lengthed movie complete with wonderful acting

Feb 22 2007,positive,beautiful musica score  i love brad pitts character  a bit long a long of unnecessary conversation and pauses
Feb 22 2007,positive,i actually dont hate it only the fact that brad pitt seems completely lost almost so much that it seems as if hopkins and the woman whoever she is are wasting time talking to a rock or a tree

Feb 15 2007,positive,dont expect a total happy ending its sad but theres bit of happiness
Feb 13 2007,negative,now this film is starnge  death takes the form of brad pitt and makes a deak with a man who is soon going to die death wants to experience life on earth yet at the same time it falls in love with the guys daughter this film is so odd and far too long
Feb 13 2007,positive,another movie thats better than the premise although the girl who was in mallrats is a shock for casting as she has acting peralisis a very heart wrenching condition

Feb 12 2007,positive,fantastic drama  not my favorite acting work from brad pitt but ey even the best of actors look like they are working on their first film when they stand next to anthony hopkins
Feb 11 2007,positive,its just beautiful most emotional soundtrack ever brad pitt is an excellent angel of death a little slow though
Feb 11 2007,positive,if you are patient with this film it will reveal itselfthe first time i saw it even with the presence of sir anthony hopkins i thought what the  later viewings changed my mind there is sly subtle humour universal wisdom brad pitt in the buff really  he is one beautiful man glorious settings that most of us will never set foot in and sir anthonys genius the music is exquisite beneath the succulent surface of this film is much food for thought my husband and i own a copy and watch it every few months
Feb 10 2007,positive,music was to loud for hearing voices properly
Feb 10 2007,positive,best car accident scene in history he he great performances from hopkins and pitt

Feb 4 2007,positive,its too long but still one of my favorite films
Feb 4 2007,positive,most films should be longer this is one of the few i wish was about an hour shorter
Feb 4 2007,negative,brad pitt and anthony hopkins foolproof right well in this case it creates a recipe for a film that fails astronomically in every facet  why did it feel like every character in this movie was reading their lines off of a screen youll find fewer cliches in a disney film youll find more true to life emotion in a directtovideo scifi flick but you wont find more melodrama anywhere else although i would suggest trying the breakfast club or any inspirational prison movie with the rock as the leading role see gridiron gang   this movie was ready to end after 90 minutes but it manged to reach the elusive 175 plateau to say it dragged is like saying tiger woods is a fairly adequate golfer words cant express the nightmarish things that this movie does to time prepare to enter a warp or vortex if you will where time is slowed down by 350   175 minutes truly remarkable for a movie that manages to strangle you with its hollow diluted version of emotional impact over and over and over how many teary eyed hugs and heartfelt monolugues can a guy take have you ever heard someone say i would like to express my deepest gratitude to you neither have i thanks would suffice and cut back on about 15 seconds of unnecessary screentime   by the end of this movie my soul was ripped from my body and im still trying to get it back
Feb 4 2007,positive,this is so so so good starring the young brad pitt  great idea of car accident and the haunting brilliant  can watch it again and again
Feb 4 2007,positive,love this film good story and superb acting
Feb 4 2007,positive,very original plot great actors wow
Feb 4 2007,negative,a very slowpaced and poorly written film that dragged on and on the scenes never seemed to end and the audience just loses interest if this film was about an hour and a half shorter it could have been acceptable but when you feel as if youve been watching a movie for ten hours and it still isnt over thats a bad sign
Feb 4 2007,positive,i loved it when brad pitt was speaking patwa lol
Feb 4 2007,positive,this was a great film brad pitt is wicked

Feb 2 2007,positive,saw it last night again its too good for not seeying it at list 100 times
Feb 2 2007,positive,one of a few films with an amazing soundtrack to backup a brilliant storyline amazing choice of actors i didnt really see brad pitt able to take on such a serious and meaningful role this film is where claire forlani acting caught my eye
Feb 2 2007,positive,absolout classic when he gets bonneted lol what r the odds u wud land infront of another oncoming vehicle pyaaaarrrr clas
Feb 1 2007,negative,awful  what a waste of brad and of anthony hopkins
Feb 1 2007,positive,very philosofical movie
Feb 1 2007,neutral,i saw it on tv with very bad dubbing for brazillian standards anyway to make matters worse i prefer subtitles so i think this affected my judgement negatively
Feb 1 2007,negative,if you want to see a movie in which brad putt stares at people for like 3 hours watch it
Jan 31 2007,positive,amazing underlying message

Sep 28 2006,positive,wowwowwowwowwowbrilliantbrilliantsuperbman i have just seen this movie 4 the 1st time n think that this is such a great movie 2 watchits got a good cast of actorsactresses throughout this moviei think that brad pitt anthony hopkins claire forlani jake webber marcia gay harden jeffrey tambor play good rolesparts throughout this moviei think that the director of this dramascifidrama movie had done a great job of directing this movie because you never know what 2 expect throughout this moviei think that this is such a really powerful drama movie 2 watch it is such a really sad movie 2 watch but this is such a fantastic drama movie 2 watchi think that brad pitt was just so fantastic throughout this movie as joe black the title character for this movie as he was so brilliant throughout this movie          meet joe black opened on november 13 1998 and grossed 15017995 domestically upon its opening weekend 111315 at 3 behind the waterboys second weekend and the opening of i still know what you did last summer    while the film had a disappointing domestic box office return of 44619100 it fared much better overseas taking in an additional 98321000 the movie grossed a worldwide total of 142940100    as meet joe black was one of the few films showing the first trailer for star wars episode i the phantom menace it was reported that droves of star wars fans bought tickets for the film only to leave after the trailer showed          most of william parrishs country mansion scenes were shot at the aldrich mansion    the place where susan claire forlani and joe black brad pitt first meet is broadway restaurant at 2664 broadway and west 101st street manhattan              critical response    the film received mainly mixed reviews by critics siskel and ebert gave it two thumbs up with ebert adding theres so much thats fine in this movie the film has a 51 rotten response from rotten tomatoes with the sites consensus calling the film glacially slow and uneventful anthony hopkins was nominated for a saturn award for best actor and claire forlani was nominated for a saturn award for best supporting actress however the film also earned a razzie award nomination for worst remake or sequel    edited version    a twohour version was made to show on television and airline flights by cutting most of the plotline involving the hopkins characters business as brest derided this edit of his film and disowned it the directors credit was changed to the hollywood pseudonym alan smithee    i think that claire forlani from the brilliant cult classics 1995 mallrats brandi svenning was brilliant as the love interest of brad pitt throughout this movie as she was really good throughout this moviei think that this is such an enjoyable movie 2 watch with a great cast throughout this movie

Sep 11 2006,positive,brad pitt is rarely anything less than amazing in all his movies the most underrated actor in hollywood
Sep 11 2006,positive,anthony hopkins is amazing as he always is and brad pitt does a wonderful performance as well proves that pitt can manage to be a good actor and goodlooking at the same time something that many hollywood actors cannot accomplish its amazing how the director manages to convey emotion and depth in the story while simultaneously capturing deaths encounters with seemingly simple things that we take for granted but for him are new and amazing there are things that hopkins character bill parrish does not understand but death does and parrish will never understand at the same time there are things that death experiences and manages to comprehend but others such as love that he can only begin to fathom and even at the end still does not completely understand it fully or its ramifications in all its more a story about life rather than death and about really truly living and experiencing life to the fullest and maybe afterwards death isnt so bad overall a very good movie with an excellent soundtrack by thomas newman whos work never disappoints me
Sep 11 2006,positive,best death scene ever

Sep 4 2006,positive,luv it claire forlani is one of my favourite actresses and brad pitt is sooooo funny
Sep 4 2006,positive,the word bittersweet sums this film up rather nicely its emotional resonance lies in the relationship between the 2 leads     as a function of the cosmos pitts death is a shell in search of the tangible realities humans take for granted he finds the epitome of life in hopkins never claiming to be a perfect individualparish is a rich manwith very human faults and trepidations     the result is a film which sells a single idea however it is an idea so strongit will linger and haunt you long after the credits roll

Aug 23 2006,positive,i cry at the end of this movie  every time
Aug 22 2006,positive,brad pitt suprises me i actually like him in a movie like this hes great this was a really slow moving film tho emotions built up to high for the intensity that the actors put forward a lil disapointment but a good one
Aug 22 2006,positive,long but stick with it because i think it says a lot hopkins is great but florlani bugs me but hey she gets pitt love the music and the pace
Aug 22 2006,positive,i thought this was an extrodinary movie the only thing that botherd me the slighest is that i thought the ending was increadbly long i knew that it would have to be a long ending so you could really get the feel and the direction of this movie so im not overly upset by that on the other hand i feel like pitt played his caracter great i cant imagine a better way to pull off that role and hopkins also lived up to his reputation of being another top notch actor this movie is one of my favorites and i do reccomend anyone to watch this if you like movies with depth however it is a long movie and the end may seem to drag so dont watch it if your tired
Aug 22 2006,positive,its ok because it has brad pitt in it
Aug 22 2006,positive,brad pitt most definitely one of my favourite actors for both this and fight club each character was convincing even the devil a moving story

Aug 20 2006,positive,amazingly long but worth it i love the music in it so very much good acting even from pitt and a touching story line what i dont understand is how at the end she assumes that she likes this other guy when actually he isnt death at all they just look the same and ditto with death to start with love me thinks not someone is just all lusty for mr pitt but other than that i really enjoyed it 
Aug 19 2006,positive,you never know lightning might strike
Aug 18 2006,positive,i never got the movie but brad pitt looked good in it
Aug 18 2006,positive,brad looking amazing in this but besides that the thought and the writing behind this mad eit truly warming adn at times emotional  the most memorable scene being the accident and that really is a shocker rumours whenb the film was being made that brad had actually been killed as someone saw this prior to release demonstrate the reality to which it ws directed
Aug 18 2006,positive,from the 1998 but it is a really good movie

Aug 3 2006,positive,long but very good this movie compelled me to like brad pitt
Aug 3 2006,positive,long slow but worth it
Aug 3 2006,negative,a truly bizarre notion and not one that seems plauseable in stretch of the imagination    in my view brad pitt has two levels of acting pretty boy brad and scruffy brad he seems to do better in the latter however in the film we see pretty    it wasnt a total diasaster but has more than its fair share of bad points  wasnt this film a box office flop      at three hours long and none to exciting ones at that i feel i should give the film a good point too which i think lies with claire felani

Jul 27 2006,negative,the bus scene is good for rewindable hilarity
Jul 26 2006,positive,the woman acts really fantistically and hopkins is amazing  he really proves that he can make any crap script stand out the film is a bit too long really
Jul 25 2006,positive,very differenti need to rewatch it
Jul 25 2006,positive,it was really really long
Jul 21 2006,positive,reason to watch anthony hopkins     and there is lots of backilghting the ending takes ten minutes too long and brad pitt is unsubtle

Jun 26 2006,positive,centerimg  center center  center center      centerbyou never know lightning could strikeb center  center center  center center      centerit seems when this movie was made the producers seemed to think that they had an epic movie on their hands at times this movie shows a glimmer of some kind of classic epic story like gone with the wind but unfortunately its completely overdone and seems like a perfect waste of something that couldve been greatcenter  center center  center center      centerthe script has this enchanting dialogue at times that makes you want to fall in love and live life to the fullest but unfortunately the same lines seem repeated and the movie says its theme more than one too many times for any real emotion to click brad pitt plays a very sexy joe black aka death which is very real and at times has very good moments but there are also many awkward moments from pitt where i think he couldve handled himself better i do think this part of this is the script againcenter  center center  center center      centerthe movie is way too long cutting it close to 3 hours there is no way this is a three hour movie i love the idea of death walking among us and falling in love  but the movie drags us through a half hour of goodbyes and even concluding with something that never really is goodbye im going to spoil the ending a bit but i did not like how it ended it drags into a goodbye and the final where william anthony hopkins and joe walk over the bridge is uninspirative joes reunion with susan claire forlani is suppose to be bittersweet but rather negates the entire prior 20 minutes of filmcenter  center center  center center      centeri wish some other figure wouldve came into this film and just cut some of the script it feels like every line had been filmed and none of it edited and thats what the movie desperately needs its troublesome that there is this great film trapped in an overlong movie trying to say too much with that said its still a decent film but fails to what it could becenter  center center  center center      centerimg  center center  center center      centerbwhere normal people have a heart neil mccormick has a bottomless black hole and if you dont watch out you can fall in and get lost foreverb center  center center  center center      centermysterious skin is a very troubled and powerful movie the movie opens to bthe summer i was 8 years old five hours disappeared from my lifeb where it sets the tone of how one experience can shape what direction you go in for the rest of your life there are more than a few disturbing sequences in this film that follows two characters that are connected through a summer of child abuse one character is neil joseph gordonlevitt a boy that was seduced by this baseball coach and eventually set him in the direction of being gay and losing himself in being with much older men and brian brady corbetwith no memory of what happened to him as a child and completely blocking off everything except wrapping upself up in ufos where he believes he had been abducted center  center center  center center      centerthe movie is very difficult to watch during many of its scenes whether its the act of child abuse neils encounter with the man with aids or neil getting brutally raped there are alot of things to cringe at in the film with that said and put out to for anyone planning on seeing mysterious skin gregg araki its director even takes the most disturbing scenes and turns it into something the viewer can really feel through wonderful craft the cereal scene takes something as awful child molestation and crafts it into a creepy but yet beautiful playful scene neils encounter with aids to me was almost unbearable to watch only because you can see neils face suffering as much as the man is suffering the shower rape scene is the movie at its most violent and even though its painful to even think about araki captures the horror i have to give araki so much credit for the film the movie takes many awful topics and sequences and crafts them perfectly to what they should be he can make a movie with so much pain and suffering and yet make the ending so poeticcenter  center center  center center      centerthe ending i must just meantion you follow neil and brian around with them never encountering each other but knowing that they have this huge history until its finale where both characters comes to terms brian is forced to face what actually happened to him while neil seemed to think of it as magic finally has realized what actually came out of it and wishes he could take it backcenter  center center  center center      centerthe heavy script and dialogue is brilliant along with the surprise of how gordonlevitts acting brings neil to life along with the supporting cast what really makes the movie so tender is arakis fantastic directing with some of the best ive seen all year its rare to take something as heavy as mysterious skin and allow the viewer to accept everything that they have seen and still be touched by so much wonder in itcenter  center center  center center      centerband as we sat there listening to the carolers i wanted to tell brian it was over now and everything would be okay but that was a lie plus i couldnt speak anyway i wish there was some way for us to go back and undo the past but there wasnt there was nothing we could do so i just stayed silent and trying to telepathically communicate how sorry i was about what had happened and i thought of all the grief and sadness and fucked up suffering in the world and it made me want to escape i wished with all my heart that we could just leave this world behind rise like two angels in the night and magically disappearb center
Jun 26 2006,positive,teh sex  that is all
Jun 26 2006,positive,tagline no one can die  while he loves its a wonderful lovestory and a very good mystery the scene were joe black gets hit by a car is flourishing on the net just a few second of a cut that looks like a real accident back to the movie i think it can be seen by people in various ages pitt playes his role well as always as for hopkins hes is as brilliant as ever this is a movie worth watching again
Jun 26 2006,positive,so funny just plain funny hes so str8 fwd its funny
Jun 26 2006,positive,an intresting movie idea i love anthony hopkins and really respect his acting capabilities he was also very good in shadowlands pitt takes an odd role in this movie but portrays it very well i recommend it to anyone purely because it is intresting though it is nothing amazing

Jun 25 2006,positive,brad pitt roks in this film  the film itself was great too
Jun 25 2006,positive,brad pitt is really funny in this film but the plot moves a bit slow
Jun 24 2006,positive,good film excellent work by hopkins  different film
Jun 24 2006,positive,brad pitt is such a stud
Jun 24 2006,positive,this is a real tearjerker movie brilliant acting by brad pitt and anthony hopkins this movie is just not for words i recommend seeing it
Jun 24 2006,positive,first  laughed myself stupid when brad gets shafted at the beginning though im sure i wasnt supposed to find it funny  also it should have ended about 20 minutes before it actually did
Jun 24 2006,neutral,i read the play this story was based on a few years ago and fell completely in love with it so decided to check out this movie overall it was a disappointment the story involved did not nearly justify the three hours i spent watching my main complaints centered around the main female character and the plotlines involving her she had absolutely no personality at the end i realized i wasnt entirely sure what her name was i named her julie as the love plotline drew to a close i was entirely dissatisfied with the ending they chose to go with  i cant remember how the original play ended but i liked it so it must have been better than this bizarre one where a dead character is resurrected for her and somehow she knows that the original guy she fell in love with was actually death or well maybe she knows this at one point he seemed to be telepathically communicating it    either way the character development and growth didnt really happen in the first 2 12 hours and then it closed off in a completely nonsensical way that left me going wait  what how does that work why does that work no you cant do that movie that is dumb however brad pitt is ever so charming in this slightly offbeat role and i found myself caring about his romantic plotline solely because he had won me over even though i was unimpressed with his choice of woman or resolution

Apr 7 2006,positive,anthony cant go wrong i like this story and how it never really talks about the controvercy of religion joe is never associated with any particular religion and theres no real mention of god i think that it gives the viewer the right to interpret it for themself according to their own faith or lack there of

Dec 12 2005,positive,great movie nothing else to say its just so damn good leaves a gushy feeling in you
Jul 23 2005,positive,best in show anthony hopkins  one for the future claire forlani but stop that rolling of the eyes tic  standout scene reveal at end  brainer or nobrainer no brainer  stands up to one viewing or repeated one  dvd commentary any good na    sure brad pitt is easy on the eye but an hour and a half film spread over three hours director martin brest reportedly disowned a shorter cut made for airplane transmission but the man is seriously in need of a faculty to edit borne out by his last film gigli which should have been edited out of existence any scene featuring faux jamaican patois the only worse onscreen example came courtesy of one jar jar binks could and should have been trimmed pitt reviving his true romance character to poor effect anthony hopkins plays ageing media mogul bill parrish a man on the verge of his 65th birthday one morning parrishs daughter susan meets a dashing stranger at a coffee shop pitt and when an rta offs said gnarly bohunk after the two part death seizes a chance to take a holiday in the mortal world at this point i recalled the death takes a holiday segment of gary larsons the far side tv show but rather than taking a scytheshaped case through customs the death of this movie simply hitches a ride in the body of the recently deceased mortal and what a mortal to choose for the remainder of the movie pitt exhudes a mixture of stupefaction and naivety death having made an agreement with parrish to delay the moguls death by a few weeks in exchange for the chance to observe life on earth in his company an added complication arises in the form of sarahs attraction towards death who has adopted the name of joe black behind the scenes machinations regarding a merger of parrishs company with a rival and parrishs relationship with his other daughter allison form major subplots but you get the feeling that less would have been more and unlike other lengthy films such as lord of the rings trilogy the material isnt meaty enough to spread across 180 minutes and instead seems padded with filler and hence outstays its welcome
Jul 18 2005,positive,meet joe black is sertainly a very interesting movie although its not what it could have been           the idea behind it was very good and the story was well put together we never really got to know just how mr black works the movie touched no spiritualreligiousfantasy grounds and im glad they did it that way brad pitts fantastic acting made this character perfect anthony hopkins did a great job as well the problem with this movie was that it never quite reached its climaxit almost did a few times but at the end it failed to deliver they could have added more to the story but ironically another major problem for this movie was that it was just too long the ending felt dragged out and lost a lot of its edge            a decent movie but a bit too long and never quite reached its top
Jun 12 2005,positive,fun to watch  cool premise
May 13 2005,positive,brad pitt was evidently much prettier than nowadays but his bad laugh was with him even at that time so my surprise was limited only to his looks but not to the way he spoke or laughed that was the same just like in snatch or fight club sometimes i even ask myself if pitts awful pronunciation was a decisive factor in his featuring  in snatch as a cunning gypsy who knows wed better ask brad of richie themselves     all right enough of this slandering cause the film is quite worthy of appraisal and even of what id prefer to name as renown theres nothing special in the film but the actors and the plot perfectly woven out of small pieces of perfect acting and heartfelt melodrama just have a look at the names of the male leads anthony hopkins and brad pitt and youll get quite anxious to see the film so was i though cause it was the main reason why i got attracted to the film there wasnt anything else that could do it no glossy cover no screaming advertisements the film is rather old no pretty faces on the cover  only a bridge over the stream and a male figure in the distance i wonder why they didnt put the girls face on the cover because shes rather pretty in a way though not a great actress  sometimes it seemed to me that her only capacity was to show a dreamy look in her eyes and a vacant air when she didnt know what to say     the beginning is intriguing and the action grasps our attention from the very start though never straining the spectator too much generally the movement is a bit slow in the film though never slow enough to be regarded as a bore everything is woven in a perfect harmony and no detail is omitted the old man hopkins wakes up at night to hear a strange voice coming out of nowhere hes at a loss and is seemingly out of place cause he spent 65 years of his successful life without hearing such voices on the next day from his talk with his daughter we come to know shes not quite happy in her private life which is fairly compensated that very day when she happens to get acquainted with a young man brad pitt no wonder and fall for him at once unfortunately the man dies in a car accident some minutes after they part     not in vain does he perish cause he was chosen by death himself to become the means of presence in the world the young man wasnt the only choice of inquisitive death he chooses the old man to guide through intricacies of human life for some time before death takes him to the valley of death the old man has to agree and nothing terrible would come out of it unless the girl hadnt fallen for the guy already that becomes the knot and the starting point for the melodrama cause the girl loves not death but joe black as frank her father pointedly introduced him the whole film becomes the depiction of their relations that come a long way from not knowing each other to making love love fills their lives but it has to be finished because of deaths peculiar duties theres some other plot lines helping the spectator not get bored or crying over the girl and the guy fight for the newspapers future some perfect scenes of fatherdaughter love dialogue and a funny role of the elder daughters husband with a fine deep voice finally the bad guy drew gets punished and frank dies after he negotiates his daughters happiness the final scenes are the girl running after her father and meeting the young man who doesnt remember at all what has happened to him for the last two days the girl understands at once that it was death that took her father away and her mission is now to live happily with the romantic man she came across at a café that was deaths gift to her and she appears to conceive it     on the whole the film is superb with nothing heavy or boring in it it can be viewed plenty of times till you know the lines by heart especially those lines about love  
May 9 2005,positive,well produced finely acted by all especially forlani its main flaw is its extreme length and there is no reason for it fascinating story interesting pitts frosted hair has to go
May 8 2005,positive,sometimes movie critics just suck in this case  i went to check on here  how much that movie got  and it was bad   i cannot understand how is it possible not to like that movie      i must say i fell in love with this movie  its definatly going in my top 10  dont know which spot  vut its going in  the first half of the movie id say  cause themovie is somewhere around 3 hours long  so id say the first hour and a hlaf is more like a comedy than anything else  william parrish anthony hopkins start hearing voices  that voice hes hearing is the voice of death  he doesnt know that at first  but will discover the truth a bit later  death or named joe black later on is played by brad pitt it is really funny when william hopkins meets joe pitt well at first since joe is death  he has taken a body of someone who did a bit earlier during that day and now he has to get familiar with the way human live  so its just funny to see him trying to figure out what to do with a spoon  and his obsession about peanut butter  then the second half of the movie is more tragedic  susan parrish  second daughter of william parrish played by claire forlani  not be be mistaken by angelina jolie  yes the first time i was her  early in the movie  i was sure that it was angelina jolie  but dont worry  that actress is even prettier than angelina jolie  she is so beautiful   anyway so the second half of the movie  susan forlani fell in love with joe  she actually dont know who is joe  but still fell for him  and joe also fell for susan  even if he doesnt know what love is exactly  so the rest of the story is more about tragedy  death  loss  love  reconciliation the movie was actually amazing  superb  i could go on for long  story was fantastic  fresh  not something we are use to see  face to face with death is something really fun to watch  i was amazed by the talent of all the actors  ok you cant go really wrong with anthony hopkins  neither with brad pitt  even if im not a big fan of him  but claire forlani wasnt really known  made some movies  but alot of them were bad  so i wasnt expecting much  but i was once again stunned  she was so good  performance of her life i say  jeffrey tambor who played quince was good too  i just loved him  funny fact  he looks like doctor phill hehe  so i would recommend that movie without hesitation  there is absolutly no weak points to that movie  its not a new release heh  so probably most of you have seen it  but for those like me who never got to see that movie  go rent it fast  or just buy it if youre like me and getting yourself a nice dvd collection       again its a must see   9510
Mar 20 2005,positive,this was definetely an interesting movie it was the type of movie that you eat ice cream with and something youd watch when you and youre friends want a good peice of eye candy     part of dvd collectionthumbs down
Mar 12 2005,positive,img  this movie has some of the most beautiful lines   anthony hopkins and brad pitt were both amazing   granted you have to be a person who can appreciate good movies with good acting and good storyline that doesnt need to see action and can actually sit through a drama  still the storyline was very creative though a bit dark it was a very interesting story it is about death but its death as you wouldnt have thought of him   good movie and i could watch it over and over in the hope to memorize some of those great lines   img romantic too     warning for those of you like me who are not interested in inappropriate scenes watch out for the second scene by the pool its a fastforward scene     love  meurl  font
Mar 9 2005,positive,i really really really liked this movie the ending is what made me give it a nine i thought it would be maybe more psychological or out there but it was still an incredible movie

Jun 4 2004,positive,began very well but slowed down in the middle it has a number of fine twists but had way too many false endings and was too long almost 3 hours couldnt really flow with death being so naive
Mar 15 2004,positive,centerimg    okay im a big fan of anthony hopkins as well as brad pitt and to be honest i love both of them deeply with admiration for the roles they play and especially anthony in this one he is perfect in this role his voice of death is fantastic and definately a voice that should be death and when i am to die i want his voice echoing throughout a room nobody elses brad pitt isnt the best in this role i dont really like how he plays the death character though his first character was good and i would have liked to see more or seen this character at the end instead of a mixture of the two death  coffee shop man     anyway the film is fantastic and very depressing not in a bad way in a sense that you want to cry at the end i hate death i hate the subject of death it usually makes me worry about my own mortal coil that i am on i had to get into a particular mood for a story i am writing at the moment and this did it i wrote 11 pages in one day my hand still hurts from writing     the film is great the ending is fantastic the fireworks exploding the sky in colour its unimaginable and fantastic to see claire forlani is okay as the leading female but to be honest i dont know she didnt seem to control the screen there was something about her she was beautiful stunning even id run away and marry her anyday but there was something lacking     something which marcia gay harden brought to me i loved her character more because her character had more of a journey at the start she realised her father didnt care and at the end she realised he did even though she loved him so much he cared i loved the last scene with marcia and anthony where they both speak their minds about her childhood and his favorites and how he loves her its fantastic the dialogue throughout is great     okay i must agree brad pitts jamacian accent isnt great but it passes you know what i mean man  anyway all in all i think this film earned its 8 points in a great dialogue kinda way its a film i can always watch again and again and will get me looking forward to death a bit more which we all are hoping to someday
Mar 8 2004,positive,up i love this film brad pitt is gorgeous in this movie and claire forlani is beautiful anthony hopkins plays his part well and all the actors seem to have such a great on screen chemistry its a general feel good movie i love this film its possibly one of my favourites i recommend it to everyone up
Feb 26 2004,positive,i just wanted to say that i  because of my new girlfriend vicky  changed my working time to fit my working shift to hers that means ive to get up way earlier but thats someting i can take only to see her at work tooand we are only dating for a month up to today     before you all ask yes she has light blonde hair and middle dark blue eyes and her hair is styled to a pony tail at workvery sexy i have to say  shes a biochemical phd and therefor a bigger smartypants that i am     im so happy at the moment right nowi wanted to share that with you
Jan 3 2004,positive,img       it runs way way to long at 3 hours pitt was severly miscasted you never believe that susan parrish claire forlani can fall in love with joe black brad pitt  martin brest from what i saw here and what i heard about gigli is that he isnt a very good director he refuses to end scenes when they should have already been over even with all of these negatives i still enjoyed it  hopkins was amazing like always even though ran way to long it still held my interest all of the way through  there just is to much that is good in this movie to call a complete mess  it is a mess but somehow a good mess i see why some people call this movie horrible and some people call this movie fantastic
