"Jul 11, 2022",negative," A cheap sexual fantasy designed for mass consumption, Fifty Shades of Grey approaches the otherwise risqué subject of BDSM and neuters it. Rather than fully explore the dark realms of sadism or even adequately investigate an unhealthy abusive relationship, this adaptation retreads clichés in a format best suited for the dullest of mainstream viewers. Having not read E.L. James’ first (or second, or third) book in her trilogy, my view on the phenomenon and controversy may be limited. But after enduring the film, I can write that any fuss made about the exploitative nature of director Sam Taylor-Johnson’s adaptation hasn’t considered what a tedious, completely dismissible film lies before us. Here’s a film that is offensive only in how inoffensive it proves to be. It transforms what should be a complicated, lurid relationship between a dominant and submissive into a laughable formula about an innocent girl and her mysterious man. She’s an awkward bookworm; he’s a wealthy control freak. Mix these stereotypes together with a bondage fetish, and you get something akin to Pride and Prejudice with kink—except neither romantic nor erotic nor even boundary-pushing. With much lower-lip-biting to cornball effect, Dakota Johnson plays the mousy Anastasia Steele (the resident Elizabeth Bennet), a virginal college student (fond of classical romances by Jane Austen no less). When she interviews Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for her college newspaper, she’s immediately taken by his steely, intimidating presence. Erudite and formal, the young billionaire runs an ambiguous communications company (where he only hires women who look like Robert Palmer dancers) and avows that he “exercises control in all things.” In addition to a few other warning signs, Christian grows fascinated with Ana and begins borderline stalking her. And perhaps because she’s inexperienced in such things, she’s charmed by his creepy attention. Then comes the moment when any sane person would walk away from his courtship: He asks her to sign a non-disclosure agreement before he touches her. Along with allusions to his “singular” sexual proclivities, the fact that he wants her to sign a contract, and she actually considers it, is part of what makes this an absurd fantasy. It turns out Christian likes to tie women up in his “playroom” and punish them. Though, he claims to enjoy such acts only if his submissives are getting as much pleasure from the experience as he does. Nothing about the seemingly smart, certainly reserved Ana and her very normal life suggests that she would be game for a little S&M. So why, when all of the signs point to Christian having major issues, does she stick around? That question is never adequately answered in the film and remains glaring. And because of that, Fifty Shades of Grey is nothing more than surfaces (color-timed in muted, grayscale shades), polished up with just the right amount of not-too-out-there erotica that won’t offend mainstream crowds. Audiences witness hands tied, blindfolds on, feather tickling, light spanks, and whipping. Nothing too scandalous. Indeed, bondage has never been so boring or felt so commoditized. Each of these acts is filmed like a music video and set to pop music by, more often than not, Beyoncé (she contributes two titles to the soundtrack). There’s one sequence where each thrust is timed with a beat, and each beat coincides with a cut from one shot to another. And the nudity in these scenes is almost exclusively one-sided, with Johnson baring far more, and more consistently, than her male costar. But ultimately, these scenes are no more erotic than watching monkeys mounting one another at the zoo. None of this would matter if interesting characters inhabited Fifty Shades of Grey, but there are none to be found. Questions about Ana’s motivations bother us until we remember she’s very inexperienced in relationships. To be sure, any self-respecting woman would have run far, far away from Christian at the first mention of an NDA, not to mention Christian’s later dom-sub contract. So what does she see in him? Christian is bland, robotic, but good-looking enough, I suppose. Without an interesting dimension beneath his exterior layer, the Irish actor plays him un-emotive from behind a rigid American accent. He’s broody and, as Ana observes on multiple occasions, unable to articulate his feelings. When she asks why he must punish her to achieve pleasure, he responds, “This is how I am.” How does such a poor communicator preside over a billion-dollar company? But because she’s naïve, she overlooks his utterly deficient personality in favor of his fancy cars, posh apartments, helicopter rides, and glider flights. Or maybe she just enjoys how he showers her with gifts: a first-edition copy of Tess of the D’Urbervilles, a new laptop, and an Audi. By the time Ana confesses her love for Christian, we cannot help but wonder what she’s fallen in love with—there’s nothing there. Many have questioned the sexual politics and implications of the book and film. The material brings into question female submissiveness as it relates to gender roles throughout history. And you could argue that it perpetuates violent relationships against women (although she leaves him in the end, quite abruptly, suggesting that such relationships are not condoned by the filmmaker/author). However, debating these serious topics in relation to this material gives it too much credit. There’s nothing the least bit insightful or insulting about this product. It has been tailored for the lowest common denominator demographic, many of whom filled the theater during my screening. The largely middle-aged crowd of women whispered and giggled; their low hum of chatter barely subsided for the film’s 125-minute runtime. They were no more affected or offended by what was happening onscreen than they were during Twilight, seven years ago. Had Fifty Shades of Grey been NC-17 rated and really pushed the limits of mainstream sexuality in film, it’s doubtful that it would have been received with such widespread commercial enthusiasm. If there’s a dangerous sociological consequence to the film, it resides in how topics that should be significant are presented in such a fluffy way that, when left to its target audience, they can be damaging if only for the ignorance with which it’s received. But Fifty Shades of Grey manages to be a non-issue and quite often boring, which is surprising, given the swell of passionate negative reception and controversy about the book in some circles. Outspoken feminists, authors, and news outlets grant the material far too much credit by suggesting it has any significant meaning (beyond supplying sexually bored readers and viewers with a look at fringe sexuality through a clichéd lens). To expend any energy getting mad about its possible but mostly nonexistent subtexts is a waste of time. For BDSM-brand controversy, seek out Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990), Bitter Moon (1992), The Piano Teacher (2001), Secretary (2002), or even Nymphomaniac (2014)—each of these films respects its audiences enough to at least attempt to provoke the viewer. Watching these other films, you might find yourself offended or pushed to the limit, even unable to watch. Others might find themselves turned on. For me, Fifty Shades of Grey accomplishes almost no reaction whatsoever, except for being so bland and programmed that it’s laughably dismissible. And where BDSM in cinema is involved, the film isn’t doing its job if it isn’t somehow stimulating."
"Feb 2, 2021",negative," Remember when Valentine’s Day was about fancy chocolates, dozens of long stemmed roses and Cupid targeting lover’s hearts with his trusty bow and arrow? With the release of the soft-core-porn soon-to-be-blockbuster, “Fifty Shades of Grey,” this year Cupid’s arrow isn’t aimed at the heart. Based on the erotic thriller by E. L. James, the movie stars Irish actor Jamie Dornan as handsome C.E.O. and slap-and-tickle enthusiast Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson, the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, as Ana Steele, a literature student sent to interview Grey, only to find herself under the spell of the businessman’s exotic proclivities. According to the young, impressionable woman he is “polite, smart and really intimidating.” Showered with gifts like a first edition of “Tess of the D’Urbervilles,” she submits to his charms—he’s wealthy, good looking—allowing him to go all a-type on her, in and out of the bedroom. “I exercise control on all things Miss Steele,” he says, a character trait he expresses through BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism). “I don’t do romance. My tastes are very singular.” I’ll cut to the chase. There are sex scenes, there is nudity and yes, Virginia, there are whips and chains but don’t expect the smutty stuff from the books. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson has whipped the material into mainstream theatre shape, shaving the rough edges off the novel’s explicit kinky sex scenes. The randy pair spend more time talking about their sexual liaisons than actually getting horizontal… or suspended… or anything else. They blabber and negotiate—“I’m not going to touch you,” he says. “Not till I have your written consent.”—yammering on about submission, domination and safe words till even the Marquis de Sade would nod off from boredom. But for all the talk, we never learn anything about why Grey is disposed to liberally mixing his pleasure with pain. “It’s the way I am,” he says. He doesn’t go to dinner or movies; he simply wants her to earn his devotion by being his submissive. This is communicated simply, with a combination of “sweet” talk –“If you were mine you wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week.”—and predatory behaviour that, if not for his billions, would land him in jail for stalking or worse. The psychological introspection on display here makes Dr. Phil seem like Friedrich Nietzsche. Of the two leads Dakota Johnson seems ripped from the pages of the book. Her gamine innocence and girlish giggle convey the emotional rawness necessary for the character to work. She is naked, emotionally and physically—unlike her co-star who, for all we know, is as anatomically correct as a Ken doll—with a propensity for drunk dialling and permanently dewy look about her that betrays the confusion and attraction Ana feels toward Grey. Dornan has the thankless role. His grim-faced Christian Grey is an unemotional cipher, a bubbling cauldron of unexplored trauma and Dornan plays him straight faced which much have been tough while delivering unintentionally hilarious lines—call it a domination comedy or dom com—like, “Roll your eyes at me again and I will take you across my knee.” His delivery is just as sexy as that time your cranky old grandfather said it to you when you were ten. His burning passion is conveyed by his intense gaze, which often looks clinical, as if he’s examining her naked body for irregular moles. “Fifty Shades of Grey” feels like an elegantly made—the cinematography and score are top notch—night time soap opera. It’s a cliff-hanger—expect the inevitable sequel to pick up EXACTLY where this film leaves off—and the kind of R-rated movie that feels more like a cold shower than a hot romance.

"Dec 4, 2020",negative," frumpily dressed Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), compensating with a 4.0 GPA and English Literature romanticism, heads to Seattle’s Grey House to conduct an interview with wealthy telecommunications magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). She’s substituting for her sick roommate Kate (Eloise Mumford), who has prepared a series of hopelessly dull questions that become just the start of Anastasia’s unpreparedness, clumsiness, and flustered attitude. Nevertheless, the cool, collected, intense Grey is fascinated by the young woman, just as she exhibits an immediate infatuation herself. The following day, Christian surprises Anastasia at her hardware store clerk job, setting in motion a collection of flirtations and interactions that lead to repeated visits to his luxurious apartment. It’s there that she reveals her inexperience with men and he alludes to his own dark secrets – namely, whips and chains. Though one of the spelled-out rules of dominance/submission is consensual participation, “Fifty Shades of Grey” instantly breaks its own rules, with Christian attempting to coerce Anastasia into a role she’s not comfortable with – and vice versa, as she hopes to taper off his extreme sexual preferences for the more standard wooing habits of a dinner and a movie. Oddly, their lack of chemistry seems fitting in a romance between a carnal novice and an emotionally damaged robot. With all the advertising and hype, it’s difficult to remain completely oblivious to the main attraction of “Fifty Shades of Grey,” which is the sadomasochistic dalliances and insinuated supercharged eroticism (and what turns out to be a lot of graphic nudity). Bondage is certainly not something regularly explored in mainstream cinema. Here, the dialogue makes frequent, foreshadowing hints at Grey’s unusual predilections, inspiring decent laughs for those aware of the subject matter. “You’re the complete serial killer,” jokes Anastasia, as Grey purchases cable ties, masking tape, and rope – in fact, tools for his singular playroom. Were it not for the publicity surrounding the picture, the first act could have established a typical teen romantic comedy. Unfortunately, the coquetries start to resemble Bella and Edward banter, which is not surprising considering the project’s origination as “Twilight” fan fiction. The similarities stop there, however, as the fantastical romance (something of an edgier “Pretty Woman”) morphs away from commonplace “Cinderella” reveries and into “The Story of O” or the many “Emmanuelle” movies and their copyright-circumventing Laura Gemser derivatives (using the name “Emanuelle,” sans an “m”). “I don’t do romance,” insists Grey, even though he’s prone to rescuing Steele from her own drunkenness or taking her on thrill-seeking dates. Later, the mention of genital clamps and anal fisting also drives a wedge between the juvenile origins. In a particularly cheap premise, the leading man is a billionaire, capable of offering helicopter rides, fancy cars, and opulent dwellings. This clouds Steele’s motives, as audiences can never be sure of the degree that endless riches influence her choices; the temptation for promiscuity transitions to one of financial possibilities. Grey also has plenty of time off to have sex all weekend long. For equilibrium, bits of unaffecting humanism are thrown in (such as a prying mother and stock siblings), along with a brief history of the cause of Grey’s sexual deviance, glimpsing the marginally interesting psychological metamorphoses and manifestations of abuse (the whys of BDSM are likely the most engrossing aspects of the behavior). The notion of freedom from responsibility and making decisions is comparably piquing, but the pain-as-pleasure idea is hard to swallow, outside of the cinematic realm of “Hellraiser’s” Cenobites. At least, the film goes out of the way to show the use of condoms. But regardless of the themes or the boilerplate that replaces original character designs, the most unforgivable aspect is the ending; since this is the first part of a trilogy, “Fifty Shades of Grey” isn’t even a marginally complete story. This entire first chapter is just the introduction – resulting in something grossly less than a competent movie.

"Sep 7, 2020",negative," If you would weave together a pinch of the softcore stylings of Red Shoe Diaries, a dab of the hyper-stylized Playboy videos, and ever so slight hints of the naughtiness meets psychosocial intrigue of Secretary or maybe 9 1/2  Weeks, then you may very well have an idea of what to expect from Fifty Shades of Grey, the adaptation of British author E.L. James's bestselling novel of the same name. Already having garnered its fair share of controversy, thus adding fuel to its inevitable box-office fire, Fifty Shades of Grey centers around Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson, 21 Jump Street and Need for Speed), a sheltered English Lit major on the verge of college graduation when she meets attractive young billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan, television's The Fall and Once Upon a Time), whose attraction to Anastasia is surpassed only by his need to control absolutely everything about absolutely every human relationship he's in. In case you're still wondering, this means that Christian is a ""dominant,"" a BDSM term indicating a role of control within a sexual scene or lifestyle. This also means that Christian is not seeking from Anastasia a traditional dating relationship, after all he doesn't do romance, but is instead seeking for her to be his ""submissive,"" a role in which she would essentially surrender herself to his wants and needs without question. There are some, particularly those within the faith community, who are already protesting Fifty Shades of Grey loudly. The protests grew even louder after the film's hyper-stylized trailer played during this year's Super Bowl and triggered accusations that the film promotes sexual violence, domestic violence, and the glorification of violence against women. Alternately, there are some who defend the film just as loudly by stressing the mutual consent within the relationship and, quite simply, the fact that BDSM is both widely popular and widely misunderstood. There are also those who consider the film as a true depiction of BDSM or even rape fantasy, the latter being an admittedly darker yet existing sexual practice amongst more experienced and extreme practitioners of BDSM. The simple truth, at least in my estimation, is that the notion of being ""swept away"" remains an intense fantasy. In Fifty Shades of Grey, being swept away by this attractive, dominating, and filthy rich man is completely enveloping because it touches on the desire to be protected, controlled, safe, and financially secure.  The books also, at their very essence, tap into that very basic idea that true love heals everything. The curious thing, at least to those whose minds work critically, is that practically anyone would openly tell you that Fifty Shades of Grey and its companion books are horribly written. This isn't meant as a slight to James, who has clearly written works of great popularity and cultural relevance, but merely as an observation that a book that started out as Twilight fan fiction doesn't have a particularly brilliant story and does, in fact, contain some of most incredibly insipid dialogue one could possibly imagine. Now then, I'm not completely convinced that you're here to actually read a review of Fifty Shades of Grey, mostly because I'm not 100% convinced that fans of Fifty Shades of Grey can actually read. However, I suppose my film criticism code of ethics demands that I at least attempt to express the experience to be had while watching Fifty Shades of Grey.  To her credit, E.L. James did not write a book that glorifies violence against women or rape or domestic violence. There is a difference between these things and BDSM, though certainly there would be those practitioners capable of drawing a line between the two. Definitely existing within the world of erotica and fantasy, James's novels more fully explore the myriad of issues present within the complex relationship that exists between Anastasia and Christian. Christian is, in his own words, ""50 shades of f***ed up"" and incapable of anything resembling a mutually satisfying relationship. Within the relatively short span of a two hour film, it is impossible to fully explore what created Christian and, as a result, we are left to watch a man whose behaviors border on sociopathic, easily cross the line of stalking, are unfathomably controlling and exhibit more than subtle hints of domestic violence. Do I believe this is the filmmaker's intent or the film's meaning? Nope. That doesn't matter. The simple truth is that Jamie Dornan's performance is so incredibly weak that without a full context his Christian Grey comes off as sociopathic rather than seductive, controlling rather than dominant, and frightening rather than fantasy-making. There was never a moment in Fifty Shades of Grey when I bought into this ""relationship"" nor did I ever buy into Dornan's Grey as a man capable of creating a business empire or commanding anyone's attention let alone their bodies. In fact, I'd dare say that for someone supposed to be a dominant that Dornan's Grey is almost painfully submissive. Johnson, on the other hand, fares modestly better as Anastasia, oozing vulnerability and yet believably portraying a more confident and, I'll say disciplined, young woman than is ever brought to life in the book. Johnson, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, gives the film nice moments of lightness and even humor, a welcome touch given that it becomes apparent early on that the hints of darkness will never become more than hints. The biggest problem here, however, is that Johnson's character shifts so quickly and plays off Dornan's so badly that Anastasia ends up looking and feeling like a woman with a raging personality disorder whose back-and-forth histrionics are more erratic than empowering. There's a surprising lack of sex in Fifty Shades of Grey, the film's sensuality defined by a handful of scenes that are vividly brought to life by Seamus McGarvey's lensing but that are surprisingly devoid of the book's more intense scenes. We get a few nude shots of Anastasia, not surprisingly, coupled with a couple butt shots of Christian, a handful of full body scenes from behind, and one hint of pube. In other words, it's fairly typical Hollywood sex with the modest addition of some whips, straps, etc. The scene that may very well be the sexiest is actually devoid of sex, a wonderful back-and-forth experience involving Christian, Anastasia, and a conference table. The truth is that if Fifty Shades of Grey wanted to really work, then Taylor-Johnson and crew needed to commit to a darker, edgier, and more compelling film. Dornan, whom I can't stress enough is miscast here, desperately needed to tap into Grey's darkness or he needed to pull a Charlie Hunnam and just back out of the project. At several points, I found myself picturing the suave and sophisticated sociopathic behavior of Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman, a characters whose sociopathic nature certainly dominated yet a character who had that edginess that Christian Grey so desperately needs here. The film's portray of dominance and submission is flaccid at best, with Dornan's Grey being an ineffectual dominant whose techniques reveal vast inexperience despite his claim of the number of women who have been in what he calls his ""play room."" The ""contract"" has several major practical flaws and far too often chooses faux style over substance. It also doesn't help that the chemistry between Dornan and Johnson is woefully lacking, making their flirtations unconvincing and their dominance and submission border on downright creepy and disturbing. The two actors, whom reports have said didn't actually get along during film, simply aren't strong enough yet within their craft to overcome a lack of chemistry and this lacking creates an unbelievable relationship made more unbelievable given the extraordinary circumstances. The great thing about a film like 50 Shades of Grey, which seems destined to take the box-office crown this opening weekend, is that you, as the moviegoer, should be pretty clear on whether it's a film for you. There's no disguising what it is and what to expect. With the folks at Universal Pictures trying to sell the film as a Valentine's Day Weekend spicy alternative, Fifty Shades of Grey won't likely fulfill any of your deepest and darkest fantasies but it may actually remind you how good you already have it."
"Jul 16, 2020",negative," Now I don’t claim to know anything about BDSM, but from what I can gather, people choose to participate through a mutual understanding and respect. The submissive is getting just as much out of it as the dominant. What disturbs me about Anastasia and Christian is that consent is never reached. Throughout, Anastasia contemplates, recoils, and flat out turns down Christian’s advances about the contract. While looking up the word “submissive” online, Anastasia is repulsed by the pictures she sees. Yet Christian still ends up persuading her to go through with it. There’s something just wrong about that. What I’m guessing is meant to be a woman’s sexual blossoming comes off more as a twisted character’s obsession to control someone physically and emotionally. E.L. James (novel), Kelly Marcel (screenplay), and Sam Taylor-Johnson (director) have crafted a disturbing story under the guise of romantic fantasy. Christian Grey is a mysterious playboy that every girl wants to be with, but in reality hides demons that make him a sociopath. After their first encounter, Anastasia is smitten beyond belief, but there’s no basis for that reaction. Jamie Dornan inhabits Christian as a steely-eyed, montone, no nonsense character. For someone who’s supposed to be sexually irresistible, Christian simply doesn’t sizzle. His mannerisms push us away instead of pull us in, and it only gets worse once his real desires come to the forefront. For a role that’s supposed to smolder like a young Marlon Brando, Christian Grey has more similarity with Patrick Bateman in American Psycho (2000). Dakota Johnson does her best with Anastasia. She’s effective at being the comedic klutz: tripping over things, never grasping the double entendres, etc. She gets a few good one-liners in, whether we’re supposed to laugh with or at her. But Anastasia’s motivations toward Christian do not make sense. What is it about him that attracts her? It clearly isn’t his charming personality. Is it his wealth? When he brings her into his “playroom,” why doesn’t she run away in terror? Every time she bites her lip, I wondered what the hell she was so fascinated with. If she can’t handle looking at pictures online, what makes her think she can handle it in real life? Since this is a fantasy, Anastasia has the mindset of being that “one special person” who can change Christian. Even when he tells her how many women he’s had in the same arrangement (because a person like him would keep count), she still continues along. This is a strange dynamic where Anastasia – under the false belief that she has ability to influence – allows herself to be tied up, beaten, and controlled by Christian in an effort to make him fall in love with her. Oh, how romantic! The sex, which I’m sure everybody will be eager to see, is dreadfully not sexy. Oddly – given that the author, screenwriter, director, and the main protagonist are all female – it’s Anastasia who bares it all. Not much is seen of Mr. Grey, except for the rare bum shot. While there’s a good amount of sexual encounters, they’re all photographed and edited the same way: with soft lighting and quick dissolves showing a body part here and there. There’s nothing all that sensational, graphic, or titillating. It’s about even to anything you’d see on Red Shoe Diaries or late night Cinemax. If you have an interest in watching other people getting it on, there are other, cheaper ways to do it besides this. This film unnerved me, and not in a good way. Seeing a girl getting tied up, whipped, and sexually humiliated is not my thing. And this is set to be a box office hit! Christian’s pursuit of Anastasia is downright creepy. This is not the same as say, Hitchcock’s Vertigo (1958) where the relationship is meant to be disturbing. There’s an ambivalence here that feels irresponsible, it doesn’t take a stand as to how Christian and Anastasia are meant to be perceived. The things he does tells us: no matter what a girl says or how unsure she is, as long as you take her on a helicopter ride you’ll be allowed to do anything you want with her. If you admit you had a bad childhood, that’ll give you the keys to the goods. Gimme a break. And she wants him because…why again? If anything, Fifty Shades of Grey can function as a barometer for society’s weird fascination of all things kinky. At my screening, it was packed to the brim, with people taking selfies to mark the occasion. Afterwards, some waited in line to grab a poster. What is it about this story that struck such a chord with popular culture? Is it because it started out as Twilight fan fiction and is enjoying the remnants of that success? Is it the result of the massive ad campaign? Or do people just want to see trashy things on screen? Because in terms of story and character, this film is in desperate need of a safe word."
"Apr 10, 2020",positive,"Overlong, too clinical in design, and based on lowest common denominator entertainment (or so I'm told), Fifty Shades of Grey still manages to be engaging, funny, and unexpectedly human."
"Nov 26, 2019",positive,"Given that this is her second film, [Sam] Taylor-Johnson directs the film with taste and care by focusing on the interactions between Ana and Christian rather than the sexual side of the story and the film looks stunning."
"Nov 12, 2019",negative," First of all, I know I'm not the target audience for this movie. Having said that, I gave Fifty Shades of Grey, like all movies I watch, a fair chance with an open mind.  The first half hour was the only portion of Fifty Shades of Grey with any sort of character. Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a humble, shy girl finishing up college who does pretty much nothing to prompt the interest, let alone garner lust from an eccentric billionaire who always gets his way. However, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) takes a sudden interest in her when she steps in for her ill roommate and embarks on a 10-minute interview with the head of 'Grey Enterprises'- whatever that might actually be. Once they get past the introduction, the film dives into exactly what you would expect based on everything you've either read or heard about from the novels. It completely loses any heart it had. For the next hour and a half, Christian and Anastasia play a manipulative game of nationwide hide and seek that includes lots and lots of sex. The entire bout feels completely meaningless because the characters hadn't been developed at all. The movie takes many liberties by assuming you know what happened in the book and leaves itself open for audience to point out plot holes. Why does Anastasia Steele have a thing for Christian Grey in the first place? Your answer is probably as good as mine, I have no idea. It seems like no reason other than the fact that he has a ridiculous amount of money. Outside of that, he borders being an abusive stalker with a personality (or lack there of) that no one would fall for but a gold digger, which Ana didn't really strike me as. I wonder what the trailer would have looked like if characters from the book weren't so commonly well-known. The movie relied way too heavily on prior knowledge of Christian Grey and his unique tastes in the bedroom which weren't unfathomable for a mature audience. Take any Nicholas Sparks movie, remove some plot and pull out any character development and replace those elements with as many sex scenes as you can before getting an NC-17 rating, and you have Fifty Shades."
"Sep 19, 2019",negative," Playful marketing provocations, heralded by the succinct tagline “Curious?” standing out beneath black and white production stills, somehow manages to be the most titillating aspect of the highly anticipated film adaptation of E.L. James’ erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, which, like many of its romantically inclined counterparts, only proves that watching people fuck or fall in love is generally only interesting to those involved directly. That’s, of course, discounting voyeurs and James’ core audience of straight-laced, sexually repressed hausfraus who have never taken an opportunity to explore base tendencies. It is their embrace that has resulted in this pop culture fixation. In a superficial sense, it’s enthralling to see that a studio production so clearly addresses notions of sexual pleasure, but fears of censorship have reigned in director Sam Taylor-Johnson’s visual freedom, and considering the subject matter, this is shockingly conservative (not unlike, say, that Rihanna music video for her ‘S&M’ track that clearly has no idea what more alternative sexual tendencies look like). What’s more curious is how the film has been mostly positively received, with those who haven’t read the source material already having a garbled, telephone game grasp of expectation. Though we’re all familiar with its basic premise, this is the first chapter in the sexually charged saga of one Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a collegiate Lit studies major, who meets billionaire playboy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) by chance. He’s attracted to her and draws her into his palatial Seattle home, where he draws up a contract that specifically outlines what the nature of their relationship will entail. The virginal Anastasia has a limited amount of time to research Grey’s specific sexual preferences and decide if she’s able to handle his potentially pleasurable lucrative offer. Grey belongs to the lowest common denominator of pop culture phenomenology, with James’ texts receiving a similar critical reception as that of Stephenie Meyer. Much like Twilight will forever tarnish the resume of director Catherine Hardwicke, Grey lands with the same thud on another promising female director’s filmography. While Sam Taylor-Johnson’s marriage to younger actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson snagged more headlines than their work together on her 2009 film Nowhere Boy, it’s a far cry from the banality presented here, though there was no chance she’d be able to mutate Grey into her own vision. The end product takes itself so insanely serious that frequent audience titters cascading throughout its screening had nothing to do with discomfort toward potentially awkward material. Oh, the line from which the title is birthed is a stumpy bit of comedy, too. As the titular billionaire, Dornan seems entirely too slight, his dialogue a series of forced utterances spoken with the prowess of a soap opera star. As Anastasia, Johnson, daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith (though thankfully she’s sans that peculiar kitten lilt owned by Griffith and grandmother Tippi Hedren), fares a bit better, and when she’s not sharing screen time with Dornan, she’s actually an engaging, intelligent presence. But once in the midst of her tryst with Grey, Johnson’s Anastasia becomes an irritating composite of girlish silliness, as if the script can’t find a way to avoid treating her demeaningly. Johnson plays her with a believable balance of naivety, at least as concerns a young person’s introduction to the torrid and tawdry practices of the sexually experienced, but the film becomes a maelstrom of repetitive silliness. Her dalliance with a man obviously looking for something different than what she has to offer marks her as another throwaway stereotype. The scandalous S&M subject matter is treated without due deference, and you’ll cringe every time the words ‘dominant’ and ‘submissive’ are used, as it seems no one involved in the making of this had any way to make this sound less contrived. But it begins with lofty allusions to classic literature, and Grey’s red playroom even recalls a place of punishment for Jane Eyre. Not only is Bronte mentioned, but Anastasia is aligned with her favorite literary heroine, Tess of the D’Urbervilles from Thomas Hardy’s famed novel. The reference is troubling for those familiar with the text, which concerns a beautiful young ingénue caught romantically between two men, ending disastrously. Professional, award winning actresses appear as their respective mothers, including Marcia Gay Harden and Jennifer Ehle, supposedly on hand simply to validate the film’s existence. Harden’s introduction is exquisitely laughable, arriving without warning at her son’s immaculate home, only to leave moments later with the same awkwardness one sees a matriarchal figure treated in something like Tommy Wisseau’s The Room. Elsewhere, budgetary constraints also seem to plague the exterior shots of Grey, with Seattle and Portland existing basically in skyline. For anyone who isn’t the target audience, i.e., privileged (largely white, middle-aged) heterosexual women, Fifty Shades of Grey plays like Alternative Pleasure Practices 101. At the film’s dramatic crux, when Anastasia dares Christian to release his worst punishment, the result is a mere whimper of a sequence. Yes, it’s great to see sexually acknowledged adult subject matter on the big screen, but Grey, to use a demeaning term, is what rough trade would refer to as a cock tease, with the powers that be inexcusably pussyfooting by depending solely on the specter of titillation. If Lars Von Trier’s Nymphomaniac is equally shackled to contrivance due to centuries of puritanical methods of sexual representation, at least he wasn’t afraid to get his hands (and other parts) dirty. Over a decade ago, we had the playful and laudable Secretary (2002), which understood that a degree of silliness goes a long way towards making an impact with taboo, sexual subject matter. Funny that no one seemed to understand in the making of Grey that watching two vaguely defined characters engage in ceaseless rounds of conservatively filmed grimaces and stifled moans (that lip biting bit is eye roll worthy) gets tiresome quickly. Decades earlier, Japanese auteur Nagisa Oshima gave us In the Realm of the Senses (1976), which is still effectively shocking. Perhaps those that gobbled up E.L. James’ prose wouldn’t mind reading a few subtitles and seek that out instead.

"Aug 2, 2019",negative," The marketing campaign for the highly anticipated film version of E.L. James’s erotic romance says simply, “Curious?”…Unfortunately the only curiosity that should drag most discerning film lovers into the theater is seeing how the filmmakers removed so much of the original steam and made it so pervasively boring. Regardless of whether the book was “literature” or smut, well written or not, there is no question millions around the world embraced the trilogy passionately. What in the books captured the imaginations of so many, who were formerly ignorant of the ins and outs of the world of BDSM and dominant/submissive sexual relationships, was the fact that sexually can take many forms while still allowing for deepening love and commitment. This is a powerful message and arguably freed fans to express themselves sexually in new ways without self judgment. All this is lost in the film. The story of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, how they meet and change each other, their sexual exploration, and their conflicts, is made not only vanilla, but has no fire. Dakota Johnson as Anastasia lacks the star power to explain Christian’s fascination. Lip biting is not an acting style. Jamie Dornan, a perfectly fine actor in TV’s The Fall, is slumming here, but he also does us no favors by mistaking inscrutability for smolder. Female director Sam Taylor-Johnson inexplicably chooses very traditional camera angles. Due, one assumes, to MPAA requirements for ratings, as usual we see more breast than at a La Leche League convention, but only the occasional male bum cheek. There is little more critical than to say a third of the film had people laughing at dialogue, and the other two thirds wiggling in their seats, not from discomfort or innervation, but from boredom."
"May 17, 2019",negative," The preconceptions about this film (equalling little more than a pile of cinematic manure) could cloud collective judgements in the strong opening 15 minutes. However the skepticism is, disappointingly, proven correct in the ensuing dull 100 minutes. Dornan and Johnson perform well, but the remainder is overwhelmingly mediocre and poor. The script, cinematography and direction, capped by a dreadful – to the point of distraction – Top 40 soundtrack, all combine to neuter all sex appeal or edge."
"May 16, 2019",negative,"Nice as it looks, this movie tastes bad..."
"May 10, 2019",negative,"Most of the actual sex has less erotic value than what can be found on late night HBO, and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the graphic content of the novels or the erotic-charged hype surrounding the film."
"Apr 17, 2019",neutral," 
	As long-awaited as that elusive orgasm is today's cinematic release of Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Dakota Johnson as virginal college graduate Ana, Jamie Dornan as mogul-fetishist Christian Grey, and our own Vancouver as Vancouver, WA, and Seattle, as usual. 
	Nope, you didn't. If you had wanted story you would've picked up Tolstoy, or something above a sixth grade level. You would've put the book down after reading the character's name on the third page: Anastasia Steele? Puh-lease! If you had any interest (chaste or otherwise) in the books, go see the movie. 
	Of course you did! If you were like most consumers of E.L. James' books you were keen to be titillated, but not as jazzed to be recognized by your dentist while browsing the ""Erotica"" section of your local bookstore, which has been stocking similar and better soft-core porn for years. This book was stocked in full view, everywhere, so you could grab it - preferably after-hours, when your dentist was at home flossing after dinner - tuck it under a copy of The Economist magazine, and flee the scene (after paying, of course). 
	Always a better bet, especially in this case. Not that you won't be able to follow the plot, such as it is, but the film offers a watered-down version of the story, which tells how sweet Ana (Johnson) falls into an SM relationship with hot and powerful executive Christian Grey (Dornan), a man with a tortured past. The sex is necessarily tamer, of course - though Johnson's nipples should get their own billing, we see them so often - but the chemistry between the leads is also lacking. Add to this a rushed history of how the couple enters into their kinky relationship, and Christian just seems like a creep. Any self-respecting virgin would run a mile. And because he seems creepy, we feel pervy for sitting there watching them. It's one thing to read the books in the relative privacy of the carpool lane, but quite another to watch the film beside a middle-aged guy munching popcorn the whole time (trust me). Plus the film, like the first book, has a cliffhanger ending and is a direct tie-in to the sequel (Fifty Shades Darker, 2016). You'll be able to tell which movie-goers haven't read the books: they're the ones sitting there wearing WTH expressions when the credits roll. 
	Actually, she is quite good, injecting the film with some much-needed wit (and she's a dead ringer for mom Melanie Griffith when she giggles). Thankfully, we don't have to be subjected to that terrible internal monologue that plagues the books with lines like ""my inner goddess is doing the meringue with some salsa moves."" What we do have are plenty of slow-motion climactic scenes in The Playroom that made me wish for Meg Ryan's fake orgasms (circa When Harry Met Sally) instead. 
	True, but no more so than what they are getting from the Internet, the airbrushed cover of that magazine in your mailbox, music videos, awards shows, all programming on the CW, social media and everywhere else. Dornan's Christian is a dominant, though more vulnerable than he cares to admit, and Ana asks for all that she's given, meaning that it's a more level playing field than it initially appears. Only you can fill your daughter in on how awkward, and wonderful, and occasionally boring, sex can be, so do that. You can hide your kindle and the car keys, if you want; but frankly, the story of a virgin meeting a handsome, sexually adept billionaire who has his own helicopter is one she'll probably risk getting grounded in order to see. Laters, baby!"
"Apr 4, 2019",negative," E.L. James fans waiting with bated breath need not be disappointed by Sam Taylor-Johnson’s Fifty Shades of Grey (2015), a perfectly anodyne Mills & Boon-in-cuffs adaptation of the author’s serially denounced book. Anyone else, however, might need to be handcuffed to their seats and wonder how something so wildly popular could be so stiflingly unerotic. Or why all the characters have a six-year-old’s vocabulary. Or whether Jamie Dornan’s hunky Christian Grey, who seems able to turn on at any given moment, should get help for what is surely erectile dysfunction. Keep your hands where we can see them – this is sadomasochism for the multiplex generation.Dakota Johnson is Anastasia Steele, a gormless virginal college senior whose least vacant expression is to bite her lip while she struggles to think of what to say next. When her flatmate (Eloise Mumford) falls ill, she steps in to interview hot-shot 27-year-old billionaire Armani suit Christian Grey (Dornan) for the college paper. With excruciating dramatic irony, Christian says he likes to “exercise control on all things”, and that outside business, he enjoys “various physical pursuits”. But their interaction sparks something deep in Christian’s secret place that means he simply must be around her. He follows her to where she works – a hardware store, no less – where he shops for rope, tape and cable ties. It would be grounds for harassment if it weren’t all so romantic. Christian, we learn has “singular tastes”, and when he brings her round to his swanky Seattle apartment (E.L. James, incidentally has never been to Seattle) he introduces her to a sub-dom contract. He can do what he likes in his “red room of pain”, and in return, in his words, all she gets is “him”. It’s so weirdly, curiously set up, with creepy pauses Pinter would have discarded as over-extended, that the whole scenario can’t not be vicariously inviting. In Christian’s world, love means never having to say you’re sorry. It’s a spank instead. BDSM films have plenty of precedents, from Pauline Réage’s The Story of O to last year’s Nymphomaniac (2014), and mainstream arthouse audiences has seen much more explicit sex in Blue Is the Warmest Colour (2013). But even cynics will recognise this as a real development in major studio release. Johnson’s Ana is naked frequently, the bondage is upfront, and although we get nothing out of Dornan’s genitalia, he’s at least a strong competitor in cinema’s rear of the year (and in his dom- position, it actually makes sense that we may not see his member). Dornan and Johnson speak about boundaries with an upfrontness that’s refreshing – her boundaries end at anal fisting, she says, “and let’s make that vaginal too”. But any real character development remains firmly a mystery – Fifty Shades of Grey is feeling its way through virginal territory just as much as Ana does. And goodness, even an improvement on James’ barely-readable novel can’t help Kelly Marcel’s script, which segues from one wooden exclamation to another. “I don’t make love,” says Christian on an early encounter, “I fuck.” Are we meant to be laughing? The actors stumble from one sentence to another in just trying to speak the script, a fact that can’t have been missed by Taylor-Johnson (whose Nowhere Boy was a promising debut). A storyline with Christian’s birth mother (he’s adopted of course) is brought up with groan-inducing clumsiness (“There is a reason” for his sadism, Ana cries). And while the first half has a brisk, upfront approach, the final hour is gobsmackingly dull – with emphasis on the smacking. Danny Elfman’s score crunches when Dornan moves his hands down to her nether regions, and much of the more atmospheric moments are ruined by incessant mainstream pop from Beyoncé or Ellie Goulding. But the funniest music moment is the opera playing when we first enter Grey’s plush apartment. It instantly reminded of Tom Hanks’ opera scene in Philadelphia (1993) – a film about HIV/AIDS. But far more pernicious than any of the sexual provocations of Fifty Shades of Grey is a fetish for wild riches. While we never learn what Grey Enterprises does (other than “communications”) Christian owns a helicopter, various fast cars, and most irksome, a glider. When Christian explains that he works towards ridding world poverty through his company’s initiatives in Africa, couldn’t he start helping by ditching his private plane? When Christian brings Ana to his apartment, he makes her sign a non-disclosure agreement – scared what he reveals about himself will be an embarrassment for a public figure. For the same reason, filmmakers should staff the multiplexes and on their audience force the same arrangement."

"Nov 10, 2018",negative," “Cigarettes 0 / Chardonnay 0 / Light beatings 1 / Lip bites 5 / Boob shots 5210. A good day. Saw Daniel last night as he wanted to practice some knots he first learnt in the Scouts. Says he wants to whip me into shape, VERY excited as presume this means he’s going to lend me his personal trainer.” Sadly 50 Shades of Grey – which I watched today, in preparation for going to see the sequel 50 Shades Darker – is not just unsexy, but also quite dull. It starts off with virginal Anastasia ‘Ana’ Steele (Dakota Johnson) – who we know is guileless and naive as she’s wearing Emily Blunt’s frumpy cardigan from The Girl On The Train, but must have an inner core of steel because that’s her name – heading off to interview billionaire sex bomb Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the student magazine. First she falls into his office, then she asks him questions in a boring monotone, including whether he’s gay, and doesn’t even react when he answers entirely in platitudes. Like many people born into a life of privilege, it turns out his success is actually down to simple graft: “the harder I work the more luck seem I have”. He also exercises control in all things, and (hashtag #Sad) some people don’t think he has a heart at all. Yet for some reason he totally falls for her and she him. It’s like an episode of The Undateables but with people who really are undatable as they are so boring. It always helps to be able to identify with the protagonist though. And luckily for me, although I have an aversion to both frumpy cardigans and light beatings, Ana turns out to be a Thomas Hardy fan. (For people unfamiliar with him, he was an author who lived in Dorset in 19th/20th century England. While a brilliant writer, his books start off depressing, melancholic, and miserable and then get even sadder. Even the nice men turn out to be rape apologists; flocks of sheep bought with life-savings throw themselves off cliffs; and women are slut-shamed with village processions. Grey could learn a lot from Hardy’s social commentary, but doesn’t.) Ana works in a hardware store, and Grey turns up there to see her; leading to a suggestive conversation about coveralls, being naked for DIY, and cable ties. A conversation which is cringy rather than wittily bantering. And therein lies one of the problems with this film: it just isn’t funny. It’s perfectly possible to make a film about sex that people don’t laugh at, but can laugh along with, but even the funny lines, of which there are a few, fall flat. Ana’s pranking of Grey when she gets birth control pills, claiming she’s not allowed to have sex for 4 weeks after starting them, could raise some laughs, but Dornan plays Grey as so humourless that they just sound embarrassing. Grey talks in banalities and truisms, and likes to come out with ponderous utterances that are meant to mean something but have clearly been thought out hours before, ready to drop into the conversation. He also keeps answering questions in the wrong order, or that Ana hasn’t asked yet, so it’s like the film was edited by Yoda. And as one of those people for whom words matter, I was profoundly irritated when he put her to bed after she vomited; Ana is concerned he might have done something to her but he replies that “necrophilia’s not my thing”. She’s asleep Christian, not dead! (What can I say, I’m an ex-editor. I’ll put up with as much BDSM in movies as you like until they erroneously put an apostrophe on the drawer marked Butt Plug’s.) There is a storyline involving an official contract that lays out exactly what Grey (the Dominant) can and can’t do to Ana (the Submissive), but there is no subplot (a subplot is the unsung hero of a film – and like cleaning a house, it’s something nobody notices until it’s missing). They never do sign that contract as by then it’s redundant, but he still wants to punish her. It’s when she asks why he wants to hurt her that we finally we get the film’s real title, straight from the horse’s mouth: 50 shades of fucked up. Still, I can nearly always find something to like in a movie, even if it’s just that one of the characters has a nice kitchen. Christian is good at knots, I’ll say that for him. And he can also plait hair (who doesn’t love a man who always has a condom and a hair bobble about his person). The big playroom scene, once things really get going, is quite erotic when compared to the rest of the film, with a slowed-down version of Crazy In Love playing in the background. And he’s got a nice kitchen. But without giving what is basically a sex-with-added-storyline flick too much influence, the underlying themes are of a kind that need to be handled carefully. Although Ana does get to amend their contract it’s still a hugely unequal power relationship and much of his behaviour is stalkerish, which isn’t romance. Grey is surprisingly unsexy, even when his chopper makes an appearance (he even has his own helicopter). The script does Dornan no favours. Johnson turns in the better performance, once we move past the lip-biting – though she does a lot of throwing her head from side to side to indicate how turned on she is. The nudity is very tasteful, with lots of boobs and bums. Would I go to see the sequel if I didn’t already have tickets? probably not, but I’m going now. And yes I will tell you all about it."
"Aug 22, 2018",negative," The good news is that it’s better than I’d expected. The bad news is that it’s not as good as enraptured fans hoped. It wasn’t much of a stretch for Fifty Shades of Grey filmmakers to create a movie that is superior to the books from a quality perspective; even the most ardent fans acknowledge that the trilogy is awkward and poorly written at best. But they loved the novels for the boundary-breaking sizzle and steam. Unfortunately, those two elements are oddly lacking from the film. Okay, I don’t think followers of the franchise expected full frontal nudity or detailed cinematic play by plays of the sexy submissive/dominant scenes. But a few handcuffs, spankings and a whole lot of sighs, moans and lip biting hardly do the source material justice. Christian Grey’s famous Red Room of Pain must have at least a half a million dollars worth of accouterments in it, yet he only uses a couple of them. The most excited reaction I heard from viewers at the screening I attended came when Christian took a bite out of a piece of toast. The entire palate of the film was cool and gray, which doesn’t do much to incite passion. and I don’t think we should blame the actors. Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele was actually adorable and endearing. If Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey was a bit too aloof and dispassionate, I think that’s the fault of director Sam Taylor-Johnson, best known for Nowhere Boy, an excellent film exploring John Lennon’s teenage years. She opted for a long, slow pace with little drama or suspense. It’s quite the challenge to make a boring movie from one of the hottest and most controversial book series to come along in decades, but Taylor-Johnson seems to have been up for it. Oh, the film looks good, unlike the first Twilight movies that just felt skimpy and cheesy. The production design of Fifty Shades of Grey shows that real money and effort were spent. And a Danny Elfman score? Twilight never had it so good. Comparisons between the two franchises are inevitable, since Fifty Shades of Grey was originally written as Twilight fan fiction, a phenomena that escapes me. In case it’s escaped you too, “fan fiction” consists of ardent readers making up their own stories based on characters and situations in their favorite books. In this case, E.L. James originally wrote Christian and Ana as Edward and Bella. As a writer, it’s beyond me who has time to write that sort of thing, let alone read it. But apparently E.L. James is knows better than I, because her efforts banked her hundreds of millions and counting. Fifty Shades of Grey will doubtless be a box office smash, and I’ll have to sit through at least three more movies (they’ll divide the last book in two, as you do these days). And if it adds a little Valentine’s Day ardor to the economy and our lives, who am I to complain? Products recommended by At Home In Hollywood are selected by our editorial team.

"Aug 22, 2018",negative," Fifty Shades of Grey is that hot date you bring home to discover (s)he's a cold fish between the sheets. It's that online hookup that gets you all hot and bothered with dirty talk on the Internet and then turns out to be an uptight clean freak who asks you to take a long shower before doing the nasty and thinks bodily fluids are yucky. In short, it's a stiff – for all the wrong reasons. The long-awaited screen adaptation of the first entry in novelist E. L. James' insanely popular erotic trilogy is also very, very gray. The film opens with an unimaginative, literal-minded montage that kicks off with time-lapse images of very gray clouds before salivating over every item in the titular character's possession: neatly rolled-up ties in his drawer, custom-made business suits hanging in his closet, luxury cars parked in his garage. They're perfunctory glimpses of testosterone-tinged affluence in what is ostensibly a femme-driven tale of a burgeoning S/M relationship. The sequence is a succinct introduction to studly magnate Christian Grey (Irish actor Jamie Dornan, faring better than I expected) and his blandly posh lifestyle. It's also all too representative of the film that follows: glum, astonishingly strait-laced, yet also agreeably glossy. Working from a screenplay by Kelly Marcel, director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy) also kills any mystery about this reserved billionaire when it should be withholding any peek at him, rendering him a mundane Master of the Universe before he even gets an opportunity to introduce himself to us, and our surrogate. That would be English lit major Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson, the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith), who agrees to drive from the campus of Washington State University to Grey's sleek Seattle offices. She's scheduled an interview of the 27-year-old entrepreneur for her college newspaper, something she's doing as a favor to her roommate Kate (Eloise Mumford), who had scored the enviable sit-down, after an inopportune cold takes her out of commission. As meet-cute devices go, the one-on-one is perfectly adequate to establish the power play that ensues, which makes the way Taylor-Johnson bungles the scene that much more dismaying. From a journalistic standpoint, Anastasia is all thumbs, but we're distracted more by the stilted staging than the character's awkwardness, which is neither cute nor charming. Granted, Marcel's dialogue, which, I gather from colleagues who have read the books was either taken verbatim from James' prose or is otherwise faithful to it, is all too willing to play all this silliness straight, with some tone-deaf levity thrown in. But there's still no reason why this crucial first encounter between the protagonists ought to feel so flat-footed. It's not just Anastasia who literally trips her way into Christian's cushy office. It takes considerable skill to handle subject matter this salacious in such chaste and decorous fashion, and as such James' soft-core romance has been distilled into the easy-listening equivalent of sadomasochism, a slick coffee table book of a film for lapsed Twihards ready to move on to the next level. By the next level I mean a courtship that doesn't take three movies and change to get to actual intercourse and which doesn't fade to black once it reaches that milestone. But the film flows along regardless, thanks in large part to Dornan's intense gaze – think Mr. Darcy by way of Patrick Bateman – and production designer David Wasco's impeccably assembled interiors. The big black hole sucking all the life out of this watered-down, conspicuously tame foray into sexual obsession is Johnson (the TV series Ben and Kate), who overplays the ingenue routine in a way that makes it very difficult to buy her as a worthy stand-in for the film's target audience. (Think of the young Charlotte Gainsbourg, then take away spine and moxie.) I could never fully surrender to Anastasia's journey of self-discovery because she fails to strike a balance between her inexperience in matters of the flesh – and the heart – and her romantic ideals. At one point, Christian asks her if she considers herself a romantic, and she replies, “I'm an English lit major. You kind of have to be one,” a remark that a true romantic would never say. Where is her inner life? What is it about, say, Thomas Hardy's writing that made her want to study literature? Taylor-Johnson and Marcel leave us hanging in this regard, and as a result, Johnson's Anastasia is ultimately too much of a blank slate. (Readers familiar with the novels know exactly how much of a blank slate she is, but I will refrain from delving further.) With college graduation looming on the horizon, Christian comes into Anastasia's life at a significant crossroads, but the film is too preoccupied with ensuring its surfaces are shiny and seductive to place her growing attraction toward this secretive suitor in the context of the transitional juncture she's experiencing. Even more disappointing: The filmmakers have zero interest in exploring the class difference between the lovers, an aspect that by all means should seep into their relationship but which is reduced to innocuous wish fulfillment. (One bright spot here: Marcia Gay Harden getting her grande dame game on as Christian's mom.) Then there's Fifty Shades' depiction of S/M, which ought to feel taboo and titillating but is anything but. It's a pipe dream, of course, to expect a truly adventurous filmmaker like Catherine Breillat or Jane Campion would have scored this directing gig, but Taylor-Johnson should have done well to follow their lead in the way those directors use their characters' body language to convey the shifting dynamics of their bond. By comparison, Taylor-Johnson's sex scenes, even when they're supposed to be kinky, are generic and dull, Victoria's Secret photo spreads with peek-a-boo glimpses of pubic hair. Surfaces matter in an undertaking like a movie version of Fifty Shades of Grey, but there needs to be something resembling an erotic charge fueling those pretty images, and this is what makes this such a perplexing letdown. It's telling that the film's strongest scene is a business meeting which frames Anastasia and Christian at opposite ends of a conference room table negotiating the terms of what's deemed permissible in Christian's “singular” sexual predilections. Like the film they're on, it's antiseptic and formal, the cinematic equivalent of a first-time job seeker embellishing his/her résumé in order to pass off as a pro. But who are we kidding here? This humorless, flavorless concoction is smut, and even worse, it's smut that thinks it's high art, an overeager date dousing him/herself with too much perfume to appear more enticing. Identity-wise, it forgets the number one rule of dating: Be yourself.

"Aug 21, 2018",positive," Well hello there Mr Grey: I came, saw and wouldn’t mind seeing you again in Part 2. Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson star as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in the film adaptation of 50 Shades of Grey. Did you even bother reading the book? Well if you did wow you have stamina and if you didn’t you will be pleasantly surprised by what in my opinion was a poorly drafted trilogy of fan fiction turned into a visually aesthetically beautiful film with an above par soundtrack. The story is that of billionaire Christian Grey interviewed for the College newspaper by sweet, innocent, virginal Anastasia Steele. She falls for him and he tells her that’s not his thing but shows her his playroom – not an x box in site but a myriad of whips, rope etc. He wants her all to himself but will she sign up to his version of “love”. The direction is incredible along with the cinematography although there are too many rain/thunder metaphors.The scriptwriter deserves a medal and Sam Taylor-Wood directs with a firm hand showing that sexy doesn’t have to mean naked bodies and sexual organs flailing all over the place. For a film that is all about BDSM, dominance and control the sexual tension and innuendos actually made me think back to old hollywood and An Affair To Remember – less is more and sometimes the viewer doesn’t need to see everything to be turned on. The weakest part of the film was in fact the character of Christian Grey. Jamie Dornan didn’t bring enough of that dark, psychopathic brilliance from his time in The Fall and beardless he just isn’t very sexy. Consider this film as part 1 – a familiar entrée – you’ve had it before but can’t quite remember where and not as spicy but still tantalises the tastebuds. Part 2, and there will be a part 2, will bring the spice to awaken all your senses or at least that is the hope. This is worth going to the cinema for, leave your expectations behind and relax and enjoy a visually beautiful film. 50 Shades of Grey is on general release everywhere in the UK.

"Aug 21, 2018",negative," ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is one of the most highly anticipated Valentine's Day films in history. This film, based on the book of the same name by E.L. James, according to Entertainment Weekly, has ""...already sold more advance tickets on Fandango than any other R-rated film in history."" With more than 100 million copies of the book sold, the literary fan base is expecting a lot. As is always the question, can the movie version live up to the book (and our imaginations)? James had input into who would adapt her first of the trilogy of what has been coined ""mommy porn."" Using a female director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, and a female writer, Kelly Marcel, this team of women attempts to tell the steamy story of Anastasia Steele and her dominant and powerful boyfriend, Christian Grey. For those of you (all two of you) out there that haven't read the book, here's the basic premise: Sweet, innocent, and virginal college senior Anastasia meets the young, handsome, confident and successful Christian Grey. An immediate attraction is evident, but behind closed doors, Grey shows many shades of red. The two find themselves in a relationship with sadomasochism at the core; living out many women's fantasies. With any relationship, there is emotional baggage, and the balance with this type of relationship can be devastating. The movie version of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" follows the content of the book exactly, although it does leave out some pretty steamy and provocative scenes such as the dinner party at Grey's parents' home. But following the book exactly doesn't make for the acceptable adaptation. With millions of people having read the book, the perfect Anastasia and Christian Grey need to be cast. While Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) fits the bill, Grey (Jamie Dornan) does not. Anastasia embodies the virtues of sweetness and innocence with the willingness to lose her purity and this flows from the pages and onto the screen for all to see. There is also a palpable chemistry, initially, between the two main characters. Grey (Jamie Dornan), is no doubt gorgeous with his chiseled body, but his command and confidence is lackluster. This confidence and dominance, in the book, is what sets him apart from everyone else and when you are missing that, you are missing the entire point of the film. The ambiance, situations, and descriptions of homes and rooms, (yes, the Red Room) are an identical representation. Their ""interactions"" in varying situations are also identical, but the intensity behind these ""interactions"" although erotic, become a bit mundane by the end. Yes, the film borders on pornographic, but modestly uses suggestive camera angles and cuts to keep it in the safe zone. Admittedly, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is not a literary masterpiece. What it is is a vehicle of escapism for women of any age. The film attempts to bring the book to life, but sometimes your imagination is far superior and much more creative and fun that what can be acted out in the reality of a stage or a film. While ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" follows the book, it lacks the intensity and rationale behind both of the characters. Dakota Johnson's performance is adequate, but Dornan's could have been replaced by a cardboard cutout as his interpretation was rather, dare I say, stiff. Did he read the book? Did he understand his character? I don't think so. You are going to see this film if you've read the book, but be warned that it just doesn't live up to your imagination. As one patron who screened the film early stated as we walked to the parking garage, ""It was good enough."" Yes, it was good enough. And the box office intake will be ""good enough,"" I am sure, to give a green light to starting production of the second film in the trilogy, ""Fifty Shades Darker."""
"Apr 23, 2018",negative," Here, that magical force is Christian’s shady kink. He’s not into love. He’s into contractual relationships where pleasure is derived from a kind of pain and sense of control, and virginal Anastasia, who seems to have spent her college years reading Jane Austen and Emily Bronte while avoiding Marquis de Sade’s more descriptive writings, prefers even just the littlest bit of emotional bond while in bondage.  Fifty Shades of Grey is famous for its steamy bits. However, if there is one exchange of dialogue that sums up the basic allure of the film, it is the one delivered by the frustrated lovers while in one of their protracted arguments about their indescribable relationship.  In reply, Christian nonchalantly declares that it is not him who is changing her, but that she is the one who is changing him. This is the ultimate fantasy of many a lover, to mold one person from one stereotype to another, to melt the stoic and unfeeling hero into a puddle of vapid sweetness. In a way, Sam Taylor-Johnson seems to be the perfect director for the job of visualizing this fantasy. Her most famous work entitled Crying Men, a series of photographs of various famous actors shedding tears, is enchanting mainly because of the way it breaks Hollywood’s veneer of masculinity by passionate imagery. This is exactly what she does to Christian. She commits to turning the character into this caricature of macho mysteriousness, only to emphasize how Anastasia, who seems to be the epitome of ordinariness, can turn his world of strict and specific desires upside-down. The sex is really just there to separate the romance from the rest. It is the spectacle to the veil the superfluous, the forbidden cherry on top of the run-of-the-mill pastry.  Unfortunately, it is in the portrayal of this spectacle where Taylor-Johnson clearly falters. The sex scenes in Fifty Shades of Grey are tepid at best, visualized and edited to look and feel like music videos for the corny pop songs that dominate the film’s soundtrack.  They have the glossy quality of those romance book covers, merely suggestive of the libidinous intent but safe enough to be seen by curious kids prancing around the bookstore. Taylor-Johnson has done more risqué work. Her contribution to Destricted (2006) entitled Death Valley had a man pleasuring himself to climax in the middle of the titular desert, all in the name of blurring the line between art and pornography.  It seems that Taylor-Johnson’s brush with a more mainstream material that targets a wider market has forced her to be more careful with regard to sexual expression, turning her adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey into erotica that has been blandly adorned by tastefulness. It truly is a problematic film, probably even more problematic than its divisive source material, which makes it such an intriguing aberration. Fifty Shades of Grey has all the makings of a bad film. Its good parts are always tempered by mediocrity. For example, Johnson’s heartfelt performance is always accompanied by Dornan’s wooden showing. Its drama feels oddly humorous, but its sexy bits, which could have been salvaged by a bit of comedy, are abysmally devoid of humanity. The film simply never gets anything right. Despite that, Fifty Shades of Grey succeeds in getting you hooked. Thus, when the leads enigmatically call each other’s names as the elevator door closes, separating them until the next awaited instalment, one can’t help but understand the audience’s collective gasps and shrieks of disbelief and disappointment."
"Mar 17, 2018",negative,"Among the many mind-bogglingly implausible fantasies Fifty Shades of Grey sells, the one I think that most accounts for its popularity is the promise that shame of sexual sin can be alleviated by surrendering to it more fully."

Es impresionante que una cinta tan fría, tan enfocada en una relación que resulta ser enferma y tóxica en vez de romántica haya podido atraer tantos espectadores, generar tanta bulla. Quizás no soy parte del público objetivo de Cincuenta sombras de Grey, o quizás simplemente es un de esas historias que gustan más a las mujeres que a los hombres… pero no lo creo. No fui el único que salió totalmente espantado de la sala de cine; entre los miembros del público que compartían mi opinión había tanto hombres como mujeres. «Cincuenta sombras de Grey» no es una película absolutamente terrible, pero sí una producción moralmente cuestionable e increíblemente aburrida. Para comenzar, debo mencionar que me atreví a leer algunos capítulos de la novela original de E.L. James. Y a pesar de que no me considero un crítico literario ni mucho menos, debo mencionar que fueron algunos de los capítulos peor escritos y más involuntariamente chistosos que jamás haya leído. Se nota a leguas que la novela comenzó como un fan-fiction de «Crepúsculo»; James hace poco por esconder las influencias en su historia, y no tiene la más mínima idea de cómo desarrollar personajes creíbles o escribir de manera inteligente o efectiva. Descripciones larguísimas, lenguaje coloquial, palabras mal usadas. Todo esto y más es lo que pueden encontrar en «Cincuenta sombras de Grey» (la novela), al igual que una presentación muy inexacta  de lo que es el BDSM (actitudes masoquistas y sádicas en el ámbito sexual).  Pero bueno, esto no quiere decir que una adaptación cinematográfica de la novela fuera a ser mala, necesariamente. Después de todo, la directora elegida, Sam Taylor-Johnson, no carece de talento, y la guionista, Kelly Marcel, fue responsable de escribir «Saving Mr Banks», una película madura y divertida. Además, da gusto el que se haya producido una cinta en Hollywood donde la mayor parte del talento, tanto detrás como delante de cámaras, es femenino, desde la directora hasta una gran parte del reparto y el equipo de producción. La historia, sorprendentemente, puede ser resumida de manera muy breve. Dakota Johnson interpreta a Anastasia Steele (uno de los nombres más tontos que jamás haya visto en una película, dicho sea de paso), una chica tímida que conoce a Christian Grey (Jamie Dorman), un ejecutivo millonario y atractivo.  Evidentemente hay atracción entre ambos, pero Grey tiene un secreto para el cual Steele no está preparada: le gusta el BDSM, y quiere que ella sea su sumisa (él sería su dominante). La película, entonces, es un ida y vuelta entre ellos, una manipulación hacia ella por parte de él, y una serie de de escenas de sexo relativamente explícitas pero sorprendentemente frías. Si uno quiere contar una historia romántica en el cine, es básico que los dos protagonistas tengan química entre ellos. Puede que sea un término sobreusado, pero es cierto. Lamentablemente, en el caso de «Cincuenta sombras de Grey», la química entre Dakota Johnson y Jamie Dorman es inexistente. Siempre se ven incómodos el uno con el otro, incluso cuando se supone ya han comenzado a agarrar confianza, y uno nunca cree que haya algún tipo de atracción entre ellos. No se siente ningún tipo de pasión, ningún tipo de fuego entre ellos, ningún deseo. Se supone que en un filme erótico, cada vez que los protagonistas comparten una escena uno debería sentir que los amantes protagonistas se desean apasionadamente, que quieren arrancarle la ropa el uno al otro y hacer el amor todo el tiempo. En «Cincuenta sombras de Grey» no sucede nada de esto. Al menos Dakota Johnson da una buena actuación. No solo se atrevió a mostrar todo lo que tiene (en serio, vemos su cuerpo completamente desnudo más de una vez), si no que también logra desarrollar a un personaje potencialmente ridículo, ayudada por el guión. Muchas de las características más desesperantes de Anastasia en el libro, como su excesiva torpeza, han sido minimizadas en la adaptación al cine, lo cual le da la oportunidad de Johnson de divertirse un poco más con el papel. Su Anastasia tiene un poco más de espíritu, un mejor sentido del humor aquí que en la novela (si no véase la escena en donde la habla borracha a Christian por teléfono), pero lamentablemente no puede hacer mucho con las líneas de diálogo tan tontas que le dan. Eso, y el hecho de que no pueda generar ningún tipo de pasión con Dorman no ayuda en lo absoluto. Y hablando de Dorman… bueno, primero que nada, su Christian Grey es el norteamericano más irlandés que pueda existir. En serio, el hombre no tiene talento para disfraza su acento natural. En segundo lugar, aparentemente Taylor-Johnson le dijo que actúe como un asesino serial… porque esa es la impresión que da el personaje. Christian Grey es el personaje menos romántico de la historia del cine, un hombre enfermo y manipulador que claramente no ama a Anastasia Steele, sino que la desea para poder satisfacer sus deseos sexuales tan peculiares. Dorman no logra crear un personaje tridimensional para nada, actuando de manera demasiado seria la mayor parte del tiempo, usando pocas expresiones faciales, claramente aburrido o incluso avergonzando de estar en la película y tener que decir líneas de diálogo tan ridículas. Si Johnson logra trascender más allá de lo que E.L. James escribió en su novela y lo que Marcel puso el guión, Dorman decepciona a ambas. Pero uno de los problemas más grandes de la película, más allá de la falta de química entre los protagonistas y la pobre actuación de Dorman, está en la dirección de Taylor-Johnson. Aparentemente la directora no se dio cuenta que era imposible tomarse en serio el material que le dieron. En vez de inyectarle algo de humor, darle algo de personalidad a la cinta, lo que hace es filmar todo de la manera más elegante, más fría posible… ¡y esto incluye a las escenas de sexo! Sí, estas últimas son atrevidas, pero no logran generar ningún tipo de excitación. Taylor-Johnson las filma de forma clínica y calculadora, distanciándose de lo que está pasando en pantalla, como si estuviera avergonzada de ser muy íntima. Se trata de un acercamiento muy curioso al material. Sí, quizás la película se vea muy bien a nivel superficial (la dirección de fotografía es muy buena), pero no logra transmitir nada. Ahora bien, ha habido toda una controversia, especialmente en los Estados Unidos, en relación a la forma en que el BDSM es presentado en la película. En pocas palabras, E.L. James no tiene la más mínima idea de cómo funciona. Tanto la autora como la guionista presentan a la gente que disfruta de estas actividades sexuales, en la forma de Christian Grey, como personas depravadas y enfermas, manipuladoras y casi psicópatas, cuando ese no tiene que ser el caso necesariamente. Y para colmo de males, ni siquiera presenta situaciones demasiado chocantes. Sí, los protagonistas usan látigos y cuerdas de vez en cuando, pero repiten las mismas acciones más de una vez, jamás haciendo algo particularmente inventivo u original. Quizás Taylor-Johnson y compañía no podían cruzar la raya porque tenían miedo de que la MPAA le diera la temida calificación NC-17 a la película… lo cual es entendible. Lo que no es entendible es que no hiciesen ningún tipo de investigación para poder representar el BDSM de manera realista. Supongo que es posible disfrutar de Cincuenta sombras de Grey de manera irónica. De hecho, yo estuve matándome de la risa durante la primera mitad de la película; me reía de las líneas de diálogo cursis y ridículas, de la cara inmovible de Jamie Dorman, y de las acciones sin sentido de su personaje. Pero fue durante la segunda hora que comencé a aburrirme, que todo se tornó repetitivo y que quería que la película acabase. Y cuando por fin acabó… pues me di con el último insulto. Decir que la película acaba es ser demasiado amable; lo que hace «Cincuenta sombras de Grey» es imperdonable, es dejar la trama y a sus personajes colgando, dando a entender que todo se resolverá en la secuela y que, bueno, “eso es todo”. Si el objetivo de la producción era dejarme intrigado, pues fallaron. Todo lo que lograron fue frustrarme más. «Cincuenta sombras de Grey» es un filme infinitamente mediocre. Puede que la dirección de fotografía sea muy buena, y que Dakota Johnson dé una interpretación mucho mejor de lo que el material merece, pero en general se trata de una producción que falla en su objetivo principal: ser erótica y romántica. No es erótica porque las escenas de sexo están filmadas de manera fría, y porque los protagonistas no tienen química. Y no es romántica porque la relación entre Christian Grey y Anastasia Steele es tóxica y obsesiva, presentándonos a un personaje que manipula emocionalmente y abusa físicamente de su supuesto interés amoroso (es increíble la cantidad de veces que Anastasia le dice que “no”). A fin de cuentas, no se trata de una película que merezca el ser recordada por mucho tiempo. Pero lo que sí me preocupa es el que mucha gente (especialmente chicas) consideren al Sr. Grey como un objeto de deseo, como una suerte de hombre ideal. Si ellas creen que la relación que trata de entablar con Anastasia tiene algo que ver con romance o con amor… pues tienen más problemas que el mismísimo Sr. Grey."

"Jan 12, 2018",negative,"It's superficial, it's manipulative, it's off-putting and embarrassing. But there's no denying that this says something about the moment in which the book was published and the movie released."
"Dec 2, 2017",negative," Not even five minutes into Fifty Shades of Grey is a scene where Anastasia Steele trips and falls entering Christian Grey’s fancy meeting room, and it just has to be symbolic that this entire movie will unravel as a disaster of cataclysmic proportions. Within a matter of minutes the ravishingly young rich business magnate becomes inexplicably fascinated with the young socially awkward college graduate. And that right there is the biggest problem in a film that has multiple crippling flaws; none of this erotic romance feels natural, plausible, or mentally healthy. From a behavioral standpoint, it’s actually appalling that some women find a film that glorifies submissiveness and pseudo-rape empowering and something worth fantasizing about. All movies need a character with a plight to invest in and root for, whether it’s a goodie two-shoes protagonist or a gripping anti-hero, yet here any attempt at constructing even the most basic narrative is absent. Fifty Shades of Grey is just two hours of one girl experimenting all sorts of sordid sexual activity with a corrupted mind that repeatedly states he doesn’t enjoy love, but rather dominance and abusive control. If the movie actively tried to explore Grey’s mental deficiencies (occasionally it does but every time it is just a one line in passing that is never expanded on) and paint the picture of a man truly broken on the inside in need of healing, maybe it would be easier to buy into Anna’s sympathies. Then again, maybe it wouldn’t because Jamie Dornan can’t even property deliver the minimal emotional dialogue that does exist without sounding like a robot. The story is simply far too concerned with going from sex scene to scene instead of doing something that would make audiences care. Speaking of those, for a movie that is based on an erotic novel that steamrolled to mainstream adoration because of its kinkiness, the adaptation is tame and safe with its depiction of Grey’s fun. Many of the more risqué scenes are outright cut from the book, leaving us with a litany of monotonous sex scenes that all just boil down to Anna getting tied up and spanked with something. Essentially, if the core demographic is coming out in droves for titillation, they’re probably going to be leaving extremely disappointed. Jamie Dornan doesn’t even show his dinker donker but Dakota Johnson is admirably game to bear all. If anything the movie is more stimulating for men with the hots for Dakota. Realistically though, it is a given that the narrative to Fifty Shades of Grey would be complete trash considering the novel started out as Twilight fan-fiction, but how the absurdity would actually translate to the screen though was always going to be an interesting discovery. Basically, that too is a mess since the script is abysmally bad, filled with Shakespearean dialogue such as “I won’t touch you until I have your written consent”, and “I don’t make love, I f***… HARD”. Worse is that the the acting from everyone involved is played deadly serious, also coming across unintentionally hilarious. The comical aspect quickly dissipates too though, as the movie descends into relentless boredom. What’s baffling is that despite how horrific everything else is, the movie does have some imaginative set design for Grey’s office and penthouse, decorating the rooms with various art-deco paintings, a piano, beautiful white walls juxtaposed with black floor tiling, and more. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson also isn’t afraid to get creative, tinting different scenes with color. Nudity isn’t the only pleasant sight here, as Fifty Shades of Grey is actually directed with competence and is nice to look at. You can credit Sam Taylor-Johnson for not taking the easy paycheck and giving her all to inject some life into this abomination, but at the end of the day she was tasked with adapting shallow trash.

"Nov 12, 2017",negative,"Dakota Johnson shines in this clunky, boring and domesticated sex ruse. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Nov 8, 2017",positive," If it appeared on men's doorsteps, would it resemble something they know and like? Or would those fleshy fantasies be terrifying - or worse, make them feel small, in all senses of the word? Student journalist Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) interviews enigmatic billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). They are sexually attracted to each other but he speaks of his dark secret coming between them. Eventually he opens up, telling her that unless she becomes his submissive in a sado-masochistic relationship, they cannot have a relationship. Grey (Jamie Dornan) of Grey Enterprise Holdings is a billionaire industrialist, pilot, pianist and philanthropist, your everyday Batman-Elon Musk combination, but much, much more better-looking. So, put a check mark next to the box marked ""intimidatingly outsized"". The amount of luxury porn on display here (aircraft, servants, gliders, limos, apartments the size of Olympic villages) makes rap videos look pauperish. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy, 2009) and writer Kelly Marcel make clear that Steele (Dakota Johnson) is not too feminist soak up the pampering. The way into Steele's heart (and elsewhere on her body) is by sweeping her off her feet, literally, with a helicopter ride over the city. Judge her for her shallow wants, but the film's visual style states that this is a fantasy, as much a fairy tale as Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty. Butlers and chauffeurs hover invisibly. They couple sweatlessly. His fingers are magical sex-wands. These scenes, left unmarred by the Media Development Authority (thank you, MDA), are long, and by Singapore cinema standards, boundary-pushing. They are vital to the story. Without them, this film would be about 30 minutes shorter and make much less sense. Like its source material (the novel of the same title, and its inspiration, the Twilight series), the movie draws on very old stories about innocent girls, dark forests and big bad wolves with sharp teeth. So there is an awful lot of rose-tinted nostalgia here for a time when women sat passively while powerful men threw wealth at them, but the interesting difference here is that the power dynamic between Red Riding Hood and the Wolf shifts. Steele knows her own sexual power. She negotiates. She questions Grey's assumptions that his pleasure comes first, and hers will flow naturally from it. That back-and-forth (depicted somewhat literally as a dance) is sexualised, and director Taylor makes it work."
"Oct 30, 2017",positive," I had to travel all the way to Berlin for a preview screening of Fifty Shades Of Grey and it was there, in the city of Weimar-era decadence and Cabaret-style naughtiness, that I discovered three things.  First, that Anastasia Steele, the innocent young Vancouver student who falls for the fatally charismatic billionaire Christian Grey, no longer says ‘Holy c**p’ or ‘Holy cow’ as she so tiresomely seemed to every second page in E L James’s raunchy bestseller. This is a definite improvement, although she does still provocatively bite her lip. A lot. Second, that there is surprisingly little sex in this otherwise fairly faithful adaptation of a book that has sold more than 100 million copies, largely on the back of its explicit scenes of deflowering, instruction and so-called BDSM (bondage, discipline, sado-masochism) sex.  On screen we wait the best part of half an hour for anyone to get their kit off at all, although we do get to see Anastasia sucking suggestively on a pencil bearing the name ‘Grey’. It gets a laugh. This sex shortage is definitely unexpected, and the conventional, modesty-preserving shooting of what scenes there are is likely to be something of a disappointment, particularly for men dragged along by wives and girlfriends, but also perhaps for some of the women who make up the book’s predominantly female fan base.  The notorious tampon scene, for instance, is conspicuous only by its absence in a film which, far from breaking new boundaries, is actually heavy with the whiff of what James would dismiss as the ‘vanilla’. This is a film that has been made to be seen rather than shock. But the third and final thing I discovered is that, shortage of exotic shenanigans apart, artist-turned-director Sam Taylor-Johnson has delivered a decently acted and technically well-made adaptation of what remains a fundamentally silly and, at times, simply rather unpleasant story.  Perhaps to stop us noticing this too soon, Taylor-Johnson, who made the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy, employs music particularly effectively – think Annie Lennox singing I Put A Spell On You, Ellie Goulding’s Love Me Like You Do and, perhaps inevitably, Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love and you get the general hot-under-the-collar idea. The overall effect is likely to be divisive: if you liked the book – and tens of millions of women seemed to – this is not just the faithful film of that book but also a film made by women for women.  If it lacks the sort of sexual content that would have turned it either into hard-core pornography or a 21st century version of Emmanuelle, it’s because Taylor-Johnson, screenplay writer Kelly Marcel and James herself, who has had a hands-on role as one of the film’s producers, decided that it should. Only the box office will be able to prove them wrong. If you haven’t read the book, however, I can’t see the film version doing much for you, particularly once the giggles of the first half hour – ‘OK, rope, tape, cable-ties... you’re the perfect serial killer’ – make way for the tedium of the endless contract negotiations between Grey’s ‘dominant’ and the ‘submissive’ role he wants Anastasia to adopt. As a voiceover launched into the complex terms of that contract, I have never seen more people in a cinema audience suddenly decide it was time to go to the loo. You could tell they’d read the book. More girl-next-door pretty than Hollywood beautiful, blessed with a neat real body rather than a Hollywood fantasy one, and certainly helped by Marcel’s fine-tuning of Anastasia’s character, she brings a low-key naturalness to a role that almost redefines the word ‘challenging’. One minute Anastasia is in a smart dress, graduating from college; the next she’s stark-naked, handcuffed to a metal frame and being whipped with a riding crop. In other directorial hands – male hands, for instance – this could easily have been exploitative, but you can see that Taylor-Johnson has looked after Johnson, both on-set and in the editing suite.  The Northern Irish actor Jamie Dornan has a tougher time as Grey, not least because he’s playing such a preposterous figure – the billionaire businessman, philanthropist, helicopter and glider pilot and concert-level pianist who dances like a dream and is a fully fledged sexual deviant, of course.  Shorn of the beard he wore for The Fall on TV (he played the sexually motivated serial killer so 50 Shades definitely makes it two creeps in a row), Dornan looks like a younger Colin Firth but doesn’t yet have his screen charisma.  But then he is playing a damaged control-freak (‘I’m 50 shades of f*****-up’) who is seeking to embark on an abusive relationship with a younger and less experienced woman, so it’s hardly Dornan’s fault that we end up not liking Grey. Not least, of course, because Anastasia is heading the same way. Films about sado-masochism are always difficult – Secretary from 2002 was a decidedly awkward watch, and let’s not even mention Madonna in Guy Ritchie’s much-vilified Swept Away – but, given the problems presented by the original material, Taylor-Johnson can walk away with her head high, knowing she has done a decent, competent job, if not necessarily a great one. "
"Oct 18, 2017",positive," There are so many conversations we could potentially have about Fifty Shades of Grey, the film adaptation of EL James’s wildly popular romance novel. We could talk about its roots as Twilight fanfiction and whether or not publishing a derivative work that originates as a free piece of fan service is right or not (it isn’t, but so far I’ve only seen it happen in genres where demand outweighs supply, like romance and young adult, so I understand why it happens—publishers are desperate for material for enormous markets). Or we could talk about the extremely fucked up sexual politics at the center of the story, except other people are already on that. Or we could talk about the hopelessness of adapting garbage source material, except I don’t believe in that. Every movie, regardless of its source, has the potential to be good. What’s more, we should want them all to be good. Rooting against a movie being good is insane—why bother liking movies at all? So let’s just talk about Fifty Shades of Grey for what it is—a mediocre movie. It’s not that bad. At times, it drifts into serious second-hand embarrassment territory, and it is not anything I’d defend as high art or even particularly interesting (if you want to see an interesting, thoughtful exploration of female sexuality and power dynamics, please see The Duke of Burgundy). But it isn’t terrible. I’ve seen way worse movies aimed at men and boys, so I think everyone can chill out about a mediocre movie aimed at women. Take away all the external issues referenced above, and what you’re left with is a middling movie about a young woman’s sexual awakening whose biggest problem is bad dialogue and a sometimes-lacking male lead. Jamie Dornan (The Fall) stars as Christian Grey, the debonair billionaire with a BDSM kink, and while he’s handsome enough to carry off the suits and glamour of Grey’s world, his performance is too stiff and lacks the confidence necessary to believe he’s an irresistible sex god. There are moments when Dornan manages authenticity, particularly when he finds out that the object of his taboo affections, Anastasia Steele, is a virgin and he is horrified that he just showed her his BDSM playroom, incorrectly assuming she had a foundation from which to understand his fetish. But at almost every other moment, Dornan physically struggles with his Irish accent—seriously filmmakers, just let the accent thing go unless it’s absolutely necessary to cover it. The narrative even establishes that Grey is adopted, so having an Irish accent would be perfectly acceptable—he does not HAVE to sound like the rest of his family. But the accent is only part of Dornan’s problem: He’s clearly not comfortable with the material. To make something like Fifty Shades work—a Cinderella fantasy dressed up in fetish gear—you have to COMMIT to the premise. Dornan fails to commit. His female co-star, however, does not. Dakota Johnson was wonderful on the short-lived sitcom Ben and Kate, and the sparkle and wit that made her a delight on that show is in full evidence here. She manages to turn a basic Mary Sue into an actual person, and better, Johnson endows Anastasia with more agency and self-awareness than she has in the source material. There is still a problematic element to Anastasia and Grey’s relationship—his “high-handedness” is outright stalker behavior—but Johnson puts enough, well, steel into Anastasia to sell her willingness to explore Grey’s world, as well as her disastrous exit from it. It’s depressing that we have to ask that the female lead in a movie about female sexuality not be a victimized doormat, but it does feel like a small victory that Anastasia doesn’t come off as a victimized doormat. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy) and screenwriter Kelly Marcel (Saving Mr. Banks) deserve a lot of credit for making Fifty Shades work at all. Taylor-Johnson doesn’t do anthing revolutionary, but her direction is more than serviceable. The only thing that falls short of acceptable is the lighting, which is flat and boring. Taking the “grey” theme too far, the cold lighting leaches all depth from the scenery, giving the movie a cheap TV look despite its real estate porny settings and high-end product placement. The only scene with any visual dynamism is the conference room scene in which Anastasia and Grey negotiate her submissive contract—thanks to a deep red lighting scheme—and Johnson’s sly intonations—that scene pops with energy. Would that the rest of the movie had similar verve."
"Sep 20, 2017",positive," THE SKINNY: Literature undergrad Anastasia Steele (Johnson) is swept off her feet by handsome billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan). She soon learns that her dashing beau has a secret obsession that will require her to submit completely to his whims. Can she find true love with such a demanding paramour? Can he learn to accept her independent streak? Just what are they getting up to? Hear me now and believe me later, Johnson and Dornan have huge scientific-type beakers full of it. He’s Hydrogen Sulfide, she’s Nitric Acid, and when you mix them together, they explode off the screen. Basically, Fifty Shades Of Grey is a sort of companion piece to the Twilight movies. As you may or may not know, the author of the Fifty Shades books, EL James, started off writing Twilight fan fiction. As a huge Twilight fan, I was tickled to see all the ways this story of a dumb little chick in lust with a billionaire mirrored the story of Bella and her sparkly vampire boyfriend Edward. For starters, Johnson and Dornan look a lot like Stewart and Pattinson. Beyond that, the development of Anastasia’s and Christian’s relationship is almost comically similar to Bella’s and Edward’s. Which reminds me — this movie has kinky sex. Not having read the books, I was expecting Fifty Shades to be tawdry, exploitative and dumb, but it’s anything but. It also helps that this is one of the most beautifully-shot films I’ve seen in a while — it’s shot like one giant commercial for itself. This dude has shot everything from Atonement to The Avengers, and the flick is worth seeing just to bask in the beautiful images he has created. It’s not politically correct, but it mines a deeper sort of truth. Women do fall for men like Christian — rich, handsome and wicked. How could anyone possibly deny it? Leave the kids at home and have a ball with your partner or your pals. I went with my date Jeanmarie, and we giggled the whole way through. Set to an achingly sensuous remix of Beyonce’s Crazy In Love, it revealed such a brief yet seductive taste of the Fifty Shades universe I was instantly fearful the actual movie wouldn’t be able to match up. While devouring the book trilogy before the movie was cast, I was imagining Robert Pattinson and Emma Roberts — who were both rumoured to be involved — in the lead roles. On all the occasions they’ve had to appear together to promote the movie, they have looked like they’d rather be anywhere but standing next to each other. Even though an arsenal of apparatus like floggers, ropes, handcuffs and belts from Christian’s “red room of pain” make cameos, the supposedly controversial sex scenes are thankfully far from graphic (which explains why the film was passed uncut), and deliver the right amount of eroticism. It explores and unravels a complicated, disturbing dominant-submissive relationship involving issues of control, trust, rewards and punishments, where there is no black and white, only — you guessed it — shades of grey. The abrupt ending may come across as anticlimactic, but it will whet fans’ appetites for the sequels to come. The only torture here is in the waiting."
"Aug 16, 2017",neutral,The retention of the style of the book and its settings merges with a cinematic story more focused on buildup than execution.
"Aug 14, 2017",positive," For a film about a “dreamy” billionaire, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), who persuades the virginal Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) to become his submissive in a dom-sub relationship, Fifty Shades of Grey is far more interested in Anastasia’s thoughts and conscious decisions than it is in developing Christian into someone with even a semblance of a personality. At every step of their budding relationship, director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy) emphasizes Anastasia’s choices, her curiosity, and her control: she may agree to be spanked, but it’s more about her genuine sexual curiosity than bending to her lover’s will. The film’s a hell of a ride, often a fun and thought-provoking one, even though it’s all such camp. But there’s so much talent here — between Johnson, Taylor-Johnson and the excellent but under-used supporting cast of Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden — wasted on an often stupid script that’s unintentionally funny as frequently as it is intentionally funny. The first half of the film is effectively a subversive romantic comedy: he is a fantasy; she is a real person. They meet-cute at the headquarters of his business empire where she’s been sent in her roommate’s stead to conduct an interview for the school newspaper. His formal manner, tailored suits, wealth, and taste for modern design are meant as stand-ins for some kind of sophistication that his vocabulary belies. He finds Anastasia’s clumsy, open, school-girl demeanor — insisting he call her ‘Ana’ when he addresses her as ‘Miss Steele’ — and probing questions disarming. So he makes sure they meet again — being a beautiful billionaire, though, we’re expected to excuse his borderline creepy stalker behaviour. His advances are certainly welcomed. When he just so happens to find himself in the hardware store where she works — he purchases, hilariously, rope and ties — sparks start to fly, with flirtatious banter. Christian is the king of mixed messages, insisting he doesn’t do romance while constantly making big, romantic gestures — whether it’s sending English-literature major Anastasia a first edition of her favourite book or taking her on an impromptu helicopter ride. He even plays the knight-in-shining armour, rescuing a drunk Ana from a bar, before tending to her vomit and hangover. He spends the other half of their time together pushing her away, telling her he’s bad news, that they can’t be together. Anastasia is always calling him on it — apparently she never learned that you should listen when people tell you who they are — questioning the rules he insists she play by, and ultimately kickstarting their real romance by drunk-dialing him to scold him for his hot and cold behaviour. His predilection for BDSM means he claims he won’t touch her until she signs a contract, but even when she asks for a business meeting, and we can see her practically vibrating with the desire to have him ravish her, she maintains control and walks out. If he wants to have rules, she’s going to have a few of her own. Although it’s only a sort-of sexy film — nothing in it comes close to the eroticism of laundering lingerie in The Duke of Burgundy — and a fairly tame one for BDSM at that — there isn’t even a human toilet! — it’s a very tactile film. When we’re not watching closeups of characters’ faces flushed with emotion or pleasure, we’re usually seeing something being touched up close: a hand grasping a tea-cup, a whip caressing the skin before being cracked, or Christian’s hands sliding up and down Anastasia’s body. Their first sex scene is backlit to emphasize her golden skin and leg hair: every hair is standing up, every graze registering. The image of Anastasia’s hands being bound during sex — whether with a silk tie or leather cuffs — is not a degrading one: physically unable to participate, to give him pleasure, means everything is about her ecstasy, as she throws her head back and bites her lip. Even when not bound, he won’t let her do so much as caress his back, so deep-rooted are his intimacy issues. Then again, this spares her having to do any work — another part of the fantasy. Although how she can ever fall in love with him, given there’s nothing two-sided about this relationship is a little hard to swallow — no matter how many orgasms he magically gives her without instruction or serious feedback. Their relationship seems to involve little more than frequent sex and expensive dinners: they never actually talk, even as Anastasia begs Christian to open up. Christian is an outdated stereotype — the stoic, damaged, rich, tall, dark, tortured, and handsome figure — who can only be changed by the love of a good woman. All we get are some burn scars on his chest and a short sob story, about his crack addict birth mom who died when he was four, to explain his kinky proclivities. He is, as Miriam Bale put it, the male manic pixie dream girl. In a day and age when we should be celebrating men who actually express emotion, that crying and sharing is sexy, Christian is practically Don Draper, minus the obvious intelligence or playfulness or complicated emotional issues. Why cast Marcia Gay Harden as his adoptive mother if you’re not going to give her a fighting chance to help give him depth? Part of Christian’s appeal, of course, is that only Anastasia can break through his bad boy defenses — it’s supposed to be an honour, but in real life, it’s a sign to run the hell away. Yet his stereotypical blandness is a useful role reversal: isn’t this how we’re used to seeing women portrayed, which we accept without batting an eye? But people are likely to get more upset about a two-dimensional, old-fashioned stereotype of a man. Perhaps this will generate a useful dialogue about this double-standard for female and male parts in mainstream movies. It’s still a missed opportunity though: with a woman this interesting, she deserves a man who can keep up with her and challenge her outside the bedroom. Yet this is never Christian’s film. Don’t be fooled by how frequently Anastasia’s nipples or tuchus are on display, while we never get more than a bit of pubic hair and bare chest from Christian. This is Anastasia’s film: she’s the three-dimensional character we identify with, the one with feelings, who’s genuinely confused. And she’s the reason Christian finds himself confused, breaking half of his silly and delusional rules because he secretly craves intimacy with this woman. But he’s so lacking in self-awareness that he doesn’t understand how he’s self-sabotaging or that he can be intimate without sacrificing his stupid sense of identity — is being emotionally stunted really something worth holding onto? The countless times that Taylor-Johnson shows Anastasia emerging from or entering into an elevator throughout the film had me frequently thinking back to the season two finale of The Good Wife when the titular Alicia Florrick finally decides to sleep with her boss. But first, she steps onto an elevator in the hotel, on which all the buttons have been pushed. Every time the elevator stops at a new floor, it’s an opportunity for her to leave, to turn back. She has to keep making the decision to go forward with her plan, over and over and over again, and it’s ultimately Alicia who has to open the door to the hotel room they’re headed toward. It’s all about Alicia’s consent and agency. Similarly, Taylor-Johnson is persistently giving Anastasia an out, a door to walk through that she must deliberately choose to enter or open. Even when she first walks into Christian’s office, she has to open the door herself. As Christian starts to insist more and more that bondage and S&M become part of their bedroom experience — or rather, their sexual exchanges in his all-red “playroom” filled with sexual props — there’s a playfulness to it: he offers her a small taste, checking first that she agrees, and then won’t proceed until she asks for more. The second half of the film, when the couple start to get serious about their BDSM, is when things fall apart. She keeps pushing him on why a dom-sub relationship is so important to him, and the way she chooses to have him explain it to her is beyond idiotic and absurd. There’s no denying that he’s opened her up to parts of her sexuality she may not have otherwise explored, but if the reason for it is because he — and he actually fucking says this — is “fifty shades of fucked up,” how is that a valuable service? Why must the film insist that she can’t enjoy this in a healthy way? Christian seems to believe that deflowering Anastasia shouldn’t involve a dom-sub relationship but something gentler and sweeter. They appear to “make love” even though he claims he only “fuck[s]—hard.” If he’s got it in him, and he’s attracted to her because she’s forcing him to feel these things called feelings, why is he so insistent on pushing Anastasia to be his, well, consenting property? His behaviour proves erratic, but we never really get a sense of personal conflict, that maybe he’s being forced to do emotional work he can’t cope with. I guess you have to wait for the sequel if you want to see actual character growth. And it’s a shame, because what Johnson brings to the part is not just a believable innocence and pluck, but playfulness and emotional maturity. When Christian first ties up her hands with one of his grey silk ties, she giggles at the role-playing: she’s submitting on her terms, aware that she’s still got control even though Christian is such an insufferably emotionally controlling guy. I suppose part of the point of the story is that Christian is such a cypher, but when they go flying in a glider, much like the one Pierce Brosnan piloted in The Thomas Crown Affair, I couldn’t help but wonder how much more alive and enduring the film could be if Christian had half the wit of Brosnan’s Thomas Crown. Even Taylor-Johnson’s direction is playful: consider that all the secretaries in Christian’s office dress in grey shirts, and even emails and text messages get sent on a grey background. How much better could the film be if there was this kind of humanity on display more frequently in their relationship from both characters? After all, it really does take two to tango. And one of them can’t be holding the camera."

"Aug 1, 2017",negative," There’s not much of a point in reviewing Fifty Shades (the movie) outside the context of Fifty Shades (the phenomenon). I don’t want to condemn what other people get their jollies from, and I think it’s remarkable that media has the power to change audiences’ perceptions of their own sexuality. Unfortunately, Fifty Shades conflates sexuality of any kind with agency; and as much as I’d like to think that everyone viewing or reading it does so with critical distance, that seems awfully optimistic when I remember how 19-year-old Carolyn didn’t think twice about Christian Grey’s patently abusive behavior, or when I consider how the little-Twilight-fanfic-that-could has created an unhealthy and inaccurate popular perception of kink. Sure, there are people who enjoy aspects of Fifty Shades while also criticizing its glorification of domestic abuse; but there are also people who will pay $12,397 to get the “Christian Grey experience.” To recap: the Christian Grey experience depicted in the books and to some extent in the movie includes but is not limited to stalking, gaslighting, manipulation, forced alienation from one’s friends and family, and rape threats. None of those behaviors are part of BDSM. None of those behaviors are acceptable in a relationship. Fifty Shades (the movie) presents a less explicitly abusive dynamic than the first Fifty Shades book, but that’s in no way an endorsement of the film. If anything, that just makes its influence scarier. I’ve gotta hand it to Dakota Johnson, though–girl does a really good job of making something out of nothing. E.L. James’ Ana is basically just a placeholder, but Johnson is funny, warm, sympathetic, and smart (I can’t wait to see her in a more deserving movie). The book insinuated that Ana was a prude for hesitating to indulge her man’s “singular tastes,” but Johnson as an actor seems so obviously critical of the movie’s message that her reluctance actually makes Christian look a little bit like the unattractive jerk he is. If there’s one redeeming grace in Fifty Shades (the movie) that the book was lacking, it’s that Johnson’s surprisingly awesome performance allows the audience to look at Ana and see an actual woman. An actual woman whose boyfriend punishes her for visiting family. An actual woman who has her house broken into because she’s reluctant to sleep with a man. An actual woman guilted into thinking she has a duty to “fix” her abuser. Jamie Dornan is fine. I guess. It’s hard to critique his performance when the character as written doesn’t do much aside from fume and wear the world’s lowest jeans. (Dornan’s core, however, is clearly vying for an Oscar. The man has a back like a bag full of snakes.) About that nudity: although the human cheesegrater stays safe in his magical floating pants for most of the film, Ana is naked more often than not; you could argue that’s illustrative of the pair’s sub/Dom relationship, but since, as Roxane Gay puts it, Fifty Shades is to BDSM as McDonald’s is to real food, it’s more likely that Ana’s physical exposure is just another indicator of the dangerous double standard upon which the entire franchise (and Twilight before it) is built. If Fifty Shades of Grey was about a woman who surprised her boyfriend-of-several-weeks by flying out to his parents’ house or breaking into his apartment, it wouldn’t have been made into a movie, or at least not one released on Valentine’s Day. A toxic woman is a scary or funny trope; men with the exact same behaviors are deemed “romantic.” The movie spouts a lot of fucked-up misinformation about BDSM (and for a movie that’s ostensibly pro-sex, it sure is obsessed with abstinence), but more than anything else, it’s a reminder of how easy it is to be a man.  Fifty Shades of Grey is so much smarter than its source material, but smarter in this case doesn’t mean better. Not where it counts, at least. The movie is savvy enough to know how to use E.L. James’ terrible prose as a comedic device, but just because the film wants its audience to recognize the ridiculousness of “laters, baby,” doesn’t mean that Christian himself is supposed to seem anything less than ideal. That’s where the scary potential of this adaptation lies: it initially presents itself as an ironic “so bad it’s good” experience, but when the shit hits the fan, it hits hard. Without any point of comparison, Ana’s abuse can seem like part of the joke, or worse, unremarkable. There’s a scene near the beginning of the movie where Christian tells Ana he had no choice but to undress her while she was unconscious before putting her to bed. (Because sleeping in your street-clothes is deadly, I guess?!???) But he had a choice, and so do you. Don’t see this movie–not because it isn’t sexy, enjoyable, and fun, but because it’s business-as-usual misogyny in insidious, beefcake packaging. And because space bees. Nothing says Valentine’s Day like space bees, right?"
"Jun 27, 2017",negative," Another distraction, sometimes welcome, sometimes not: the squealing toddler in the row behind.  She was there with her parents and an older sibling who looked to be about 7 or 8. Odd family outing, but who am I to judge?  I once made a boyfriend take me to see “How The West Was Won” on Valentine’s Day. Anyway, if you’re one of the few who doesn’t know about “Fifty Shades,” it’s based on an erotic best-seller (which subsequently spawned two sequels) about a…well, see a few paragraphs above. Her name notwithstanding, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a pliant young woman who meets mysterious zillionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) when she subs for her flu-stricken roomie who was supposed to interview him for the school paper. Or something like that.  It hardly matters.  What does matter is that the two enter into a sexual relationship that involves literal ties that bind (among other things). As this sort of thing goes (in movies), I think Mickey Rourke, Kim Basinger and the contents of a well-stocked fridge had a lot more heat in “9 1/2 Weeks.” Poor Dornan was a last-minute replacement, and he plays Grey well – as a last-minute replacement. He’s a powder-puff pretending to be a wrecking ball. Perhaps his next career movie will be a turn in “The Bachelor.” Something about him suggests that. Doe-eyed heroines — non-animated version — don’t come much doe-ier-eyed than Johnson.  Dressed in the 21st-century equivalent of librarian-chic, her huge eyes hidden by an introvert’s bangs, she’s just fine. What’s important is that she understands completely how the character must function, and she embraces—rather than condescends to  — the role.  Harder to do than you might think. Lineage could be the key. Though best-known as the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, Johnson has more steel in her veins than you may realize. She is also the granddaughter of Tippi Hedren, the woman who survived Alfred Hitchcock not once, but twice.  A little bondage in the bedroom is not likely to do her — or her career — in. “Harder to do than you might think.”  Hilarious.  I suppose sooner or later every actor finds themselves in a role that begs to be condescended to, and must resist that temptation.  A little like the old joke about the dialogue between a masochist and a true sadist:  “Hurt me!” “I refuse!” SaportaReport, founded in February 2009, is a trusted voice in metro Atlanta.

"May 31, 2017",negative," A film that captures the moment and goes on to become something that women will love for ever. It lodges in the heart as a five-star classic, a four-hankie weepie, an unforgettable experience for the audience. Fifty Shades Of Grey is not that kind of film. Despite the hype and the sex scenes filmed in full-screen buttockarama, the most anticipated release of the year is not much more than a spanking great bore. Fans were promised lashings — literally — of passion and piping hot sex from this adaptation of the multi-million-selling erotic novel by E.L. James, who attended the world premiere in Berlin last night with the movie’s director and stars. Yes, this Fifty Shades Of Grim might have its titillating moments, but it just goes on and on and on for no good reason before ending in an abrupt and unsatisfactory way — the very definition of bad sex, not good. Part of the difficulty is the lack of sexual chemistry between the two leads. This is a particularly acute problem in a tale of two lovers exploring a relationship that takes in the wilder shores of bondage, submission, dominance and terrible dialogue. ‘Sitting through the turgid and tedious S&M melodrama that is Fifty Shades Of Grey may feel like its own form of torture. Those looking for hot, kinky sex will be disappointed. ‘Fewer than 15 of the movie’s 125 minutes feature sex scenes. The dialogue is laughable, the pacing is sluggish and the performances are one-note. Worst of all, the chemistry is nil between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson. Dornan spends most of his time frowning while Johnson stares vacantly and bites her lip.’ ‘It has stripped away the fun and settled on palatable. There have been perfume commercials with more depth and story arc. We may have been curious going in, but by the time the credits roll, there’s another question that springs to mind: is that all there is?’ ‘Fifty Shades is a lot tamer than it could have been. Dornan, a god on Earth with a wobbly American accent, is forced to play the same notes over and over. Which I don’t mind watching him do, but he begins to seem bored. The film’s plotlessness becomes a burden in the last 20 or so minutes, when something like a climax is needed, but all the film can muster is yet another argument.’ ‘This is a turn-off — every time a sex scene comes on, some lady starts singing a big, whooshy Sex Scene song. Hello, Beyonce . . . It will work better as home entertainment, when each viewer can race past the blah-blah about how well Christian plays the piano and pause on the fleeting image of the man minus his pants.’ ‘Both actors do strip . . . but anyone hoping the movie would really push the S&M envelope may find Christian’s tastefully shot toy room a little . . . vanilla. We see a whip here, a handcuff there, but nothing that would shock even newcomers.’ ‘The mediocre plot, bland characters and tepid tone don’t do any favours. The result is a boring, drawn-out call to a sex dungeon that takes an indeterminable time to arrive.’ They tear through this tale of raw passion like a couple of drippy teens, with neither party exhibiting the kind of dark sensuality needed to make this rom-com with extra dom even halfway believable. ‘I’m not exactly jumping at the opportunity to get whipped and chained in your red room of pain,’ Ana chirrups at one point, as if contemplating tidying her knicker drawer. ‘That was nice,’ she says, after taking a bit of a thrashing from Grey. Nice? You’d think he’d just given her a half-hearted peppermint foot rub. Meanwhile, Grey’s eyes are supposed to blaze with seething lust all the time, but he just looks as if he’s suffering from trapped wind. Nurse, fetch the Tums! It is true that this Hollywood adaptation is not as bad as the books. Even their most devoted fans would probably admit they were often clumsily written, teen-style steamy fiction. British director Sam Taylor-Johnson has sliced through the worst of the dialogue, but overcompensated by making the film all too tasteful and ponderous, like an empty collection of slightly pervy but beautifully shot perfume adverts. Poor Dakota — the daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith — is often naked, with a high nipple count, lots of buttock shots and occasional flash of front bottom. Jamie gets to keep his jeans on a lot, which hardly seems fair or feminist, although we do get to see his impressive bottom, rippling with muscles like a bag of walnuts. Of Christian Grey’s fabled manhood, which features so much in the books, there is no sight. Grey’s only hardware on show is his monogrammed helicopter, his glider and his collection of fancy cars. Still, what else could Sam Taylor-Johnson do? The film of Fifty Shades had a difficult inception, with a number of actors, directors, writers and key personnel all being changed at short notice. British screenwriter Patrick Marber was drafted in to beef up the script, then author E.L. James threw out all his work and reinserted her own dialogue. She is famously proprietorial about Fifty Shades — and why not? Despite the fact that the books have little literary merit, she knows what her readers want: sex — and lots of it. Exploring the world of bondage, domination, sadism and masochism (BDSM) might seem daring, but to be honest, the mass market appeal of 50 Shades is strictly old fashioned. The books struck a chord with women who want that timeless fantasy — to be swept away from their humdrum lives by a tide of passion over which they have no control. These are presumably the kind of women who see Beyonce and Madonna turning the simplest pop song into a leather-clad psychosexual performance, and perhaps want some of that, too. But might it be the case that this story is not really about sexual desire, but about the desire to be dominated by a handsome, rich Prince Charming? What E.L. James has written is Cinderella, re-tooled for a more sexualised age. Ana’s pumpkin coach is Christian’s helicopter, her glass slipper is his silk blindfold. There is even a post-coital scene in the film where Ana is happily frying bacon wearing one of his shirts, with her hair tied up in a fetching topknot. How many times have we seen that before. ‘Are your Xboxes in there?’ she wonders. The Red Room of Pain where the tyings-up take place — infamous for those who have read the books — looks like a Pilates gym designed by Smythson, all sleek cherry leather and shiny clasps. There are mysterious instruments hung on the walls; whips and manacles, yes. But what are the rest — squirrel tails, that feather duster from Downton Abbey, a paddle, two bread boards? Meanwhile, there is some hanky panky with ice cubes and a bit of ever so tasteful, slow-motion peacock-feather-tickling that will remind many women not of their libido, but the fact that their mantelpiece could do with a dust. And in the end of this modern, sexually adventurous load of nonsense, the hero throws the heroine over his knee and gives her a good spanking."
"Apr 26, 2017",positive," If you go to a lot of Hollywood screenings, you know there’s a special trembling in the air when the audience expects the movie to be good. But the air couldn’t have been deader at the Fifty Shades of Grey preview last night at the ArcLight. Yes, you heard a few scattered female whoops when the film finally started, but until then, every person you talked to had a bad feeling. We’d all heard reports that stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan had no chemistry. We’d heard that director Sam Taylor-Johnson didn’t see eye-to-eye with E. L. James, the author of the original books. As if that weren’t enough, the whole enterprise seemed ripe for disaster. At the best of times, it’s hard to adapt a popular novel for the screen, and here was a massive bestseller stuffed with scads of BDSM action—this in an era when Hollywood movies have become all spandex and no sex. Small wonder we were all on flop-watch. Critics prepared their snide jokes in advance; I’d already worked up a riff on the history of lousy sex movies. Then the lights went down, and guess what? Fifty Shades of Grey turned out to be not just entertaining—at least until the clunky, exasperating final minute—but it also knows exactly what it’s doing. As you’re doubtless aware, it’s the story of a virginal, romantic English major, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), who gets involved with a handsome, uptight, controlling billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) who doesn’t do hearts and flowers—he’s into handcuffs and floggers. Whereas the novel treats their relationship with a seriousness others might reserve for Bible study, Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel see what’s funny in this fetishistic scenario. The couple’s early encounters possess an unexpected lightness—Johnson’s got a wonderful comic touch—and when Steele and Grey negotiate the written contract he’s prepared stating exactly what he can do to her body, the scene’s absurdity is saved by the filmmaker’s droll awareness that it’s absurd. Even when the two of them get down to the de rigueur sex stuff, most of which is generic R-rated business—you know, ice cubes sliding down torsos, the obligatory bare breasts and bums—the movie doesn’t submit to the dominance of dark eroticism. Like a vintage fifties melodrama, it takes lurid material, cleans it up, gives it a high gloss, and turns it toward heady and healthy emotion. You see, whether James knows it or not, the original Fifty Shades of Grey is essentially a YA novel with bondage. For all its dirty bits, it’s not actually about Anastasia experiencing the joys of rough sex (though she does get off on some of it). It’s about how she redeems the psychologically twisted Grey—it’s not for nothing his first name’s Christian—by teaching him how to love, in part by meeting him halfway in his desires. This is, beneath it all, corny stuff, but what makes it engaging is Johnson, an actress of ineffably awkward charm, who pulls off the trick of bringing a thinly drawn character to vibrant life. While Dornan gets better and more complicated as the film goes along—at first, he displays all the erotic voltage of a taller Ryan Seacrest—Johnson is great all the way through. Channeling both her father, Don Johnson, and her mother, Melanie Griffith, she manages to do two opposite things at the same time. Even as she finds Grey’s style and sexual tastes rather amusing (in this, she is the audience’s surrogate), her every expression and gesture reveals she’s also really turned on by him. You can never really predict these things—who could’ve guessed Robert Pattinson would become bigger than Kristen Stewart?—but with Fifty Shades of Grey, it looks like Dakota Johnson has just made herself a movie star.

FIFTY SHADES OF GREY (director: Sam Taylor-Johnson; screenwriters: Kelly Marcel/novel by E.L. James; cinematographer: Seamus McGarvey; editors: Debra Neil-Fisher, Anne V. Coates, Lisa Gunning; music: Danny Elfman; cast: James Dornan (Christian Grey), Dakota Johnson  (Anastasia Steele), Victor Rasuk (Jose), Jennifer Ehle  (Carla), Marcia Gay Harden (Mrs. Grey), Luke Grimes (Elliot Grey), Eloise Mumford (Kate); Runtime: 125; MPAA Rating: R; producers: Michael De Luca, E L James, Dana Brunetti; Universal (Focus Features); 2015)
“Not as dirty as we were led to believe by the ads.” Dull shocker directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (“Nowhere Boy”), which is not as dirty as we were led to believe by the ads. Writer Kelly Marcel aseptically adapts the screenplay from the literary limited novel by E.L. James. The trilogy novel surfaced in 2009 and began as Twilight fan fiction. The virgin Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) is a college English-lit major who is graduating. When interviewing for her college journal in Seattle the billionaire 27-year-old techno business tycoon Christian Grey (James Dornan, Irish model-turned actor ) as a favor for her roommate Carla (Jennifer Ehle), she believes she met Mr. Perfect and begins a relationship with him. Christian’s big flaw is that he gets off on various bondage exercises, that includes flogging the submissive young lady. I guess things are fine since it’s consensual. Though Ana has her limits and says no to anal fisting. All the sex scenes are done without going over the line, and therefore could be considered tasteful. But the relationship film steps into dark corners and sees only the inane, which makes for a tortuously boring watch. The stud might be a hunk, but he has the charisma of a piece of wood."

"May 28, 2016",negative," “Oh, I’d let Jamie Dornan tie me up. Absolutely.” My friend and I were having coffee at the Starbucks around the corner from the AMC Lincoln Square, where we’d just come from an all-media screening of Sam Taylor-Johnson’s adaptation of E.L. James’ Fifty Shades of Grey, and we were hashing out the movie. I’d asked her to come with me for one simple reason: because she’s the closest person I know to Anastasia Steele, the book’s heroine. She’s young, attractive, intelligent, and (by her definition, at least) a submissive. What she thinks about this movie is way more interesting than what I think about it. But here’s the thumbnail traditional review, for the record: your film editor wishes it had either been much better or much worse. It’s not, as you might’ve heard, this year’s Showgirls, a deliciously terrible so-bad-it’s-good retelling of the notorious novel. There are some interesting scenes, some strong supporting performances (particularly by Marcia Gay Harden, who breezes in for a couple of scenes and really classes up the joint), and a flat-out terrific leading turn by Dakota Johnson, who knows this material is basically ridiculous and plays the comedy of it, to great effect. But it’s also too flawed to recommend — much of the dialogue is irredeemably goofy, the sex scenes are straight out of Red Shoe Diaries, Dornan is a cipher, and the slicked-up portrait of the lives of the rich is straight out of an early-‘90s Michael Douglas movie (not one, but two sequences amount to flying porn). There’s my two cents. My friend’s take is a bit more complicated. She is, first of all, not precisely the same kind of sub that Christian Grey is trying to turn Anastasia Steele (gawd, those names) into: “I’m never in a situation where I’m saying, ‘Yes, sir,’ ‘No, sir,’” she explains. “It’s not that traditional, it’s not that formal. For me, it’s more giving up physical control. It’s saying, I am willing to be 100 percent physically vulnerable in front of you, and to allow you to push the limits of that vulnerability — because I enjoy it, and you enjoy it, and me, in that moment. But it’s never a situation, for me personally, where it’s punishment.” But. That “but” is where things get scrambled when you’re talking Fifty Shades of Grey, where the concerns of kinksters merge with those of anti-porn types and sex-positive feminists and people who are generally sensible. Because even someone like me, someone not in The Scene, can feel something going horribly askew the deeper we get into this narrative, which eventually crosses over from normalizing kink to, arguably, normalizing abuse. My friend is inclined to give a lot of leeway here. “His tying her up and hitting her with a flogger or a whip, isn’t abuse. She said yes, she gave him permission, and he did not cross a line with her.” But what’s tricky, she says, it what it takes to get her to that point. “He coerces her. She may be into it, she may find that she enjoys it, but her initial shock and dismay at his proposition? That’s honest. And he then coerces her.” Growing up, my friend read enough romance novels to understand the fantasy: “The shy, innocent girl who doesn’t know how beautiful she is meets the worldly man who is famous or wealthy or in some position of power, and he sweeps in, and he changes her mind, but she changes his heart.” But what’s harder for her to swallow is how Fifty Shades makes it clear that a BDSM relationship is not, for Christian Grey, a kink but a requirement, and a requirement borne out of a past of abandonment (by a mother who was, no kidding, a literal crack whore) and abuse. In other words, the book and the film promote the notion that you’d have to be broken in some way to get off on this stuff. “For me, personally, what makes this hard to dismiss is that — and this is going to sound melodramatic — in some real way, [E.L. James] pulling this general perception out of the air that everyone who does this wants to just hurt people, and is doing it because of some deep psychological trauma… that makes it harder for someone like me to negotiate my own life,” she says. “Because what if I meet some great guy whose mom or sister or ex-girlfriend has read these books and raved on an on about them, and given him the bits and pieces? And what’s formed his idea about women like me is a combination of Fifty Shades of Grey and the shit that’s out there — that’s legitimately, 100 percent abuse walking around with a ‘bondage’ sign on it — on porn sites? Does it raise my hackles a little bit? Yeah. And this makes it easier for the bad people to take advantage of [submissives] who are inexperienced, or maybe don’t have as firm a grasp on what their own limits actually are.” And this, when you get down to it, is the fatal flaw of Fifty Shades of Grey: that it wants to be edgy and kinky and titillate us with a scene, but only to the degree that it can smash that scene into the traditional beats of a good girl/troubled guy rom-dram dynamic that’s as old as the hills (she’s honest and good, and he’s gorgeous and troubled and has to be fixed). Ultimately, James and Taylor-Johnson want to have their cake and eat it too, to revel in the sexiness of a fetish while simultaneously looking down on those who partake in it as, in some way, damaged goods."
"May 15, 2016",negative," Save yourselves, the book is better than the film. I thought the film would be much better because it was directed by Sam Taylor-Wood of Nowhere Boy, but alas, the film was much worse. Fifty Shades of Grey opens predictably. There are lots of grey things – grey clouds, grey buildings, grey clothes. Dramatic music plays in the background as we watch Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) put on a shirt while standing in his walk-in wardrobe. Grey is super good-looking and also super rich. He is CEO of some firm named after him. Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) is a timid college student. She bats her eyelids a lot and wears floral blouses. Her housemate, Kate, works for the student paper and has an interview with Grey but is sick, so she sends Anastasia instead with a list of questions. The meeting between Anastasia and Grey, which occurs in his office, is supposed to explode with sexual tension. It sort of did this in the book. It didn’t do this at all in the film. Anastasia sits down and looks confused. We see a shot of Grey’s desk and are able to admire the fact that he has a series of lead pencils lined up with his firm’s name on them. Why does the CEO only write in lead pencil? Did he never get his pen licence? I cannot recall this detail from the book, and I cannot understand the significance of it in the film. Perhaps it is symbolic of the fact that Anastasia is going to be able to change him. Much of the film revolves around Anastasia and Grey arguing about her signing a contract, presumably using a pen. Anyway, back to the initial meeting. Anastasia has forgotten a pen because she is a battler (damsel in distress). She also can’t ask questions in a smooth way. Perhaps this is supposed to be because she is so turned on by Grey, so lovestruck, so discombobulated by his charm. If so, this was unconvincing, mostly because, despite being blessed with model good looks, Grey has as much charisma as a doorstop. We first met Dornan in Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette, where he had an appropriately minor role. Before that, we met him in an advertisement for Calvin Klein underwear. Throughout Fifty Shades of Grey, Dornan acts like he is still shooting that same advertisement. At least Twilight had palpable sexual tension! There is no sexual tension at all between Anastasia and Grey. We see a lot of close-up shots of their faces. Grey’s face always looks the same because Dornan has one facial expression – frowning with his eyes slightly squinting as though he is trying to telepathically communicate with someone in a nearby room. Anastasia’s facial expressions change more regularly – she smiles, she looks coy, she cries. The film is not good, but many scenes were particularly bad. In the book, much of the communication between Grey and Anastasia takes place over email. I was wondering how this would translate to the screen. It translates in a very literal way. The emails are shown in the top right-hand corner of the screen. They are on a grey background (Of course! Neat!) and the first email is at the top of the screen, then future emails are listed below them until we have a veritable stack of emails taking up the right-hand third of the screen. In a way, this was useful because Grey and Anastasia are better at flirting over email, and so this rather literal and experimental filmic technique actually contributed quite a lot to the few morsels of sexual chemistry the film offers. In terms of aesthetics, however, it was like being hit over the head with a brick. The main issue I had with the film was that it was entirely unconvincing. This is because Dornan is so weird and abrupt as Grey that it becomes difficult to understand why Anastasia would stay with him. He doesn’t let her touch him and he refuses to share a bed with her. He doesn’t like to talk about his personal life. When she presses him he relents, but in a nonsensical way. While she is asleep, he comes into her room and says, “The woman that gave birth to me was a crack addict and a prostitute.” This is different to the book (and less concise), where he says, “The woman who brought me into this world was a crack whore.” Obviously Anastasia is asleep, so Grey’s past remains a moot point that is never discussed again. At times, the film is humorous, though it is unclear to me whether this was intentional or not. There is a scene where we see a photograph of Grey and Anastasia in the local newspaper, and Anastasia has her mouth open and looks both uncomfortable and sultry at the same time. When this photo came on screen, the entire audience burst out laughing. The scene where Anastasia and Grey negotiate in an orange room is also pretty funny. They are sitting very far away from each other and suddenly they both have sushi rolls. When Anastasia says, “Cross out anal fisting,” the audience burst out laughing again. She says, “What are butt plugs?” and the audience again started laughing. The sex scenes are done well. I was under the impression that 50% of the film would be sex scenes, but really there were only three sex scenes. As far as sex scenes go, they are unremarkable. They are like stock sex scenes with bells and whistles. I say they were done well because during them no one in the audience was laughing. Also, as in the book, there are many references to safe sex. It was novel to watch the characters tear open condom packets and discuss the oral contraceptive pill. Just to reiterate, Fifty Shades of Grey is a terrible film. It was too long and too repetitive. Amazingly, the characterisation was even shallower than it was in the book, likely attributable to the fact Anastasia’s voice is sustained throughout the book while the film is told from an objective perspective. This is a pity. The loss of Anastasia’s perspective strips the film of any excitement. In the lacking of an engaging subjectivity, the narrative of sexual awakening falls flat."
"May 12, 2016",negative," When the first instalment of E.L. James’ concupiscent trilogy was thrust into the literary world in 2011, few could have predicted that despite its lascivious content and perceived glorification of sexual exploitation, the novels would go on to sell over 100 million copies worldwide. A vehement critical backlash however, deemed its substandard literary qualities more offensive than its erotic content, its low-cultural value merely providing pabulum for the gendered masses. Whilst the character of the submissive ingénue is hardly unfamiliar in literature or contemporary cinema (Steven Shainberg’s 2002 film Secretary based on Mary Gaitskill’s novel Bad Behaviour, springs to mind) the success of James’ novels has piqued such intense global interest in the film that its cultural significance cannot be underestimated. Dakota Johnson stars as demure and diffident student Anastasia Steele who is sent to interview handsome publishing tycoon, Christian Grey (Jamie Doran) for the college newspaper. Despite having little in common, they are attracted to one another but Anastasia soon discovers that the brooding billionaire conducts his private life on the sexual fringe and that she is merely a conduit for his priapic fantasies. Adapting the novel for the big screen, director Taylor-Johnson has had to navigate a high wire between its hard-core pornographic elements, its global popularity, criticism of its sexual violence and film as a profitable commercial venture. Attempting to strike a balance between all four, Taylor-Johnson focuses on the development of the emotional relationship between the protagonists rather than an exploration into the world of sadomasochism, which steers the source material’s narrative. As a result of such diluted text, the sexual content is pallid and restraint, neither sexy nor risqué. By moderating the driving force within the core narrative and littering the film with sexual metaphors in its place, leaves the film with very little in the way of plot development and it has simply nowhere to go. It is left to Johnson and Dornan to rescue what they can from such sexual oblivion and whilst Johnson is a revelation as the innocuous student turned sexually curious mistress, Dornan struggles to connect with dual characteristics of Grey, failing to strike a balance between charismatic businessman and sadistic Dominant. The restructuring of the film’s narrative evidently hinders Dornan and while Anastasia Steele is emotionally more rounded, the psychologically complex Christian Grey is premised upon excess, domination and obsession and by moderating these characteristics, Anastasia’s desire for an impenetrable Grey becomes less plausible. In spite of the unbalanced lead performances, the stylistic elements of the film complement the shameless absurdity of the plot and the polished production design exudes glamour and indulgence, underpinned by an erotically charged music score. The sophisticated production values fail however, to conceal the lack of chemistry between the lead characters and Dornan’s struggle to connect with an egregious script overwhelms any attempts by the film’s design to compensate for its nonsensical plot. While the film is arguably no better or worse than its literary source, it does shatter the fantasies of sexual desire and sexual pleasure constructed within the novel. Fifty Shades of Grey is a book premised upon the attainment of sexual pleasure and fulfilment through the dark and sinister practices of sadomasochism. Subverting the very elements in which the narrative is structured upon and supplanting it with an anaemic love story brings a certain morality to the film that is absent in the novel and it is doubtful that Taylor Johnson’s film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey will satisfy even its most ardent fans."
"Apr 26, 2016",negative," If hype, 'likes' and advanced ticket sales are any indication of success, box offices around the world will get a boost this weekend with the release of the much anticipated adaptation of author EL James' ""mummy porn"" phenomenon, Fifty Shades of Grey. A soft-core, erotic film about a 27 year-old billionaire who attempts to seduce a demure college student with spanks, whips, blindfolds and handcuffs, the synopsis for Fifty Shades of Grey sounds more likely to come from the porn industry than a glossy Hollywood film. Except, the James' trilogy has sold more than 100 million novels worldwide, so it was only a matter of time before this saucy franchise cashed in on its remarkable success by bringing the S&M-enhanced love story of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey to the big screen. Loyal fans and those curious to see what the fuss is about will discover a film tamer and lighter than the source material - erotic, rather than pornographic, it's not as sexually explicit or psychologically dark. It's to be expected; there's a difference between what you're comfortable reading in privacy at home and what you're comfortable watching with a group of strangers at the local cinema. There's also the sense, with two more films to follow, we're being eased into the more provocative parts of the story. While the casting was reportedly fraught for both filmmakers and fans of the novel, the decision to go with lesser known faces was a good one. The lack of screen associations mean Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan have the chance to truly own the roles of Ana and Christian, and they both push their characters beyond what could have been just two dimensional clichés. Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith's daughter is surprisingly good as Anastasia. She's warm, funny and as natural as you can be when your boyfriend is asking you to sign a legal contract to be his submissive sexual partner. The narrative of Fifty Shades of Grey is largely just one conversation about the boundaries of their relationship, but Johnson's Anastasia grows throughout, slowly wrestling power from Christian, who at this point in the trilogy remains more of an enigma. In general, her nicely buffed, square jawed co-star has a harder time of it, but it's not entirely his fault. Screenwriter Kelly Marcel (Saving Mr. Banks) has kept the novel's cringe-worthy dialogue to a minimum, but it's Dornan who gets what does remain, as well as the majority of the unintentionally funny, cheesy scenes. Honestly, the post-coital piano playing has got to stop. Red flags would have gone up if you saw the lack of chemistry between Johnson and Dornan when they presented an award together at the Golden Globes. But while there are moments that don't sizzle as much as they perhaps should, for the most part, when naked, they seem to get on just fine. Which brings us to the sex. British photographer and indie filmmaker Sam Taylor-Johnson was a smart choice to direct. She was never going to be allowed, by a controlling EL James and fans, to make this juggernaut anything more than mainstream escapism for a girl's night out, but she does her best to make it about more than just sex. It is, after all, a film about two people opening up and trying to understand each other, in a Mills and Boon for the 21st Century kind of way. She makes us wait a good 40 minutes before the clothes come off completely, and another 35 minutes before the spanking starts. None of it is quite as shocking as you'd expect. Christian's Red Room of Pain, like the rest of the art direction, is tastefully decorated, and it's amazing how quickly you become accustomed to the nudity, S&M gear, and the sighs and gasps. Some scenes are hot and steamy, and some, frankly, a little dull, but there's nothing to make you feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. That is, unless you've chosen to go with your mother or on a first date.    There was even a nice feeling of camaraderie at the screening I attended. There was plenty of laughter, and, with an excessive running time of just over two and a half hours, a few yawns too. There was a sense we were in for something a little naughty, and that's what we got; a guilty, if not particularly memorable, pleasure."
"Apr 10, 2016",positive,"Funny (often intentionally!), ferociously unsexy, and roundly entertaining from beginning to end."
"Feb 23, 2016",neutral," Author E.L. James should be ecstatic that the crazy fervor surrounding her trilogy of BD/SM propelled it towards a movie deal because now artists more qualified to bring her kinkiness to life can get their hands on it. I’m not saying she’s a bad writer—I’ll let the myriad commenters on the interwebs too haughty to accept someone who turned a pornographic Twilight fan-fiction into a worldwide bestseller do that. Talent aside, James hit the jackpot. She touched a raw nerve in female readers desperate for an injection of unbridled sex no matter what adjective for penis was used. Now, with Fifty Shades of Grey the film, her faults can be improved. I’m talking quality, though, not relevancy. Personally, while director Sam Taylor-Johnson has crafted a very attractive work with the help of cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, I still don’t quite see its necessity. The women for which the “Mommy Porn” moniker was made get very little besides Christian Grey’s (Jamie Dornan) bare chest and ass in lieu of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) baring all. Soft-core porn is back on the big screen despite the novel being of the hardcore variety, so fans expecting more than a couple extended, close-up sex scenes will be disappointed. But if Kelly Marcel‘s adaptation is exacting, perhaps there wasn’t much “sex” involved in the first place. Steele gets undressed often and Grey slides riding crops along her curves to supply a lot tension without much release. Perhaps that’s the point? If so, kudos to all involved. However, as someone going in to judge the movie plain and simple, there’s not much below the surface. Is it supposed to be about a virgin college graduate’s sexual awakening? Is it perhaps a manifestation of a female fantasy to fix a broken puppy of a man, in this case a Rottweiler taking control merely because no one ever questions him? Either way it’s a warped, disturbingly abusive adult fairy tale from start to finish with plastic people dressing the background, a billionaire prince offering a hand, and a shy, hopeful everywoman yearning for happily ever after. Rather than have to overcome an outside evil blocking her way, this Disney princess’s sexual prize doubles as her romantic villain. There’s this whole “will they, won’t they” aspect at the heart of the hedonism where she wants love and he explains it isn’t in his vocabulary. But every time she pulls away he covets more, breaking his own rules to be with the girl unknowingly seeking to be his dominant when the contract on the table is for the exact opposite. There’s of course a tragic backstory as to why this cardboard Ken doll has such a frozen heart in his chest, one with details to explain his being aroused by Ana’s teasing. She only has to bite her lip to trigger a Pavlovian response in his libido. And despite her giggling at the silliness of everything she’s being exposed to, you can’t help wondering whether she’s been in control from the start. With silly, there’s no better word to describe the whole endeavor. From my brain wanting to project Twilight onto the action—with Victor Rasuk‘s José standing in for Jacob being the most glaring example—to the way moments that should arouse are painted as a verbal manual instead of spontaneous pleasure. This is why a movie like The Duke of Burgundy is more effective at doing the same subject matter justice. It puts us into the game without knowing who the submissive is, reversing the roles when we least expect it, and always showing the ecstasy of their labor. Fifty Shades of Grey is more worried about us understanding dynamics that its actions become clinical and precise. What should be hot is merely a construct to position Steele and Grey for their finale. That climax is surprisingly well done. If only the series ended after one book with the final shot of the movie hanging over our heads like a long-awaited delightful release of tension, the filmmakers could have had more fun with what came before. Knowing that I’m going to get answers in subsequent installments to questions only intriguing in their ambiguity ruins the joy I experienced in the theatre-wide gasp accompanying the cut to black. What happens isn’t a surprise—Steele’s stubborn attempts at love and Grey’s constant softening demeanor throughout make the eventual endgame obvious—but it does show the expert visual precision Taylor-Johnson had over the material. Cut a good thirty or forty minutes of fat away and this could be a taut little sexcapade. Add more sex and the overblown controversy might make sense too. Presently the bloat is simply too much to endure. Why must we meet Christian’s brother and sister? Why must we spend time with Anatasia’s divorced parents when the words she speaks about them add more to their purpose than the time they’re onscreen? I bet the push and pull between Ana and Christian would be at full flight onstage in a two-person show of dominant and submissive, each encounter slowly chipping away at the other’s resolve until roles overlap. By dedicating so much to the world outside the bedroom and “Red Room”, the film often loses momentum in lieu of redundancies. We understand Ana and Christian from their first meeting. Some of the foreplay afterwards works—the “business meeting” to discuss their sexual contract is fun—but the majority proves a monotonous drone. You know, boring like Dornan’s performance. He does an adequate job when angry and impulsive, but his line delivery under the guise of “faux nice guy” is awkward at best. Taylor-Johnson more than competently directs the proceedings, certainly more than the material deserves, but she fails at giving Christian life. I get he’s closed-off, tortured, whatever. That doesn’t mean he’s a robot. Johnson’s natural, playful counterpart only exacerbates his stiffness through her perfect mix of innocence, curiosity, and adventure. She is having fun and dare I say embracing the joke of the whole Fifty Shades hoopla: the girl next door every guy in the audience will desire clothed or unclothed, her hidden, underlying confidence stringing Christian along becomes the lynchpin holding everything together.

"Feb 10, 2016",negative,"Certainly there is an audience out there for this kind of story, and with any luck neither you nor I will ever have to interact with it."
"Jan 1, 2016",negative," Let’s start with what it’s not. It’s not the worst film in the world. To an extent, it has been rescued from its lowly origins, like its enigmatic billionaire anti-hero Christian Grey. As a trilogist EL James has been all about inflicting the wrong sort of pain, visiting bruises, welts and assorted aches upon the English language. Her instrument of abuse is Roget’s Thesaurus. That the world has willingly submitted to the dull thwacks of her prose – and to Dan Brown’s cloth ear – suggests both a vast market for masochism and the mass failure of the education system. The good thing about Kelly Marcel's script, visualised by director Sam Taylor-Johnson, is the wholesale absence of James’s sentences, if not her sensibility. Instead it’s Dakota Johnson’s job to embody Anastasia Steele’s surrender in writhing shivers and shimmering squeals and other sundry liquescences. She does it creditably. She’s a beautiful flirt too who – and this is a very old-fashioned concept, almost as old-fangled as Anastasia’s prelapsarian complement of unwaxed pubes – knows how and when to say no. While Grey is busy seducing her into his little boy’s toy room, she is seducing the audience, vulnerably gnawing her lower lip and doing the coy doe-eyed Diana look thing. If you care about anything in this film stuffed to the gunwales with planes and fleets of purring motors, with Apple product placements and a fuck-off property portfolio, then it’s the girl, a lovely innocent on the age-old path into the dark wood. But we need to talk about Christian, a walking, stalking erection with a platinum credit card and a knowledge of knots. Put together from papier-mâché and ply, and vacuum-wrapped in a plucked epidermis of lotion and ripples, he is a fatal nullity as a dramatic character. Dornan does what's required with Grey, but he's a real no-one boy, who just happens to have a massive chopper. His desire to dominate but inability to love is the conundrum the film seems to task itself with unpicking. “It’s the way I am,” he says. There is no rosebud. Beyond a cockamamie back-story about some sort of crack whore for a mother, told to Anastasia when she’s sleeping, the story has no interest in investigating its own mystery. Several years in analysis would sort him out. Alas, the film hasn’t got the time, or the curiosity (or, more likely, permission from the plot dominatrix EL James), to dig deeper. In dramatic terms Fifty Shades ejaculates early. Invoking its own safety word at precisely the point things might have got interesting, it brings things to a juddering halt and lops off the third act entirely. Boy gets girl, boy loses girl. Beauty doesn't tame the beast. That’s it. Instead there are surfaces, loads of them - sheeny chrome and glass, stainless steel and polished wood and, yes, lashings of comely skin. Even Christian’s red-walled playpen is mostly for show. He’s got enough instruments of torture to tool up the Spanish Inquisition, but, a bit like most of his car pool, they mainly stay parked. The film's cinematic forebear is the straight-to-video softcore sex thriller, which may explain the quantity of floppy-cock rock freighted into the soundtrack direct from the 1980s. This is a wannabe tragedy (with whips) about the knightly failure to commit to the maiden’s romantic narrative. Of course, it’s good that he doesn’t get his way. But on the whole, this is fifty shades of grrr."
"Dec 30, 2015",positive,"Fifty Shades of Grey delivers, however ponderously, on its promise of pop transgressiveness."
"Dec 30, 2015",negative," Only a couple minutes in, it’s clear that Fifty Shades of Grey will be ludicrous. Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) gasps out loud at the Seattle skyline like she’s never seen a city (or Seattle) before, even though she’s driving there from Portland. Wrapped in a stupid cardigan woven from the sad, blue DNA of the kind of awkward women that primarily exist in movies—which looks nothing like anything she’ll wear at any other point in the movie, mind—she proceeds to fall flat on her face while entering the office of self-made billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Johnson plays nervous by talking really slowly and leaving lengthy spaces mid-sentence; Dornan plays charismatic by…taking off his shirt a lot later in the movie? It’s a meet-cute where they fall immediately in love: her because he’s handsome; him because she forgets a pen to write with. The problem, if you’ve never heard of the E.L. James novel on which this is based, is that Christian is a BDSM enthusiast who doesn’t do “normal” relationships or vanilla sex. Annie Lennox’s “I Put a Spell On You” plays, if you haven’t already been knocked unconscious from the dropping anvils.  What’s your solution? Screenwriter Kelly Marcel and Director Sam Taylor-Johnson deal with this problem by renovating Ana’s character, though it’s not a full renovation: Ana now owns a “broken” computer, at least, but her phone is still from 2001, she still allows Christian to lecture her on drinking too much (at an after finals party) and she’s still a virgin. The movie slightly modifies that last point by having her clearly state that this is because she has not met the right partner yet. (Of course, in both versions she doesn’t believe she’s desirable despite the reams of chisel-chested men in her life who want to knock boots.) The most important change? She is, if not explicitly feminist, positioned as an independent force against Christian’s overbearing desire to have her submit to his will. She calls him on his shit. Not in an interesting way, mind—this movie isn’t actually engaging, and she’s still in lurve with him—but she does call him out. In one sense, it’s not a bad solution, and parts of the film—the ones that consequently depict Christian as a creep who refuses to listen to the desires Ana clearly and repeatedly expresses—are better than they have any right to be. At the same time, this movie isn’t supposed to be the story of an emotionally vacant Dom who is crappy at communicating what he wants to a woman of whom he’s asking a lot, so the tension between the plot of the book and the film’s conception of Ana creates a movie that doesn’t make a lick of sense. The story and the marketing are based on a simple idea: that Ana will be a vanilla audience’s portal into the sexy world of BDSM, and that her initiation into this world will be titillating even for people who have never considered BDSM play before. In this sense, the movie fails entirely. Ana does want Christian, but only as what she keeps vaguely referring to as a “normal” boyfriend. She’s fine with light bondage play, but she’s not really down for a serious lifestyle change that involves becoming Christian’s fulltime Sub—which is the reason she keeps refusing to sign the contract. How is the audience supposed to be excited or titillated about Ana’s initiation into the world of BDSM if there hasn’t really been any formal mutual consent and it is abundantly clear to everyone except Christian Grey that she’s just not that into the idea?  This issue doesn’t just manifest in the script, but in the film’s production. In the few BDSM scenes we get, the camera shies away: tight close-ups obscure Christian’s whips and chains and instead focus on Christian caressing Ana’s body for a few moments before having fairly straightforward sex with her. The whole artistry of BDSM—the patience, the anticipation, and the blurring of lines between pain and pleasure—is erased. What’s the point? Why is this film about BDSM scared of the very thing it’s actively marketing to its audience? Dornan does his best with this material, but Christian doesn’t just come off like a creep, he’s a completely ineffective creep. At no point does he offer a sustained explanation of what Ana might enjoy about being a Sub; instead he just gets her a computer and commands her to so some “research.” After their first serious BDSM session, Ana decides to go visit her mother, which, like every other thing she does in this movie, provokes Christian’s jealously. He flies to Savannah, telling her his BDSM mentor advised him to come fight for her. So, just to be clear: your BDSM mentor advised you that the best way to deal with a potential Sub who is clearly chafing against the constraints you keep trying to impose upon her is to chase her down to remind her of those constraints?  What’s worse, amidst this confusion about how we’re supposed to take Christian’s clumsy advances, Fifty Shades of Grey ends up taking a fairly offensive position against BDSM. At several points, Ana demands that Christian explain why he wants to hurt her. Christian keeps telling her that it’s because “this is the way I am.” Ana insists there must be a reason, and Christian eventually suggests there might well be a reason (in a monologue he delivers while Ana is asleep) that bafflingly suggests she might remind him of his crack-addicted mother. At no point does the movie consider the idea that Christian might be into BDSM because he is into BDSM. Instead, there is only the ever-present hint that something must be wrong with him. And because Christian is, as he himself puts it, “50 shades of fucked up,” we shouldn’t accept anything he has to say about the potential pleasures of BDSM at face value.  Couple this with how elements of BDSM are also exploited for laughs. The filmmakers already know we know what Christian’s secret is, so before Ana becomes aware of Christian’s predilections he is saddled with a bunch of double entendres at which the audience is clearly supposed to chuckle. Later on, negotiations over the contract in which Ana dismisses anal and vaginal fisting as potential activities—and then asks what a butt plug is, showing the she’s both really done a whole lot of research into this potentially life-changing decision and, also, this lit major apparently doesn’t understand how words work—are also played for humor. Is BDSM sexy or funny? Maybe it can be both, but not if it’s never taken seriously in the first place. Fifty Shades could have been a film about Ana coming to terms with the fact that she isn’t sexually compatible with the man she loves (which would require the writers to find a reason she is in love with him), or you can have a film where Ana meets an attractive man who inducts her into a sexual world she’s never contemplated before. The film tries to be about both, and the result is that the “sexy” scenes are flaccid—but fortunately too tame to be really uncomfortable—and the “dramatic” scenes are boring and repetitive. Ultimately, Fifty Shades of Grey spends two hours describing a relationship that is bound to fail and doesn’t even seem all that fun while it’s occurring. Here are two people who are suspicious of each other’s intentions but also in love because…because they are. Sexuality isn’t deviance, love isn’t this magical, and Christian Grey playing sad songs on a piano after sex isn’t endearing. Even with his shirt off.

"Dec 30, 2015",positive,"Fortunately the two leads have real chemistry. Dornan makes Christian less creepy and more angsty than on the page and Johnson brings a surprising depth to Anastasia. They also know how to play certain scenes for laughs, making the film come alive."
"Dec 30, 2015",neutral," I had zero interest in reading ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" or writing a review comparing the movie to the book. Now, if someone tied me to a bedpost and forced me to read it while lightly flogging me with Cinnabons, I’d be so into it. Our beautiful love story commences when Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) volunteers to interview 27-year-old billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for her roommate, Kate, a journalism major who’s battling a cold. Anastasia shows up at Grey’s office wearing an outfit that looks like Maria von Trapp made it out of curtains, while her body language screams timid. On the other hand, she does have a 4.0 GPA, pouty lips and big blue eyes. So, there’s that. Christian Grey’s dazzling office is completely staffed by women who look like they were hired by a Nordic head-hunting company specializing in Victoria’s Secret models. When we first meet Grey, he’s standing in his office before floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Seattle. It’s stunning shot, but also makes Grey -- Dornan, actually -- seem far less intimating than he’s meant to be. He’s clearly a handsome fella but I had a difficult time with his physicality, especially in the scenes when he’s being a “dominant.” But first, let’s discuss what works. Grey’s initial odd but endearing courtship of Anastasia is amusing. He unexpectedly shows up at the hardware store where Anastasia works and asks her to help him find cable ties, masking tape and some rope. The audience is in on the joke, but Anastasia isn’t, and Johnson plays it like a pro. Dornan, however, as the handsome, confident and mysterious suitor, gets by at this point on his natural charm. He’s still not quite the presence he needs to be. The two are falling for one another. That’s a problem for Grey because, as he tells Anastasia, he doesn’t do romance. He has a singular interest -- one that involves floggers, nipple clamps, spanking paddles, handcuffs and an adorable rabbit named Mr. Peanut. (Fine, there’s no rabbit.) Christian explains to Anastasia that he’s what’s called a “dominant” and he would like her to be his “submissive.” It requires signing a contract with very specific rules about how she’s supposed to behave and take care of herself. Anastasia’s supposedly conflicted about whether to sign, but there’s never really enough doubt shown to make it believable. And while Grey’s conflicted about his feelings toward Anastasia, feelings that may extend beyond his dominant-submissive relationship, it generates almost no dramatic tension. It’s boring. It’s fair to say, the sensual nature of some of the BDSM scenes in this movie isn’t something you’d normally find in a mainstream film, but based on the mythology surrounding the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" novel, or at least the media narrative about it, the sex scenes are rather timid. Dornan, whom I’m sure both women and some men alike will find appealing when he’s mostly naked, wasn’t particularly convincing in those scenes. He seemed uncomfortable, not like the BDSM veteran Grey is supposed to be. What may be more surprising than the sex scenes is some of the dialogue, particularly Grey’s response to Anastasia when she asks him if he’s going to make love to her now (I’m not going to spoil it for you). But then, I believe the sex is just window dressing for the real fantasy here: Anastasia’s ability to change Christian. Let’s talk about Dakota Johnson. The daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson is easily the best thing in ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" As Anastasia Steele, she’s the perfect blend of innocence and confidence; a stealthy heart-breaker who at first comes across as mousey and innocent, but suddenly and convincingly becomes confident and coquettish. On the other hand, as Christian Grey, Dornan does everything he’s asked to do, but he’s just not the intimidating, confused, tortured presence he’s supposed to be. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson could’ve done better with pacing and creating more dramatic tension. Her best work comes at the end of the movie, punctuating a film that had been largely devoid of dramatic tension and drama with a well-constructed, emotional moment that almost had me wanting to see what was next."
"Dec 29, 2015",negative," With its simplistic storyline about a naive heroine drawn to a dark, brooding hunk, who conceals monstrous desires, Fifty Shades Of Grey is Twilight with riding crops and plush furnishings. Editor Lisa Gunning gently caresses each glossy sequence of writhing appendages to the strains of Danny Elfman’s score or a soaring ballad from Annie Lennox and Sia. As a favour to her flu-riddled roommate Kate (Eloise Mumford), English Literature student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) interviews handsome billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for an article in the university newspaper. “I’m incapable of letting you go,” confides Christian as he introduces wide-eyed Anastasia to his secret world of domination and submission, which didn’t get UK censors hot under the collar, passing the film uncut. I was more aroused by the immaculate shine on Christian’s piano than anything in his boudoir of bondage: a set designer must have spent hours buffing those ivories. Kelly Marcel’s script fails to flesh out the protagonists: Christian remains an enigma and Dornan gamely keeps a straight face as he barks ropey lines."
"Dec 7, 2015",negative,"Rather than anything to do with sexual connoisseurship or philosophy in the bedroom, all that comes across through Fifty Shades of Grey's absence of erotic heat is a lust for the appurtenances of luxury, something that's more commonplace than singular."
"Nov 23, 2015",negative,"It's cheap, misogynist, Z grade exploitation masquerading as the romance of a woman trying to tame the ultimate man, who by all accounts should be alone left to his own demented fantasies"
"Nov 19, 2015",positive,"It's not overstating the case to say that Dakota Johnson achieves stardom with this role. She mines moments of humor that help offset the soul-searching and weeping, and she's appealing without being impossibly beautiful."
"Oct 14, 2015",negative," At least someone’s getting excited about the pic because anyone actually seeing it will be bored to tears. Dakota Johnson (watchable) stars as the virginal English lit major Anastasia who falls in love with the fabulously wealthy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Problem is, he’s a proud practitioner of BDSM – the dominant one, of course – and he has a big red dungeon to show for it. Anastasia’s so taken with the guy that she’s game to try out a few whips and chains. For one thing, this film adaptation doesn’t eroticize anything. Very little actually happens on any level. The pair don’t kiss until 45 minutes in. Most of the not-even-soft-porn sex is of the vanilla variety and when the handcuffs come out, the violence is seriously soft-pedalled. Crucially – contrary to Jian Ghomeshi’s claim (which his accusers deny) in his famous per-emptive-strike Facebook post that his tastes are just like Grey’s – the dominant partner here is a long-time practitioner of BDSM who takes prior agreements very seriously. An essential plot point of this first instalment is all about whether Anastasia will sign the contract so they can finally get it on. An interminable scene features the two negotiating things like whether fisting can be on the play list. I’m an anti-pornography social critic who believes porn is a deeply problematic sex educator. I’m a long-time critic of the mainstreaming of sexual violence and the media images that promote it and am passionate about ending woman abuse. I’m ready to campaign against anything that gets in the way of that goal. But 50 Shades Of Grey, the movie, is not that. In fact, there are many things about it that could trigger an important conversation about sexual violence. For example, I don’t think the desire for pain in sex comes out of the blue and is just a random happenstance. And I don’t think abusers come out of nowhere. I think we should talk about that, analyze it. The 50 Shades narrative takes that into consideration. Grey is plainly a messed up guy whose sexuality has been compromised from an early age. He admits he’s “50 shades of fucked up.” What’s appealing and seductive about that? In fact, Anastasia is bent on changing him. That doesn’t happen in this movie. But from a feminist perspective, this film has a happy ending. As for submissive partners, in the second and third books – and presumably the follow-up films – Anastasia enters Grey’s sexual universe and gets into it. Some might say this is deeply problematic, that it promotes the idea that every woman’s turned on by violence – you just have to give her time and she’ll love getting the shit kicked out of her. But the 50 Shades narrative is a little more complex. Anastasia is a virgin sexually groomed by the guy she loves into doing what he wants. That happens even when it’s full-on, actionable sexual assault. Young sexual abuse survivors, even incest survivors, often report having orgasms during repeated abuse, and have talked about how their sexuality has been moulded by the experience. This movie is a mess. It’s glacially slow, boasts a laughably clichéd soundtrack – Beast Of Burden, anyone? – and is plainly a cash-grabbing set-up to promote a full trilogy. If you’re going to boycott do it because it sucks."
"Oct 14, 2015",negative," Through an act of fan-fiction gone amok, “Twilight,” Stephenie Meyer’s tedious YA vampire-cum-romance series about restraint and crossing over, got spun into a worldwide must-read that transposed characters and tropes into the carnal taking of a fetish-driven business tycoon (some might call them vampires too), all the while butchering any sense of literary craft to an unconscionable degree. Sadly, I can attest that “Fifty Shades of Grey” the movie is better than the pages on which E.L. James swapped out fangs in favor of butt plugs – and all in time for Valentines Day. Make no mistake, the insipid, light whipping of S&M porn that sparked a wildfire among soccer moms and other unlikely segments will rake it in big at the box office. And for those saying it’s a cheap misogynistic fantasy, keep in mind it’s written by a woman and directed by a woman. Yes, there’s tons of nudity, but erotic? No. “Nine 1/2 Weeks” lived in an equally campy and tawdry place when it came out in 1986, but there the stars, Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger (actors recognized by the Academy over their careers), under the sweaty, pandering eye of Adrian Lyne, conjured up something titillating, even human, albeit inane – and there was far less nudity. Here director Sam Taylor-Johnson, who made the wonderful young John Lennon biopic “Nowhere Boy,” has leads Dakota Johnson (the offspring of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) and Irish actor Jamie Dornan (he doesn’t act, he just poses and looks good doing it) get naked as often as possible – but there’s little fire. Much of what goes on in the boudoir or Grey’s playroom (a BDSM antechamber) feels like a soft-core model shoot for a tier-two gentleman’s mag, and someone decided to let the camera roll and capture the tedium in between the postured highs. As far as the love story at the heart of “Shades,” the aloof, thinly inked title character, Christian Grey (Dornan), a reclusive billionaire, “doesn’t do romance,” ostensibly because he has intimacy issues. As a result, control and spanking are all that gets him through the night. It’s a chance encounter with the young, virginal Anastasia Steele (Johnson) during an interview for her school paper (she’s pinch-hitting for her sick roommate and armed with probing, canned inanities such as “Are you gay?”), that ignites Christian’s hope for a new sub(missive) and sets the stage for James’s reimagined pairing of Bella and Edward. Grey turns out to be a bit of a stalker, throwing gobs of green to get the gal, but he’s got rules and dark secrets (you’ll have to bear through later installments to find out) and a niggling contract he wants Ana to sign before they can fully consummate (she strikes fisting from the lengthy list of sex acts). Ana, on the other hand, resists just enough to keep the manic mogul on the hook and begins to sway him from his detached, closeted predilections. James began her opus on a fan site under the pen name “Snowqueens Icedragon” and called the series “Master of the Universe.” Ancestry matters because it trickles down. Hopefully the two quality actors caught up in this fetid fetish folderol, Marcia Gay Harden and Jennifer Ehle as the lovers’ mothers, collected sizable checks for their troubles and tarnish. The dialogue is beyond insipid (”I’m 50 shades of fucked up” or “I don’t make love; I fuck, hard”) and the timing and chemistry is nonexistent. Johnson, borrowing much of her mother’s left-of-center sexuality, gives as pleasantly a nuanced performance as one can when the role requires moans, pursed lips and an uneven mix of pushback and naive ingenue. Dornan is merely a wooden prop. About the only one who comes away unscathed is Johnson. “Shades” will likely launch her career, but then again, look what happened to Elizabeth Berkley after “Showgirls.” The other Johnson in the picture, the one behind the lens, went from a “must see what she’ll do next” to a hack, and given there are more “Grey” films in the works, the door on that now seems closed.

"Oct 14, 2015",positive," Since 2011, when the first book in E. L. James's trilogy was released, we have heard endlessly about how readers (primarily women) were consuming James's novels, even though they were written in a style that might be called ""word salad with lite-BDSM dressing."" The words were meant to make you blush — and keep reading chapter after chapter, like a competitive eater reaching for the next set of chicken wings. It comes as a surprise, then, that the filmmakers went in a completely opposite direction. The first Fifty Shades movie is a surprisingly hilarious piece of cinema that's equal parts sci-fi and romantic comedy. What began as a tale of a young woman falling in love with an older gentleman with kinky tastes has morphed and twisted in the hands of director Sam Taylor-Johnson into a story that involves a young, weather-manipulating woman who falls in love with a teleporting incubus whose greatest weakness is the banal pleasure of contract law. Our heroine, Anastasia Steele, is played by Dakota Johnson as mumbly and mousy. Physically, we're meant to see this weather witch is awkward because she sports a set of unbecoming bangs and has a penchant for dressing in a fashion that seems to be openly combative to the occasion. On the night she's supposed to ""go out,"" for instance, she wears a T-shirt. But she also, apparently, has superpowers. Throughout the film, the weather reflects Ana's mood. When she cries, the storms pour. When she's happy, the Seattle clouds separate and golden hues drape the city. And when she's sexually aroused, the sky blesses her with a gentle drizzle. It's unclear whether Steele is aware of her weather-manipulating properties in the same way it is unclear to what degree Johnson is willfully satirizing and subverting the story. One thing's clear, though: her deadpan delivery of lines like ""Are you going to make love to me now?"" or ""What is a butt plug?"" is hilarious. In the books' nascent stages, they were Twilight fan fiction. Ana was originally that series' terminally bland protagonist, Bella. But Johnson gives Ana gory bits of humanity in a deeply funny, amusingly awkward performance that recalls, of all people, Michael Cera in Superbad. Johnson's comedy is further enhanced by her paramour. Jamie Dornan plays the strange billionaire/creature known as Christian Grey. The two actors often feel like they're stuck in different films. Dornan spends much of the movie furiously knitting his brow and glaring with his cold eyes, while Johnson comically fluffs up the pensive scenes Dornan tries to ground. Though Christian has an extended family, and though he is seen driving cars and doing things normal humans do, it all just appears to be an elaborate cover, as he is really a glamorous, shadowy specter who exists beyond our comprehension. There are multiple scenes in which Grey manifests himself out of nowhere. He is not seen or heard entering houses, hardware stores, and hotels through conventional means like doors. It's not readily clear that Christian even knows what a door is. Christian offers telltale signs that he typically lives in shadows. For starters, he rides shotgun with his manservant Taylor. Everyone knows you sit in the back when being driven by your manservant. Further, Christian doesn't seem to eat a full meal in the film, though there are two semi-important dining scenes, and there is one scene where he is able to communicate with Ana while she sleeps, just by talking out loud in the same room. Grey also has the ability to text and drive at the same time without causing accidents on human roadways. Christian having a paranormal nature would also explain why he has ""singular"" tastes. He seems bound to our world by a magic document called ""the contract."" Like the sea witch in The Little Mermaid, his document  needs Ana's signature, and until it's signed it binds Grey, forbidding him to inflict harm upon others in pursuit of pleasure for himself. The enduring power of this document is what the movie wraps itself around. There is so much negotiation. All jokes aside, this alien quality is what makes Dornan so effective as Christian. Humanity seems foreign to Dornan's Christian, which makes sense for a character who could be completely empty. There are other signs Steele and Grey are living in a dystopian future. Google does not exist. Ana uses a flip phone, and at one point, she's given a new computer but not a new phone, perhaps signaling that smartphones have gone extinct. Street parking is relatively easy to find, a possible sign that cars have gone extinct, too. Grey mentions ""African charity work,"" possibly alerting us to the idea that Africa is one giant super-country now. Were these touches intentional? It's impossible to know. We do know that Taylor-Johnson and James didn't get along. Perhaps Taylor-Johnson has created one of the most elaborate, slow-baked revenge plots of history by injecting comedy and weird, almost sci-fi touches into what was meant to be a filmic adaptation of a too-self-serious pulp novel. And if those touches were intentional, it makes the film all the better, a surprising success. Seen through the lens of a sci-fi romantic comedy about a man who's barely human and the awkward woman who comes to love him, Fifty Shades is a masterpiece of subversion and dark humor — and much, much better than anything our kinky minds could have imagined.

"Aug 31, 2015",negative," E.L. James' erotic novel ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" which has been described as housewife porn, is now a movie, and it arrived just before Valentine's Day weekend. Film critic Neil Rosen filed this review. Now that is good advice to keep in mind, especially if you're one of the unfortunate souls who gets dragged to this film by your partner or date. For those unacquainted to the plot, it is about Anastasia, a virginal, naive college student being pursued by Christian Grey, a hunky millionaire corporate titan who has a thing for sadomasochist sex. The bulk of the storyline revolves around Christian's attempts to get Anastasia to sign a written contract. That document will give him permission to do all kinds of kinky dominant activities with his new submissive slave. The book was trashy, but the movie tries to elevate that content to high art, and is so vanilla that the results are a disaster. The filmmakers have watered down both the tone and racy sexual content of the source material to such a large degree that people attracted to the sexual aspect of the novel will be sorely disappointed. Romance fans are also out of luck as the characters are undeveloped and cartoonish. So is the story line, and the two main actors have little chemistry. We care nothing about their fate. Dakota Johnson, the real life daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, has a certain spark and she occasionally rises above the awful material. But Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey does only perfunctory work. One day, it may become a bad movie/cult classic - the kind of film that people go to laugh at, like Showgirls. But for now, it's so boring it feels endless, and with two more sequels probably on the way, the only people getting truly tortured here is the audience."

It isn’t difficult to argue that Fifty Shades of Grey is “better than the book”. EL James’ excruciatingly bad prose sets an extremely low bar. But the silk purse crafted out of that sow’s ear by director Sam Taylor-Johnson, cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, screenwriter Kelly Marcel and stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan is unexpectedly delightful. Fifty Shades the movie is playful – and not just in the sense that its title character maintains a ‘playroom’ stocked with ‘toys’. While it incorporates many of the ‘moments’ that fans are fetishistically anticipating – the micromanaging author made sure of that – the film treats them skeptically. Its best creative decision was jettisoning the book’s moronic interior monologue and observing its characters with wry affection. Despite the pre-release speculation that stars Johnson and Dornan hate each other, onscreen they’re charming enough together. Dornan is left largely to brood, while Johnson sparkles; but together they produce something disarmingly funny, like a comedy of capitalist manners. Fifty Shades is best compared to 1990’s Pretty Woman. A repressed billionaire tycoon proposes a business agreement with a free-spirited woman to provide escort services for a week. “Holy shit!” she cries, once the deal is sealed. Aided by discreet henchmen, to an eclectic pop soundtrack, he showers her with expensive gifts and spirits her away on surprise excursions. He confesses his childhood psychic wounds. And she rescues him right back. The similarity even extends to a scene where the tortured hero expresses his feels via melancholy midnight piano playing, only to be seductively interrupted when the heroine trails out of bed. Like Pretty Woman, Fifty Shades collapses the corporate and the corporeal, the libidinal and consumer economies. That capitalism turns every human experience into a commodity to be traded – and that we already know and live under these conditions – makes this a conservative rather than a subversive story. Its audience appeal is based on capitalist fantasies about using one’s wealth to dominate others, not subcultural fantasies of finding freedom through sexual surrender. How the tycoon Christian Grey (Dornan) actually produces his wealth remains hazy; the film is only interested insofar as it allows virginal Anastasia Steele (Johnson) to interview him awkwardly for her college newspaper, replacing her sick housemate Kate (Eloise Mumford). In a classic screwball meet-cute, Ana stumbles across the threshold of Christian’s office, and blithely quizzes him on whether he’s gay. It’s the best satire on interviewing since Notting Hill. Johnson gives Ana an almost somnolently diffident voice and an engagingly startled, gawky physicality, peeping from under a shaggy boho fringe. Fifty Shades began as Twilight fanfic; but unlike that story, in which a creepy stalker inexplicably decides a boring teenager is ‘special’, we instantly grasp why Ana might intrigue Christian. To this prematurely jaded businessman, her innocence is a greenfield worth tapping. Yet her alert self-reliance warns us – and teases Christian – that she won’t meekly take his ‘punishment’. Taylor-Johnson and McGarvey shoot the luxurious bubble – or prison – in which Christian dwells in a glamorous, impersonal way, fresh from an interiors magazine. His vast office (peopled by grey-uniformed babes) and his split-level Seattle penthouse, done up in marble, leather and satin, amplify the film’s signature colour to the point of absurdity – although I couldn’t help noticing that Christian’s bedsheets are the same colour as those of Michael Fassbender’s sex-addict character in Shame. However, in a welcome departure from the book’s fawning surrender to commodity fetishism, Ana is wary of Christian’s unsolicited, expensive gestures – especially the way he summarily replaces her quirky Volkswagen Beetle with a new Audi the colour of a popped cherry. The film’s McGuffin is the ‘binding’ contract Christian wants Ana to sign. Their ‘negotiations’ are mischievous exercises of equal agency rather than a hostile takeover. A ‘business meeting’ sequence, beautifully shot under red-tinged light in Christian’s office, had my preview audience in stitches as various sex acts are “duly noted” and ruled out with phallic grey pencils. At the screening I attended, guests were given special tie-in ice creams coated in grey-tinted chocolate. Once you bit down, though, the ice cream was vanilla, surrounded by a layer of treacle. It’s apropos. This isn’t really a BDSM story, like Secretary, The Piano Teacher or Nymphomaniac. It’s not interested in why someone would freely choose sexual submission. Instead, the contents of Christian’s Red Room of Pain seem to function as abstract symbols of Ana’s sexual awakening. They’re sex toys in the same sense that Christian is a ‘billionaire’ and Ana is an ‘English literature major’. Rather than offering specific sensations, they merely communicate that something ‘kinky’ and ‘unusual’ is afoot. What people seem to love about the Fifty Shades story is the much more conventional fantasy that a woman can redeem and tame a damaged man. Christian’s sexual inclinations are explained purely as residual trauma from his exploitation by unseen cruel older women. Even David Cronenberg’s flawed A Dangerous Method doesn’t resort to such easy psychoanalysis. And it’s unconvincing. “I don’t make love,” avows Christian, “I fuck. Hard.” Yet it’s striking how comparatively Mr Whippy-soft the sex scenes are. They’re well within Hollywood’s mainstream erotic vocabulary of elevator clinches, silhouetted kisses, heads ecstatically thrown back, a tasteful butt shot or two, and fingers and tongues trailing down naked torsos. All soundtracked to swooning power ballads. Filmed montage-style, the sex scenes are cunningly edited to suggest far more than they actually depict. And Taylor-Johnson and McGarvey do wring out a few striking moments. The hairs on Ana’s thighs silhouetted golden in the light. Seattle rain from Christian’s apartment windows projected sinuously on the wall behind the couple. But while the camera feasts on Johnson’s nudity (pleasingly, Ana actually has pubes), it refuses to make a similarly voluptuous spectacle of Dornan’s. Apart from one tantalising fly-unzipping shot, Christian’s lower body is almost always shrouded in denim mystery. Perhaps this is intended to represent the control Christian exerts “in all things”; but it’s also easy to read as a denial of the female gaze. Viewers will find themselves instead fixated on Dornan’s extremely handsome face and penetrating grey-eyed gaze. His performance is cold, controlled, and kind of dull – except for two scenes. One, perhaps the film’s most touching, has Christian and Ana take a euphoric glider joyflight. Unseen by each another, they surrender to their joy as the glider loops gracefully through the sky. The second, Christian’s climactic, deal-breaking whipping of Ana, may be held up as ‘problematic’ by those who argue Fifty Shades glamorises abusive relationships. That’s not quite fair, as the filmmakers carefully emphasise the consensual nature of everything depicted, including this. And it’s the first time we see Christian truly indulging his own pleasure, aroused from both icy capitalist cliché and solicitous tenderness, quivering, gasping and perspiring as he wields the belt. That this is represented as ‘a bridge too far’ annoys me, since it’s the film’s most interesting moment, awakening new power and determination in Ana and making Christian vulnerable in a way no moonlit piano jams and bedside confessions can do.

"Aug 11, 2015",negative," I’ve only read enough of the book to appreciate the awfulness of E.L. James’ writing. Still, as you’ve heard unless you’re completely cut off from the culture, the book is about English-lit grad student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) meeting telecom billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and discovering the taste for sadomasochism lurking behind the young mogul’s carefully groomed façade. Okay, I think I know why this caught on even though it’s crap. This is the fairy tale about a damsel being rescued by a rich, handsome prince, only to discover that the prince is actually a severely damaged little boy deep down inside, and he needs some saving himself. It’s childish fantasy, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned about movies, it’s that they wouldn’t exist without childish fantasies. The way this film works its archetypes is reasonably clever, though I would point out that Pretty Woman worked exactly the same way 24 years and 11 months ago.  One of the good things about the Fifty Shades fever is that it has made lots of people dig up Steven Shainberg’s 2002 film Secretary and pointed out all the ways it’s superior to the current movie. Secretary is a masterpiece of a unique sort. It’s the only movie I’ve ever seen that made me feel like I understood more about what BDSM practitioners get out of their sexual practices. The characters in that film are also majorly messed-up people, but their S&M relationship seems to fill their psychic needs and heal them in some way. The male character in Secretary is also named Grey, interestingly enough. The movie also has the strangest masturbation fantasy sequence I’ve ever seen. I mean, office documents are involved. Sadly, I couldn’t find it online. I Googled “secretary masturbation fantasy.” You can imagine what came up. The other movie that this reminded me of is A Dangerous Method, a talky piece that I nevertheless found interesting, and one that features Michael Fassbender spanking Keira Knightley until she achieves orgasm. I’d recommend that movie over this one. Fifty Shades is surprisingly funny, in a way that the book is not. The first hour or so plays like a romantic comedy to a large extent. Christian surprises Anastasia by turning up at the hardware store where she works, and it’s funny when she gasps in surprise. (On the other hand, the fourth time it happens, the joke has gotten old.) Funnier still is the early scene when she gets a call from him at a nightclub and drunkenly makes fun of his moodiness: “Come here! I want you! No, no! Go away!” Still, the moment when Anastasia walks out into a rainstorm after her first meeting with Christian and takes a deep breath in while getting pelted by the rain? That’s when the alarm bells started ringing in my head. There’s no chemistry between the actors, and I think it’s on Dornan. He seems to miss the neuroses that drive this man. Anastasia’s early description of Christian is “really intense and intimidating,” and I got neither of those things from the actor. Dakota Johnson (the real-life daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, and whom you saw as the Stanford girl introducing Justin Timberlake to Facebook in The Social Network) falls short in some of the more emotional scenes, but she still shows enough that I’d be interested to see her in non-Grey material.  The sex scenes don’t interest me. (Actually, most sex scenes in movies don’t interest me, but that’s another issue.) Director Sam Taylor-Johnson, who previously made Nowhere Boy, fumbles the first one severely, switching between shots of Ana’s head lying at the left of the screen and shots of her head at the right of the screen, with no reason. It’s a challenge to make a film interesting when so much of it is taken up with sex scenes, and Taylor-Johnson seems to sense it. She tries to introduce character developments with successive ones. They don’t take, though. Hard to say what Anastasia sees in Christian. I mean, he’s ridiculously handsome and rich, sure, but he also has no sense of humor and fears spontaneity. What fun is this guy? Call him a jerk or a commitmentphobe or an abuser or a bad BDSM practitioner, but as a fictional character, he’s something worse than all of those things. He’s a bore, and that’s probably why the film intensely bored me during its latter half. What else? Damn, did Anastasia and Christian really spend all that screen time negotiating the terms of the sex contract he wanted her to sign? And did it all really end with them deciding that the contract didn’t matter? What a waste of time! Also, there’s two postcoital scenes where Christian goes to his grand piano and plays pieces by Bach and Chopin. These are cheesy enough as it is, but as a classical music guy, I also noticed that Jamie Dornan’s attempts to mime playing the piano are really bad. The way he bobs up and down on the Bach piece is totally fake. On the bright side, I saw a bunch of trailers for female-centric movies coming up, some of which I was excited for (Pitch Perfect 2), some I was intrigued by (Aloha), and some I was depressed by (The Longest Ride). Seeing so many films about women promoted in one place was a refreshing change from my usual moviegoing experience."
"Jun 27, 2015",negative,"When Christian sweeps the demure Anastasia off her feet and into his world of penthouse-and-helicopter luxury and sadomasochistic sex, what lies in store is two hours-plus of glossy tedium."
"Jun 9, 2015",negative," Tantalizingly not terrible for the first hour or so, director Sam Taylor-Johnson’s adaptation of E.L. James’ literary atrocity will presumably shatter box office records and launch a thousand think-pieces over this coming weekend. The fact that Fifty Shades Of Grey is not unwatchable is a massive credit to the film’s creative team, spawned as this all was from a floating Internet chunk of pervy Twilight fan-fiction by a writer calling herself “Snowqueens Icedragon,” before professional publishers showed up with a seven-figure deal and then your struggling neighborhood bookstore lived to fight another day just because everybody’s Mom was suddenly cool with being seen reading porn in public. Hey, whatever works. Personally I prefer my erotica penned by someone at least slightly conversant in the English language, but as that old album title boasted: 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can’t Be Wrong. Besides, I spend fifty-one weeks a year watching and reviewing infantile male fantasies about a bunch of dudes dressing up in spandex punching and/or shooting each other. At least the rare female counterpoint has some fucking. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson – a renowned photographer and installation artist one might consider above helming this sort of LiveJournal smut – seems to have had the semi-brilliant idea to play Fifty Shades for the most part as a rather happy, horny comedy. She’s got a remarkable lead in Dakota Johnson (offspring of Sonny Crockett and Melanie Griffith), who assays the thankless lead role not as the empty, wimpering simp of James’ so-called novels but instead as a delectably awkward, natural born comedienne coming (sorry) into her own as a sexual being and digging it. For those lucky enough not to have aunts who drink too much and tell you about these dreadful books all the time, Dakota’s Anastasia Steele is a shy, virginal college senior attracting the attention of twenty-seven-year-old billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan, awful) during a botched student newspaper interview. He falls madly in love, whisking her around Seattle (even the locations in this movie are low-rent) in his private helicopter, boinking a bit while withholding true intimacy. Baby’s got a secret. Christian has a bad past, and he’s also got a rather hilariously outfitted porno Batcave torture chamber in his house. The only way he’ll keep seeing Anastasia socially is if she signs an amusingly plain-spoken contract agreeing to live there as his sex slave, under consensual stipulations. (Anal fisting is off the table, we sadly learn during the negotiations.) This is all bugfuck insanity, and much to the credit of Johnson and Johnson (see what I did there) they play it as such. Dakota has inherited her mom Melanie Griffith’s good-humored sexuality, “with a head for business and a bod for sin,” she seems down for anything. Buzzfeed and other outlets are harping on the fact that she actually has pubic hair (I’m old enough to remember when everybody did) but I was more taken with the way Taylor-Johnson shoots the big “deflowering scene” – because of course Anastasia didn’t shave her legs that morning. You don’t see that kind of detail in many movies. There’s a really funny, sexy comedy in this big-screen version of Fifty Shades Of Grey that would probably have been wonderful were it not also stuck with being an adaptation of the loathsome novel Fifty Shades Of Grey. After Anastasia finally asserts her dominance over Christian’s head-games and allows him to take her in his torture chamber on her own terms (a theoretically heroic sequence neutered by so many sleazy dissolve shots it looks like an off episode of Red Shoe Diaries) the film sheepishly backs away and makes everything BAD. Like scolding, Puritanical BAD. It gets all ugly and betrays Anastasia’s character as she chastises Christian, calling him disgusting at the cliffhanger finale. Nothing about the last half hour matches up with the rest of the film, and it keeps with E.L. James’ craptastic illiteracy and lack of understanding about whatever it was she thought she was writing about, if she thought about it at all. You’re suddenly being taunted for everything you came here to get off on, and being a good sport enough to try and roll with this movie’s absurd fantasy earns you the wagging finger of shame. One hears horror stories about no-talent E.L. James barging around this set of this film and yeah, the Internet really has ruined everything. Francis Ford Coppola gutted more than half of The Godfather to make one of the greatest movies of all time, but these days Twitter fans would be complaining that he left out Lucy Mancini’s vagina operation. Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner upended American Psycho into a kinda brilliant satire, while Clint Eastwood performed some insane alchemy on The Bridges Of Madison County – a wonderful film that was, hands-down, the worst book I’d ever read, before I read Fifty Shades Of Grey."
"May 30, 2015",negative," The E.L. James bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey is famous for bringing BDSM sex into the trash-novel mainstream, but this adaptation from director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy) is just a sleek and dull piece of lifestyle porn. Taylor-Johnson seems far more interested in fetishizing sports cars and tailored suits than whips and chains, and the vanilla sex scenes quickly become monotonous and familiar, offering the same oblique, candlelit tracking shots of undulating body parts that we've been getting for decades. This isn't the next Basic Instinct; it's the next Sliver. Dakota Johnson stars as virginal lip-biter Anastasia Steele, and Jamie Dornan plays the mysterious Christian Grey, a Seattle tech billionaire who entices Anastasia to become his sexual submissive. Both actors are trapped by the rigid banality of their characters, and they fail to manufacture any chemistry—without that heat, this is just a story about a contract negotiation. D.B."
"May 7, 2015",negative," It’s one of those phenomena that seemed to come out of nowhere. All of a sudden there was a book called “Fifty Shades of Grey” and everyone was reading it. Basically thought of as something of a “naughty” book, it quickly gained a reputation for being rather raunchy with its depictions of unusual sexual acts, and thus it became the topic of gossip in a multitude of literary circles. With such popularity, it’s hardly a surprise that someone would snatch up the film rights and try to bring the worldwide sensation to the screen, taking a rather big risk in the process. Where does one even begin when trying to adapt a novel that is known primarily for its sex scenes into a film? Fans of the book would no doubt think of this question almost immediately, though it would hardly stop them from wanting to see the end product. However, for everyone else, it just might have been an early indicator for just what kind of film that end product would be. As the film opens, we meet Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a literature major who is conducting an interview with millionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for her sick roommate Kate (Eloise Mumford). The interview is a little awkward to say the least as Ana is a little intimidated by Christian, but he is taken with her almost immediately. Visiting her at work and “rescuing” her from a bar, he finds any excuse to be near her. She is hesitant at first, but she too finds herself wanting this relationship to happen. As the two spend more and more time together, Ana finds out just what kind of relationship that Christian is into. He doesn’t do flowers, cards, movies, dinner, etc., but rather something else altogether that many would find completely off-putting. However, Ana ends up being somewhat intrigued by the odd physical nature of what it is that Christian likes to do, but how far is she willing to go to make it work? There are no doubt many who wanted to see this film come to fruition, if only to see how on Earth it could be done. However, in trying to bring this story to the screen, the filmmakers seem to have ignored the fact that, fundamentally, the film doesn’t work in the first place due to there not being an actual solid plot to move it along (Keep in mind, I’m strictly discussing the film as I’m one of the few who did not read E.L. James’ novel). It appears to want to be about the relationship between these two people who clearly have some major issues that need to be worked out, but if this was the original intent, then having them be nothing but flat, lifeless characters that could have come from any cheap romance novel off the supermarket shelf doesn’t do it any favors.  For its two-hour runtime, we never get the sense that we are watching actual people, but rather cardboard stand-ins that are perfunctorily going through the motions of these sexual acts. Aside from this, if the filmmakers are looking to elicit sympathy for these “damaged” characters, having them be into some rather disturbing behavior is not the best way to go about it. Sure, there may be a small niche that finds that appealing, but it’s more likely to push away the majority of the audience even more. So what is it that “Fifty Shades of Grey” truly wants to be? A romance? There’s not much of anything that you could call “romantic” throughout the film, especially as you get into the later scenes. A character drama? Such a film requires character development, an element this film sorely lacks, or at the very least a reason to care about what these two are going through, another aspect which the film fails at. What we’re left with is a film that is little more than a string of sex scenes thrown together in hopes of scintillating the audience.  This result may be enough for those who were looking for nothing more than a soft porn flick, but anyone looking for even the slightest bit more than that is doomed to be disappointed. Again, I’ve never read the novel, so perhaps it has a lot more plot and character development to it, but if we’re to believe that this is an accurate representation of it, then it would appear that it was best left on the shelf, or perhaps in the hands of fans who at least got a little excitement from reading it. Whether the problems sprung directly from James’ book or whether something got lost in the transition, this is an adaptation that simply doesn’t evoke any of the emotions that it so desperately wants to convey. “Fifty Shades of Grey” makes its Blu-ray debut in a 2.40:1, 1080p High Definition transfer that features a perfectly crisp and clear picture, which allows you to see everything you’re intended to, even for the darkest and most explicit of scenes. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is also flawless, giving everything from the dialogue to the soundtrack in excellent quality. Overall, there’s not a single complaint to be had in either area. The World of Fifty Shades of Grey: A collection of short featurettes that explore the characters, actors, and more, featuring interviews with the cast and crew. If you’re interested in going deeper into these areas, then you might find it of interest. At the very least, you get a good chuckle when they try to discuss how “complex” the characters are. Behind the Shades: A “Making of” featurette that includes lots of interviews with the cast and crew, who discuss the process of bringing the movie to life. Whether you end up liking the film or not, it’s still pretty interesting to watch. E.L. James & Fifty Shades: A brief look at how the novel first came about and its transition to film. (Special note: James mentions that her inspiration for writing came from reading Stephanie Meyer’s “Twilight.” Let that sink in for a moment.) Fifty Shades: The Pleasure of Pain: A look behind the scenes of the film with the BDSM (Bondage/Domination/Sadism/Masochism) consultant. Again, if it’s an area that interests you, you may find it worth exploring. When you take a close look at “Fifty Shades of Grey,” it becomes painfully clear that it’s basically a plethora of sex scenes strung together with a bare minimum of support. However, even within that support, we see only random reasons for these two characters to find themselves together continuously. Granted, this film was most likely not put together with things like plot and characters being primary concerns, but because of that, the filmmakers need to take responsibility for the resulting product, which is a soft porn flick with nothing else to offer. Surprisingly enough, there are two more of these films on the way, so perhaps that is where the characters truly come alive… or we could simply be getting more of the same. Only time will tell as this directionless sexual odyssey continues."
"Apr 23, 2015",negative,It's pretend bondage. Caffeine-free Diet BDSM.
"Apr 13, 2015",negative," I can’t believe I watched a movie based off this Twilight fanfiction I read a few years ago. It’s a bit surreal, but mostly ridiculous that Fifty Shades of Grey has turned into practically the same worldwide phenomenon as Twilight. And just like Twilight, it raises controversy and starts hot debates on feminism, abuse, sex and more. The TYF staff will be getting more into the nitty-gritty of Fifty Shades of Grey in our Four-Play Discussion of the film later this week. There’s a lot to address there, and it’s not something I’ll be getting too in-depth with in this review. Rather, this will be my thoughts of the technical aspects of Fifty Shades of Grey. If you’ve been living under a rock for the past year, Fifty Shades of Grey follows Anastasia Steele and her relationship with a young billionaire CEO, Christian Grey. From the moment she walks into the building, Ana’s homely appearance is a stark contrast to the perfect, sleek world of Grey Enterprises. But Christian is fascinated by her, and she’s definitely fascinated by him. So much so that she’s willing to deal with his standoff behavior and mysterious past. What she doesn’t bargain for is that Christian isn’t interested in a normal relationship. If there’s one thing this movie proves to us, it’s that Dakota Johnson is a natural. She plays Ana to the T, wide-eyed, quiet, and inquisitive. Even in some of the bondage scenes, which I can only imagine how uncomfortable those can be, she gives it her all. I found that Johnson’s portrayal of Ana made the character more intriguing than the book ever did. As for Christian Grey, well… I knew whoever took on that role wouldn’t have an easy time with it. Grey is pretty polarizing and some of the stuff he says is so ridiculous that I can’t imagine any real person saying his lines without dying a little inside by how grossly cheesy and pseudo-intense they can be. Unfortunately, Jamie Dornan doesn’t muster that right kind of intensity on the big screen. Sure, he’s attractive, but the stuff (the non-sexual stuff, that is) that had readers swooning was absent on-screen. It’s not so much Dornan’s fault, who proved he’s a capable actor with his incredible work on The Fall. If the script only deviated from source material, a better movie would have resulted. Nothing about the film is spectacular. The script, which follows the book too closely, doesn’t allow the story to play out effectively. We’re stuck with E.L. James’ mundane plotting and frustrating characterizations. What makes it even more disappointing is that director Sam Taylor-Wood gives the film no visual or stylistic flair. Not only does it have a boring script, but the directing was too. It’s rare when a movie is better than a book, but in this case, only because this movie is better than its source material doesn’t mean it’s good. There’s a lot going on in Fifty Shades of Grey, but this movie doesn’t skim the surface of it. It’s as shallow as the book, and it’s sort of odd that a movie as un-romantic as this one is dominating the Valentine’s Day Weekend Box Office. After seeing this movie, I’ve had some great conversation with friends and fellow movie-goers about it. If there’s anything truly good about Fifty Shades of Grey, it has people talking about important and serious issues. The staff will be diving into these issues this coming week; stay tuned!

"Mar 27, 2015",negative,"If they added foreboding opening and closing monologues by David Duchovny, the whole thing could easily be mistaken for a long-lost episode of Red Shoe Diaries."
"Mar 18, 2015",negative,"Johnson brings some wonder and vulnerability to her part, but even with a listenable soundtrack, the song that most comes to mind is Peggy Lee's ""Is That All There Is?"""
"Mar 16, 2015",positive,"Grey may be crass and calculated, but Johnson saves it from being completely forgettable."
"Mar 7, 2015",positive,"Without the baggage of having read the book, the synopsis or even the film's Wikipedia page, Fifty Shades of Grey unspools as a surprisingly engaging story about sexual naivety, concepts of consent and, ultimately, power."
"Mar 2, 2015",positive," “I like various physical pursuits,” purrs a gray-suited man behind a sleek, expensive desk. Christian Grey looks unblinkingly into the eyes of his interviewer, a bashful English Lit major with a flowery blouse hidden under a blue sweater and a navy skirt draped casually over the edges of a pricy chair. Anastasia Steele stumbles through the rest of her interview before meekly retreating through the reception area and into the corporate elevator. Mr. Grey mentions something about seeing her again, but then elevator doors close between them, cutting their gaze. This is one of the opening scenes to the wildly popular big screen adaptation of E.L. James’ book, “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Call them star-cross or contractually-bonded lovers; self-made millionaire Grey falls for Steele shortly after their fateful office meeting. He can’t and won’t let her go. As he becomes extremely possessive and demanding, Steele reciprocates the attraction and begins to fall for him. That is, until Grey reveals his darker sexual urges.  The virginal Steele must now decide between trying out kink with her rough new lover, or walk away. The film trims its former “Twilight” fan fiction source’s 514 pages to a svelte two hour and five minute movie. Although much of the racier content may have been discarded for rating’s sake, much of the cringe-worthy dialog remains intact. Opening shots channel “The Great Gatsby,"" differentiating Anastasia’s middle-class millennial normalcy from Christian’s obscene wealth and luxurious lifestyle. When their worlds collide, Ana is easily absorbed as everything from her personal style, car and laptop are replaced to Christian’s standards. Apart from her relationship, Ana shows very little interest in the outside world and never voices concerns about her future. Actress Dakota Johnson brings humor, sensitivity and vulnerability to Anastasia, making her the clear breakout performance of “Fifty Shades.” Johnson holds onto Anastasia’s bubbly energy and plays with the power dynamics of her character’s troubled relationship. Her body language shifts from shy and insecure to ashamed of her dirty deeds to tapping into her “inner goddess” and confidently rocking her normal-looking body. Johnson is not made up to look like a porn star: we see hair on her legs, untrimmed pubic hair and wearing very little makeup for most of the movie. The audible gasps in my audience over her first nude scene were a sign of how little we see un-plucked and un-waxed women engaging in and enjoying sex. Unfortunately, Mr. Grey’s Jamie Dornan does not equally rise to the occasion. With a special clause to shade his privates from the camera, Dornan never seems to be at ease with the explicit nature of the movie. He doesn’t relish his character’s highs and lows, leaving the audience to beg for more acting chops. Dornan wears the suit well but sometimes disappears into its folds on the way to becoming America’s next top sex symbol. His distanced energy leaves the bulk of the chemistry to be sparked by Johnson’s ingénue. It's just a tad unsatisfying to watch as he cruelly manipulates her for little to no reward. Speaking of sex, the troubling sexual politics of the source material was muted in order to score the coveted R rating. Each sex scene is differently shot to show the couple in various stages of the relationship. Ana’s deflowering is the darkest lit scene as she is slowly and seductively brought into the light. A rougher afternoon tryst goes from warm, sunny afternoon to an evening with an unpleasant ultimatum. Only one of the two sex room scenes (unclimactically named “The Playroom”) plays it campy, complete with the bass-ridden Beyoncé theme song. A third scene in The Playroom is borderline abusive, and brings to mind the question Ana has been grappling with since the beginning: should she stay or go? “Fifty Shades of Grey” is keen on details thanks to director Sam Taylor-Johnson. With only one previous feature under her belt, 2009’s young John Lennon biopic “Nowhere Boy,” Taylor-Johnson has now proven she can handle the sticky subjects, an opinionated author, and protect the story from becoming the butt end of a bad joke. Her visual style lends itself well to the big studio production and allows for great subtle side moments to occur outside the central relationship, like Ana and her roommate Kate’s (Eloise Mumford) relationship and Ana’s strained connection with her mom. As of now, Taylor-Johnson is attached to direct the next two sequels, which could very well make her one of the highest grossing women directors in history so long as creators don’t pull a “Twilight” stunt and hire a male director instead."
"Mar 1, 2015",negative,A monumentally boring motion picture.
"Feb 27, 2015",negative,"Who would have thought, a Twilight ripoff actually being inferior to its already inferior inspiration."
"Feb 27, 2015",positive," It is finally here, the swooningly anticipated movie version of Fifty Shades of Grey, the book that millions read but far fewer were caught doing it. And you know what? Director Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie isn't nearly as terrible as E.L. James' novel would make you expect. There's perverted, like the sado-masochistic sex games played by tycoon Christian Grey, and then there's perverse, like the pleasure of watching trash so glossily compacted. Christian (Jamie Dornan) made his fortune doing something unexplained, except he shouts on a cellphone about 24-hour ultimatums. It's a lush, lonely existence with a single, sensual palette: gray suits, ties and luxury cars. Christian probably pays God to keep the Seattle skies outside his penthouse the color of slate. He is, in the parlance of our time, quite the catch. But there's a catch. Christian is one chainsaw shy of American Psycho, with an S&M playroom and a sexual history that might make Sigmund Freud weep. Not the most interesting man in the world, but certainly among the kinkiest. Dornan also plays a serial killer on BBC's The Fall, and there's a dash of Dexter in his deadpan perversion here. He never takes himself too handsomely, even when undressed. Despite Christian's dominance, Dornan is an anatomically correct sex doll with bling accessories for Taylor-Johnson to pose and sighing viewers to take home in their dreams. Don't take him seriously and nobody gets hurt. Into Christian's fabulously wealthy world tumbles Anastasia (Dakota Johnson), a college senior helping her sick roomie with a campus newspaper project. He immediately spots her as a potential submissive who will bend to his kinky desires. Something about the way she shyly pokes her lips with the pencil he loans her, the one with his name embossed on it. Chicks dig that. Before long, Christian is impressing Ana with expensive gifts and helicopter rides. He proposes that she move in with him, into a bedroom she can't leave without his permission, waiting for his command to be sexually dominated to the point of needing a safe word. There's some paperwork to fill out. It's complicated. That's when Fifty Shades of Grey finally gets around to the reason we're here, the naughty, nekkid parts that James' readers dog-eared. Not all of them, of course, or else Lars von Trier could make two movies. An R rating for the adaptation of a triple-X book is a clue to the rough stuff skipped. Still, Taylor-Johnson and her actors go further than usual for a major studio production, in skin, spanking and thrusts. Soft core porn, filmed prettier than life. Christian's infamous Red Room displays far more intimidating sadism tools than the script employs. There's a gentle hand on the riding crop, and all but six spanks (Ana counts them) are just love taps. Johnson is the best thing about Fifty Shades of Grey, an average beauty with awkward allure: the girl imprisoned next door. The actor and screenwriter Kelly Marcel make Ana less of a pushover than James wrote. She holds her own with Christian in the movie's best non-erotic scenes, a contract negotiation over what can be put where and when, and a blackout cliffhanger that had viewers groaning from premature evacuation. Those moments put Ana on equal footing with Christian, even when she's strapped down prone. That's vital to any movie romance, with or without the flogs. Fifty Shades of Grey isn't the howling pornucopia it could be, but it's sexy enough, spank you very much.

Fifty Shades Of Grey is, without doubt, going to be one of the year’s most talked about releases.  Those who want to see it, will be telling you how much they want to see it.  Those who don’t want to see it, will be telling you how much they don’t want to see it.  Those in my Twitter feed tonight seemed to fall into the latter category. 
For those living in the dark, Fifty Shades Of Grey is the first in a trilogy of novels that was first published in 2011.  Writer Erika Mitchell, going by the pen name of E.L. James, was as surprised as anyone when her books became so popular.  Within a matter of years, she’d gone from writing Twilight fanfiction… to an author who had sold more than 70 million copies around the world. 
This first instalment, brought to the screen by director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy) and writer Kelly Marcel (Saving Mr Banks), is ultimately two hours of seduction.  Anastasia Steele is a shy, bashful, 21-year-old college student studying literature.  Christian Grey (Dornan) is a strong, influential, 27-year-old entrepreneur who has already has a net wealth exceeding one billion dollars. 
The two meet thanks to a curious twist of fate.  What follows is a love story very different from what we usually see out of Hollywood.  Christian clearly has feelings for Ana but he also has a series of peculiar ground rules.  He refuses to be romantic, he won’t go out for dinner, and he even makes Ana sign a non-disclosure agreement preventing her from discussing their relationship. 
You might think Ana would be running for the hills but not so.  Thanks to his chiselled good looks and mysterious personality, she decides to stick around and get to know him a little better.  It’s around the 45 minute mark where we get treated to the “big reveal”.  After dancing around the subject for days, Christian tells Ana that he’s into a bit of kink.  His luxurious apartment features a “playroom” which a wide assortment whips, paddles, cuffs, toys and pretty much anything else you can imagine. 
Just as he operates in the business world, Christian likes being in control.  He seeks a relationship with Ana where he acts the dominant and she serves as the submissive.  There’s a humorous scene where the pair sit in a boardroom and flesh out terms for a contract!  It will outline exactly what Christian will have the power to do inside the playroom. 
The subject matter is intriguing.  I’ll say that much.  I’ve commented several times recently that sex seems to be a subject that is avoided in today’s mainstream films.  Not only does Fifty Shades Of Grey feature several sex scenes, it goes a step further and takes inside the world of S&M.  As to the nature of the scenes, Taylor-Johnson seems to have found a middle ground.  There’s plenty of nudity… but also a number of quick-paced edits to ensure the film snuck through with an MA rating (as opposed to R). 
Perhaps I should be blaming the novel but my biggest grip with the film was that I didn’t find the two leading characters all that interesting.  Christian keeps pushing and saying she should give in to his desires.  Ana keeps flip-flopping.  One minute she’s acting life a shocked, naïve, innocent school girl.  The next she’s refuting Christian’s advances and wisely giving him a taste of his own medicine.  The supporting cast, which includes Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden, don’t get a chance to do much. 
Marketed heavily towards female audiences and released just in time for Valentine’s Day, I’d expect this film to be doing big business at the international box-office over the next few weeks.  Two sequels are planned and so this won’t be the last we’ll hear of Christian and Anastasia."
"Feb 22, 2015",negative," In this movie, the wealthy John Gray mesmerizes a woman into doing his intimate bidding — ice cubes, blindfold and all — and pushes her to limits she never imagined. I’m talking, of course, about “9½ Weeks” from 1986. This was a movie (starring Mickey Rourke as Gray, with Kim Basinger as his lover) that stirred up a lot of controversy and arguments over its sexual content. Here we go again with “Fifty Shades of Grey,” which, in 2015, has the benefit of social networks to create an incredible amount of publicity as well as arguments pro and con. Jamie Dorman (“Marie Antoinette”) is Christian Grey, a gazillionaire in his 20s who is ready to be interviewed by college student Kate (Eloise Mumford), who becomes ill and dispatches her roommate, Anastasia (Dakota Johnson, “Need for Speed”), to do the interview instead. When Ana and Christian meet, they are attracted to each other. He’s worldly, handsome and powerful; she’s mousy, flustered and enchanted by him. Christian tells her he wants to be intimate, but not in love, and he wants it on his terms so much that he asks her to sign a contract saying she will serve as the submissive to his dominant. The script contains intentionally funny moments, which are numerous and enjoyable at the beginning of the film. Johnson, known mostly for being the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, giggles her way through this, coming across more like a schoolgirl than a college student. Dorman, whose abs are the focus of many scenes, undresses Johnson a lot. Still, there’s very little chemistry between these two, and I didn’t care one whit about either vapid character. This one is shallow, and it conveys a strong message about good looks and money: I kept wondering whether Ana would have endured what Christian dishes out if he had been an average-looking guy with a minimum-wage job. And a brief anecdote from Christian’s past is cringe-worthy ... ew. It does have a splendid soundtrack, with a Danny Elfman score and songs by the likes of Beyonce and Annie Lennox. If you just have to see this, please note that it’s not an entire movie. It’s based on the first book in a series, so to see how the story ends, you’ll also need to see the upcoming sequel(s)."
"Feb 20, 2015",neutral," I went to Fifty Shades of Grey prepared to mock it mercilessly. But over the course of last weekend, something happened. As I skimmed the 50,000 cultural commentaries that dissected Fifty Shades as the definitive statement on female sexuality, soccer moms' sexuality, the sexual revolution, modern depravity, mainstream cluelessness about alternative sexuality and on and on, I found myself agreeing more and more with an erotica writer I interviewed last week. Not a fan of E.L. James' best-selling series, she nonetheless wished everybody would ""shut up about it."" ""It's a fantasy!"" she said, exasperated. ""It's pretend."" Indeed. And maybe we shouldn't judge people by the content of their fantasies, whether those fantasies involve remorseless, scot-free murder (the focus of many an action flick) or getting tied up by a dreamy billionaire. Because fantasy is such a private thing, however, the transition from page to screen always involves directorial interpretation and contact with cold realities. Idealized characters must be replaced with real actors, vague settings with concrete ones. Movies also target a wider audience than books, so it's worth asking how it feels to view Fifty Shades when its fantasy is not your own. In my experience, the film is sometimes boring to a non-fan. Sometimes confusing. As pretty as an upscale home-furnishings catalogue. And not nearly as squirm inducing or giggle-worthy as expected. Let's address ""boring"" first. As everyone probably knows by now, once upon a time there was a naïve college senior named Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) who met a big, bad, ridiculously handsome billionaire with intimacy issues. Instantly smitten, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) buys her luxury goods and offers her a coveted place as the submissive occupant of his private sex dungeon, all officialized by a contract. Ana says yea to the sex, but demurs on the paperwork. This happens repeatedly until the movie ends — or, really, just stops. When a film is essentially just about two characters negotiating an offbeat relationship, they need to be likable, and Johnson's Ana is. Gone is mousy book Ana's first-person narration; no longer must we witness her efforts to blame every bold sexual impulse on her ""inner goddess."" Despite some lip biting and whining, this Ana owns her desires and, in a few scenes, even calls Christian out on his creepy insistence on controlling every aspect of her life. That's where the movie gets confusing, because Ana's self-respect comes and goes like the March wind. A glance from those gray eyes, or a hint of Christian's tortured childhood, suffices to make her forget how often he's a bossy jerk. Dornan was memorably creepy in the British series ""The Fall,"" but there he played a character, not a fantasy figure. Here he fails, as most actors doubtless would, to show us just what Ana is so damn mesmerized by. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson gives the Seattle-set film an elegant, streamlined look and a silvery-gray sheen, distancing it from the more florid aspects of its source material. Even the sex scenes tend to the pictorial, following the grand tradition of arty soft-core films. All these choices work to make Fifty Shades a more tolerable experience for non-fans of the books than it might have been. A more adventurous writer and director could have turned this twisted fairy tale into a full-fledged surreal fantasy (think Lynch or Almodóvar), using its inconsistencies as assets. But James, who wielded considerable control over this production, surely wouldn't have given her OK to such escapades. In any case, the reality of Fifty Shades was long ago eclipsed by the frenzy of discussion around it. Perhaps it's time for all of us to recognize that fantasies come in a great many more than 50 shades — and that they're not real.

"Feb 19, 2015",negative," Reading the first reviews of Fifty Shades of Grey, I wondered whether female critics had been banned from attending the film’s last-minute press screenings. The male critics had a good old laugh at the film as they vied to write the most disparaging and entertaining review. It was a warning – to their readers, to E.L. James and to the film’s director – effectively saying, “Your ‘erotica’ may be popular but God forbid anyone would take this rubbish seriously. And by the way, we can write better than you can (even if you’ve made a fortune).” Then came the second wave of responses, from women who wanted to like it or to be shocked but found the film anticlimactic. Where’s the sex? Where’s the feminist agenda? This isn’t BDSM, this is domestic abuse. In directing this film, Sam Taylor-Johnson held a poisoned chalice. Fifty Shades of Grey is not a boundary-pushing female Shame, but nor is it the golden turkey that some would wish. Like the novel, it is a singular phenomenon, an international box-office smash hit by a female British director aimed squarely at a female audience. Like Cinderella, Bluebeard, Pygmalion or Twilight, it is a romantic fantasy and a fairytale, a story of sexual awakening in which the innocent heroine’s inherent strengths allow her to battle monsters, in this case capitalism and a male sexuality twice-warped by childhood abuse and adolescent manipulation. Wicked witches are omnipresent in this story, whether it’s Christian’s birth mother, the shadowy ‘Mrs Robinson’ with whom he had a relationship when he was 16, or Ana’s mother, on to her fourth husband and having such a great time that she can’t make it to her daughter’s graduation. Danny Elfman’s score weaves its dark, twinkling magic around the story, bringing out the archetypal fantasy. Towering glass-and-chrome corporate landscapes replace the dark forests of classic fairytales and much of the film’s mise en scène brings to mind the great expressive excesses of Douglas Sirk’s Hollywood melodramas, lavish women’s pictures such as Written on the Wind (1956) with its chain of unrequited love. Its palette based around the four elements, Seamus McGarvey’s cinematography captures the film’s reflective surfaces while introducing shadows and depth. A shot of Christian and Ana making love pans upwards to reveal a dark mirror on the ceiling, their image like an underwater chimera or shunga painting. (Memo to Taylor-Johnson: jellyfish in an aquarium would have been amazing.) Storm clouds are always on the horizon, and when it rains it pours. Ana goes up in the air in the helicopter and glider sequences; much derided as examples of the film’s silly, stereotypical displays of conspicuous wealth, these scenes are breathtaking and joyous, referencing the title of Erica Jong’s milestone novel about female sexuality, Fear of Flying. The walls of Christian’s office glow red and orange like the fires of hell as he and Ana negotiate the contract by which she will become the submissive to his dominant, and the ‘Red Room of Pain’ speaks for itself. It is in one of the film’s ‘earth scenes’, when Ana and Christian walk like babes in the wood, that he tells her the story of his adolescent submission to his mother’s friend, ‘Mrs Robinson’. The film borrows big from Grimm, and also from Alice in Wonderland; the hangover painkillers by Ana’s bedside are labelled ‘Eat Me’, the juice ‘Drink Me’. Ana falls down an internet rabbit hole when she begins to research her subject online, looking at Dita Von Teese bondage pictures – a sly reference to the burlesque stripper’s real-life urging of women to read erotica by the likes of Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin rather than Fifty Shades. The casting of the film was famously difficult, as Fifty Shades fans bayed their disapproval in the background. But Dakota Johnson (daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, granddaughter of Tippi Hedren) is terrific as Ana, a latterday Tess of the d’Urbervilles, reluctant yet curious and questioning, rapidly proving herself incompatible with the “50 shades of fucked up” control-freak Christian. Johnson brings to mind Charlotte Gainsbourg in An Impudent Girl (rather than the older nymphomaniac), not least when Christian plays Chopin’s ‘Prelude Op. 28 No. 4 in E Minor’ on the piano, a piece of music sampled by Serge Gainsbourg in his love song for ‘Jane B’ (Birkin). In the absence of any really explicit sex, the chemistry between the leads strains to be there. Jamie Dornan (The Fall) is not the plank that some male critics have described and puts in a decent performance, but he isn’t the sexy beast of the Fifty Shades reader’s imagination, nor does he beat Jamie Bell’s recent turn as a melancholic whip-cracking sadist in Nymph(0)maniac. One of the disorientating things about the film adaptation is the shift in point of view. Whereas the book begins with Ana looking in the mirror and is told from her point of view, the film’s opening scenes are mostly of Christian, setting up his world for Ana to enter. The upside is the loss of Ana’s annoying inner voice (“Holy crap!” she exclaims repeatedly in the book) and her inner goddess, an irritating Tinkerbell that most readers long to squash underfoot. But while James’s novel luxuriates in Ana’s descriptions of Christian, and particularly his erection, the film barely allows the viewer’s gaze to linger on the face let alone the body of Dornan’s character. This is a far cry from the director’s video David commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery in 2004, a single long take of the footballer David Beckham sleeping that allows the viewer to gaze voyeuristically at his beauty. Equally exposing of their subjects are Taylor-Johnson’s earlier gallery film Brontosaurus (1995), showing a naked man dancing in slow-motion, and her short film Death Valley (2006), depicting a man masturbating in the desert. There have been several films featuring BDSM imagery and/or themes, subliminally in the mainstream (Daniel Craig’s James Bond tied naked to a chair and beaten in Casino Royale) or explicitly in the art house (the films of Alain Robbe-Grillet or Catherine Breillat, Maîtresse, Belle de Jour, The Night Porter, Mano destra, Secretary and most recently The Duke of Burgundy). The closest predecessor of Fifty Shades is probably 9½ Weeks (1986), another sexually driven US mainstream movie phenomenon based on a novel by a woman, and Taylor-Johnson includes a nod to that film’s ice cubes and blindfolds. But whereas 9½ Weeks became famous for a number of set pieces – the food sequence, the male drag scene, the ‘You Can Leave Your Hat On’ striptease – it’s difficult to identify a single watercooler moment or destined-to-be-classic scene in Fifty Shades. Despite the fact that more explicit material, filthier language and dirtier jokes have already been unleashed by 18-certificate studio pictures, Universal was obviously not out to challenge the parameters of mainstream taste or the boundaries of the BBFC and its worldwide equivalents. In the UK at least the film was passed uncut, leaving no hope of seeing a director’s version. One suspects that Taylor-Johnson was never free even to push at the edges of sexual representation, and the film’s lack of explicit imagery and grit is one of its disappointments. That this has been the predominant articulated response may be apt, because the story is about wanting more: he’s gorgeous, wealthy and makes her come, but he doesn’t do hearts and flowers and he won’t let her sleep with or touch him."
"Feb 19, 2015",positive,What emerges in Fifty Shades of Grey is perhaps the best finished product that could rise from the depths of a compromised starting point.
"Feb 19, 2015",positive," WITH a sidelong glance, billionaire bachelor Christian Grey opens the door to his “playroom” – a windowless dungeon kitted out with whips, cat-o-nine tails and riding crops. The greatest triumph of this adaptation of EL James’s novel – the fastest-selling paperback in British history – is how it so effortlessly takes the seedy world of S&M and gives it a respectable makeover. Not that my opinion is going to affect the movie’s box office one jot. With tickets being pre-booked at a rate of one every seven seconds this week, Fifty Shades is completely bullet-proof. Dakota Johnson, the 25-year-old daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, plays naive undergraduate Anastasia Steele who meets Christian (Jamie Dornan) while interviewing him for her college newspaper. The pair couldn’t be more different. She’s a naive klutz who’s all fingers and thumbs. He’s a debonair control freak – but the mutual attraction is palpable. With the looks of Brad Pitt, the wealth of Bill Gates and the sexual appetite of a dozen rabbits on the first day of spring, what woman could possibly resist? Early on, Christian warns the smitten Ana, “I don’t do romance. My tastes are very singular.” You can say that again, for the aloof lothario is actually a “dominant” hoping to turn the 21-year-old virgin into a “submissive”. Many of the book’s weaker chapters and Ana’s asinine inner monologue have been stripped out but this isn’t a film that could be described as high art. Scenes of Ana sucking her pencil make for moments of clunking symbolism. The soundtrack (including The Rolling Stones’ Beast Of Burden) is painfully obvious and Christian, despite his peccadillos, is too perfect to ever seem real. And the film more than delivers. The first, after 40 minutes of foreplay, sees Ana lose her cherry, missionary style, on silk sheets amid a haze of boobs and buttocks. Her naked body is whipped, spanked and teased with Christian’s riding crop – behaviour that would be likely to spark a complaint to the Jockeys Association in any other situation."

"Feb 19, 2015",negative," Let’s cut to the chase on this one: If you are going into Fifty Shades of Grey expecting a smörgåsbord of steamy BDSM sex scenes that send you over the moon with images of orgasmic euphoria wrapped in the finest natural-fiber constraints, you best be lowering your expectations. While not entirely stripped of eroticism, the couplings in the film are pretty tame (you’re likely to find much more kink in any given episode of Scandal, truth be told), and the camera tends to pan away like a courteous voyeur before most of les petites morts are achieved. So what are we left with? Just the usual wish-fulfillment fairy tale of a naive girl and her Prince Charming that's been told a million times before. Based on an obscure novel by E L James, Fifty Shades is the story of Anastasia Steele (an entirely legitimate name), an English Lit major at Washington State, a clumsy plain Jane, and, no big deal, a virgin. Subbing for her sick roommate, she’s interviewing the millionaire Christian Grey (Dornan) for her school newspaper, a man who’s made his money manufacturing things that aren’t important to the story and, also, feeding poor people. The spark that alights from that interview carries over into a courtship that seems to be bound for romance. That is, until he drops an exhaustive contract into Anastasia’s lap that details his predilection as a dominant and his desire to see her as his submissive, and will she just sign please so the flogging may commence? Snark aside, the first half of the film is pretty entertaining. It has a campy, nimble approach to the material that elevates it above its fanfic origins. Dakota Johnson breathes life into an otherwise drippy, clueless character. She is absolutely the best thing about this movie. Dornan, as Grey, on the other hand, does not fare as well. As written, his character is icy and taciturn, which means you’re in for a lot of pursed lips, eye twitches, and severe looks, and not much else (except, perhaps, his abs). That the couple's chemistry is nonexistent also doesn't help sell the story. But once Christian introduces Anastasia to his wealthy lifestyle, the rest of the film plays out like some forgotten Calvin Klein perfume ad mixed with an S&M legal drama about butt plugs (Anastasia’s never heard of them) and other similarly complex legal ramifications of things (maybe fists) you stick into other things, with excursions in helicopters, lavish penthouse suites, and of course, red rooms of bondage. The subversive undercurrent at work here – that Anastasia holds the real power over Christian because she actually loves him as a person and will eventually change him for the better – ends up not being that subversive after all. It's a bondage movie without much perversion, a love story without much passion, and ultimately, a film burdened with expectations it could never fulfill. It never quite hits as hard as you want it to.

"Feb 19, 2015",negative,I can only say that boredom set in early.
"Feb 19, 2015",negative,"While there's some meat to Dakota Johnson's role of the ingenue, Jamie Dornan is given absolutely nothing to work with for most of the film."
"Feb 19, 2015",negative,"In the end, Fifty Shades of Grey isn't so much terrible as it is timid and tame."
"Feb 19, 2015",neutral,"The much-hyped film adaptation, in which James was closely involved, sticks closely to the novel, but is both strengthened and weakened by what director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel decided to omit."
"Feb 19, 2015",negative,"What is this thing called love? That's a question asked by Cole Porter. In 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' the initially virginal heroine has a very different if not entirely unrelated query: 'What are butt plugs?'"
"Feb 19, 2015",negative," I’ve seen them reading it at airports, reading in their front yards while the kids are at play, reading while driving their cars on the freeway, reading at church with the book cleverly tucked in their hymnals, reading while violently kickboxing and, most notably, reading in public lavatories while jovially humming (very unsettling, that jovial humming). The Fifty Shades phenomenon has been impossible to avoid, and that virus has now spread to movie screens. While I managed to avoid the book as if it were an ill-tempered grizzly bear infected with Ebola and brandishing a shotgun, the cinema now beckons, so off to the Red Room of Pain I go. Subbing for her sick roommate, mousy college student with a porn name Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), who is so innocent she doesn’t know what a butt plug is, goes to Seattle to interview billionaire business guy douchebag Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Grey’s offices are immaculate and adorned with supermodels. The place is also riddled with fancy pencils that have GREY stenciled on them, so that when Anastasia erotically sticks one in her mouth, its sort of like she’s sucking on Grey’s dick. Shortly after the interview, Grey starts stalking Anastasia at the hardware store where she works, but that’s OK because he has billions of dollars and looks like the result of a night of passionate lovemaking between Ryan Phillippe and Eric Bana. I mean, let’s face it, if Grey looked like Zach Galifianakis and only had a quarter in his pocket, straight to jail he would go for such behavior. His psychotic courtship eventually winds up with Anastasia becoming his prospective bondage slave. He offers her a formal contract that, if she signs, will allow him to be the dominant and her the submissive in a kinky sex relationship that will involve spanking, humiliation, nipple clips and eating toast in bed. The sex scenes eventually happen and, if anything, they provide some good, hearty laughs. While the screenplay doesn’t explain much, Grey’s sexual proclivities and needs to abuse his mate have something to do with his being a crack baby. So I guess we’re supposed to feel sorry for him when he’s torturing his girlfriend because his mom was a stupid crack whore. Fair enough. When people aren’t having sex in this movie, which is quite often as things turn out, they talk in a somber, slow, irritatingly elongated manner. Everybody in this movie is a mopey, sodden sop. I love Seattle, but watching how residents behave and communicate in this movie makes me never want to visit the city again, even if the Mariners make the playoffs. On the subject of Grey’s dick again, take note: Dornan signed a “no dick whatsoever … sorry!” clause, so he never whips it out on screen. There’s plenty of Dornan ass, and Dornan chest, and Dornan chin scar, but no Dornan dick. So any of you out there highly anticipating a chance to see some massive Dornan dick will have to score a real life date with the guy, because there is no Dornan dick to be found in this flick. The guy could be a eunuch for all we know. The movie sort of just ends at the just over two-hour mark. Yes, those of you who get intensely, emotionally involved in the plights of Anastasia and Christian will have to wait, Empire Strikes Back style, for the sure-to-happen sequel. Frantic negotiations have no doubt commenced with Dornan to get him to show the dick. I saw Fifty Shades of Grey on a Valentine’s Day late-night showing. I suspect there might’ve been some tug jobs and fingerbanging going on in the theater since it was the sweetheart holiday and, well, I heard grunting and snorting. If there were various acts of covert sex commencing around me, I’m pretty sure they were a thousand times more erotic and genuine than the hilarious supposed sexual antics occurring on screen."
"Feb 18, 2015",neutral," I'd like to think Fifty Shades of Grey knows exactly what it is -- corny slash fic come to life -- and if that's the case it's almost admirable in its attempt at spectacle. (The two leads are also nice.) Unfortunately, Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie adaptation gets so caught up in the intrigue and melodrama that it never really finds its groove. Even the film's raw sex appeal is lacking, which just leaves a poorly plotted story and laughable dialogue.

"Feb 18, 2015",negative," Few people took Fifty Shades of Grey seriously, even the masses who read it. And neither does the inevitable movie adaptation, written by Kelly Marcel and directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. Which is too bad, really, for the result is a lukewarm exercise in timidity that – if not exactly embarrassed by its subject matter – is extremely wary of diving too deeply into it. I suppose that would be fine if the film at least generated some sort of sexual heat or was instead a blackly comic deconstruction of its source material, along the lines of Mary Harron’s American Psycho. But Fifty Shades of Grey is neither. The picture is disinterested in serious social commentary (a disappointment, given the prominent place of sexual ethics in the current cultural conversation). And aside from one spicy dinner-table detente – lit as if it were taking place in its own red light district – the movie too often resembles someone furiously trying to rub two sticks together, hoping in vain for a hint of smoke. The main problem is one of the sticks. As Christian Grey, the steely young billionaire with a taste for BDSM, Jamie Dornan has the same handsome vagueness of the last few actors who’ve been cast as Superman (and whose names I’ve already forgotten). This is supposed to be a man of privacy and reserve, yes, but Dornan plays those qualities to the point of becoming a mannequin. Taylor-Johnson’s camera lingers on his face for much of the movie, waiting for a spark that never comes. Dornan also brings very little chemistry to his scenes with Dakota Johnson, whose Anastasia Steele is the inexperienced English major who falls under Christian’s preying gaze. A virgin – literally and figuratively – Anastasia is at first wooed by his money (he tops Foxcatcher’s John du Pont by having a helicopter with a leather interior), then his intensity. When he reveals that he’s not interested in romance, but rather her concession to being his sexual submissive, she’s both unnerved and intrigued. The movie wants this to be a struggle for Anastasia, but the struggle is communicated in the most rudimentary of ways. Johnson’s scenes operate in one of two modes: physical pleasure (including softcore cinematography that does nothing to mitigate the objectification element) and emotional pain. She moans in one scene; cries in another. And then the movie repeats. We barely see the meeting and mixing of those two experiences, any sense of real struggle or conflict. Fifty Shades of Grey – and Johnson’s performance – is distinctly missing the sort of intricacy Diane Lane brought to the infidelity thriller Unfaithful, especially the remarkable scene in which euphoria, guilt, pride and embarrassment all race across her face during a train ride home from an illicit tryst. In the end, Fifty Shades of Grey isn’t worth getting too bothered about, no matter how dubious its sexual politics might be. It never really takes a position on questions of consent or gender equality, just as it conveniently portrays Christian’s sexual preferences both as something enticing and something of which he needs to be cured. For a movie with whips and chords, Fifty Shades plays things awfully safe."
"Feb 17, 2015",positive,"""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" which gingerly crosses over into the questionable subject mark, may not be the film some of the book's readers were hoping to witness."
"Feb 17, 2015",negative,There is a very good chance that I will see nothing worse all year. I'm pretty sure I will see nothing more brain-witheringly stupid and boring -- or less sexy.
