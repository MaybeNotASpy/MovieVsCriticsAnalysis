Apr 13 2024,negative,not good acting is awful writing is terrible and generic story you do not feel connected to the story or any of the characters the only positive thing is there are a good amount of world building shots throughout the movie
Apr 11 2024,positive,it was pretty cheesy and had some far fetched ideas however overall it was a exciting feel good movie would recommend if you dont have anything else great to watch
Apr 10 2024,positive,i dont know if we all saw the same movie sure it could have been much better but its still visually pleasing and the storymessage soul its there my only issue is that i wish everything happened in the span of three movies and a lot of things happened in between hahahhaha
Apr 9 2024,neutral,some good parts  not boring  nothing too original  kind of mad maxish
Apr 9 2024,positive,awesome movie i cant believe people give it such bad reviews
Apr 6 2024,positive,an all around great movie although the prologue doesnt give anywhere near enough context and can have viewers wondering
Apr 4 2024,negative,well at least visually it looked stunning and had an interesting worldthe rest of the movie however is so rushed that this film would have been better off as a series then a movie
Apr 4 2024,negative,it looks okay and the acting is halfway decent but the scriptdirecting is very much meh like does the girl take out her knife and look at it dramatically before shoving it into her sheath dramatically every time she uses it it tries too hard and as for the basic premise just why giant mobile cities makes zero sense but it does look pretty cool if youre really bored and watched everything else go for it
Apr 3 2024,positive,i dont know what gen tanked the tomatometer but i think if youre a millennial youll likely enjoy it
Apr 2 2024,positive,totally enjoyed this movie thank you peter jackson you have a realm of entertainment i read the good  bad reviews but i still watch this movie and found it very entertaining other places besides rotten tomatoes gives this movie much better ratings i think its one of those movies you love it or you hate it i absolutely love this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,its a good film not that bad visual effect is so good
Mar 29 2024,positive,you need a cinemahome cinema for this the canvas is really big the pictures and sound come alive it was on regular tv and it looked really bad i watched it via one of the streamers it was brilliant brazil red dwarf frankensteinterminator studio ghibli all blended together there is subtle humour too that the may have gone over the reviewers heads its big if watched the correct way
Mar 29 2024,negative,whats even going on in this movie weird
Mar 21 2024,positive,this was absolutely fantastic a steampunk driven romp had elements of bioshock infinite elements of fallout 3 ghouls absolutely loved it great cgi great acting great characters whats not to love
Mar 19 2024,positive,i loved this movie the story line was great and the characters were interesting i really liked the action costumes and settings its very steampunk
Mar 16 2024,negative,the setting was mildly interesting but the storyline was a real hot mess and the characters were incredibly 1 dimensional it was infuriating to see some decent actors given such horrible lines and a disjointed story
Mar 7 2024,positive,dynamite flick watch it for the artistic direction and cinematography alone if you dont like the plotcharacters  thoroughly entertaining on so many levels
Mar 6 2024,positive,excellent movie cgi were perfect acting was very good from all actors i hope we have a sequel
Mar 2 2024,positive,this film will probably be a cult film or cult classic in 20 years this film was one of the biggest box office bombs of all time the acting was terrible hugo weaving seemed like he was trying the only good film about this film are the visuals and some are striking and great this film is based on a book ive never read and the film is worth a watch for the visuals its like star wars meets divergent in a bad way i wish this film was better but it wasnt but the special effects are cities are cool saw it for free on amazon prime its freevee free to watch im in the middle on this one not great not horrible just average
Mar 1 2024,neutral,real conflicts reel disappointments america vs britton unfolds in this dystopian dud oh but dont worry the terrible acting disappointing dialog wont distract you from how badly they missed the mark on such an interesting concept
Feb 25 2024,positive,i think this would have worked if it has been a tv series there are some decent cgi but overall it has a look of a mid tv budget show     i can see the initial problem is the cuts and acting direction from what i observed from many different films even with not so good actors a good director or editor can make actors look good or give them the facial expressions they need to make less cringey or campy acting it does feel like they shot it as first take instead making them work the scene the facial expressions are too close to the scene and if thats what the audience sees then thats what they will complain about
Feb 22 2024,negative,the people who made this film were all very talented because it takes talent to make anything this bad the story is bad the premise is bad the acting is bad and the script is bad
Feb 21 2024,positive,i found it to be quite awesome great cgi effects plot kept moving forward rapidly great action scenes and characters seemed real not really sure why the movie was panned so muchkept me riveted the entire time
Feb 20 2024,positive,this is one of my new favorite movies enjoyed the characters as they were fully realized and very good enjoyed the story which was a simple one of battle for resources hugo weaving knocked it out of the park on my list of greatest movies ever
Feb 16 2024,positive,i enjoyed it hugo weaving cant do a lot of wrong in my world though
Feb 11 2024,positive,better than any marvel movie
Feb 11 2024,positive,good movie its crazy movies like this get such low reviews
Feb 9 2024,negative,the acting is kinda embarrassing
Feb 3 2024,negative,phenomenal visual effects scenes settings and concept this movie had so much potential  it was let down by a rushed plot leaving no room for character development or any kind of life this movie felt completely soulless
Jan 8 2024,positive,theres way too much going on either the movie should have jettisoned a subplot or two or been a lot longer that said i still enjoyed the movie for its ambition and strange setup the image of london as a ravenous machine bent on devouring other cities is kind of ingenious
Jan 1 2024,positive,i enjoyed watching the movie fantastic setseffects actionpacked good enough story but it is far from great  my two main criticisms 1 they tried to squeeze too much worldbuilding from a book series into a single movie and 2 i never became sold on the concept of big cities roaming around gobbling up smaller cities
Dec 29 2023,positive,great movie overall great soundtrack story and acting but the best thing is the world building made me want to read the books and rewatch the movie again
Dec 10 2023,negative,it reminded of the old monte python sketch
Nov 30 2023,positive,its my messianic age at the end motion picture mortal engines
Nov 26 2023,neutral,with such an interesting premise of moving cities and a mad max steampunk kind of aesthetic there was plenty of opportunity for novel thinking character development twists and turns but instead they chose to unfold the most cliched boring plot line possible three quarters of the way through i really didnt care how it turned out or i knew exactly how it was going to turn out but i felt after investing the time i should see it through still good performances and beautiful to look at 
Nov 25 2023,positive,i liked it had some great characters with sequal potential
Nov 11 2023,negative,very very bad movie so bored so predictible very very generic dialogues and a very boring story
Nov 3 2023,positive,the movie is fine and a good popcorn movie the story is serviceable and its trying to be a fun fantasyscifi movie i love scifi but i think people dont enjoy light hearted scififantasy movies anymore everyone wants scifi to be all serious and dark now
Oct 25 2023,positive,this is definitely not as bad as people make it out to be as a big fan of steampunk i enjoyed this thoroughly it has a good storyline and an amazing concept for a world however i do agree that it could have used more of a premise in order to engage the audience better people who arent a fan of steampunk or fantasy should probably stay away from this
Sep 2 2023,positive,my whole family loves this movie give it a chance the graphics are amazing and its just really fun overall
Aug 27 2023,positive,its a decent movie  fun and interesting scifi meets fantasy movie cant understand why it was given a bad wrap huge cities become mortal engines that are able to be mobile if they use the same concept and make a series of it it will be a great success i enjoyed it not sure why many gave it a bad review its type of movie you would sit on a cold outcast day with popcorn and hot chocolate
Aug 22 2023,positive,fantastic i really liked it although i really liked the book dont know why so many critics seem to have a stick up their arse on this one
Aug 8 2023,positive,great theme great acting but simply not 100
Aug 4 2023,positive,not as bad as it seems
Aug 1 2023,positive,mortal engines presents a fascinating concept of moving cities in a scifi context creating a visually captivating world however while the film boasts an intriguing premise it falls victim to a predictable storyline that fails to offer much excitement beyond the triedandtested formula of the hero triumphing and winning the girl    the films central idea of cities on wheels roaming a postapocalyptic earth is undeniably unique and sets the stage for an immersive experience the grandeur and intricacy of the set designs lighting and costumes contribute to the films visual appeal the cinematography is particularly noteworthy with sweeping shots that effectively capture the vastness of this dystopian world    unfortunately where mortal engines falls short is in its storytelling the plot follows a predictable trajectory where the hero faces challenges and overcomes them in a rather conventional manner this lack of surprises or refreshing twists hampers the films potential to be truly engaging the romantic subplot adheres to the clichéd trope of the hero ultimately winning the girl failing to provide any genuine emotional depth    regarding the performances the acting in mortal engines is passable but not exceptional while the cast delivers their lines adequately there are no standout performances that leave a lasting impact however it is worth noting that the films shortcomings in acting are somewhat compensated by its impressive visual and technical aspects    despite its narrative shortcomings mortal engines offers a visually stunning experience the meticulously crafted world combined with remarkable cinematography creates a feast for the eyes as a result it can be viewed as an entertaining film to pass the time particularly for fans of science fiction and visuallydriven spectacles    in conclusion mortal engines introduces a captivating and unique concept but falls short in terms of its predictable storyline and conventional character arcs the films visual elements including set designs lighting costumes and cinematography are commendable while it may not be a groundbreaking or outstanding cinematic achievement it can still provide an enjoyable experience for those seeking a visually striking scifi adventure
Jul 22 2023,positive,i dont know why people disliked this movie so much its not polished sci fi no but i finally watched this movie after 5 years even though the trailers really caught my attention when it was released this was due mainly because of the terrible ratings it recieved its a perfect popcorn and beer movie and i found myself inexplicably emotionally moved by the murderous death robot who still managed to love and care for one of the main characters imo this film isnt amazing but it is criminally underrated and deserves a rating between 60 to 70
Jul 22 2023,negative,sorry but this was the most disappointing movie for me did not suit my expectation as a scifi lover
Jul 22 2023,positive,i dont know what all the fancy critics say all i know is that i enjoyed it a lot and the movie instantly gains a ten x boost if you have read the jook which i assume these critics have not because all they do is movie related
Jul 11 2023,negative,i tend to agree with the critics on this one its full of special effects but the story is meh the acting isnt too bad eitherits just a poor story
Jul 10 2023,neutral,at times it looks absoloutley incredible i also thought the world it was set in was extremley intersting with the movie pulling of the aesthtetic really well the characters and story however were not devloped enough and shouldve been given more care overall it was a mediocre movie that had a lot of potential
Jul 9 2023,positive,critics have panned this extravagant cgi adventure i suspended my expectations and enjoyed it for the romp it is attractive people on screen good acting and my pigeon hole for it is sci fi action adventure fantasy romance which does not let up much on the action right from the start if you like all those things thrown together its ok entertaining and the makeup artists need some sort of prize
Jun 12 2023,positive,i dont get why people dont like the movie it didnt really get a lot of attention when it came out for whatever reason and then most of the people who ended watching it and liking it didnt ever pay to watch it i didnt since one of my family members just took it online and we all watched it together it was an amazing movie the action is there the plot is there the effects are insane these are based on what i can remember as a kid at the time people say that it was aimed at young adults but i fully disagree kids that are growing up have a creative mind and really like movies like these i really hoped for the full series to become a movie but unfortunately it didnt get the light that it deserved which sucks i really recommend everyone to watch this movie its one of those movies youd fine on tiktok in like dozens of cut up parts that would have you going through every single part regardless of there being 40 parts please i promise it will be worth your time
Jun 4 2023,negative,mortal engines is a disappointing film it is about a postapocalyptic world where cities ride on wheels and consume each other to survive hera hilmar and robert sheehan give terrible performances the script is badly written christian rivers did a horrible job directing this movie i was not impressed with this motion picture
Jun 4 2023,neutral,if youre a steampunk fan  this is a visual treat special effect wise but the plot is weak full of hollywood cliches and predictable the acting is weak and flat
May 30 2023,positive,great popcorn film had a good time
May 28 2023,positive,its a decent watch not as bad as the ratings make it seem ive seen soo much worse
Apr 4 2023,neutral,disorganized beautiful special effects  unpredictable plot
Feb 19 2023,positive,this is the first time i watch the movie mortal engines i didnt watch it in the past due to the low rotten tomato ratings i got up this morning to do a workout and it was on tv so i decided to watch it while working out overall the movie was fairly good its worth taking a look at i think i will at least view a movie with bad rotten tomato ratings to judge for myself from now on
Jan 22 2023,negative,feels and looks like this movie was made in the late nineties story is flat game of powers damsel in distress effects are okay but still very far from a good movie
Jan 17 2023,positive,even though this film more than exceeds expectations held in visual effects it lacks enough story and heart to propel it towards any lasting effect 𝘔𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘭 𝘌𝘯𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘴 deserves writers that are as talented as its vfx artists
Dec 30 2022,positive,a rushed lacklustre and cliché plot especially the ending  but in the first half the world that is shown is so exciting and full of life that it drew me in and i still enjoyed the film all in all
Dec 16 2022,negative,took me years to get around to watching this and it was a deep disappointment i had very much liked the original novel and its successors so i was interested to see how it translated for film answer  badly less than five minutes in i was dissatisfied wondering why this didnt have any of the charm of the book it all seemed predicated on spectacle and action where the book was much more lowkey and provided a world that was involving and interesting and in a peculiar way believable i couldnt suspend disbelief in the film  it all seemed so implausible so cliched as others have said any random two minutes could have come from any other not very good fantasy film i completely lost heart and gave up at the point the small town was being destroyed carelessly in a world of shortages i sort of want to to know how they portroyaed the shrike so will ff one day to check that but my hopes are not high very poor film good opportunity wasted
Oct 26 2022,positive,i forgot hugo weaving was in this
Oct 14 2022,positive,great film great story outstanding effects great retelling of an amazing book
Oct 3 2022,positive,absolutely loved it very sad it wont get a sequel
Sep 13 2022,negative,being a fan of postapocalyptic settings i decided to give it a go oh boy now i understand the poor ratings the movie has very decent visuals but the writing felt like teenager fanfic even video games have better writing nowadays thats how bad it is the characters are very cliché and shallow like theyre straight out of a shonen manga their behavior are extremely inconsistent like the heroine randomly revealing her deepest past scars to a stranger she met ten minutes earlier for no apparent reason the dialogues are often terrible and cringethe movie may be okay for a 13 years old but if your an grown up person this is not even good enough to pass time i truly forced myself and suffered to watch it until the end hoping it would have some redeeming quality but it did not
Sep 4 2022,positive,excellent science fiction dont ever let anybody tell you that its not that great it is science fiction for those of you think that it was made poorly youre wrong great move radix and great adventure for you
Aug 4 2022,neutral,it is a little hard to get past the premise with your suspension of disbelief intact but once you just accept the absurd and get into it the story is pretty good  i bet kids love the film
Jul 20 2022,positive,okay movie  plot could use work cant beat the book
Jul 7 2022,positive,great concept for that i gave good score execution and plot was lacking but the concept and visuals made up for it with a better director might have pulled it off with an epic movie instead of just mediocre
May 8 2022,neutral,the technical aspects of mortal engines art direction visual effects and set decoration are impressive no doubt why the hell couldnt they pair all that with something better than this mess of generic cliched screenwriting and marginal acting   hugo weaving is bad again not sure when ive ever been really impressed by him he was even questionable as elrond but maybe he was supposed to play it that way  robert sheehan was much better as bj and as klaus i liked shrike though the slow panty voice was annoying at times   28 just for the technical side
Apr 7 2022,negative,this is pretty dam bad if you have nothing to do and dont want to rewatch a good movie or just want to having something on in the background while you clean or scrub the bathroom this is the movie for you     the technology is just impossible this isnt steampunk its an insult to steampunk wow i kept watching the same way i would watch a car accident while driving in traffic the plot is just terrible not the actors fault the script is terrible     visually its a meh some beautiful scenes man just want to wash my eyes out they tried to steal from star wars holy crap even with a i am your father moment and an escape from the death star scene     i can go on but i have to take a poo the poo is much more entertaining i have a shampoo bottle to read
Apr 4 2022,positive,i cant believe this has a score this low it was actually pretty good ill watch it again
Mar 6 2022,neutral,this is another in the long line of young adult films that all pretty much have the same theme and are clearly not made for me  this one takes place in  you guessed it a post apocalyptic world where cities move on wheels sort of and its got a steampunk style to the whole thing which is admittedly an interesting look  the story itself didnt do much for me but it is a visually interesting movie to watch
Mar 4 2022,positive,okay rt canned this flick and audience reviews were so so i watch dozens of scifi movies and i found this quirky steam punk postapocalyptic flick a delightful ride it was quite imaginative with great cinematography and ample special fx ok plot was pretty basic and unchallenging but who cares sometimes clearly knowing the bad guy vs the heroine and hero is relaxing there was plenty of action bizarre people entities and outlandish machines appear everywhere it was like brazil and time bandits had a scifi baby try and conceive of such a thing never mind the criticisms on rt  just sit back and enjoy a unique scifi flick with your older teenage kids its mostly tame  and no sex or nudity  just loads of action and explosions with doses of battles here and there
Feb 17 2022,positive,possibly the best visual effects ive ever seen wrapped up in a disappointing film even better than avatar 2009 i think the action is exciting the technical aspects are immaculate the first problem that i noticed was the poor introduction to the cities these things are enormous but the film does not introduce this scale well at all you see one giant moving city but no scale compared to the trees it is crushing or the people on it and seconds later an even bigger city is introduced but again theres no buildup or suspense its just big from the start the characters are annoying and obnoxious except the main girl the details of the story are muddled but the overall story is interesting the parallels of the real world are painfully unsubtle i very much found myself wanting the bad guys to succeed reminiscent of the matrix 1999 in tone and style but without the memorable characters
Dec 3 2021,negative,they didnt even read the book we are at minute marker 1212 and just about everything has been wrong so far
Dec 2 2021,negative,i dont quite know what it was about like that kinda movies
Oct 6 2021,positive,this movie is so underrated i hope it gets a sequel
Oct 4 2021,positive,i was a huge fan of the books and for me the movie was alright until the last 30 minutes which i think most fans of the books would agree it was pretty faithful upto that point though for someone who has never read the books this is hard to get into and actually care about the characters the first 20 minutes of the movie messes that up pretty quick    its an okay watch to see a cool concept though sadly there will most likely never be a sequel
Aug 22 2021,positive,great story with great visuals and characters
Jul 26 2021,negative,badand thats being generous
Jun 17 2021,positive,so awesome amazing imaginative creation by peter jackson
Jun 16 2021,negative,i dont want to disrespect the work of everyone involved but man this movie was torture im serious someone should make it forbidden for people older than 13 years old this is a movie for children the narrative is absurdly poor a machine gun of cliches punching you in the face without ever stopping the special effects were very good but they didnt affect my opinion because of how badly the story unfolds lost my time
Jun 11 2021,positive,the british are coming and how people were fleeing london in droves as the actual city was being used as an apocalyptic weapon on wheels star wars meets mad max in this thrill a minute adventure
Jun 1 2021,negative,a tragically bad rendition of a good book    i am not the kind of person who always insists the book is better with the lord of the rings for example i think both the books and the movies have their own distinct virtues i wont dispute with anyone who wants to insist that the book is better but i still believe that the movies are worthwhile in their own right and need not be put down nevertheless peter jackson has clearly lost whatever edge he once had mortal engines is an even greater disappointment than when he turned one short kids book called the hobbit into three overbloated and alltooadult movies by the same name the principal reason for this disappointment is the same in both cases he has sacrificed story character and dialogue for a ridiculous amount of overthetop 3d cgi action    mortal engines is a great booka new classic perhapsand yet its not pretentious or toilsome in any way in fact its written in such an approachable and wellbalanced manner that one could really turn it into a screenplay with the smallest effort it has comedic moments action violence relationships characterbuilding and worldbuilding its a fun adventure that has plenty of plottwists though none that a smart reader will not expect and a compelling story arch along with a premise cities that move around and eat one another that would make for good spectacle in short even a fool could make a passing movie out of this book    yet peter jackson has manipulated and even butchered the source material to such an extent that all of its virtues are lost and yet nothing good is put in their place the cityoncity violence logically makes for a good cgi action scene but in the movie this is so overthetop and absurd that its not even fun to watch since the movie was made for 3d theres a constant stream of objects flying at the camera simply for the shock value yet the cgi looks unrealistic and uninspired the cities do not look like real gigantic cities but sillylooking gokarts the camera angles do not give the viewer a sense of their immensity the goofy gigantic lions on the front of london for example completely spoil it if the movie at least had interesting mobile megacities i would have liked it at for that but it doesnt    the absurd overthetop action does not end there but even supplants key moments of dialogue and characterdevelopment theres a remarkable scene where valentine in order to release one prisoner inexplicably blows up an entire prison similarly the scene where the protagonists meet anna fang turns into a bloodbath as with no explanation she suddenly slaughters a crowd of people by shooting men pointblank with a sawnoff shotgun    in the same way even the most crucial element of a modern storythe cast of charactersis completely blundered by jacksons movie tom natsworthy changes from lovable apprentice historian to annoying slackertechie his relationship with catherine valentine is significantly changed in one of the first scenes of the film where quite remarkably one of the biggest mysteries of the bookthe meaning of the enigmatic medusais outright spoiled    in short there is really nothing redeemable about this movie its not even worth watching its not fun exciting or interesting and it does not even have good visuals despite a huge amount of money blown on cgi its sad i would really like someone to make a good mortal engines movie some day but because of this flop i doubt it will even happen
May 12 2021,positive,why do critics hate the movies we love and love the movies we hate the sound of music and the joker were ruthlessly slammed by critics but are loved by audiences just because a critic gives a movie a bad rating doesnt mean its a bad movie and vice versa i like to watch most movies whether i liked the movie trailer or not ive seen trailers for movies and they didnt catch my attention but after watching the movie i was speechless i was like im glad i decided to watch the movie also at times the minute and a half trailer was only the best part of the movie this movie to me falls in the it kept me on the edge of my seat category awesome special effects throughout the assemble of casts for each character couldnt have been better each actor or actress really gets into their characters role i would place this movie in the category with movies like mad max snowpiercer and the book of eli i would definitely recommend this movie
May 10 2021,positive,good story good effects entertaining
May 7 2021,positive,hundreds of years in the future after a cataclysmic event destroys most of humanity the world has changed  cities and towns and now mobile some looking for peace and a future others looking to consume the others for their own survival in a world that is now light on resources and fuel  the city that looks to rule them all is london a massive metropolis devouring every thing in its way  hester shaw has grown up in the outlands and is looking for a way into london to avenge the death of her moth tom natsworthy is an outcast from london who discovered its leaders secrets and anna fang is a dangerous outlaw with a bounty on her head looking to end the reign of the predator cities  together they will try and do the impossible and bring peace to the ravaged land of the future  mortal engines opens with a visually spectacular scene as we get our first glimpse of a large predator city chasing town a smaller town to consume for resources  the scene is fast paced exciting and the steampunk inspired visuals are beautifully realised  on the basis of how this looks this film should have made big bucks at the cinema and be the beginning of a fantastic fantasy franchise  however it failed somewhat  it is by no means a terrible film i really enjoyed it but i agree that the characters needed fleshing out some more and the narrative does not speed along as quickly as the action on screen however i still enjoyed it very much worth watching
Apr 27 2021,positive,its a great movie but it didnt tell the story of the book
Apr 19 2021,negative,this movie in its entirety could be used as an argument against capitalism nothing in it is remotely original the background story superficial the effects exaggerated the fight scenes trivial the character building is cliché the oneliners are lets just say they draw heavy inspiration from bmovies to even imagine that this movie gave its creator literal money awakens some stalinesque ideas in me also the proportion is not constant
Apr 12 2021,negative,star wars with rolling cities yes its as ridiculous as it sounds
Mar 28 2021,neutral,could have been better i had lots of hope that it was going to be a super movie
Mar 22 2021,negative,i give this movie points for originality never have i heard of roaming cities eating each other before however with the exception of the always great acting of hugo weaving there was not much else that i enjoyed about this film it seemed like a waste of time introducing some of the characters as they never developed into much and the story never really gained any traction unlike the super unrealistic cities on tracks
Mar 13 2021,positive,while i do think that there was so much happening in this movie that it should have been broken down into 2 movies not just 1 it was visually stunning not only that by the story was amazing even when comparing it to the book and the few jabs it took at modern memes were funny    overall it was an awesome movie that didnt deserve the low scores it received bought it just so that i could finally see it and im so glad i did
Feb 27 2021,positive,it was a thoroughly enjoyable flick its not going to change your views on the world or stick with you for a long time but it was fun its not too long and the action flows pretty well if youre into character development this isnt a film for you but for decent entertainment its fine it doesnt deserve quite such a low rating
Feb 25 2021,positive,on earth sometime in the future there was a sixty second war further in the future steam punk cities roam europethe amazing technological advancements required for these cities on tank treads are offset by numerous loses in communications and weapons technology    i fear mentioning any more plot details or character motivations as i may be accused of spoilers very few specifics are learned in the opening moments of the movie although there seems to be a protagonist hester shaw her motivations are questionable at best determining who was supposed to be good seemed more about how they were introduced rather than how they actually behaved on my second viewing i decided mortal engines would be a very bad place to try and learn morals in the large cast of characters there are only two perhaps just one that seem to have altruistic actions i kept thinking i can see why this guy is bad but is this other guy good    the structural problems of the film stem from some significant world building problems the world is very complicated and we learn enough to know its complicated but not enough to know why anyone does what they do not just the main characters but the societies as well that might be realistic and true to life but it makes a hard film to get emotionally connected to there are moments clearly meant to be emotionally impactful that for me just arent    the plot chugs along in a mostly pleasing way in a visually very impressive world if you have a 4k tv you want to see what it can really do mortal engines is a great film to test it out with right from the start the movie has highly detailed very realistic looking sets even when you see something and know it must be computer generated it looks real on my 51 system the surround is pretty good the soundtrack is fitting but not memorable    theres not much course language or sexual content but theres plenty of violence most of the violence is around the same level as harry potter except one brutal scene    mortal engines is a lot like avatar beautiful but shallow its exciting at times but burdened with an overly complex world that either needed to be explained less or a lot more    my review sounds pretty bad doesnt it i think there are pretty good odds ill watch this again someday and i give it a 610 you could watch it while folding laundry without your kids
Feb 23 2021,neutral,mortal engines is a steampunk enthusiasts wet dream with all the makings of a decent 2001 film unfortunately its a couple decades out of place and exhaustingly familiar    its got all the right formulaic ingredients of an epic fantasy adventure but lacks the modern sensibilities and creative refinement to shake off its derivativity     despite what appears to be great production values the whole movie just kind of feels like writers haphazardly stitched a bunch of tried and true elements together then tossed it thru a steampunk filter and called it a day
Feb 21 2021,positive,i really dont get the hate for this film unlike other movies hoping to cash in on a new franchise this movie goes all in with a singular film awesome visuals and a very fun performance from hugo weaving were the highlights for me and while the story had elements from other films the familiarity of the narrative and easy tropes allowed the film to provide a lot of story and world building while also giving a satisfying conclusion it was a good time
Feb 20 2021,neutral,okish peter jackson produced post apocalyptic drama 
Feb 19 2021,positive,i liked the visuals and the story it was exciting and kept on track
Feb 17 2021,negative,the plot was interesting but it never really took me there some characters were added and their story line went know where others seemed to be completely forgotten despite how often they were shown despite a happy ending i wasnt satisfied the movie just left me confused but the world they created in this movie left much to be explored id be curious to see more of it if someone could execute it properly
Feb 12 2021,negative,if the weight of the entire city of london england on tractor treads running across europe without getting bogged down is not too hard for you to swallow then neither is this film or anything else for that matter it does provide a fair bit of action so if you are entirely able not to think about how ludicrous and weak the entire plot is you might be able to derive a modicum of pleasure out of watching innocent people being slaughtered but that is about it
Feb 6 2021,neutral,just saw it on netflix a mix of jules vernes star wars lego and tonka for teenagers with nothing else to do
Feb 4 2021,negative,the curse of the big budget steampunk movie strikes again the kindest word i can use to describe mortal engines is ambitious the movie begins with a spectacular chase sequence of predator city london a mishmash of londons famous landmarks stuck onto crawler tracks bearing down on a much smaller bavarian rolling city while visually stunning  its sadly all downhill from here the movie quickly descends into a jumbled mess  too much going on too much backstory too much weird and silly technology too many groups and characters the filmmakers fail to turn what is a flawed source novel into a straightforward understandable story one cant help but feel this movie was designed to kickstart a new peter jackson franchise unfortunately its more likely to be remembered as yet another entry in the long list of steampunk critical and commercial failures
Feb 4 2021,positive,in my mind it is fascinating to see this beautiful story
Feb 4 2021,negative,its hard to think of a worse movie than this
Feb 3 2021,positive,i think this movie requires that youve read the book beforehand as i was familiar with the world and characters this movie was an easy and enjoyable watch but i definitely understand that without having read the book it could get a bit confusing and out of left field its a good adaptation but not a cinematic masterpiece by any means
Feb 1 2021,negative,i liked the beginning and it started strong but than the movie just phased out and was boring and not worth a rent but only  there is nothing else on and my show is on commercial so ill watch this while i wait
Jan 29 2021,positive,the premise is completely stupid and the characters often act in very stupid ways however it is absolutely gorgeous
Jan 24 2021,positive,something differentbut visually good and very entertaining
Jan 20 2021,positive,although this steampunk romp has a rather uninspired not too exciting plot it does dazzle with lots of visually stunning special effects which should satisfy fans of the genre
Jan 11 2021,positive,this movie is great
Jan 10 2021,negative,complete nonsensical rubbish for the love of god dont waste your time was exhausting to watch until the end
Jan 5 2021,neutral,as someone who was a fan of the book series when i was younger this film fails in so many ways to live up to the potential that the novels held taken alone the film is alright but isnt anything particularly special the film has toofast pacing that takes away any sense of scale the characters journeys may otherwise have had and did have in the original fails to let the viewer spend nearly enough time taking in the world the story is set in which is one of its most interesting aspects and causes the character interactions and relationships to feel extremely shallow and forced a television series may have been a better choice of medium for an adaptation of the story    dont get me started on hesters scar
Jan 3 2021,negative,mortal engines was a promising movie that failed for many reasons     honestly though the universe mortal engines was set on was interesting and would have been so great only if they didnt compress the story into one movie the story seemed more fitting for a trilogy or maybe a series there were a lot of terms that as i viewer i didnt understand because it didnt give us a lot of time to get familiar with it and instead just expected viewers to understand it the characters were very bland i couldnt relate to nor feel affection or hate for any of the character because of their lack of well character the graphics of the film was great and honestly was a waste because of how bad the movie was    in summary  characters  meh  plot  good but poor execution very rushed  graphics  fantastic
Dec 28 2020,positive,i would recommend mortal engines it has appealing cinematicvisuals throughout the film with a followable storyline the thought of the world on wheels is an interesting thought but one that definitely worked
Dec 28 2020,positive,its not as bad as the rotten tomatoes score would have you believe in fact i have seen much much much worse movies than this getting higher rotten tomatoes scores they clearly dont deserve like frozen 2 for example or star wars rise of skywalker     the storytelling is pretty good as are the characterizations and the plot has some nice twists some people might have problems of the concept of mobile cities but i thought they did a pretty good job of explaining it     the special effects were also pretty good my only complaint is that they might have squeezed too many sub plots into the movie and it did get quite derivative and predictable in the end     but overall i thought it is still an effective action adventure thriller
Dec 28 2020,negative,story line of movie is so bad that i was in the middle of the movie and i had to do a google search on the ethnicity of the producers and directors i am an indian and i felt no proud when the movie shows the city of london as the overfeeding machine and the land behind the great walls of himalayas as the sustainable peaceful people what is this bullshit if there was an apocalypse and there was a complete destruction of earth how come people behind the wall are like buddhist monks with asian features like chinese indians this is the weakest point and i felt movie to be a complete political propaganda i want to actually understand the brain of the story writer i believe he was high on pot when he was making this bullshit story dude story i felt like unsubscribing netflix for proposing this bullshit to me
Dec 26 2020,neutral,not very clear plot visuals and design very new and interesting the directing not the best
Dec 6 2020,positive,a bit slow at times and the suspension of disbelief in the fact that every person relevant to the story happened to be at exavctly the right place at exactly the right time makes it lose a half a star but that is true for most scifi movies im not sure where the other people considered it bad but i enjoyed this movie it was a bit darker than most of its peer films and had good acting which is hard to find in most cg blockbusters it felt reminiscent of maze runner but with a better cast and the plot makes a bit more sense it may not become your favorite movie ever but dont pass over this one its worth a watch
Dec 4 2020,positive,special effects 10sound effects 05acting 05story 10
Nov 26 2020,positive,this is a odd movie in a good way i found myself strangely captivated by it
Nov 25 2020,negative,extremely ironic seeing someone in the opening scenes wearing a face mask being chased by london that aside it was utter bunkum at least 20 movies from way back to the 60s chucked in a blender et voila  even dickens gets a look in
Nov 23 2020,negative,he doesnt get much emotion the colors are dark and not cool the script is very bad its not worth watching this movie
Nov 22 2020,positive,it used the technology it has to its potential making for great effects resulting in great scenes and fight sequences   the storylines is taken care of with a pace obviously book based  which i guess makes sense  the characters arent tropes or stereotypes or just tools for the storyline none of the usual subtle sexism or racism that most blockbustery movies have the characters are alive and logical   movie makers were careful not to make the same mistakes that most do with their movies  its a world alive and natural just like abed described in communities last ep i can go on and on about all the details and characters decisions they were right to make  it exceedes expectations and its a shame for it to go unseen
Nov 10 2020,negative,when i heard that peter jackson was helping direct this movie i immediately thought this would be a great movie yes the hobbit trilogy needed help but lord of the rings are still some of the best movies ever made  and mortal engines lost its steam as it went on  if there was a spark it didnt quite get the fire going  i was so underwhelmed by the acting and the storyline or lack thereof  i feel like there were so many gears going but not many of them were turning in the right places  but one thing that stood out to me the most was how the characters spoke of us the ancients  i felt like this was supposed to be an allegory for our world but i could not figure out what the message was  take care of the environment history is written by the victors theres always a bigger fish if there was a positive the visual effects and fight scenes were very entertaining if not a tad gory at times  this had an incredible takeoff but it just didnt make the landing for me      apologies for all the horrible puns not
Nov 8 2020,neutral,for just a movie it was entertaining thats why its got such high rating based on following the book in any way it gets a one it would have been way better if they didnt change so much the actors all did a good job with a crappy script
Nov 2 2020,neutral,mortal engines is the type of movie that cant be labeled as a good film but also isnt necessarily a bad one its certainly not as bad as the critics say it is but is not the kind of movie i can in good conscience recommend for anyone to watch theres no point trying to deny it the visual effects were amazing in every scene they appeared in but felt wasted next to lots of characters that felt randomly shoved in with no relevance to the main plot along with many character  story subplots that lead nowhere that aside however the main characters were all setup in a nice way with a strong first act the second act went progressively downhill with more throwaway characters shoved in the final act although being a visually impressive sequence suffered from a frustrating lack of significance and relevance to the story it could have been a powerful  significant ending if the villain had destroyed the cities that were introduced in the first scene of the movie that at least wouldve been more relevant but no what we got was the predator city blowing up a wall and killing thousands of people without being significant or even trying to make the audience care about the victims so in all i would really only see this if your trying to pass the time and is a very meh 510 film
Oct 18 2020,positive,amazing movie i cant pinpoint it but this move is definitely different in a good and cool sense unpredictable in so many ways i couldnt guess what would happen next 5 45 stars because nothing is prefect
Oct 5 2020,neutral,i dont hate it but a rewatch is not in my future
Oct 4 2020,negative,jihae ruined the movie
Sep 25 2020,positive,i enjoyed the visual experience keeping in mind that this movie is based on a japanese anime i really enjoyed the storyline as well i thought this movie was very well done however i thought that the minionsas american deities was a little over the top
Sep 17 2020,negative,pretty damned embarrassing improbable meaningless ok shes hot but its not really enough to justify 90 minutes of bullshit
Sep 7 2020,positive,pretty good and captivating its surprising to me that it has such low rates
Aug 29 2020,negative,forced scenes cliché everywhere final scene almost copied from star wars secondary characters do not count anything while the main ones are enhanced by fortune coincidences its one of that movies where you can predict the whole plot from the beginning its a shameful waste of potential because the actors and the cities would have been ideal for an awesome plot
Aug 24 2020,neutral,the acting was stale to say the least and the concept was just straightup weird
Aug 18 2020,negative,the premise is interesting in and of itself and takes a leap to differentiate itself by diving headfirst into its own neosteampunk aesthetic but mortal engines suffers from one of the cardinal sins of novel adaptations  trying to cram too much of the source material in too many characters and subplots that are improperly explored or just unjustified katherine valentine is introduced early on as a potential main character but completely forgotten about until the last ten minutes and most of the pilots who die defending the city in a blaze of glory were introduced just a few scenes prior robbing any emotional impact what main characters are there feel undifferentiated boring or inconsistent hilmars hester is presented as a mysterious badass but hardly gets the opportunity to present many of those traits that might make her remembered by any audience member after the credits role jihae feels completely wooden as anna fang overall potentially engaging but poorly executed and far from memorable the american deities joke thrown out earlyon is actually funny though 25
Aug 16 2020,negative,a lot of special effects nothing more  no interesting story no interesting characters no interesting movie at all
Aug 16 2020,negative,derivative mashup i added a half star for the vfx team
Aug 12 2020,negative,a story about how the east does a big land grab on all the fertile land and fortifies it against the rest of the world leading to the downfall of western civilisation forcing the western countries of the world to fight for survival   the portrayal of the western countries london as the warmongering power hungry places and the east as a peaceful utopia seem like a blatant contradiction of reality but hey it is just a fictional story  they take away from this movie is the self loathing that is happening within the western world at the moment from portions of the population if they end state is that you wish to live in your perceived utopia in the east you are allowed to leave and go there without destroying your own home first buti guess it is the writers prerogative to tell the story however they wish which is their right i just wonder what the feedback would be if lets say china had a movie made internally making them out to be the bad guys and portraying them as power hungry war mongers   food for thought zero stars
Aug 8 2020,negative,the movie sucked they messed up everything from how all the characters meet to how they all end the movie made the entire thing seem like it happened in the span of 2 days whereas in the book it was more like a week the relationship between katherine and her love interest forgot his name seemed rushed and you dont get to see katherine snoop around london while her father is away also no one has the tattoos marking their job magnus crome doesnt have his engineer insignia also katherine never sees the sewers where she begins to unravel londons mysterys
Aug 7 2020,positive,an above average adventure movie ive been trying to figure out why it was pulled early from theaters and havent really found any evidence while watching the movie
Aug 7 2020,negative,such a great concept what poor execution like a bad pub meal i felt obliged to gradually chew my way through this cinematic crap show grinding my teeth together wanting it to be over but my ocd not letting me exit the show before the credits and please dont ever ever make number two the setup is there but dont do it for goodness sake dont
Aug 2 2020,negative,mortal engines has the makings of a good movie the acting is good the action sequences are fun the special effects are great the visuals for once dont look like somebody pissed on the camera lens the people involved clearly are trying to make this movie work but setting aside the ludicrous premise for anybody who hasnt read the critically acclaimed books especially since these books didnt exactly leave a significant pop culture impact whereas the lotr movies were based off of books that had been hailed as timeless classics years before moviemaking technology reached the point where you could make a successful liveaction version of jrr tolkiens classic piece of literature mortal engines is unfortunately not very good and while external factors did it no favours its not hard to see why it ended up becoming the biggest flop of 2018 the two main characters share no chemistry character development is incredibly rushed and the plot takes so many cues from other movies most notably star wars that it ended up showing the 50 people who went to see this movie on the big screen that it takes more than sortof like transformers meets mad max to stand out among postapocalyptic ya movies i had fun with mortal engines every now and then but if you were hoping the sequel would pull a wrath of khanfat chance of that happening even if sometime in the future everybody starts calling this the most underrated movie of the 2018 if not the last decade
Jul 31 2020,positive,in a day where movies have no more originality and creativity mortal engines is a breath of fresh air most movies these day seem to be churned out sequels with generic plots yet audiences seem to gobble them up most of my movie going experiences these past years end in disappointment i miss the days when movies were a sense of wonder watching the original star wars indiana jones jaws terminator superman and tron leaving the cinema you were left with a sense of awe and the movies wouldnt leave your mind    mortal engines was original the special effects didnt distract from the story but instead enhanced it it felt like a new experience and not a rehash of something done better in the past more movies like this should be made and encouraged the fact that it didnt make money at the box office is disappointing as it means studios will be more likely to rehash something that was previously successful for an undemanding audience
Jul 15 2020,negative,mortal engines the movies got a very interesting look either that being the costume designs for the characters or it being some of the sets designs    also theres some decent fight scenes throughout this movie but apart from that nothing isnt really built up well for certain moments throughout this movie    overall apart from those little positives its a very boring movie the reasons being is the plot its a very basic but not a very interesting story to keep me entertained and same goes for the events which happen throughout this movie    the events throughout this movie arent built up very well to make us feel anything for these characters they just feel very rushed and also the characters throughout this movie arent very memorable at all its not worth the watch lol
Jul 15 2020,positive,the story seems interesting at first glance but then it starts to feel cheesy for some reason it feels like some parts of the story are too rushed and the others parts are too slow there is just some kind of unbalance in this film and i was even more surprised to see its writers director and producers it could have been much better
Jul 14 2020,positive,a brexit allegory  social comment earned this worth 12 extra stars to me  original
Jul 6 2020,negative,plots contrive everywhere bland characters arcs generic and boring plot and super cool cgi thats why the movie is bad
Jun 28 2020,positive,i cannot believethis is not an emily blunt movie i thought for the longest time that the lady on the cover was emily blunt but ill try not to hold that against it    the movie is well cast and amazingly produced all the moving parts and intricacies of the traction cities are very well done and the world is actually fairly rich    there are problems like why the hell anyone would actually build the traction cities on such a massive scale or if they would be able to in any situation where they would be needed    there is an entire movies worth of potential backstory on the lazarus squad alone    the biggest fault is just that they do try and make a twist with the villain instead of doing some establishing scenes to explain the villains perspective instead the villain and his followers come of as blood thirsty psychopaths    giant things dont do it for me im more of an antman fan than pacific rim both great movies though but if youre a kaiju fan godzilla or pacific rim then there is definitely something here for you    the writing is pretty good and the plot on the main characters really works theres plenty of action and cool stuff to look at in between plot points    good movie can recommend and can certainly see myself watching this again
Jun 7 2020,positive,between 25 and 3 stars good special effects charismatic characters and even not a bad environment but the story is too weak and childish
May 31 2020,negative,great great cgi but the whole movie gradually falls apart in plot
May 25 2020,positive,after seeing it again i still find it my favourite movie out there as a fan of the books i understood everything that is going on and that probably helps a lot but even without reading it i still thought that it was not that hard to understand the plot is constantly moving forward with a fast pace which i really love it is hard to get bored 978  i dont give full marks because yes it looks a bit like start wars and the ending robed a plotline in the fourth book if they would continue with this saga which wont happen i know the visuals are the best i have ever seen apart from star wars 1067 junkie xls score didnt disappoint me at all and gave me some of my favourite sounds i have ever heard 872 over all i loved every single bit of it and it will be my favourite movie for a long time score  972
May 15 2020,positive,watched on cable and it was actually good  it looked  bad from the trailers
May 4 2020,positive,too long however its a interesting concept id would have liked the same pizzaz as lord of the rings but hey it is what it is
Apr 23 2020,negative,thought i was going to see a mad max but with giant city mechs that part was all in the first 5 minutes the rest of the movie was a paper thin anti whiteeuropean colonizer narrative all the villains in the movie are all old white dudes most getting destroyed instantly in embarrassing ways long periods of boring backstory that doesnt pan out and cgi vistas they thought were really cool
Apr 23 2020,negative,its potential to be a successful franchise is totally wasted with a convoluted and incoherent story overuse on exaggerated cgi unrelatable characters and an overreliance on young adult and scifi movie cliches that ultimately serves as a footnote to peter jacksons once estimated career
Apr 21 2020,neutral,i am honestly flabbergasted with this garbage adaptation of the ya scifi fantasy novel philip reeve mortal engines differs a lot from the book and the characters are worse to the point where you can barely distinguish them as characters it becomes extremely cliche none of the characters stand out and they even mess up their appearances hester is massively downgraded tom is annoying rather than likable fang has a change in accent and shrike looks like a terminator ripoff they changed the ages of tom and hester for no apparent reason other than probably oh look look how attractive these people are ooooooh the story is also generic and the final act is entirely unoriginal there is some decent acting but they lack good onscreen chemistry most notably robert sheehan and hera hilmar the visual effects special effects and score by junkie xl are the only good things that stick out best  overall mortal engines is a generic boring cliche and lifeless movie that lacks the imagination that made philip reeves book and entire quartet unique you ask me stick to the book series
Apr 19 2020,positive,wow this is one of the most intensely creative movies ive seen in a long time  i thought the plot was good enough to carry us through this wild adventure in a truly unique and imaginative new world  the creativity was outstanding
Apr 19 2020,positive,following a cataclysmic conflict known as the sixty minute war the remnants of humanity regroup and form mobile cities called traction cities under a philosophy known as municipal

no shortage of eyecatching special effects but lacks enough highoctane narrative fuel to give this futuristic fantasy sufficient cinematic combustion the guardians film critic peter bradshaw gave the film 25 stars describing it as steampunk star wars with a bit of lowoctane gilliam and gaiman on the side bradshaw also characterized mortal engines as a tiringly frenetic and derivative fantasyadventure movie similarly the daily telegraphs tim robey awarded mortal engines 25 stars describing the film as a a mechanical soulless dystopian theme park ride to nowhere variety reviewer andrew barker praised mortal enginess opening chase sequence but criticized the unwieldy baffling exhausting and unintentionally hysterical plot development while praising the films emotional depth and junkie xls score barker compared mortal engines unfavorably to other science fiction films such as cloud atlas and valerian and the city of a thousand planets new zealand news website stuff reviewer graeme tuckett awarded 4 out of 5 praising director christian rivers for the films tone pacing choreography sets and costumes while noting the films references to other series including star wars mad max and the city of lost children sandra hall of the sydney morning herald praised peter jackson for his worldbuilding and mortal enginess social political and historical commentary awarding

role as shrike opining that he injected some muchneeded humanity into an otherwise fully mechanical film ben kenigsberg of the new york times observed that the movie borrowed elements from other films including star wars mad max the matrix and the lord of the rings david fear of rolling stone described the film adaptation as a steampunk frankensteins monster made from spare parts giving it 25 out of 5glenn kenny of rogerebertcom awarded the film 15 out of 4 describing the films story pacing as laughably portentous and kitschy and likened the film to another boxoffice bomb the wachowskis jupiter ascending sandy schaffer of screen rant awarded the film 25 out of 5 praising mortal enginess world design and visuals but criticizing what she termed as its uninspired narrative and ungainly filmmaking    mortal engines is a postapocalyptic steampunk scifi adventure directed by christian rivers and with a screenplay by fran walsh philippa boyens and peter jackson based on the novel of the same name by philip reeve he published a blog post on july 19th 2017 that principal photography had ended and he had been invited to the set back in may of the same year he noted that he had been impressed by the actors and the sets mentioning that most of it looked very much as id imagined except for the bits which looked better i havent red philip reeves books but i do like this steampunk world the story and the social and political subtext within the storyline and i have no issues with the clear inspiration such as terry gilliams brazil the film was made from as many seem to point out for some reason we get great production design solid suspense its visually stunning and the film has great cgi i personally think the weak spot here is robert sheehan  as tom natsworthy he doesnt convince in his role nevertheless the film received negative reviews from critics some of whom praised the visual effects and score with most criticizing the direction screenplay and lack of personality the film grossed over 83 million worldwide against a production budget of at least 100 million and postproduction costs of nearly 150 million losing the studio an estimated 174 million and making it the biggest boxoffice bomb of 2018 a bit strange i think as i cant fully agree with all the negative reviews
Apr 18 2020,neutral,it is an interesting concept until the reality is there on the screen and then the absolute absurdity becomes the overwhelming take away from the movie  without a sufficient explanation as to how and why these cities are put on tracks and moved about the unanswered question subvert the story they are trying to tell  leaving a movie with a frustrated feeling is not entertainment  however the visuals are first rate
Apr 12 2020,neutral,this film was a colossal bomb at the box office which his a bit unfortunate but i understand why at the same time the story was pretty convoluted  messy plot points that werent needed  the most interesting character arrived  was gone pretty quickly visually mortal engines is stunning  how they created the cities was fun to watch but the film itself just fell short
Apr 1 2020,negative,a story taking place in the dystopian future aboard literal moving cities in the barren wasteland of europe the plot follows two characters tom  a historian aboard london and hester  a woman seeking revenge for her mothers murder together these two unlikely heroes team up in an inorganic sequence to fight for survival andyou know the rest     the cinematography of the movie from the boiler rooms of the mobile cities to the desolate deserts was good but not enough to save this movie from cliche dialogue an overlycomplicated plot and unoriginal storyline this movie was not good
Mar 31 2020,positive,i enjoyed it  the movie did what it was supposed to do and took me to another world for a few hours
Mar 25 2020,negative,this movie withholds key information that could help the audience understand whats happening and what the characters are talking about the movie introduces characters as if the audience should know who they are even amidst a quarantine and having literally nothing better to watch i still regret the 2hr 19min i wasted on watching this garbage its like they took everything they liked from every movie theyve ever seen and patched it together to make a movie let me save you 2hrs do not watch this if your still desperate read the wiki page its probably better anyway
Mar 23 2020,positive,great original story some good characters visually magnificent   peter jackson has a hard time telling a story in a short time after 2 long trilogies but this steampunkanimeterrygilliamesque story is still a pleasure to watch  enjoy
Mar 21 2020,positive,its interesting to see how it all slowly shows end develops throughout the movie in a different universe from what we know   questions are slowly turned to answers and the answers are turned to connections
Mar 20 2020,positive,a steampunk film with amazing visuals and stunning actors even if this film didnt deliver at the box office it delivered to my mind
Mar 11 2020,neutral,pretty interesting theme but a forgettable film
Mar 10 2020,negative,idk what to say only one good point the fx are not bad thats even not a good point
Mar 10 2020,positive,im a bit mixed about this one  after reading the book i actually do prefer the movie for the most part  there were some things that i liked better in the book especially regarding valentine  but i did decently enjoy this
Mar 9 2020,positive,why is everyone in this movie insanely attractive i mean yes most movie stars hold a certain level of attractiveness but usually there are only one maybe at best three that have me going well youre gorgeous every single main and secondary characters were damn fine it was ridiculous that being said entertaining movie a few funny moments about the past this always gets me what will live on from our time and decently enthralling action cant ask much more than that from a movie
Mar 8 2020,negative,storyscreenplay 155 an unfocused and overwrought piece of science fiction  the underlying premise of a mobile city is too silly to ignore    durationtempo 25 at 2 hours and 8 minutes its a long movie that felt much longer    cast  crew 35 cast was not bad but hugo weavings performance was superior    summary 25 the special effects were obviously expensive and well done but the underlying story was a bomb
Mar 7 2020,positive,based on the popular book series of the same name mortal engines fails to develop its main characters enough for the viewer to care but it does have some breathtaking visuals here peter jackson got the rights for these book series but handed the directing duties to his art director from king kong 2005 christian rivers in his film debut the movie i believe looks absolutely beautiful because of this but truthfully jackson should have directed it himself he already cowrote it and perhaps it would have come out a bit better the movie takes place in the future where the world went through an apocalypse of some sorts the remaining cities are on wheels and bigger cities consume other smaller towns and cities in order to get their resources here we follow hester shaw hera hilmar a bit of a mysterious young lady that is trying to kill the head of the guild historians thaddeus valentine hugo weaving thaddeus murdered hesters mother and shes been waiting years to strike when the city of london consumes a mining town that hester is on she attempts to kill thaddeus but is thwarted by the young tom natsworthy robert sheehan tom is a historian that had a dream of being a pilot but isnt well liked by his peers since hes truthfully kinda just a bit too normal tom stops hester and chases her through the city hester escapes but whispers to tom about thaddeus thaddeus overhears that tom knows a bit too much and attempts to kill him too tom and hester are soon left in the wild lands and have to rely on each other to get back to the city of london and stop thaddeus why you ask well thaddeus is gathering old tech and secretly creating a weapon out of the london city that will forever change everyones lives theres more to it of course and even more characters but i just wanted to say what the basics kinda was a lot of the other characters are kinda useless we get a side story involving thaddeus daughter katherine leila george and she literally is there to just take up time i actually had a decent time watching this movie but i felt like we could have gotten more from hester shes not a very likeable character if anyones likeable its tom but even then he doesnt really bring much to the table theres even a twist here but if youre paying attention its kinda a given halfway through the film for the most part this one is a pass for most people especially since its one of the biggest box office busts of all time but i would recommend at least a rent to see if you enjoy it the visuals alone are pretty great at least to check out
Mar 5 2020,positive,overall good movie a light watcher that doesnt use jargon or very complex elements its just that however a good movie not great not bad the developing story takes a while and is not very complex but if you want to just sit and watch a movie that doesnt require much thinking or complexity this is it
Mar 4 2020,positive,far out but i loved it
Mar 2 2020,neutral,couldnt get on board the floating cities steam punk is awesome but this was just a bit too much hot air see what i did there look not every movie a master filmmaker does is his best this is not jacksons best better than i could do but not my favorite
Feb 23 2020,positive,post apocalyptic adventure set in a refreshingly unique universe good watch and a break from all of the reboots and retreads in flight today are there holes yes but i enjoyed every minute of the story
Feb 20 2020,negative,unwatchable you cant go past the 1520 minute mark
Feb 18 2020,positive,i can see why some did not care for it i mostly liked it maybe 15 minutes too long but it looked great and was a fun ride
Feb 16 2020,positive,the movie fulfilled its mark
Feb 15 2020,positive,não esperava nada desse filme mas ele me divertiu bastante principalmente com todas as referências à star wars
Feb 15 2020,negative,the book was far better too many changes made glad theres no sequel planned
Feb 13 2020,negative,welcome to mortal engines the fourth film in this film franchise series or is it the fifth maybe the third this is what happens when there is a lack of defining exposition to the backstory it is attempting to create for its world the premise and worldbuilding in itself is intriguing the vfx are on par with the films ambitions the chase sequence of the motorized cities was exciting it is when they leave the promotional premise of the motorized cities that everything goes downhill without braking the biggest sin a film with this budget can have is having enticing settings but yet fail to have quality story and character arcs which is surprising considering peter jackson produced and wrote the screenplay because of the lack of proper character development we dont care about the protagonists except for the zombie robot character known as shriek their performances are forgetful and the dialogue deplorable since it seems like this film is trying to revive the ya adapted film franchise from a few years ago like the hunger games divergent and maze runner its attempts of romantic chemistry misses by a wide margin the villain was expectedly a one sided character for those reasons it reminds me of 2017s valerian and the city of a thousand planets since i havent read the novel i felt excluded by the films adaption of the worlds terminology and for not simplifying its lore like lord of the rings and star wars does so well it is good to cater to fans of the book but without alienating and confusing a new audience this feeling of lost is only enhanced by having the predictable plot run all over the place with clocking over 2 hours it felt it dragged a bit too long all in all i commend the studio in trying to create a new world for us to be immerse i wouldnt mind visiting this setting again if we do we should not forget the most simplest attributes of a great story
Feb 6 2020,positive,not as horrific as the 26 on rotten tomatoes would have you believe weta alum christian rivers and his team are still creating mostly flawless and grand cgi creations and exquisite is under utilised set work the story and dialogue and pacing is bunk but then again it always is in ya fiction adaptations at least mortal engines has some spectacle and grandeur the actors are uninspired and arcless with forced romances but thats par for the course for these films without the excellent world to draw from from reeces novels sure its saddled with the silly expository names of things we dont understand antitractionists and quantum weapons and it strains under the weight of too many storylines and a meaningless third act and some weightless flashbacks but its almost almost good i can see it peering through and i had a very fun experience expecting the worst rivers team probably did the heavy lifting because as a director he composes wonderful sequences with no heft and no attachment the film is badly casted and character designs are cartoony and the music is desperately trying to do its best lord of the rings fan tribute its big broad colourful saturday morning cartoon fun with a big budget and a load of spirit just not good chops in the right place an actual director would have made the characters and the stakes pop a little more than just the massive machines and the battles
Jan 30 2020,positive,its been two years and i still think about this movie
Jan 29 2020,negative,schizophrenic script shallow character depth  cg looked like reused templates  needed jlo and ben to complete the trifecta of crap
Jan 23 2020,negative,peter jacksons hey day is long gone this was garbage 
Jan 17 2020,negative,the first half is quite fun if you can get over the absurd internal logic of the film but as it progresses off just gets more and more tiresome 
Jan 12 2020,positive,loved it i hope they make sequel cannot believe the low rating
Jan 3 2020,negative,basically a modern digital effects remake of star wars with a bunch of victorian era clothes copper and well cogs and stuff the film is badly made shallow and overwhelmingly artificial not to mention improbable and unintentionally funny in concept perhaps this film should have been shown only for jacksons immediate friends and family in mirimar new zealand as global audiences showed almost no interest in the product after its release date
Dec 30 2019,negative,poor visuals awful dialogue cheesy moments and bad acting do no favors for an already questionable premise
Dec 28 2019,positive,a very enjoyable  really wellcrafted film comfortably surpasses the usual output of this genre 
Dec 27 2019,positive,an incredibly enjoyable and engaging film if youre able to suspend your disbelief enough to accept the premise of predator cities then the rest of the films characters and beautifully designed sets will take you into a wonderful world of adventure
Dec 24 2019,positive,i think it was highly intriguing and had a great story its only major downfall being a late release for this type of movie had it been released a few years earlier i feel it would have had a greater following even with the limitations of cgi at the time
Dec 23 2019,positive,really really liked it  almost did not watch because of negative reviews  maybe they dont like fantasy movies  best movie ive seen in awhile 
Dec 20 2019,positive,such a fresh new take on movie idea was completely engaged in this movie and had lots of fun with it some pacing issues but in the end was a enjoyable from start to finish has a satisfying ending and leaves the door open for more but doesnt require it if a sequel does not happen
Dec 20 2019,positive,do not listen to the bad reviews see it yourself it was great the plot was well written and the visuals astonishing also had some good humor
Dec 18 2019,positive,a fantastic film with a concept and story that i think has been unfairly maligned it appears to be a good adaptation of the source book and the only pacing mistake is that the climax was slightly too far from the end but that is hardly the movie killer people have made it out to be the characters were interesting the story was engaging and exciting and i thoroughly enjoyed it
Dec 18 2019,negative,its just a shame in how peter jackson doesnt brings the same energy like the lord of the rings or the hobbit he should be direct this thing
Dec 17 2019,negative,terrible couldnt get involved with it at all nothing fetching about it 
Dec 14 2019,positive,that was a lot better than the reviews needs a bit of character development but otherwise we all enjoyed that 
Nov 28 2019,positive,this movie is solid the story is weak but the visual splendor and cool action sequences make it entertaining to watch
Nov 24 2019,positive,even the worst person can change for the one whom he loves the main idea of the movie was love and we can see that the person even though he tells that he does not love the one is still deep in the heart loves himher the main drawback of the movie was that the robot that hunted the girl should not have died this was the main drawback for me however i liked the movie a lot and would suggest to watch it
Nov 15 2019,positive,not as bad as people make out
Nov 14 2019,positive,with peter jackson leading the way i had high expectations coming into this movie in the end i think that was mortal engines downfall although not by much this movie would have been better received with a newcomer at the helm entertaining at times the movie never really gets the blood flowing like it could have however the world building is absolutely brilliant
Nov 13 2019,positive,not sure what all the ick reviews are about it really was well done with special effects story and acting well done 
Nov 11 2019,positive,loved this movie  its a favorite  i dont get the hate at all  very creative and action packed with great acting
Nov 5 2019,negative,more failed ya  so this is a universe where the apocalypse only took an hour to alter the entire world  its not really clear why but cities and towns now roam the countryside with the biggest metropolises ingesting the smaller villages for fuel  sounds crazy right  well that is only a small part of the equation because there are two young people with romantic tension a tyrannical leader a conspiracy and a whole lot of familiar tropes  now when it comes to young adult franchises lets face it they want every single one of these things to have 4  8 movies you really have three factions studios trying to get that harry potter money studios trying to get that twilight money and studios trying to get that hunger games money  mortal engines falls mostly into column c but even then it doesnt even feel like one of the good knockoffs  this is closer to divergent than anything and we all know how that turned out interest waned so quickly that they canceled their last movie  if youve been tracking these movies in any capacity it should come as no surprise that this is one of the biggest box office bombs of all time  now i spent the entirety of this movie thinking that this was directed by peter jackson  i was shocked because once the opening action sequence was finished this started to just spin its wheels and even when he is at his worst peter jackson is at least watchable  then i found out as the end credits were rolling that he was just a producer and that made everything else make more sense  this movie is just a hodgepodge of better science fiction films and it is watered down to the point that any unique flavor is completely washed out  you have terminator matrix and even some star wars and because it is lifting from such iconic properties you can see right through it  there is a difference between paying homage and ripping off something and they clearly think that because they made everything steampunk they have a pass to steal from the greats  i dont really blame the actors in this but everybody in this is playing a type  you can tell who is good and who is bad as soon as they show their face and honestly you can probably figure out who the bad guy is simply by giving the cast list a quick once over  it doesnt take the time to build characters it just gives exposition in flashbacks thinking that is going to give you enough of a reason to care  it doesnt  this movie is clunky as can be  i can tell that it has a big budget and that they funneled money in from many different angles but that doesnt change the fact that for the majority of the time i felt like i was just looking at a special effect because they never take the time to make me care about any of these characters i dont care about what is exploding on screen  mortal engines is marginally watchable at points but you can do so much better especially when you consider that this is over two hours long
Nov 3 2019,negative,terrible movie beautifully made but contains all the cliches and even more
Nov 2 2019,neutral,basically this is the antithesis of the hobbit as where hobbi was at best a movie and a half worth of material stretched out across three films engines is easily two movies condensed into one in doing so character and story development is severely weakened to the point that you just dont care what happens to anyone on screen its other great failing are some lackluster performances that being said goddamn this movie looks gorgeous the final battle scene is a fantasy fans wet dream the bstory the murderous surrogate zombieandroid yes that is a thing is actually the strongest part of the movie there is little here for the casual fantasy fan but fanboys and fangals can not afford to miss it
Oct 29 2019,positive,yet another movie where the actual critics dont think its any good while us normal people do i just saw this through hbo or something when att gave 3 days free now im adding the dvd to my wish list for those who found it hard to follow the plots pay more attention
Oct 28 2019,negative,initially i dismissed this movie entirely because of the titles similarity to the mortal instruments some twilight knockoff that got bad reviews and was only fit to be seen by teenagers i was wrong i should have dismissed it because its not good and is fit to be seen by pretty much nobody i kind of feel bad saying that because it tries it really tries but this is a story that requires too much worldbuilding in too little time and is filled with poorly established characters who have poorly written dialogue and are mostly poorly acted this is a film adaptation of a book about a weirdo fantasy steampunk dystopian future world where entire cities exist on wheels moving around like tanks if it sounds ludicrous thats because it is im not even sure how this premise possibly worked in a novel we are told that its 1000 years in the future and that this state of affairs is the result of something called the 60minute war but thats the extent of the background information given and the audience is left befuddled and wondering what the hell this movie is even about from the very beginning you are blasted right into the middle of the story with hardly any explanation then the movie spends the rest of the film trying to catch you up awkwardly the exposition is so rushed and forced you never truly understand what is going on and the story falls flat this is director christian rivers first feature film and it really shows this kind of a story needed a more deft hand at the helm to maximize its potential aside from the narrative blunders the films leads are primarily unknowns and the acting is okay at best cringeworthy at worst granted the dialogue isnt easy to deliver and im sure even meryl streep would have struggled with it but the guy that plays the main protagonist is beyond awful you are supposed to be rooting for him but he was so annoying i just kept hoping hed die ill give hera hilmar credit she is as good as she could be in the lead role and really does her best to convince you that her character as well as this entire world was worth caring about but still i didnt ill give it props for the effects and production design they are both pretty cool and make this movie pretty to look at but the botched storytelling prevents this movie from being anything more than superficial eye candy
Oct 28 2019,negative,this movie is a human rights violation
Oct 27 2019,negative,what a stinker the engine based towns  cities are pretty cool for about 30 seconds the characters are mostly soulless  annoying a great idea that was somehow ruined 
Oct 20 2019,positive,i had not come across the book series before watching this film so had no idea what to expect i was happily surprised as this film was really good the story itself felt epic and the cast were a credit to the film i was gripped throughout and found the  plot to be a heavy hitter sure pacing wasnt its strong point and it feels like there is a lot of back story missing to make this a great movie but i thoroughly enjoyed it and felt like i went on an emotional rollercoaster with films based on book series i ultimately feel they are a success if i a want to see the next movie b want to read the books well i know it performed badly in cinema but i hope we get a sequel and i will most definitely check the books out  recommend it i do 
Oct 20 2019,negative,great effects but the story was off alor 
Oct 19 2019,negative,white adults are the villains yet again its heavy with some decent cgi but the story is a disappointing mess
Oct 19 2019,positive,if you have read the books the underdevelopment of the characters within the film is compensated by their wonderfull development within the books the film tries admirably to cover every part of the multiple subplots from the books in 2 hours which is great from an existing fans points of view this may leave firsttime viewers unsatisfied with what could be seen as pointless underdeveloped subplots  overall watch the film before reading any reviews and you will be enthralled by the world you get sucked into
Oct 18 2019,negative,lets make a movie that cities eats other cities argument lets make a collage with themes of other movies that we have watched mostly star wars mortal engines
Oct 17 2019,positive,great concept dont listen to all the haters  just watch and judge for yourself
Oct 17 2019,positive,it was an amazing movie highly underrated action packed well developed characters would easily watch again
Oct 16 2019,positive,i enjoyed it bit daft but i thought it was decent
Oct 14 2019,negative,this film is hilariously funny for all the wrong reasons
Oct 13 2019,negative,my lord what a fluff piece of material everything that surrounded was good to look at its too bad that the characters were nothing now this is based on some books and i dont know how the characters were translated but all semblances of characters was just bland the entire film was bland no surprises no involvement with any characters and the story just hiccup every once in a while it was a mess everything was overshadowed and the main characters werent that interesting the only real drawback was seeing the main character and the robotlike individual shared some backstory that was interesting everything else i didnt really care much too defined to be of much semblance yes its well to look at but thats about it it looks worthwhile but it isnt 
Oct 12 2019,negative,the concept to the worls was great but it was awful spent the last q5 minutes waiting for this big signal what was the point on the scene building that up and the main character was awful and was just uwu im so edgy and i cant be happy then its the end and shes actually happy and i think they were trying to hint at love between her and the guy which really wouldnt work
Oct 11 2019,positive,much better than its rating good movie
Oct 10 2019,negative,may be the worst movie ive ever seen probably worse than gigli  the plot was nonsense the acting was horrendous and the special effects looked like they were done using 1980s technology  biggest waste of 2 hours ever
Oct 9 2019,positive,overall it was a pretty good movie with potential to have great sequels to bad we will jot get those sequels for a long time aince the movie bombed at the box office any luck netflix will commission a sequel
Oct 8 2019,positive,whats wrong with mortal engines its that it seems so like other films released within the last 23 years that its easy to dismiss as derivative but this is a wunderkind of originality impressive worldbuilding characters you care about and action surprises enough for any 14 year old this will be a gem people come to revisit time and again
Oct 7 2019,positive,i watched it on hbo i liked it
Oct 7 2019,positive,i dont this movie was as bad as the critics made it out to be sure its no lotr but is it even possible to match the lotr series i found it entertaining enough 
Oct 4 2019,positive,actually a fun and interesting film with world building and possibilities wish we could have seen more from this world but unfortunately stupid ass critics who dont know how to enjoy films bashed it and because people cant make up their own minds about watching a film skipped out on something which was wonderful and had so much potential going forward 
Oct 2 2019,negative,wants to be star wars so bad
Sep 29 2019,positive,why all the hatin okay maybe going into this movie with such low expectations influenced my overall impression buuuutits a great movie interesting concepts and great characters played by believable actorsi was even moved at times is there something wrong with me the reviews are bashing this movie and i just dont get it 
Sep 23 2019,negative,did anyone else think this movie was incredibly racist  so the primary predator town was london which had a black face here or there but the diversity was not great  and the bad guy who is white wants to blow up the wall that is protecting a city of multiethnic people  but wait it gets better  as the bad guy is using his weapon of mass destruction against the multiethnic town the scene cuts to a group of all white people cheering and jeering but then the camera pans to the one black guy who is not cheering  but wait it gets better  it turns out that the only way to save the multiethnic city is for two white kids to get on an airship with the selfdestruct key  this is the worst kind of white savior complex  peter jackson we deserved better  this book did not deserve to become a movie rife with ethnic stereotypes and white savior complex
Sep 22 2019,neutral,it felt choppy and rushed for this reason it was very limited in some character development over all it had great potential if not crammed into one movie the story needed time to grow and breathe fail
Sep 21 2019,negative,about half way through i realized that theres no plot to this movie some cool visuals is about it couldnt take any more of it 
Sep 20 2019,neutral,despite some stunning and sometimes not so stunning visuals this movie never lifts me up to really be enthralled into the setting and story i think it has an amazing setting but i miss it being drenched in lore it could have used a dash of mystery wonder and soul
Sep 19 2019,positive,the visuals and universe were both stunning and stuffed full of wonderment and oddity acting on point in almost all cases some awkwardness and clearly difficult linesscenesportrayed emotions where the movie struggled was in its unfortunately mechanical pun not intended storyline which simply had too many obvious twists or forced plot advancement action was a but dull in most cases too and felt brushed over and rushed extra props to hera hilmar and hugo weaving who did a fantastic job and really helped suck me into the universe of mortal engines  probably would have been worth a trilogy    all in all 45 stars  because the universe leaves me very much wanting more good acting and extraordinary visuals not enough fantastical steampunk megamachine going around at all
Sep 18 2019,negative,wayyyyy too much going on definitely an interesting concept of moving cities but the actual plot had very little to do with that   had a few less characters been introduced and they took time to develop the main characters more i think it wouldve been solid probably not worth the watch
Sep 17 2019,negative,simultaneous wowcringe     also stop using hugo weaving for unholy films
Sep 16 2019,positive,im absolutely shocked at these reviews and ratings bizarre and displays another example of corrupt business practices and most likely paid by other studios to downplay the reputation of hbo because they are a threat as another major competitor in the film industry making great films    if you have not watched this please give it a shot and dont let these ratings and reviews trick you  it is definitely a film wrongly criticized because everything about it the plot screen writing the amazing acting and character development and special effects need be given more recognition
Sep 15 2019,positive,fun movie not oscar worthy but a little different and cool to watch loved anna
Sep 14 2019,negative,this is the worst film i watched this year  the worst acting and screenplay 
Sep 14 2019,negative,so once again white men are pure evil the west is bad and the funniest part if all the east is the mecca of freedom and peace lmfao and shriek was the dumbest subplot after canto blite this movie went from a solid 10 to 0 in 60 mins
Sep 11 2019,positive,i enjoyed most of the film but the ya feeling of it all kept taking me out of the story  still decently directed but maybe a bit miscast  still recommended for science fictionfantasy fans
Sep 9 2019,positive,this movie channels a lot of the filmmaking wonder that peter jackson and his creative team are known for      several scenes in this film show why the novel was such a popular piece of fantasy fiction  i would love to see these characters continue maybe as a miniseries  i wish this movie had done better as it had a lot of great fantasy ideas and locations that provide easy escapism
Sep 9 2019,positive,this was a good movie and another example of why hollywood shouldnt pay attention to critics it would have been better as an hbo or other premium cable channel series than a movie its faithful to the books unfortunately critics think its derivitive when it is not like the first book this movie makes me want more definately a must see 
Sep 8 2019,positive,a little confusing at times but pretty fun nonetheless  
Sep 8 2019,positive,its excellent world building
Sep 7 2019,neutral,expecting the film to be a worldwide commercial success peter jackson regrettably plastered his name all over this box office bomb because it employed much of his lord of rings production team unfortunately over the past decade multiple megahits have outshined all of mortal engines dystopian adventure elements the end result leaves us with a sauté of hightech rotating gear cgi thats too heavily overshadowed by its shopworn plot
Sep 7 2019,negative,i was looking foward to watching this movie but feel asleep a half our into it
Sep 6 2019,positive,entertaining did a great job of world building and starting a framchise hugo weaving is at his best 
Sep 5 2019,positive,i super enjoyed mortal engines  the movie was well cast  it has good action and the right amount  some movies overdue the with nonstop action  i had no interest in seeing it but really glad i did
Sep 5 2019,negative,why does this movie even exist
Sep 2 2019,negative,lets through a convoluted story up and through in the matrix and terminator for no reason 
Sep 1 2019,positive,pretty good moviegreat acting pretty good plot and amazing cinematography good for a lazy sunday flick
Sep 1 2019,positive,it was entertaining and has plenty of action the story did not go as deep as it should have there were deep roots and interesting reveals that were not pursued or thoroughly explored it was a lot of interesting story that was edited and summarized despite those things i was entertained 
Aug 31 2019,negative,quickly in the so bad its kinda good category  love big budget steampunk  if youre nerdy you might not mind watching it some references we all appreciate and a few laughs at the expense of the producers and directors  cant say the actors were even trying
Aug 30 2019,positive,youre a bunch of negative assholes
Aug 29 2019,negative,its a steampunk star wars wannabe with no soul for all of the action it was dreadfully boring and the characters were about as deep as a puddle
Aug 28 2019,positive,the story is kind of a mashup of prior dystopian plots  good acting and effects so it wasnt boring but not very compelling either
Aug 27 2019,positive,no lord of the rings
Aug 27 2019,negative,decent fantasy but slow moving
Aug 27 2019,positive,fascinating collage of future past with a wonderful collection of techno science fiction adventures
Aug 26 2019,positive,this was a good story original characters good effects save the world theme a cliche but told well should have a higher rating
Aug 26 2019,positive,this film is very beautiful and full of action with incredible special effects but it has some flaws like some parts too obvious that can be predicted practically from the beginning also i find absurd the fact that throughout europe london has remained the only one superpower however the film is very addictive and makes you spend two hours of watching very well without ever getting bored last point the character with green eyes is almost useless for the purposes of the plot except for the central part
Aug 26 2019,positive,i loved it  as a fan of this genre i thought it was great 
Aug 26 2019,positive,this could have been a great movie but it switched from a movie about massive machines to a love story so quick that a mclaren couldnt catch up to it not to mention the terminator subplot that this film sidetracks to this film doesnt know what its doing and neither do i solid start everything that follows is daft
Aug 26 2019,negative,such a stupid idea for a movie
Aug 25 2019,positive,great story different than anything ive seen action packed and keeps you coming back
Aug 25 2019,negative,dont waste your time on this slow film
Aug 25 2019,negative,wowso yet another craptacular offering from the guy who took a dump on tolkiens lord of the rings and an even more epic dump on the hobbit only peter jackson could spend so much money on such a large ball of overwrought confusion lacking anything resembling entertainment lol giant cities on wheels sneaking up on smaller giant cities on wheelscharacters that sort of kind of feel a bit developed yep a pj special but on the plus side there cant be much chance of anyone backing one of his projects again after this     
Aug 25 2019,positive,dont understand the poor score this film was great
Aug 25 2019,positive,i cant believe aqua man has 66 when this film is in the 20s this was so much more entertaining and original
Aug 25 2019,positive,way more enjoyable than i expected maybe not worthy of a trip to the theater but worth your time watching due to the world building and visuals the story and dialogue were rather weak at times but the actors were for the most part passable enough
Aug 25 2019,positive,good movie i think its being very underrated
Aug 23 2019,negative,this is a young adult book turned into a movie and it is a mess the story is poorly written leaving many plot points confused with unsatisfactory explanations the acting is passable but bland better only than the writing which is equally dull the only interesting parts of the movie were one single character and the visuals the costuming and vehicle design did a great job of building a world for the charactes to inhabit if only there were a story and threedimensional characters to go with them
Aug 22 2019,positive,great movie if you are into science fiction and futuristic type movies i thought it had a lot of great action scenes and cgi
Aug 19 2019,positive,entertaining and fun movie
Aug 18 2019,positive,outlandish premise but once past that the world building was entertaining enough and the visuals wonderful  familiar tropes and predictable dialogue means its fun to pretend its paralleling scenes from star wars or terminator
Aug 8 2019,positive,enjoyed this movie interesting story line visually amazing acting and some characters could have been better but overall an entertaining flick
Aug 7 2019,positive,highly underrated sure it probably would have been better as a six episode or more series to allow space to flesh out the various story lines and characters but they did a really great job rendering the tale as a standalone film
Aug 7 2019,positive,a typical adventure story for kids the new version of something nostalgic
Aug 6 2019,positive,once again peter jackson has done it and once again movie critics show their complete and utter disconnect from viewers as a true geek and lover of stories this film really did it for me much like with stardust hogfather the colour of magic lotr the world felt lived in tangible everything had a place and a place had everything my one drawback and it really is only one was the lack of character development maybe we will get more of it in the sequel but i didnt quite grow to love the characters as much or care what happened to them there were just too many i suppose thats what happens when you shove a novel into a movie many of the professional critics on this site and others will depreciate is how the cities move or how the earth still has vegetation or something like that it doesnt matter and its been 1000 years get over it and try to immerse yourself in something other than michael bay great movie if you like to immerse yourself in stories and or have a brain 
Jul 29 2019,positive,it was entertaining  and a fresh spin on scifi  even if it is a bit ridiculous
Jul 26 2019,negative,boring story wooden acting
Jul 26 2019,negative,on the positive side the movie looks gorgeous a steam punk fans delight  the story however is so bad especially if you know how great the novels are this is a sadly bereft of life carcass of its literary source  i expected a lot more by the lord of the rings brilliantly talented writing time but they dropped the ball on this one very very badly  the cast doesnt help here with the exception of jihae as anna fang who is quite charismatic whenever she is on screen but even her part to no fault of hers is riddled with cliche plot points and trite dialogue  hugo weaving as main villain is a one note actor and one note role so nothing new there  hera hilmar the main heroine is such a stock cliche character i felt more emotional connection withe the android shrike stalking her than with her  robert sheehan is a very annoying tom with the constant helpless stare into the camera reminding me of elija wood in his most annoying frodo moments and i kept wishing him to have a lethal accident  and thats reallyu all there is to it great visuals very bad adaptation of great source material that deserved so much more and finally a one dimensional cast delivering the final fatal stroke that made this movie tank at the box office  saddest thing is we will now probably never see the kind of adaptation these great novels deserve and thats a loss
Jul 22 2019,negative,i was so hyped for this film having been a major fan of the books for many years and actually working at weta digital who were doing the vfx i wanted to like this movie so much the visuals are amazing and hugo weaving steals the show but the script and much of the acting or at least character directing is horrible they even fundamentally changed the bittersweetgoosebumpinducing ending to settle for a more happily ever after climax dont bother seeing this film just read the books  
Jul 21 2019,negative,interesting at first then it subtly becomes a racist antiwhite male fest
Jul 20 2019,negative,what did i waste my time on a good dvd movie when you need to be bored to sleep 
Jul 14 2019,positive,character development feels rushed and minimal but i feel like this film is about a culture that is going 200mph 247 making everything less personal and more objective based great film
Jul 10 2019,positive,excellent world building i found it very enjoyable once the shakycam settled down you have to be a true sci fi fan and enjoy british filmmaking to take this one to heart
Jul 6 2019,positive,i liked this i wasnt disappointed by this movie  
Jul 5 2019,negative,pretty to look at but makes no sense  subpar acting and horrible dialog
Jun 27 2019,neutral,this movie was all over the place the beginning didnt start off too forward had a good build to it but once the intentions for the rest of the movie were revealed it went downhill from the poorly written lines and the timing that they were executed to the story in general  super rushed it would have done better as a series it had great potential 
Jun 26 2019,negative,the movie lacks flow i have listened to the whole mortal engines series on audio book i am afraid the movie adaptation does nothing to do it justice the plot of the movie differs way too much from the novels
Jun 23 2019,negative,super antiamerican and ahistorical its funny cause the author could never write this story in china about china  its only the american system that gives him to freedom to write this filth 
Jun 20 2019,positive,it wasnt that bad i found it entertaining  might not be exactly like the book but it was pretty close  i am not a big peter jackson fan either 
Jun 17 2019,negative,if you enjoyed jupiter rising youll probably like this personally im pretty over big budget dumpster fires 12 star for the skeleton guys music and violence
Jun 16 2019,negative,this movie was the basic revenge type movie it was an okay storyline nothing out of the usual
Jun 15 2019,negative,yeah just not that great  very disjointed and tried to show a grand world and tell a grand story without much context or time
Jun 14 2019,negative,good special effects  bad story telling  boring characters long movie
Jun 12 2019,positive,nice to be suprised  this movie definitely was much better than the low scores would lead you to believe  ok it wont get prizes for being clever and the story line made it feel a bit like a james bond movie set in a steam punk future world   but having said that the characters are great and the look  feel is spectacular  i enjoyed it very much more than i expected   
Jun 11 2019,neutral,beyond the underdeveloped gimmick of steampunk cities on wheels the plot and characters are so mechanical that things stall out before they really have a chance to get rolling   
Jun 9 2019,negative,yeah you all know why youre here fx thats it thats all you get script is bad acting is mediocre fx are not worth the buck wait for the torrent
Jun 9 2019,neutral,ok so let me start this review by explaining my initial thoughts on this movie and its basic premise as im sure many are aware the basic idea in this movie is how civilisation has crumbled after a devasting war and the remaining humans have for some reason decided to mount all the remaining cities on wheels so they can drive them around so to speak well although this sounds cool on paper in a kind of igamesworkshopi related way i also found it to be simply ludicrous    obviously i know this is based on a fantasy novel and the entire concept is outlandish sciencefiction but really so firstly i would have to ask how the feck mankind is supposed to have put their cities onto such huge chassis this would mean they would have had to dig up famous landmarks such as st pauls in london load them onto the chassis and then somehow fix them in place to said chassis i then found myself asking what about the rest of london how did they decide what to save are all the other buildings custom made for the new londononwheels or have they also been dug up and planted on the chassis    i then found myself asking the most fundamental question i think what is the actual point in building or putting a city on wheels how does that benefit the city i mean yeah sure you could move it to the coast in the summer but it just seems so utterly stupid just looking at these things they look so fragile vulnerable and in one case completely top heavy a neat fantasy idea for a cool image and again it sounds wicked on paper but when you actually see it in live action and try to think about it logically it raises bsob many questions also the fact that mankind has done this after an apocalyptic event really makes little sense not to mention the fact they still seem to have a lot of technology materials food water and working men to actually build all this stuff these vast mobile cities are damn impressive feats yet they go around destroying each other    my last nagging question relates to the land itself it seems that the surface of the earth has changed since the 60 minute war and countries like the uk have now joined mainland europe  anyway considering how vast the mobile city of london is and i assume some other cities it got me wondering if there was enough space on the land for all these mobile metropolises heck even the smaller mobile cities are pretty big and its indicated there are many of them i mean you could ask the same about oceangoing cruise liners in our present day and obviously there is plenty of ocean for lots but if there were loads all roaming around on their own accord im sure there would be problems this also led to me ask what state the land would be in these gigantic mobile cities tearing and grinding up the earth as they piledrive along the land would be wrecked flattened no trees no plant life no animal life a complete wasteland    as for the actual movie well its a mixed bag really and does indeed remind you of some other large budgeted scifi movie failures of recent first off it is very much your bog standard istar warsi type clone with all the usual bog standard characters mix in some other very common elements from some other well known classic franchises i dont even need to mention them and this is the inevitable result the only aspect of this movie that was slightly fresh was the steampunk aspect which i liked    but yeah you have your standard unwilling hero who finds himself thrust into a war of which he was somewhat naive about and in this case looks disturbingly like justin trudeau the standard strong female character who is trying to get revenge the standard wellspoken leader who is actually behind closed doors the nasty villain and then basically a whole load of background characters doing the usual stuff for both sides i also have to mention that yet again we have a clear case of all the goodies being a multicultural bunch whereas all the baddies are all white just like in ithe last jedii a strange and increasingly obvious hollywood trend    i mean in all honesty aside from the admittedly cool and intriguing visuals there isnt really that much going on here it has the exact beats both character and plotwise you would expect from a scifi feature of this ilk literally scene for scene in one sequence the main villain thaddeus valentine hugo weaving wants to unleash this cyborg from a prison so it can hunt down and kill the main hero hester shaw hera hilmar now weavings character is highly important in this movie he has sway and power yet in order to release this cyborg he destroys the entire prison killing everyone couldnt he get this thing out without doing that this attack also highlights how vulnerable and badly designed these mobile vehicles are in this case a spiderlike walking prison one shot to a leg joint and down it goes    and speaking of the cyborg a clear terminator ripoff called shrike what was that all about from what i can gather these things were men that have been killed in battle and then resurrected with mechanical body parts and apparently there was an entire army of them this particular one looked after hester as a child after her mother had been murdered why this killer cyborg decided to do this i dont know but the really odd thing is the fact that the cyborg offers to turn hester into an undead cyborg because she is suffering depression from the murder of her mother hester agrees  and makes a promise with shrike but in changing her mind hester breaks that promise which triggers shrike to continually hunt her down in order to kill her and transform her into an undead cyborg eh this entire subplot was just idiotic and was completely pointless to the movie you could literally remove it all utterly aimless    of course shrike eventually tracks hester down to a city in the sky yes thats right a city in the sky in the clouds if you willahem and in the ensuing battle the city starts to fall apart shrike gets badly damaged and hester does find her original love for shrike is reignited as the cyborg is obviously about to expire and in typical action movie fashion despite the entire city falling apart around them with explosions and debris both hester and shrike manage to muster enough time in order to have an emotional farewell in true iterminatori fashion    so yeah suspension of disbelief is required for this movie whilst that might sound obvious for a scifi fantasy its a bit different for this one seeing as its sorta supposed to reflect upon certain obvious political issues of our current time such as capitalism climate change easily manipulated governmental systems nonrenewable energy etccities that eat and absorb other cities which only benefits the few in the cities instead of everyone which would possibly lead to a better future basically saying or highlighting how society cancould eat itself this can be easily detected in the story but the scifi element is so zany with its wheeled warrior cities the social commentary kinda gets smothered not to mention the sheer quantity of horrendous greenscreen effects and shots stand aside istar warsi prequels theres a new joker in town    so yeah the wheeled tanklike cities concept is engaging but ultimately really stupid the rest of it is by the numbers science fiction which can be somewhat fun but only when the characters are actually onboard some kind of moving vehicle they arent very good characters thats why once they fall off onto the ground the movie literally stops dead which is weird when you think about it this is a highly imaginative and packed world for sure but as said before it owes so much to other films and tries to do too much i felt like i was watching the final movie in a trilogy or more the movie really feels like it needs sequels but i doubt that will happen one thing i will say i reckon this has future cult status written all over it    
Jun 8 2019,positive,its a fantastic premise didnt buy some of the acting and more needed to be explained of the world ideallybut really enjoyed it feel like its the new generations water world even if not perfectly executed its great fun and super enjoyable
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was okay and thats about all i can say
Jun 7 2019,positive,it got me curious about the books
Jun 4 2019,neutral,great special effects but the story is unbelievable on many fronts
Jun 1 2019,positive,the movie is refreshing scifi moving cities there are actually multiple important characters that could be on their own the hero  heroine that wins at the end strong and believable characters the detail in the movie is impressive some people gave this movie 1 or 2 star you cannot take those people serious i really enjoyed this movie and its going into my bluray collection of awesomeness 
May 27 2019,negative,mortal engines has a cool idea but it just didnt make sense and was not able to be adopted into a feasible plot just too much was crammed into the movie the movie has some great visuals but lacks characterization storytelling pacing and above all direction just felt like we were jumping from scene to scene without any story build up or emotional connection the mediocre casting didnt help the matter much
May 23 2019,negative,this is a mess of a film the story is generic the two leads have no chemistry and the narrative jumps too quickly from one thing to the next the only good things about this movie are hugo weaving and the visual effects the trailers made it seem like this was going to be similar to mad max with  technologyvehicle battle sequences it was like that for the first 20 minutes and then it goes in a whole other direction and from that point loses steam this seems like it was a case of poor editing since the story jumps from plotline to plotline while at the same time not being clear enough 30 minutes in i was still not sure who the main protagonist was what the goal in the story was or what the stakes were that all becomes clear towards almost the end of the 2nd act it was a case of too little too late the visual effects are impressive though the machines are creative and the robot villain was terrifying and had such realistic motion capture but impressive visual effects alone do not a good movie make i did not feel any sort of connection with any of the main characters and i was confused about the goals and stakes for 85 of the movie  now i know why this went to my local discount theater after only 2 weeks and didnt even survive there since it was gone from even there 1 week later
May 22 2019,positive,i love the world building and the action scenes but the plot was weak the characters were flat and their relationships cliche
May 18 2019,positive,written by peter jackson with an ip thats supposed to match the grandeur of lotr mortal engines has a promising premise  packs amazing visual spectacle but i wish its more its part bioshock  more fallout my mum told me she likes it though  i asked her how much out of 10 she said 7 so 7 it is
May 17 2019,positive,i like it engaging and entertaining wasnt expecting an epic
May 17 2019,negative,the first hour is bearable the second hour degenerates into a pile cliches up to the point in becomes nigh unbearable ive not read the book and this film is not an endorsement
May 17 2019,positive,an unusual setting but i love it great job peter
May 17 2019,positive,i was surprised by how much i liked this movie def worth my time
May 16 2019,positive,it was fun and well acted but the film industry is very franchise heavy and it might struggle to succeed
May 12 2019,positive,absolutely loved this film hugely entertaining its nothing new at all but overall its just a blast the whole way through 
May 10 2019,negative,a big two hour long bag of clichï 12 12 cs with some visual effects and apparently computer generated actors
May 9 2019,negative,neat effects but so many plot holes just makes it was
May 8 2019,positive,having read the book this movie sadly does not live up to its standards all that aside the movie actually is fine its something youd want to watch an ordinary friday evening in lack of other types of entertainment
May 7 2019,positive,loved it 9 plus 10  and i have no idea why it bombed poor marketing   the film marketplace is too saturated  unbelievable im shocked to see that this film was truly unrated something is seriously wrong  when film this good doesnt do well
May 6 2019,negative,a lazy madmax rewrite stupid premise and bad acting 
May 6 2019,negative,all i can say is that its not good
May 5 2019,positive,lack of originality and poor marketing turned this steampunk fantasy into a failure but lets not forget that its true purpose is clearly to entertain not to impress  and in that entertaining part it succeeds
May 4 2019,positive,it was very cliche in a lot of places and jumbled and the premise is objectively silly but i absolutely loved it the emotion of a movie is very important to me and this one got me
May 4 2019,negative,its a concoction of plot points from various other distopian movies none of which it does well the shots are beautiful but seeing as it lacks a good cohesive storyline it leaves a lot to be desired
May 4 2019,positive,hundreds of years after civilization was destroyed by a cataclysmic event a mysterious young woman hester shaw hera hilmar emerges as the only one who can stop london  now a giant predator city on wheels  from devouring everything in its pathmortal engines is so damn enjoyable and beautiful to look at im kind of glad it exists the vehicle and world design is so aesthetically pleasing the phrase eye candy doesnt do it justice especially the elegant airships   with lots of impressive action enhanced by breathtakingly detailed cgi mortal engines is vibrant energetic and exciting  a little too overthetop at times but not distractingly so hester shaw hera hilmar is the big surprise here she puts in a strong performance and deserves to have a bright future ahead of her  when i watch a fantasy science fiction like mortal engines i just want to relax and be entertained and thats exactly what i got so im not the one whos going to complain just dont over analyze everything and enjoy the ride
May 1 2019,positive,not a masterpiece by any stretch but not anywhere near as bad as the critics scored it but lets be honest there are plenty of far far worse movies that get much kinder reviews
May 1 2019,negative,this film is the next generation of mystery science theater so awful its hilarious if youre going to invest the time to watch this horrible film based on poor writing shored up with bad acting and fair production then do it while drinking with friends that have a great sense of humor and a natural ability to deliver one liners otherwise i suggest you turn away and cover your ears
May 1 2019,positive,various character development was left out due to what i imagine was time constraint the rushed narrative in certain spots was really all i found lacking however in my enjoyment of the film
Apr 30 2019,negative,wow this would have been a great film in the 1980s lol it was overkill with the melodramatic lines and predictable plot points how much did they spend on this yikes
Apr 30 2019,positive,stunning  though many dont like it and thats fine by me i loved this movie  the acting is very good though i dont think they deserve an award for their acting i believe in time they may the movie was to sum it up vibrant the acting was perfect for the steampunk genre the visual effects were award worthy as they were done by the team that did the vfx for lord of the rings which was amazing for its time same with this the script could have been better but that isnt a huge problem this movie did not disappoint me i wish more people could like this movie but it didnt appeal to everyone it is better to watch this movie and decide for yourself because some loved this movie some hated it
Apr 30 2019,neutral,a beautiful disaster the movie pulls from so many other sources it fails to establish its own identity visually stunning but the script needed to be a bit more tight 
Apr 29 2019,negative,i was dubious about this movie but thought with such powerhouses of modern cinema behind it that it might stand up to my knee jerk assessment and prove me wrong it didnt this steaming mess of a film does entertain in parts but relies too heavily on the usual familiarities of these scifi action dramas cheesy lines galore and characters introduced so late in the movie just to be cannon fodder a weak and expensive failing effort in the end
Apr 28 2019,positive,loved a new take on a concept refreshing with all the star wars and the mcu and dcu very unique loved it
Apr 28 2019,positive,bang  cgi was spectacular  pity story was mess  could be better peter fran and phillipa
Apr 28 2019,positive,i wish i would have seen it on the big screen
Apr 28 2019,negative,terrible filming  shaky camera  good plot  watch at your own risk
Apr 27 2019,negative,there is nothing to like about this film its two hours of bad acting a weak story and awful concept     cities on wheels wfs what was you thinking peter jackson
Apr 27 2019,positive,enjoyable and easy to watch it is a shame it flopped as it had potential to be an interesting series
Apr 27 2019,positive,mortal engines just lets it all hang out  there is a lot going on here and it is a bit of a jumble  peter jackson has certainly produced a movie that has visuals on par with say the hobbit but the story is all over the map  i almost think they got too creative and threw too many concepts at the screen at once not bothering to spend the time to elaborate on any of them  cloud pirates  roving cities shangri la or whatever it was  the rotting terminator  i suspect all of these themes have been better explored in various movies this one was cobbled together from matrix star wars lotr lots of others here and there  i think they maybe could have focused more time and energy on the motivations of the roving cities as advertised in the trailers  acting was so so  weaving seemed to do a decent job everyone else was fairly throw away in some cases literally  there was no sense of purpose drive or comraderie  multiculti londoners were indistinguishable from the shangri la people and they didnt seem to mind what the city was doing or who they were at war with or who was coup detating who they seemed to mostly be cheering on a futbol game or something  weaving seemed to have a vague sense of ill save london if i blow things up  annas role seemed to be to stab people in the head and have enough product in her hair to look good while doing it matrix anyone  tom and ester were kinda bland  but one had a scar so you could remember who she was  terminator character seemed like a bolt on pun intended  i could go on but you get the idea  battle scenes were dumb but the visuals were good enough to compensate  not sure why the super weapon had to be retracted into the dome every time it was fired  like hungry hungry hippo or something  london chasing and eating the small town was an interesting scene  overall not the best movie in terms of character development or story development but fast paced and visually appealing to make for a fun saturday afternoon matinee
Apr 26 2019,positive,well i liked it it was entertaining good special effects good movie 
Apr 24 2019,positive,i have absolutely no idea why this movie got these bad reviews this movie had an amazing concept and an even better story with interconnected characters that all had their own arcs and parts to play     the acting was superb and the world was super immersive it was funny emotional and excitingthis is in my top thirty maybe even top twenty movies of all time    i feel like this could have been huge as big as harry potter or even lord of the rings but apparently people dont like it     ive lost all faith in movie reviewers and i suggest not paying any attention to them
Apr 22 2019,negative,unbelievable predictable and just not good
Apr 21 2019,positive,good sci  fi ignore the stupid reviews they all brainwashed marvel fans
Apr 21 2019,negative,if you love watching characters with jumbled backstories being chased then chased some more this movie is for you if you like cliche one liners this movies for you if you like a love story with no chemistry this movie is for you  if your a normal movie fan this movie will just be a hot mess to you
Apr 20 2019,positive,great movie cant wait for a sequel
Apr 19 2019,negative,another garbage movie where the white men are weak and they destroy everything while the women are strong and smart glad i didnt pay money to see this garbage oh and also the acting is horrendous while the story is confusing and pointless
Apr 19 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it
Apr 19 2019,positive,i have to say that i liked this movie a lot it is kind of fantasy science fiction emphasis on fiction here and steam punk or perhaps i should say diesel punk mixed together    the world is a fairly dark post apocalyptic world where moving predator cities prays on each other the entire concept is really quite ridiculous of course but it makes for some really fantastic and spectacular special effects and i am a sucker for spectacular special effects    in addition the overall story holds together fairly well that is in the context of the ludicrous world that is the background of this story in the first place of course it is quite straightforward without too much annoying social or green preaching that plagues so many movies nowadays somewhat predictable but overall a good vehicle for the plentiful action    i also liked most of the characters both the bad guy and the good guys had decent charisma with the exception of tom who was a bit of a naive whiner although he got it together towards the end    there where  few flaws nothing really major except that in one scene at the end the city of london was shown against the wall and it was bloody tiny compared to the wall the main bad guys last resort was to pummel london against the wall and was expected to break it down before in the movie london was depicted as really huge that scene really screwed that and made him delusional    apart from that end toms whining and naivety i really liked this movie it was the kind of over the top fantasyfiction movie with a big budget that you do not see every day of course the dickwads aka critics at rotten tomatoes and other mainstream media assholes did their best to tell everyone how bad it was as usual thats just the stuff that comes out of the south end of a north bound bull
Apr 18 2019,positive,a fun entertaining movie lacking any affiliation to any known universe seems like pro critics werent bribed to grade it accordingly   after the end i am ledt wanting another one to be made or even some series to expand the universe it is an intriguing concept that deserves the lore to be exposed to the world and enjoy a new sxifi universe outside of the decrepid disney owned ones
Apr 17 2019,positive,machines on wheels eating cities
Apr 17 2019,positive,i loved it it is not the book word by word but it is a full story i am sad that hester is too pretty so we cannot see her insecurities as in the book but you get to hate valentine and admire anna fang all the same they fit the 15 hours of book in 2 hours of film that tell the full story with some shortcuts
Apr 16 2019,negative,what a waste of a huge cgi budget not sure who is responsible for this garbage but its bad
Apr 15 2019,neutral,although an interesting concept the movie was too cliche and kind of a bore
Apr 14 2019,positive,a mix of metropolis terminator and blade runner excellent movie where everything comes to an end no happy ending this is a joy to be seen 
Apr 13 2019,positive,i really wanted this film to be great but it fell flat on nearly every aspect its such a unique concept with mediocre execution
Apr 13 2019,positive,i was soooo excited for this movie to come out i love peter jackson his work and couldnt wait to see this lets start off with the graphics they were everything we are used to when we think peter jackson so so beautiful i think they might be my favourite part of this movie to be honest the characters are a close second though you could relate to most of them which made it easy to form a bond either love or hate there could have been a bit more character development if you ask me and as my friend said at the end of the movie the biggest friendzone movie ive ever seen one thing i really missed while watching mortal engines was the history i felt like they left out a lot of valuable and interesting information and filled that precious time with more action scenes which to me was a bit disappointing    so overall a cool idea a really beautifully made movie but lacking a bit of depth in the screenplay
Apr 13 2019,negative,this is just a terrible movie  the longer it went the worse it was  so many incredibly cheesy bad lines  a thin plot that you could see where it was heading from a mile away  there is very little redeeming about this movie
Apr 12 2019,positive,nothing special  but good story
Apr 11 2019,positive,tried to say too much in just one film and ended up not saying much at all characters were light on and nothing new in the story that seems borrowed from various movies before
Apr 11 2019,positive,i dont care what the critics says it was a good movie 
Apr 10 2019,negative,worst crap ive seen in ages the moment where she breaks the machines heart that it doesnt have with her love for some dude was savagely insulting couldnt even finish signed up for rotten tomatoes just so i could scream into the void about how bad this was
Apr 10 2019,positive,mortal engines is basically a mtv movie with a huge budget they should have stretched it out into two or three movies for better story and character development its visually beautiful but ultimately lacking peter jackson and crew did great with lotr and decent with the hobbit but they were already immensely popular books compared to the mortal engines books
Apr 9 2019,positive,fun adventure movie in an ridiculous but interesting and imaginative world i really enjoyed it and rate it around 75 definitely put this on your rental list
Apr 9 2019,positive,it actually is a enjoyable movie not the best but good enough for two hours l
Apr 9 2019,positive,its a good movie with great film quality
Apr 8 2019,negative,i truly dont understand how something so lavishly produced can have such a lazily written screenplay
Apr 8 2019,positive,very creative and original the world they created is fascinating its too bad the story didnt do a great job showing it to us i dont think the screenwriting was great but it worked we need more movies like this original and different the main character was believable and written in a realistic fashion she wasnt some overpowered female lead thats trying to make some sort of social commentary overall i loved the visuals and the concept the writing could have been better and the story told a bit darker
Apr 7 2019,positive,i enjoyed the spectacle more than then politics but over all an original film and i enjoyed it 
Apr 7 2019,positive,ending wasnt the best but this movie is awesome ï 12 12
Apr 7 2019,positive,the concept was a little weird but non the less an enjoyable film
Apr 7 2019,negative,just an awful movie while im a huge sci fy fan and often like impossible or unplausible plots moving cities that eat other cities is just the worst
Apr 5 2019,positive,i liked the story and universe but overall was disappointed by the movie
Apr 5 2019,positive,despite the bad publicity and low ratings one of the biggest box office flops of the year is actually not that bad mortal engines is far from great but i believe critics and audiences were harsh in their reviews especially since what they claim to be flaws are praised in other blockbuster hits sure its poorly edited and the cgi and camera movements were dizzying but so are superhero and action movies the action sequences were exciting and the world compelling enough to keep me invested the script was unacceptable especially from the writer of the lord of the rings it was so bad i could sometimes predict the lines perhaps the only admirable thing about the movie were the actors and they didnt deserve to be wasted on characters that completely lack character development another issue was the sloppy storytelling that neither makes mortal engines a solid movie after the credits roll nor a good enough first installment to a franchise its obvious that the cons outweigh the pros here but ive seen worse
Apr 4 2019,positive,i was expecting worse when i sat down to watch mortal engines but i was pleasantly surprised putting aside the bad cgi i enjoyed the story line and i am happy to sit and watch an epic film     i get the feeling that i will be waiting for a sequel that will never come goodbye john carter
Mar 31 2019,positive,very good science fiction that unfortunately falls short of epicness in its intention yet finishes well
Mar 31 2019,neutral,second half was good but needed more explanation at the beginning
Mar 29 2019,negative,pretty to look at but otherwise pretty ridiculous and pretty big waste of 25 hours
Mar 29 2019,positive,fun and imaginative alternative to the scores of super hero movies
Mar 28 2019,negative,visually stunning as usual with peter jackson films backstory is thin
Mar 25 2019,positive,had my doubtsbut i really liked this movie good through out with a decent ending
Mar 25 2019,negative,pretty bad plot cool visuals
Mar 24 2019,positive,i will admit that i know nothing about the books or the author  but i can say the i like this movie im sure that most of the critics on here are fans of the books who are disappointed with the movies lack of depth if you have never read the books this is a great  visually stunning movie  but if you are a book troll then you will probably want to stay away or you may be disappointed now remember i said at the beginning that i havent read the books
Mar 24 2019,negative,the plot had so many holes and was  weak parts for the principal charactersi mean at the end she looked so weak and of course was very predictable
Mar 24 2019,positive,awesome movie with great effects
Mar 24 2019,negative,one of the lousiest movie of the century
Mar 23 2019,positive,i think mortal engines had a very good idea that wasnt very well executed there are amazing scenes and story in some bits but in others it feels like there wasnt enough to chew on the the stalker aka shrike is a character i feel the movie could have done without he barley had any screen time and was basically filler to make the protagonists life the tiniest bit more difficult not to mention the cgi for shriker was pretty bad they could have spent alot more time on him and made him actually fit into the story however the movie would have been better without him dont let my review stop you from watching the movie though its a rather fun movie to watch and it does have very good moments
Mar 22 2019,positive,i never read the books but my whole family enjoyed the movie i dont know why it doesnt get better reviews
Mar 22 2019,negative,im with the critics on this one its shit
Mar 22 2019,positive,why the dud reviews critics should show more maturity when reviewing genre outside their own circles comfort zone
Mar 22 2019,positive,i had very low expectations for this movie but i actually enjoyed it much more than i thought i would  quite a few weak spots in the story and script but still a fairly entertaining movie overall
Mar 21 2019,negative,copy of the copy of the copy a fantasy futurist and dystopian saga for young adults that arrives at a saturated market and at an exhausted trend among the worst and most deserved flops of critics and box office of 2018  mauro lanari
Mar 21 2019,positive,having read allot of the reviews i feel so many picked apart this movie with very petty opinions  i do not feel this movie deserves such harsh criticism    huge plot huge cgi effects and no shortage of action the drama and story telling is very well executed with an easy to follow track unexpected plots and a whole host of takes on this genre that is refreshing  the post apocalyptic genre lives on
Mar 20 2019,positive,terrific film having read all the books i think the writers and director have been able to present a highly entertaining and exciting film which replicated the core elements of the fictional world created by phillip reeve the original author
Mar 19 2019,positive,it was a good fantasy ride  kinda had a 90s movie vibe i liked it
Mar 19 2019,negative,great concept bad script leading to very average to bad acting
Mar 19 2019,positive,a good steam punk film some of the acting was i little ropey but an interesting adaptation of a alternative postapocalyptic future with very pleasing special effects
Mar 18 2019,positive,not amazing but worth a watch if you like fantasy or scifi
Mar 18 2019,positive,if you like the experience of graet fillm and visual effects things that will surprise you the total scifi experience
Mar 18 2019,positive,so mortal engines it interested me enough to think about getting the ebooks but yea its a very basic point a to point b kill the bad guy story     visually appealing if not stunning story tries to build a ï 12the women save the day plotï 12â the love interest steps in when needed but they keep it not a damsel in distress story the main protagonist is a 1 dimensional character that is either brooding or crying the love interest is competent and stays out of the way when the ladies need to kick ass the secondary main female looks like sheï 12tms trying acting a tough character but it is kind of hard to believe sheï 12tms a tough no man needing woman nothing sexist she kicks an unbelievable amount of ass she just only has one facial expression through the whole movie    the villain is classically one dimensional he uses lines of dialog to shoe horn that heï 12tms multidimensional and that would have worked if they spent anytime building that up or ever explained a reason for his goals and the lines he uses are tired trope lines i did it for you for us you donï 12tmt understand blah blah yada yada    3 out of 5 red shirts on an away mission    worth a watch at the minimum
Mar 18 2019,positive,freakin awesome literally the greatest movie ive ever seen p r e p a r e     f o r    i n g e s t i o n
Mar 17 2019,positive,i thought it was the coolest thing ive seen since i dont know when
Mar 17 2019,negative,the concept of movable entire cities was a new one to me and interesting but this film is such a mishmash of characters and storyline that it never gelled into a cohesive or engrossing scifi flick i saw on box office mojo that the production costs were 100 million and the movie grossed only 15 million domestically i can understand why
Mar 17 2019,positive,a fresh and exciting take on the steampunk fantasy genre tons of explosions and subplots to keep anyone happy with a payoff at the end that satisfies any movie goer highly recommend
Mar 16 2019,negative,too many plotholes illogical premise characters arent developed enough to care enough for the only plus is the set designs and mecha designs
Mar 16 2019,negative,a prime example for a good book getting butchered into a bad script
Mar 16 2019,positive,the visuals were outstanding 
Mar 15 2019,positive,simply incredible stunning imagery with a completely new storyline
Mar 15 2019,positive,its a decent postapocalyptic fantasy theres some interesting ideas set up in it but it ultimately ends up being a weaker mishmash of elements from superior films of this type most of that probably comes from the young adult source though but being a property based on a ya novel its pretty solid
Mar 15 2019,positive,some of the characters were likeablenot all of them including some of the lead roles  this movie is almost two and a half hours long and it feels like it
Mar 15 2019,positive,the problem was mr sheehan just came across with too much whining as a weak subcharacter trying to portray himself as a leader it failed jihae hugo and hera were exceptional yet the director failed with windshields exploding yet no wind in their faces a wounded hester could scale large machines but couldnt drop 20 feet  the director failed the audience with this one
Mar 15 2019,positive,visually stunning terrible childish dialogue screenplayhints of star wars mission
Mar 15 2019,positive,very cool concept and well executed was a big fan please make the sequel 
Mar 14 2019,positive,very entertaining so many professional movie reviewers has forgotten to actually enjoys movies tragic
Mar 14 2019,positive,immensely cool wellacted and quite thrilling this sortof mad max taken up to eleventhousand nonetheless has a weak script without solid grounding for its characters
Mar 13 2019,positive,best movie i live for movies that are as adventurous and romantic as these next to lord of the rings i shall place this one
Mar 13 2019,negative,all style with no substance or plot over a million people died in this movie but no tears will be shed
Mar 12 2019,negative,wtf was this this movie was crap ok visuals ok music
Mar 12 2019,negative,slightly better than sharknado
Mar 12 2019,positive,theres way too much going on either the movie should have jettisoned a subplot or two or been a lot longer that said i still enjoyed the movie for its ambition and strange setup the image of london as a ravenous machine bent on devouring other cities is kind of ingenious
Mar 12 2019,negative,horrible film shockingly bad another video game film where youre not sure if its a film or not  just bad on every level and nothing like the books  avoid
Mar 12 2019,positive,i havent read the books so i have nothing to compare it against   but that might have gone in my favour because i didnt think it was that bad   its a half decent sci fiction action movie that kicks along nicely  keeps you watching the plot is fairly straightforward good guys bad guys heros   villains   a post apocalyptic  adventure story that while it does seem to borrow heavily from things like mad max star wars  even the terminator it is a decent watch the metaphors of old empires and the way the western world destroys the rest of it are pretty obvious  the whole london populace in the film do not come out of it well as they clap and cheer along to death and destruction because its not them dying  but as popcorn munching time killer its actually ok
Mar 12 2019,positive,one of the best science fiction movies i have ever watched   it perfectly depicts the main failures of humanity  the failure to live in peace the failure to preserve natural resources because of short term gain and greed and  the failure to learn from history  it reflects a society that is very close to our days world a society that is eating itself literally for the short term gain of the powerful few over a sustainable future that benefits us all  really brilliant and bewildering movie and story
Mar 11 2019,positive,peter jackson could do a better job on the plot
Mar 11 2019,positive,i dunno why all the bad reviews i liked it its young adulty sure but i guess it didnt preach about social justice so the critics have to pan it
Mar 10 2019,negative,oh man this is bad how did so many good actors not be able to save this movie script story and stupid its just a dumb idea for a syfy movie
Mar 10 2019,positive,enjoyed it thoroughly gave a whole new perspective on scifi fantasy movies didnt give it 5 stars purely because the plot was somewhat predictable at times overall a sweet movie
Mar 10 2019,positive,not perfect but cool to look at and made with love
Mar 10 2019,positive,i actually liked this movie saw it recently and was surprised how good it was  the trailers and marketing for the movie did not do it justice  yeah the concept is quite unbelievable and a better back story would have helped the movie or just a totally fictional back story instead of post apocalyptic earth     overall the acting was good the story flowed and good character development action was really good also so giving it a 45
Mar 9 2019,negative,quite possibly the most hollow pile of garbage ive seen in a long time  mortal engines takes a promising and visually arresting concept and does exactly nothing of consequence with it  its most interesting asset is a flagrant terminator ripoff of a villain and the video game resident evil 2 remake handled that exact concept much more effectively  mortal engines is a heartless movie that tries to tell you it has heart  dont even bother with it
Mar 9 2019,negative,horrible movie it doesnt explain how and why cities are moving around let alone moving around killing each other the acting is bland the supposed lead character is the girl but she is depthless and you dont care about her the male lead is only slightly better     stay away from this movie you will never get the time back you wasted watching it
Mar 9 2019,positive,well executed film version of really enjoyable books slightly ridiculous premise incredibly interpreted visually suspend your disbelief ignore the negative reviews and enjoy the combination of philip reeves bizarre but enjoyable setting and peter jacksons triumphant visual style
Mar 9 2019,positive,audiences dont like steam punk but if you like steam punk youll love this movie
Mar 9 2019,negative,the whole point of this flick the moving cities are only seen within the first 5 minutes
Mar 8 2019,neutral,glad i skipped this at the movies so cliche and cheesy but some of the visuals and action makes it palatable as something to leave playing in the background
Mar 8 2019,positive,cool concept wasnt put together as well as i would have liked fights scenes were boring came in thinking it would be great but fell short but was still cool to watch
Mar 8 2019,positive,i liked the movie just got it on digital i missed the theatre release because it was not advertised enough i think
Mar 8 2019,positive,a movie with strong visuals and a compelling story  however the acting is not as good mainly because the cast isnt as seasoned
Mar 6 2019,positive,absolutely phenomenal anyone who critiqued this film with poor rating has lost their sense of wonder lust towards imagination  this movie is incredible open your minds eye and be captivated
Mar 6 2019,positive,its good good stuff
Mar 6 2019,negative,what the hell was that 
Mar 4 2019,positive,i thought this movie would have potential but it fell short  to much going on and to fast
Mar 3 2019,negative,horrible shallow and pointless donï 12tmt waste your time
Mar 3 2019,positive,a fun light movie to watch if you just want to enjoy yourself for a couple hours
Mar 3 2019,neutral,horrible acting so much potential 
Mar 2 2019,positive,great movie i never rad the books but really enjoyed this movie
Mar 2 2019,positive,i really dont know why this movie has such a low score and made little in the box office i enjoyed it a lot
Mar 1 2019,positive,not that bad it is not a waste of time
Mar 1 2019,negative,ill make it short the movie misrepresents the book so badly it was painful to watch the movie has no soul the characters lost well all character and feel like a blank one dimensional slate it follows roughly the happenings of the book but so loosly that it feels like the writers just read a summary of the book ugly hester as she is described is beautiful in the movie with a tiny little scar on her cheek valentine is purely evil instead of being man thats just trying to give his daughter a good life none of the characters personality is depicted correctly one of the fan favorites the stalker shrike wasnt even shown as he was in the books all in all as a fan of the books i was massively dissapointed the citys were cool though so i give it a two star rating
Feb 28 2019,negative,amazing movie actions scenes were great visual effects were awesome too but who ever wrote thisdamn and the ending scene had me laughing from how sappy and fake it came off to bad this would have been an awesome movie
Feb 26 2019,negative,i thought the predator was the worst movie of 2018 well it still is but mortal engines is really really close what a terrible movie everything is awful in it   horrible overuse of green screen and bad cgi   atrocious acting   cringe forced romance   bad dialogue   boring plot   wokeness
Feb 26 2019,positive,pretty cool to see the cities come to life few differences from book to movie but all and all good
Feb 26 2019,positive,mortal engines is a film with many problems that could have been easily fixed like its plot action scenes and character arcs but it does have some wonderful elements that makes the film still enjoyable to watch
Feb 25 2019,positive,this movie is creative and action packed great plotline and interesting story make for a fun and exciting experience
Feb 25 2019,positive,i love all special effects in this movie
Feb 24 2019,negative,another early 21st century film with mary sues of infinite capacity and courage women of determination who speak with conviction male cast either ackward fearful or villainous i am rather apolitical but truly fed up
Feb 24 2019,negative,much better than i thought it was gonna be but i still got bored about 34 of the way through 
Feb 24 2019,positive,saw the movie  excellent scifi steampunk adventure
Feb 24 2019,positive,pretty ok good word building and art design derivative story characters and plotting
Feb 24 2019,positive,awesome movie good acting awesomely unique amazing visuals kept me engaged from start to finish zero clue as to why it wasnï 12 12tmt a huge success i dream of and desparately desire a sequel well worth the watch and purchase
Feb 24 2019,neutral,not satisfied with all
Feb 24 2019,negative,oh my god what a terrible terrible film a real shame because it looked pretty good nice effects and great looking citys all seriously let down by a woeful script awful acting and really unlikable characters by the end of the film i just wanted all the heroes to die
Feb 24 2019,negative,boring and derivative
Feb 24 2019,positive,i enjoyed it despite the poor reviews it did seem to try to cram a lot of backstory into a short amount of time i might have been better if the producers had invested more time in the project and expanded it to at least a sequel
Feb 24 2019,positive,interesting and original concept
Feb 24 2019,negative,2 hours of torture do yourself a favor and skip this one the moving cities played no part in the story by the way just a mess
Feb 24 2019,positive,yes the second half of the film is completely predictable but the special effects are awesome and the first half of the film is very original i guess if the book ends up being predicable they were limited by the source material certainly worth watching though so ignore the low ratings and see for yourself
Feb 23 2019,positive,its nowhere as bad as everyone says while it doesnt have the most original plot or the most indepth character developments the concept and world are fun so is the movie as a whole from beginning to end and its a stunning visual spectacle if nothing else if you are familiar with the video game series final fantasy this is pretty much what one of those games would be as a movie i really dont think anyone involved tried to create a masterpiece here so by being a very entertaining actionpacked scifi fantasy it more than fulfills its purpose  now i do agree with one thing the title is just dumb
Feb 23 2019,positive,i genuinely enjoyed it
Feb 23 2019,positive,great film i really enjoyed watching it in the cinema i felt the story lacked interest at times though the cgi was great there were a few gringey times that i could not stand seen it a few times
Feb 23 2019,positive,outstanding stunning marvelous masterpiece from filmmakers of the lord of the movies the lord of the rings by christian rivers  peter jackson  imbd 62  seriously this movie deserve plus 9 idiot haters  great storyline excellent script awesome directing as always  brilliant acting   definitely love it 
Feb 23 2019,negative,the worst movie ive seen this year in a cinema most of the time i was wondering why did i bother
Feb 23 2019,positive,it was an entertaining movie  people look to far into things  just sit there and enjoy it
Feb 23 2019,negative,appealing concept bad implementation
Feb 23 2019,positive,visually stunning although the storyline was a bit muddled at times
Feb 22 2019,negative,okay plot i guess great acting fighting sciences at the wrong time the book is better
Feb 22 2019,positive,i really liked it if you like steam punk and action its worth your time
Feb 22 2019,positive,really enjoyable overall  would have liked to see more battles between the cities themselves but still a lot of hreat action  good settings and scenery  a bit reminiscent of star wars at times
Feb 22 2019,positive,awesome special effects  great plot  reminded me of final fantasy type rpgs  hope to see the sequel ï 12ï 12
Feb 22 2019,positive,such a shame they tried to fit the whole book into one film so much detail and depth is missing from the film compared to the book the film is ok but its such a shame they didnt split this film up to add the depth that the book deserves when converted into a film
Feb 22 2019,positive,an interesting premise decent characters and lackluster story make this a good choice for a rental     i was dragged to this movie with some family who really wanted to see it i had absolutely no interest in it and very low expectations however i was pleasantly surprised by a beautifully imagined world i found myself wanting to know more about the world that jackson had built here i would go see a sequel if one were made     the characters were also a pleasant surprise definitely not awardworthy characters but there was depth and actual character arcs i found myself sympathizing with some of the villains some the bigbad of the movie is where this movie really started to fall apart for me the story too left much to be desired as it was so generic yf that i could have skipped the last 30 minutes of the movie
Feb 22 2019,negative,2 stars for great visuals and an interesting concept but another female teen hero in a dystopian environment bored me pretty quickly
Feb 22 2019,negative,i think the movie is a mess of too many storylines of which none really is fully worked out
Feb 21 2019,positive,i loved it and now i just want to know if they are going to be continuing it 
Feb 21 2019,negative,mortal engines feels like the result of someone making a movie about a dream they had but cant quite remember   the movie begins with all guns blazing amazing special effects only problem is the beginning of this movie feels like youre coming in 34 into a story currently being told you spend the rest of the movie catching up with what has been going on who the characters are and what all the decaying tech is   the characters are forgettable at best nothing unique stands out about anyone which leaves you not caring if the main cast lives or dies   throughout the movie everyone references a particular character who is the generic terroristfreedom fighter trope by the time you get to meet her she seems to be trinity out of the matrix dressed up like a cyberpunk hipster dough but lacking in anything interesting about her character     in a nutshell just what for this to be put on netflix and even then theres no rush
Feb 21 2019,positive,wasnt to bad action was great but character a bit dull
Feb 21 2019,positive,well not that bad i expected more from this movie
Feb 20 2019,negative,i forced my self to watch it for 45 minutes then i lost interest and just stopped  one star for effort of making a movie
Feb 20 2019,negative,another mediocre feminist movie
Feb 20 2019,positive,creative and original 
Feb 18 2019,positive,solid story a lot more fun than i expected it to be with good character development
Feb 18 2019,negative,visually interesting and started off looking promising but it was way too long and you quickly lose interest in every aspect of the film that leads to significant regret in time and money wasted might be good for unseasoned movie goers otherwise its crap
Feb 17 2019,negative,somehow it was both intensely confusing and amazingly predictable and cliched including but not limited to the following ya tropes ï 12i am your fatherï 12â moment child tragic backstorys teenagers being more capable than adults pathetic attempts at murder and more
Feb 16 2019,positive,mortal engines has a weak and very simple script but still yet has charismatic characters very well portrayed by hera hilmar robert sheehan hugo weaving and jihae impeccable visual effects an excellent soundtrack by tom holkenborg and a great direction made by christian rivers
Feb 16 2019,positive,i wasnt expecting much but i definitely enjoyed it from start to finish the visuals are gorgeous and the story was engaging
Feb 15 2019,neutral,if you detract ratings from underage audience score might become even lower than critics
Feb 15 2019,neutral,the ideas are solid and the casts tries however it cant escape its own sense of importance
Feb 14 2019,neutral,im thinking a discount showing at the theater might have been in order some pretty cool visuals but not a whole lot else that really stands out
Feb 13 2019,positive,had no clue what this movie was about  but was taken by the special effects and the mobile cities  agreed that its light on substance but its interesting all the same
Feb 12 2019,negative,an interesting concept like most dystopian films but with absolutely no traction horrid script weak characters and a sociak commentary that has been done too many times recently mortal engines just doesnt have enough
Feb 11 2019,positive,love the actors and the director did a good job with the hobbit so this one came out good
Feb 10 2019,neutral,i feel like i should have cared more about what was going onbut i didnt
Feb 10 2019,positive,wow it was really good  i didnt expect to enjoy it but within the first 20 minutes i was hooked it was paced well the acting was good and i loved the universe it was set in
Feb 10 2019,positive,faithful to the books and great effects
Feb 10 2019,negative,this was really really bad cringy acting horrible story telling
Feb 10 2019,positive,suprisingly entertaining
Feb 9 2019,positive,another slept on movie thatï 12 12 12 12tms actually dope
Feb 9 2019,negative,howls moving castle fury road but nowhere near as good as either of those im left feeling dissapointed and exhausted i should have turned it off at 30 minutes and watched my washing machine instead    dont bother you wont get those 2 hours of your life back
Feb 9 2019,neutral,makes you sad  the music is stolen from terminator 2 and a bit reworked  for one time
Feb 9 2019,positive,in the 6th grade i read this book series with my older brother we both loved it i will however admit to never finishing it because of the boring narrator in the 3rd book that being said my brother who is a firm hater of seeing movies in the theater and i went to see mortal engines the opening scene was amazing the cinematography was exquisite i had high hopes then it started picking up the movie was long but not long enough i personally believe it shouldnt been split into two movies it excluded some key scenes and moments leaving me dissatisfied it made valentine out to be this crazy maniac who didnt love his daughter and would ultimately let her die instead of trying to save her it made hester out to be mean like shes supposed to be but almost immediately soften up in the books it takes a long time for her i enjoyed the movie i didnt enjoy how it misrepresented key aspects of the books i hope that they continue the series
Feb 8 2019,positive,trailers were meh like like it was going to be some kind of cash crab movie and only heard bad reviews but watched it anyways and wow  its actually freaking awesome
Feb 7 2019,negative,get ready to phase a war with horrible acting and poorly script with a terrible drama queen
Feb 6 2019,negative,i stop watching the movie when i saw the minions yes you read that right the damn yellow minions from the despicable me movies were there 
Feb 6 2019,positive,good fun requires a bit of suspended belief but lets be honest what good scifi film doesnt gorgeous steampunk world i hope to see more of it in a follow up film
Feb 6 2019,positive,mortal engines is a non stop action packed adventure from peter jackson fran walsh phillipa boyens and christian rivers with hugo weaving as the bad guy and hera hilmar as the hero i dont get the low scores for this awesome movie its so much fun with awesome characters by the ending you feel so entertained you cant wait to watch it again to notice stuff you didnt before being made by peter jackson and his crew i knew id enjoy it and was surprised christian rivers who worked with peter on the lord of the rings and the hobbit movies directs mortal engines and did a wonderful job everyone should see this movie
Feb 5 2019,negative,complete and utter waste of a novel    pros great concept art direction cgi  cons pisspoor adaptation weak characters overall execution
Feb 5 2019,negative,a movie that suffers from telling rather than showing and characters that are terminally stupid
Feb 5 2019,positive,solid action adventure film with all the trappings of romance and drama i would recommend this to everyone from my mate to my mum a solid film with very few arguments to be had worth a watch 
Feb 5 2019,positive,a truely amazing movie while it does not strictly follow the books it is still a great watch with plenty of action and mystery along with a smidge of romance mortal engines is intreging with new infomation around every corner yet easy to follow the story and place your self in the of the characters shoes as they fight to save their world
Feb 5 2019,positive,for me mortal engines is not as bad as critics and audience said but it doesnt mean that it hasnt serious problems there are holes in the plot and some of the characters are left over they dont contribute anything to the advancement of the film
Feb 5 2019,positive,its a good movie overall but there are some details that are really bad like the audio is terrible the story isnt that stong but it is enjoyable i would love to see a part 2 atleast if they manager to fix the problems from this movies in a possible part 2
Feb 5 2019,positive,the best movie in 2018
Feb 4 2019,positive,its an awesome movie that shows you what could happen when we let technology ruin the world
Feb 3 2019,positive,could it have been better yes but it certainly isnt bad would have been much better if they didnt try to do so much in one film but build a compelling universe to grow gradually surprising considering peter jackson usually stretches his movies too long
Feb 3 2019,positive,love steam punk movies and this one was one of the better ones iv seen need more like this most people dont like this type of movie because they like the same garbage we have been getting from hollywood for decades this is not that trashwe need more movies like this its too bad most people dont like these movies so they are few and far between
Feb 3 2019,negative,shocking nobody mortal engines was not very good trying to jam way too much into two hours than is reasonable it instead delivers on zero things i guess i was kind of interested in the character of shrike but that was really the whole of my positive experience with mortal engines maybe if this thing had come out about eight years ago in the height of the bizarre steam punk obsession that gripped the globe even if it was a weird sort of obsession where everybody called everything they like and themselves steam punk but it really wasnt required to have any relation to actual steam punk then the movie could have at least done well financially but theres no world wherein this version of mortal engines is a consumate film
Feb 3 2019,positive,the story lacks a bit of backround but has enough substance to keep you interested the visual effect are like nothing youve seen before avatar doesnt come close
Feb 2 2019,positive,wow the steampunk world is spectacular the settings take so much effort this movie is a greatly underappreciated piece of scifi fantasy
Feb 2 2019,positive,really i dont know how such a big budget movie and well planned with better cgi have flopped and much of the audience didnt appreciated it i dont care what others says i must praise its plot concept and the way it entertains barely can see any movie like this i certainly loved it and its true that its based upon a novel and have shrunk down lots of part from the actual novel if you read the book you can say its lacking lots of great stuffs from the book along with storyline but hey what about harry potter to me its one of the best movie i get to see in a month or year
Feb 2 2019,positive,great movie it was very fun to watch
Feb 2 2019,positive,it has good world building which is rare and very nice to see and visuals but unfortunately falls flat when it comes to plot and character development
Feb 2 2019,negative,this movie is an ultimately forgettable fiesta of cgi chockfull of every poisonous pc trope imaginable every facet of the plot was both silly and utterly predictable and even the talented hugo weaving failed to make any kind of personal impression as yet another stereotypical villain    as a way to blow two solid hours its vaguely entertaining in a forgettable way it gets one star for hugo weaving and a half star only for the gigantic lion statues i suggest renting it from redbox for a couple of bucks rather than wasting the money on seeing it on the big screen
Feb 2 2019,positive,really enjoyed it fast moving interesting and fun definitely recommend it
Feb 2 2019,positive,great special effectswas blown away by the first action sequenceliterally couldnt believe what i was seeing my attention was glued to the screen the entire timeafraid i would miss something if i looked away great moviehope there is a sequel 
Feb 1 2019,positive,dont look at the ratings just watch in this is one of the times that rotten tomatoes group mind has branded an awesome movie as something substandard the story is a bit rushed but the character development and the story are all there
Feb 1 2019,positive,here is good but not sure
Feb 1 2019,positive,great visuals ok plot nice acting but i think that is is too long and to drawn out but great fun overall
Jan 31 2019,positive,mortal engines is a hit and miss kind of thing the flashbacks were very detrimental to the movie put in order the story would have benefit from the steady rise in tension and made more sens the fx are amazing you wont get bored looking at this movie the action isnt always great sometimes its very cool some just plainly generic the main actors are fine but all the secondaries are pretty bad but the dialogues are just poor all the way around especially with the loving part there is no magic in it in words the music is horrible doesnt always match what you see on screen i give it a 62 its not a bad film but the only seller are the visuals
Jan 31 2019,positive,makes us fell human again let your ego and technologies and choose love
Jan 31 2019,negative,what a pile of crap geez i can see why its been mocked so much
Jan 30 2019,positive,great movie another example of why you should ignore film critics
Jan 30 2019,positive,fantastic film based on my favourite bookwell directed well acted and the action never lets up this is something different something everyone apparently wants because they are all tired of the same old stuff and franchises but as soon as something original and different comes out people essentially destroy it for beint exactly that i hope it goes on to garner a cult following it deserves none of the hate its been receiving
Jan 30 2019,positive,critics seem to be down on this movie because they went in with the expectation of a dieselpunk version of lord of the rings    folks  this aint tolkien so dont even attempt to compare it to lotr  but its still a fun little postapocalyptic romp  and honestly  its gotten me interested in a book series that i hadnt known of until now    folks  its just a movie  sit back relax and enjoy the show  i sure as hell did    also kudos to the makeup department  if someone ever does a liveaction queen emeraldas film i hope its peter jackson
Jan 29 2019,negative,if all the technology is for the story service then the film succeeded in the story and destroyed the technology
Jan 28 2019,positive,its movies like this that convince me of a moron bias in rotten tomatoes this movie was original steam punk fantasy top notch in a much needed category great characters wish it were longer like lord of the rings longer
Jan 28 2019,positive,actually really enjoyed this movie it was beautifully made and you can certainly see peter jacksons hand in the project
Jan 28 2019,positive,very unique movie not as bad as people are saying i really enjoyed it never got dull or boring a fun watch all the way through
Jan 28 2019,positive,better than the critics say
Jan 27 2019,positive,the story is better than most people say it kept me entertained along the whole movie
Jan 27 2019,positive,i loved it people are way to harsh its a beautiful world and had some original ideas and some clichï 12 cs but overall well done
Jan 27 2019,positive,this film is genuinely awesome never mind highoctane its nearly 2  a half hours long and was easily one of the most enjoyable 2  a half hours of movie ive ever watched its wellpaced and theres lenty of story happening with multiple characters even those that are supposedly bad will earn a place in your heart
Jan 27 2019,positive,its a real treat for the eyes let down by undeveloped characters and a cheesy script jihae is a particular delight  shame on the writers for not fleshing out her character anna fang more  she is undoubtedly the best thing in this film then theres ronan raftery the unblinking oirish ham from below stairs who is nothing more than a one dimensional plot propeller on the whole its enjoyable enough perhaps an extended cut might improve things a tad
Jan 27 2019,positive,i like the films steampunk theme and the world is interesting enough for me to wish for a sequel this is a great film to watch with the family it actually looked suitable to become a blockbuster but i am guessing the issue i have mentioned in the spoiler section below held it down mortal engines shows the trappings of becoming a cult film    spoiler i can see that for some westerners who are sensitive about race might find a few subjects in this movie insulting because the asians seem to have won the day appeared more human and most of the other group are portrayed as warlike but treat this film only as simple entertainment and you will probably enjoy it it is not that deep but it is quite a fun and an enjoyable ride a sequel can do wonders to this film by having more time to develop the characters which really piqued my interest overall a recommended watch
Jan 26 2019,positive,oh man the john carter of 2018 and i mean that comparison without malice or snark john carter was underrated and certainly didnt deserve to implode the way it did the same goes for mortal engines a peter jackson produced and designed scifi fantasy adventure that just didnt find the audience it needed engines functions as a cross between mad max and star wars in that its a postapocalyptic story in which giant vehicles which are essentially mobile cities cross barren landscapes hunting for more resources but we have a few brave young heroes who will join a rebellion and bring down an evil empire and its doomsday weaponbattle station oh yeah it sticks to that formula along with a dash of joseph campbells hero of a thousand faces for its two main leads    make no mistake mortal engines is messy and bloated as all hell and no one in their right mind had any business committing serious money to a steampunk ya series long after that ship had sailed the last ya series to make a successful run was the maze runner trilogy and it did so by a combination of realistic limited ambitions and reasonable budgets even the hunger games movies barely made it to the finish line amid audience fatigue but mortal engines is so damn enjoyable and beautiful to look at im kind of glad it exists the vehicle and world design is so aesthetically pleasing the phrase eye candy doesnt do it justice especially the elegant airships why did we give up on those in popular fiction outside of steampunk    hugo weaving is probably the most recognizable face on screen and he makes for a complex and interesting villain even after its revealed how much of a selfabsorbed douche he is you may find it hard to blame him entirely for his reasons hera hilmar and robert sheehan compete and cooperate for the role of hero and protagonist and they do so effectively not only that but they make a cute romantic pairing in that old hollywood sense theres plenty of action and id rate it as effective action mostly new director christian rivers works competently and the years he spent working with peter jackson since braindead shows its a shame this went badly as team jackson has had a string of defeats recently though im glad his wwi documentary they shall not grow old has made waves this has long since disappeared from theaters so you will have to rent or stream it go see millions burn on screen sky pirates attack tank cities and steampunk terminatorsterminate
Jan 26 2019,negative,lost me after 15 minutes into it 
Jan 26 2019,negative,this movie flawlessly followed the cliches of modern fantasy film which means the very plot goes against any common knowledge people know i wanted to cry at the ending for the stupidity of the writers and how peter jackson have lost it for good
Jan 26 2019,negative,i have so many things to say about this movieonly one of them is good any time the machine cities or aerial machines are on screen and things are ducking shooting weaving and exploding things are actually kinda fun and you could simply view it as an effectsaganza like bays transformers so many things going boom in your face at once you have no idea whats going on until you find yourself walking back to the car after the movie youre so happy to have your face intact that you simply say huh that wasnt so bad the problem is unlike bays transformers which be honest shall forever be awesome everything else about this movie is horrible everything the story is pffft the acting is subpar and the timing for almost every instance of movie magic seems off the fight scenes the comic hits the wouldacouldashoulda romantic pauses even the music is its justi cant i feel like the soundtrack was a mix between elevator music and something john williams third cousin larry the amateur keyboardist might create if john williams had a third cousin larry who was a keyboardist the characters are immediately forgotten likei forgot every single character and the crying is i meanwhy are you crying also the ending can just go eff itself thats all i have to say about that all in all i give a big fat d the only reason i didnt give it an f is because i got an f once in elementary school and i refuse to share that honor with this madness of a movie ps shame on you peter jackson
Jan 26 2019,positive,can understand why the review is low when it show some kind of people colonialism and brutality all over again
Jan 25 2019,positive,loved it   really hope theres a 2ed
Jan 24 2019,positive,what i loved in this movie is that they are able to show you more what went wrong with the old world at the same time staying on the point and the characters were amazing with different life stories
Jan 24 2019,positive,much better than reported the story requires an audience members attention and probably isnt for everyone where it is accused of being derivative of star wars it may be as much derivative of the films lucas based star wars on it it likely before its own time
Jan 24 2019,negative,this is movie is an insulting waste of money and time while i appriciate cheesy lines and lots of special effects   mortal engines has the worst narrative ive witnessed all the characters have two emotions want or greed thats it  the flop is well deserved im glad i didnt pay any money to watch this
Jan 24 2019,neutral,great vfx performances nothing to write home about possibly due to the rushed storyline by none other than peter jackson much like his lotr chapter 2 or 3 back stories all told in flashbacks poorly directed could have been better given the original material
Jan 23 2019,positive,full of action something new which is good good acting and great cgi unfortunately they released it at a bad time of year i think if they would have just waited a month or so on the release date it would ha e done way better in numbers
Jan 23 2019,positive,never read the novel and heard a lot of negative reviews but i have to say after watching the film i quite enjoyed yes there are things i would have changed with the film like with hugo weavings character and there was probably too many cheesy scenes that werent needed
Jan 23 2019,positive,consider star wars x castles in the sky x mad max had a baby now we have mortal engines a fairly fresh interesting post apocolyptic earth in the future times the screenplay is jaw dropping oh yeah its got action galore the one thing i criticize is they could have delved deeper into their world and its characters and ways of life  plus the romance between the main characters made little sense and had no logical structure for the audience otherwise great movie
Jan 23 2019,positive,it was agood movie not what the books are but good
Jan 23 2019,negative,if you didnt watch it in theater with a big screen and loud sound system dont bother because that was the only reason to go 
Jan 22 2019,positive,this will be an awsome trilogy is what all wanted steam punk movie with huge machines and a classic history the actors are a bit bad but hey whocares
Jan 21 2019,positive,i was surprisingly hyped for this movie it looked liked an original hollywood blockbuster which we dont see much of these days i wasnt disappointed this was a really original movie set in an interesting new world the only thing lacking and the only thing that set this movie back was the slightly cliched and not fully fleshed out characters and story excluding shrike easily the most interesting and developed character in the film i want to see a whole movie about him if it was a little less focused on action and more on story this movie could easily be a 55 but as it stands right now the originality and sheer spectacle of everything in this film is enough of a reason to see it  45
Jan 21 2019,positive,an enjoyable movie good action and wellwritten character development just wish they had explained the lore a little bit more
Jan 20 2019,positive,i caught this movie on the tail end of it just barely able to find a movie theater to watch it in and i have no clue why it was that movie is absolutely phenomenal one of my favorite movies for sure and is visually stunning got a great story sure to keep you on your toes and characters you can easily get attached too i encourage anyone and everyone to go see it if you still can its only flaw is the date it got realeased in my opinion
Jan 20 2019,positive,simply superb the sets lighting and action were brilliant it was gripping from start to finish and didnt let the wonderful book down it was great to see the strong female roles
Jan 20 2019,positive,it was quite entertaining and the special effects were great a neat concept as well i was entertained the whole time
Jan 19 2019,negative,who gave this a green light smh stupid as hell
Jan 19 2019,negative,visually impressive but a terrible movie overall
Jan 18 2019,neutral,a film which has so much potential ambition and talent but ultimately falls victim to its own grandiosity mortal engines is yet another postapocalyptic thriller featuring humans struggling to survive in the aftermath of a cataclysm its a central conceit worn painfully thin through rigorous overuse and theres really not much added to it much like the machines which feature in it its an expensive lumbering piece of work that certainly has its merits but they dont surface enough to justify its existence peter jacksons career peaked with the lord of the rings trilogy and here he pens a rote script with few surprises but the visuals are always a sight to behold therere some fantastic landscape shots and the mobile cities themselves while astonishingly impractical are impressive feats of computer imagery and modelling with all the backstory characters and locations this might have worked better as a miniseries chopped up so the exposition and introductions could be spread over several episodes rather than being forced on us all at once the lead is an irritating dope the heroine is brooding and boring and with the exception of hugo weaving whos always awesome no one else really leaves much of an impression the plot moves from expensive set piece to expensive set piece kept running by a series of coincidences lucky breaks and deus ex machinas i was glad to see it on the big screen and appreciate the world it created and its a shame to see it do so poorly at the box office it might be a sign that the moviegoing public is turning its back on big budget blockbusters or maybe it was just destined to never find its audience
Jan 18 2019,negative,well i naturally knew by its trailer that the whole idea of driving cities would be a bit ridiculous but i expected at least some great visual effects and that is pretty much all this movie offers these are in fact jaw dropping images but they cant hide the fact that the whole movie is a big bunch of crap extremely poor conversations lines horrible actors and a story which defies any laws of physics mechanical engineering etc that even archimedes would turn around in his grave by all the illogical bull that they include in this insanely ridiculous story though they show a bit of the obvious natural cannibalism and eating slob situation in an postapocalyptic society nobody is ever concerned where food actually comes from for those hundreds and thousands of people living on those moving cities the only concern seems to be energy and rebuilding a preglobal war weapon like if all knowledge of science would have completely disappeared on one part of science but still existing for others and that for hundreds of years it is utter nonsense and one needs to completely switch off ones brain to enjoy it at least a tiny bit for the cool imagery there is really no need to waste ones time andor money on this heap of senseless insanity and i personally do in fact like fantasy movies proven by the fact that only yesterday morning i rewatched valerian and i enjoyed it from the very beginning to the last minute but this mortal engines should have never been produced as i read in the newspaper there were even 2 or 3 followup movies planned but by the bad general reception at the box office this is hopefully out of the question 2 12 out of 10 points and that is so high only because of the vr scenery
Jan 17 2019,negative,so bad the characters are so useless the big cities eating other cities is just showed one time in the beginning and the movie really looks like star wars we have han solo deathstar  millenium falcon luke skywalker cloud city and lando even snoke is on the movie but after some really party and drugs
Jan 16 2019,neutral,part of me was really interested while watching but another part of me wasnt i was interesting to see a unique depiction of the future but the plot and the story followed just about every other path that these movie go down    unless you read the book you wouldnt know all of the back ground you might need to make it better
Jan 16 2019,negative,great special effects but the narrative and most of the dialogs are awfully poor you don get any emotional attachment to the characters or the story
Jan 15 2019,positive,just expected better and it wasnt 
Jan 14 2019,positive,many speak of what this movie ï 12couldï 12â have been and not so much of what it was visually spectacular and overall an enjoyable movie
Jan 14 2019,positive,cleraly shows a vast open and rich world    gives the feeling of dimension a great movie for its time
Jan 14 2019,positive,great aesthetic and premise with some iconic moments but otherwise a oneshot that will go the way of the golden compass
Jan 14 2019,positive,this movie reminds me of the other great ya books turned into movies the first maze runner for examplethank goodness they didnt split it into 2 parts this has exciting action enough backstory to understand whats going on and a downplayed love story worth watching even if you didnt read the book
Jan 13 2019,positive,city of ember inkheart eragon a wrinkle in time enders game and the golden compass naming a couple of bookturnedfilm titles that were decently acclaimed on paper but the interpreted vision of literature tend to be inferiorly received which brings up the debate of preferring adaptations between books and films whats special about those titles is that theyre stuck with illfated luggage of being blocked from narrative continuation that the books were more capable of and the appealingly adventurous scale that the films presents couldnt go any further in unfortunate matter but that doesnt mean theyre not enjoyable well most of them and joining them is peter jacksons new writing visual project with his longtime collaborator christian rivers helming the project mortal engines     mortal engines is a hugescaled dystopian novel taking place few centuries after civilization was destroyed by a cataclysmic event known as sixtyminute war and cities are now able to mobilize towards the survival of the fittest for resources with london as a giant predator on wheels devouring everything in its path the only one who can disabled londons engines and secretive destructive plan of power is hester shaw fiercelydriven with a personal vendetta in memory of her mother shes later joined by london outcast tom natsworthy and dangerous outlaw anna fang with a similar motive while londons head thaddeus valentine is in calm desperation to move forward his plan of a supposable key to use increased power to forcibly gather more resources    it provides an enjoyable thrilling experience by its expected spectacle that settled its own theatrical scale as a way to validate a worthy cinematic experience with visualized set pieces that garners awes as well visually proved helpful on an impacting scale of the narration that the film delivers in envisioned emphasis furthermore the atmosphere is routinely backed up by junkie xls riveting score and a little from the casts decent performances especially hera hilmars breakthrough heroine also theres a subtle interpretation on the dystopian context that led up to a question regarding the rules of the genre of unwanted necessary solidly strong unity as a sane logical movement with this amount of imprinting deliverance that a film could entertain its however still unbalanced    unlike the injected cinematic devices onto the source material it has left quite a distance from the story not being at the same imprinting level the structure is clear enough to see how it was initially written the general story itself enforced the negative tip of the balance scale by the simultaneous soullessness when the spectacle takes the drivers seats with overcoming machines till man reclaims the steering wheel at the last minute if you were writing a story over the grand canyon how can you justify the immersive offering smoothly while having human drama at its justifying center thats what jackson and his frequent collaborative team missed thus meeting the newly set low bar    mortal engines finds christian rivers directorial debut in a similar matter of a production crew role under the guide of an acclaimed director taking on the challenge of helming a project and hed reached the acceptable standard with expected imagery and scale of exceptional spirit within a sortof immersive experience even though it has become a new title in the aforementioned book list of illfate blocked continuation because the flaws reached towards a level of an unbalanced impression it still delivers with acceptable enjoyment b
Jan 13 2019,positive,excellent movie fantasy but so relevant to todays surroundings and enlightening love it  
Jan 12 2019,positive,great acting cinematography special effects and story non stop action
Jan 12 2019,positive,i loved the film as much as i loved being part of the making of it and the reading of the books it was a desperate shame to see it not being more visible in the leadup to the release date and it truly deserved to do better at the box office     one of the most visually impressive and delicious films ive ever seen the sense of scale was spectacular i found myself wondering if it would have fared better if instead of london the film was made about new york to capture american audiences more
Jan 8 2019,neutral,i would absolutely watch an anime version of this that was fleshed out and had a decent story as it was the movie had some interesting bits but was really poorly written no one i went with enjoyed it 
Jan 8 2019,positive,i am floored by the difference in the average ratings and how i felt about this movie this was fantastic while the cinematography was expected great and was the characters were skillfully portrayed and the plot was very unique for the most part there was only one predictable point i can remember in a sea of movies that are entirely predictable in this day and age i just dont understand how someone who enjoys this genre of film could possibly dislike this movie
Jan 8 2019,positive,this was good sci fi great action and story a lot of fun 
Jan 8 2019,negative,there is a feeling that the movie is too long the plot could be reorganized there are useless scenes that could be removed giving more space to the history of events or characters
Jan 8 2019,positive,i loved this movie i think it was one of the best scifi in resent years
Jan 8 2019,positive,okay needed way more scar    i enjoyed it visually it was great and felt like the books i have read and the plot did move along reasonably neatly a completely different plot from the books with some big changes in character motivation that also seemed to want to be star wars attacking the death star in the last act but it did move    bigger scar would have done it wonders
Jan 7 2019,positive,a movie doesnt have to be life changing to be enjoyable while mortal engines had its flaws to me it brought a life a fascinating world and very interesting characters i suppose the concept of fun and entertaining just does not exist to movie criticsmortal engines exceeded my expectations going into the cinema i really loved the movie and hope for a sequel
Jan 7 2019,positive,great visuals unfortunately its a story thats been told 100 times western expansion vs eastern isolation not enough character building to make me care about any of them they brush over the world buildinghistory which would have vastly improved the movie
Jan 7 2019,positive,this was an excellent movie  i dont understand the critics i went with three friends one said as the movie ended outstanding  the other loved it also  that is three thumbs up
Jan 7 2019,positive,better than expected and had a great story plot just couldve used better actors and maybe this would have been great 
Jan 6 2019,positive,despite the rating turned out to be a really good movie something is exploding every 10 or even every 5 minutes so i have no idea what could possibly be higheroctane than mortal engines
Jan 6 2019,positive,amazing movie  i dont care what yall rated it i loved it  entirely new take on the dystopian future scifi movie  i loved the giant cities the action the acting everything about it was so cool  thank you for making this one
Jan 6 2019,positive,an interesting film really enjoyed the female protagonist who is strong and vengeful seem to lack that in the film industry also really enjoy the graphics of the machines
Jan 6 2019,positive,i have no idea how this got low ratings this movie was visually fantastic and was the first true steampunk movie
Jan 6 2019,positive,if you liked the star wars movies you might like this
Jan 5 2019,positive,i am surprised this was so hated by the critics i thought it was really good a fun and faithful adaptation to the book totally worth seeing and on the big screen 
Jan 5 2019,positive,probably much better if you read the book hard to follow 
Jan 5 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the futuristic concepts and post apocalyptic portrayal of the future fresh cast of characters was great plot was simple but enjoyable to watch with a satisfying ending
Jan 5 2019,positive,despite all that bad publicity mortal engines was brilliant enjoyable and entertaining seriously critics arent giving this peter jacksonproduced film enough love and are way too harsh this dystopian young adults fantasy is a very well crafted visual interpretation of the sametitled philip reeves first book of a series of 4 books in what could have been the development of a very interesting franchise in the making i believe the film suffered from poor marketing on the part of universal and the lack of knowledge of the author rather than the film being poor the ensemble cast is well assembled however due to the many characters the film suffered from a shallowness that appears to give cgi and action more oomph but giving a bland feel to the characters my favourite bad ass heroine was none other than jihae kim as anna fang id love to see more of her in films she depicted her character very well as the strong leader of the rebellion the film is a nuanced political commentary which may be difficult to resonate with especially for an american or western viewer as the narrative involves a resource depleted of whats left of london in the future attacking the walled up east in order to survive for me this is a cult status classic  ive watched it three times already and still loving it
Jan 4 2019,positive,while the acting only was slightly above average the movie itself played well and drew you in definitely worth seeing in theaters
Jan 4 2019,positive,i completely enjoyed this movie but i dont mind movies that drop you into the action and let you discover what is going on  the look was great and most of the characters well done  unfortunately because of performance wont get more exploration of this universe
Jan 4 2019,positive,fun family film saw it twice and enjoyed it just as much the second time havent read the books so came into it rather unaware of the lore of the universe    im hoping we get some sequels as id love to see more of the characters and the world fleshed out further
Jan 3 2019,positive,i just saw the movie tonight and it was fantastical the beginning hooks you in and the cgi fulfilled my inner desire for scifi a great movie overall and one i would recommend others to go see
Jan 3 2019,positive,so many blockbuster films with much less compelling storylines get rated way higher by critics think any marvel movie  theres little wrong with the story or the character development    i think in the end many of this movies critics just didnt connect with the quirky dark world that those of us who love the steampunk motif are enamored with   put aside the criticisms and go watch this film on the big screen while you can   i loved it and am going again
Jan 3 2019,positive,fantastic  mad max meets snowpiercer meets howls moving castle loved this movie 
Jan 3 2019,positive,the movie should have been 6 hours long to fit the entirety of the story but the visuals are as good as it gets definitely worth a watch
Jan 3 2019,positive,i did not go in with high expectations and was pleasantly surprised i was not big on the idea of cities on wheels but once i accepted it i loved the characters and the plot line and would definitely watch again
Jan 3 2019,positive,fantastic movie although the ending didnt felt very satisfying
Jan 3 2019,negative,it was flatout boring it made no freaking sense the plot of the story
Jan 3 2019,positive,love this style of sci fi steps outside of reality al together and just puts you into set back and enjoy it
Jan 3 2019,positive,this movie is absolutely breathtaking with a wildly original concept the story itself is endearing and makes the best of the source material in my opinion i definitely suggest people to watch it on the big screen the visuals alone are worth it but i think this movie is an underrated gem cursed with a bad timing for opening in december 2018
Jan 3 2019,positive,movie was alright something to do 
Jan 3 2019,positive,an unusual premise carried out well
Jan 3 2019,positive,a stylish adaptation of the first book in the series   characterisation good for the screen time especially shrike i can forgive the prettying up of others   a few derivative moments but these didnt distract from the spectacle and some sound storytelling
Jan 3 2019,negative,cgi that makes the wondrous seem small writing that cheapens a supposedly grand narrative and acting as one dimensional and tryhard as jihaes stare its astounding how recent peter jacksontouched films seem to dazzle in dissappointment
Jan 2 2019,positive,amazing visually but there was something missing wanted to see more of the towns battling it out
Jan 2 2019,positive,not bad but i still have no idea what the hell was going on 
Jan 2 2019,positive,i suprisingly really enjoyed the film so much so i have resulted in reading the serires the storyline was great and the scenery was extradinary cant wait for the sequal
Jan 2 2019,positive,the storyline is a bit flat and characters pop up and outwith no development but the movie is gorgeous everyone is wearing the coolest steampunk clothing and you cant beat that fantastic red flying machine that looks like an ancient chinese junk worth seeing for the beautiful look and colors of the worlds
Jan 2 2019,positive,i didnt expect much from this movie because of the mix reviews it turned out to be a pretty good movie good storyline and good special affects lots of sifi action
Jan 2 2019,positive,pretty good movie great story line i liked it 
Jan 1 2019,positive,really confused by the really low reviews on here it was a solid movie it is true that the storyline lacks in places they tried so hard to get a lot from the book into the movie and ended up leaving out a lot of the character development but it was still quite entertaining and visually stunning
Jan 1 2019,positive,one of the best movies of the year this has an interesting plot developing characters powerful emotions some comedy  not that much but it is fun  and its visually striking    im honestly surprised at the low rating by the ciritcs although ive long since lost my faith on the tomatometer i urge anyone interested in this movie to go see it it is not a masterpiece but its one of the best movies of the year and a lot of fun go see it you wont be disappointed
Jan 1 2019,positive,this movie was visually beautiful and had a pretty good story  it lacks in character development and some story development that could have been helped by multiple movies which this appears to be apart of a multi movie run
Jan 1 2019,positive,watched for the interesting story rewatched for anna fang shrike and the soundtrack but wouldnt really watch again
Jan 1 2019,positive,not a bad movie better than the critics rated it i can see how it could have been 2 or 3 movies
Jan 1 2019,positive,dragged a little but still entertaining
Dec 31 2018,positive,i dont understand what is wrong with people anymore if it doesnt say marvel or disney it rarely gets good reviews this movie was phenomenal do these complainers realize the imagination required to craft the crazy cities and landscapes in this movie i loved the action the sets and the plot the movie would have been better split into to because we would see so much more but i loved every minute of this show
Dec 31 2018,positive,muchos buenos this film is awesome on so many levels pure guaranteed goodness yesooohh yes
Dec 31 2018,negative,it was better than the angry bird movie
Dec 31 2018,positive,i thought this was pretty good  it makes me want to read the novels
Dec 31 2018,positive,aesthetically appleasing and with a cool concept i feel like this is an underrated movie that deserves a bit more
Dec 31 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the movie it was a beautiful cinamatic masterpeice with an amazing score and beautiful acting i was highly impressed i havent left a movie smiling in a really long time i give the director props for that
Dec 31 2018,positive,great special effects innovative plot line this was an unexpected treat
Dec 31 2018,positive,this is a sleeper movie just like underworld was i thought it was awesome because it had everything in it mad max meets star wars meets terminator if you like those this is the movie for you if not then you wont get it
Dec 31 2018,positive,mortal engines is a great little good vs evil fantasy movie the plot keeps pulling you through to the next series of events i am now inspired to read the book that the movie is based on definitely an entertaining 2 hours
Dec 31 2018,positive,loved it very uniaque film
Dec 31 2018,positive,visually fun wasnt expecting to be blown away by the story but still enjoyed it it was what i thought it would be
Dec 31 2018,negative,lets be clear the books are not that great and the movie is literally made of cliches basically 100 of the dialog is a cliche the ideal is kind of dumb the delivery is bad its not good its not smart
Dec 30 2018,positive,i thought the story at the beginning was amazing but it lost me half way though but made me love it again with the climax 
Dec 30 2018,positive,left a lot out from the books did not provide enough context believed it to be a decent movie all things considered
Dec 30 2018,positive,this was a fantastic movie with a completely original plot and amazing women heroes we will watch it  again and hope to see a sequel
Dec 30 2018,neutral,did not live up to book expectations
Dec 30 2018,positive,okis this a cinematic masterpiece no is it a great movie no is it going to win awards no but what it is is a good fun night out at the theater kind of movie itï 12tms visually great to look at and the story is easy to follow making it a good time and thatï 12tms ok not every film has to be thought provoking social commentary on the state of the world sometimes you just want to sit in the theater and eat popcorn and not think and that ok mortal engines is that kind of movie
Dec 30 2018,positive,visually appealing and stimulating creative and fun 
Dec 30 2018,negative,on paper mortal engines seemed like it couldve been the next big book to film adaptation turns out not even peter jackson could keep it from becoming a massive critical and financial failure when i first saw the trailer i was intrigued by the idea my only hesitation was how overdone postapocalyptic movies like this are still the massively detailed special effects and small possibility of a hit were enough to get me to go see it what i got was a complete mess that squanders its visual appeal mortal engines is based on the first book in a series of five books peter jacksons first mistake was handing the directing reigns to a visual effects supervisor mortal engines centers on a postapocalyptic future where mankind has turned enormous civilizations like london into mobile predator cities theyre highly impractical but theres no denying how eyecatching they are the biggest problem is definitely its characters none of whom are played by recognizable actors except hugo weaving hester shaw is the scarred hero seeking revenge valentine is the villain with an obvious twist and tom is the reluctant tagalong who becomes the obvious love interest the rest of the world is bland unimmersive and i was immediately turned off by an early joke about certain yellow icons the only thing i was sort of interested in was hesters relationship with an undead cyborg named shrike it sounds ridiculous but i think they really had something there other than that mortal engines never stood a chance
Dec 30 2018,positive,a modern masterpiece its up there with the original star wars and lord of the rings and most of the unfounded idiotic complaints leveled at it could also be said of those classics see this big movie on the big screen
Dec 30 2018,positive,enjoyed the book enjoyed the film cant understand why so many bad reviews i guess those people that didnt like it arent a fan of the genre and probably wouldnt like the books either
Dec 30 2018,positive,if you dont want to see a post apocalyptic scifiish fantasy movie then dont watch something else this was good 
Dec 30 2018,negative,honestly since ive seen it it is probably one of the worst movies in the world complete rubbish dont watch
Dec 30 2018,negative,an interesting idea but the film is extremely boring
Dec 29 2018,negative,sandra ohs character the robot shrike and the graphics were the best parts but still couldnt outweigh the lack of a story back bone
Dec 29 2018,negative,the plot was kinda manic and unfocused and i thought they got a little too wrapped up in the special effects and let the worldbuilding aspect die on the vine a bit  id say all of the characters were paperthin other than hester too    i also thought the integration of the main plot with the shrikehester subplot was a little haphazard and clunky  that subplot was actually the best part of the movie storywise but it didnt really fit well with the kind of basic story surrounding it
Dec 29 2018,positive,better than expected
Dec 29 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie not sure if its because i watched it off the back of aquaman lol but i was pleasantly surprised enjoyed it start to finish and liked the twist about the robot man thing  that was hunting her
Dec 29 2018,positive,not terrible but not mindblowing
Dec 29 2018,positive,this was a great movie action from start to end the visuals are amazing completely new universe way more interesting than i expected 
Dec 29 2018,positive,i thought the movie was good frankly the reviews are a tad unhinged for fans of the series unfortunately we wont likely see any sequels made do to the negative press
Dec 29 2018,negative,not read the book and this did not inspire me to do so i  like the concept but was wanting to see cities fighting it out
Dec 29 2018,negative,awful full of loop holes acting is terrible
Dec 29 2018,positive,i echo many audience reviewers  this is quite a good movie  not perfect but good  the critic reviews make it sound like waterworld its far better than the reviews  go see it 
Dec 29 2018,positive,i actually enjoyed the movie despite the negative reviews  the bonus of the negative reviews was that i got top pick at seating in the theatre  it held our attention and the graphics were quite detailed  it just goes to show you that you cant trust all the negative reviews you read  i recommend you give the movie a chance and go see it  you will be pleasantly surprised  note  i did not read the books so cant comment on accuracy of the movie and the books its based on  but you know how movies and books typically go    it was really neat how the cities were packed up to move very creative  the movie had influence of lord of the rings star wars mad max and at least two strong female leads and a diversified cast
Dec 29 2018,positive,7 stars nine stars il stars and beyon
Dec 29 2018,positive,loved the film unfortunately a poor release and even poorer showings made it destined to fail
Dec 29 2018,positive,not a bad movie at all at least it was new and creative i wouldnt mind a sequel 
Dec 28 2018,positive,yeah the story is irrational but nevertheless the graphics effects are of the cutting edge level
Dec 28 2018,positive,better than expected    i decided to go see this movie in theaters because even though completly unrelated my love and longing to see a full langth robot circus a short anime from the 90s anyone who loved that short will love this movie for its ability to bring that horror into a fully developed world    thus upon reading the reviews i wasnt surprised that critiques hated it the most common problem was said to be that it was a combination of other great movies are we suppose to tale this as a bad thing by those standards marvel movies which btw spiderman and aquaman got great reviews are rehashed heros and all romantic comidies are the same with character name changes    buy what about the movie itself    it was great be warned that there is not enough battling cities but the world of monstrostic engines out there was vast and amazing it also had some mild humor about ancient tech that was giggle worthy the movie also seems to struggle with bookism as many actors have only a few seconds to portray characters that probably have much bigger parts in the books but as a person who hasnt read the books i thought they did well and now want to read the books to find out more about those characters i didnt get enough of in the movie    that said there were some flat spots there is a huge plot hole at least one line that even the actor who muttered it seemed to hate and no kissing however so does every other movie in existance
Dec 28 2018,positive,cant remember the last movie that i disagreed so much with the critics about  the strength of the movie is a feeling of cultural and historical depth more reminiscent of lotr than star wars well duh  hugo weaving is as always excellent
Dec 28 2018,neutral,this is the most expensive bad movie ive ever seen and by god hugo weaving yet again plays the villain in a sci fi movie
Dec 28 2018,positive,mortal engines delivers an exciting actionpacked animeinspired scifi fantasy wrapped in rich beautiful visuals peter jackson and his production team are seasoned filmmakers who really understand how to combine all the elements of a complex story and breathe life into it the heavily animeinfluenced elements of this film are immediately apparent yet delivered with a beautiful touch of finesse and color a tasteful blend of hiyao miyazaki castle in the sky star wars the matrix battle angel and lotr makes mortal engines a fun 25 hours that leaves you wanting more
Dec 28 2018,positive,it was all in all a really great movie there were some stuff i got confused about but it all made since in the end i would completely recommend it to everyone and will probably watch multiple times myself
Dec 28 2018,positive,as a certified scifi geek i can say that this is almost a first rate movie the world the cast and most of the characters are really good especially hera hilmar and jihae kim the opening 15 to 30 minutes of the movie is superb but there is a bit of a drop off once the ending approaches with a bit of a formulaic resolution to the conflict nonetheless it is a good collection of unique post apocalypse ideas and the movie really looks good on the big screen i would see it before it is gone which looks like it will be soon since the critics dont seem to understand the movies good points
Dec 28 2018,positive,this movie is definitely worth seeing its a phenomenal film that has stunning visuals and amazing acting absolutely worthy of watching in theaters
Dec 28 2018,positive,good movie having read the books definitely could tell how they could set up the sequels
Dec 28 2018,positive,well acted great action and graphics intriguing plot just as good as any of the recent star wars movies
Dec 28 2018,negative,one of the worst movies i have seen all year terrible storyline spare yourself the agony and skip this one
Dec 28 2018,negative,far too long very boring
Dec 28 2018,positive,if youre a fan of previous ya book adaptations mortal engines should be right up your alley it may lack the oomph and starstudded cast of hunger games but mortal engines brings its own kind of unique charm partially in the form of the otherworldly context in which the story takes place and partially due to a beautiful little cast of upandcomers   im a sucker for a freshfaced cast so excuse me if i give mortal engines an extra halfstar just for bringing new talent to our screens  particularly hera hilmar of icelandic tv fame who was a pleasant and welcome surprise as hester shaw   visually mortal engines is a treat and i would argue that its the extensive and impressive visual world that christian rivers and peter jackson have created that differentiates mortal engines from the myriad of ya booktomovie adaptations if you are in twominds about seeing this film the cgi spectacular that is moving traction cities might just change your mind  and while the plot and dialogue might be somewhat predictable the world of mortal engines certainly is not   i walked into the cinema with littletono expectations and ive come to believe this is the mindset in which mortal engines should be viewed ditch your expectations at the door and perhaps youll be pleasantly surprised
Dec 28 2018,positive,i am so glad i did not follow all the horrible reviews this movie received  i had a great time and was thoroughly entertained if you are drawn in by the trailers then youll love this movie
Dec 28 2018,negative,mediocre made witb a heart but low end story
Dec 27 2018,positive,a little predictable  but a fun watch anyway 
Dec 27 2018,negative,movie was so bad i begged to leave early the score almost put us to sleep the best characters were the cities themselves the love story made no sense and the movie itself was so boring we would have rather watched 2 hours of star wars politics on repeat instead  made an account here just to post this
Dec 27 2018,positive,enjoyable emotional and left me on the edge of my seat would see it again the soundtrack and visual effects are emotional and beautiful the story is interesting enough to keep you watching
Dec 27 2018,positive,great action packed story for a saturday afternoon at the movies  loved all the references to the long ago past
Dec 27 2018,positive,super fun opening scene and action throughout
Dec 27 2018,positive,this film deserves better box office maybe i am prejudiced in its favor because i like steampunk and there is so little in the genre that is worthwhile if a post apocalyptic movie can properly be called steampunk but i am going on the feel rather than strictly requiring steam the visuals are stunning the world well crafted and the actors are generally good while there are moments where you say i knew that was going to happen there are also a few surprises the movie made me want to read the books especially since it is all but certain there wont be a sequel joins my list of movies i loved that were box office bombs like mystery men and league of extraordinary gentlemen i think this movie might be more appreciated over time
Dec 27 2018,neutral,mortal engines features dazzling visuals and occasional signs of sheer ambition but they are not quite enough to distract audiences from the poor screenplay by peter jackson and the lack of chemistry within the cast
Dec 27 2018,positive,not sure what film the reviewers at rotten tomatoes were watching this film is fast paced exciting with absolutely stunning special effects the transition from book to film has worked well things moved into a smaller timescale which helps keep a good pace without sacrificing the plot i would highly recommend
Dec 27 2018,positive,not a bad adaptation of the book an enjoyable and fun film to watch would recommend to a friend
Dec 27 2018,positive,very compelling story amazing visual effects and it overall had me intereated and wanting more the actors did very well
Dec 26 2018,positive,wasnt expecting to like it but enjoyed it thoroughly  a great mix of action futuristic steam punk contraptions characters and storylines
Dec 26 2018,negative,its the time of year where the dry winter air allows germs to live longer on surfaces thus making more people sick also mortal engines its a toss up which one id prefer to experience again the movie or the illness
Dec 26 2018,positive,steampunk star wars thats what i thought when i watched this movie mortal engines is a little bit like star wars in that it creates an entire steampunk world from scratch and introduces us to a whole bunch of new nuanced characters whom we are unfamiliar with all of them with some backstory which makes things interesting its a whole new world     what i really like about the world of mortal engines is that it is unlike any other worlds ive seen before in the movies so the mechanics of the world is totally different its a semipost apocalyptic world with a hint of dystopia yet not dark like many of the modern boring dystopian movies we see today coupled with a dash of hope and humanity on the one hand you have the humans which true to life want to destroy each other and then on the other hand you have the unquenchability of the human spirit found in steampunk itself told through what is likely the coolest steampunk character ive seen in the movies shrike i wont spoil it for you but youll know what i mean when you see the movie    with wetas involvement and peter jackson  co it is no surprise how real they managed to create this steampunk world in excellent cgi glory london on wheels is simply so cool and intimidating the actors all fit into this world well i reckon they could make this movie even more interesting by fleshing out the characters quite a bit more all in all it is simply such a cool movie personally this is one of the most unexpected movies ive seen in 2018 and it is a pleasant surprise being so different from the other movies i love it my kids loved it too highly recommended
Dec 26 2018,negative,a depiction of a future america 15
Dec 26 2018,positive,kind of stunned at the reactions   there are some really fantastic things in here but it really delivers on a cohesive story line with lots of pathos and suspense    unpredictability  i was reminded a bit of the movie 9 the animated one with the stitchpunk creatures fantastic but creative clever  really good filmmaking in my mind careful attention to every detail  not at all a waste of a couple of hours  does not take itself completely seriously what with the carefully protected minion statues and in their hour of deprivation consuming 1000 year old twinkies  that was satisfying
Dec 26 2018,positive,loved it as did every one of my friends who saw it do not understand the negative reviews  lack of box office
Dec 26 2018,positive,kind of stunned at the reactions   there are some really fantastic things in here but it really delivers on a cohesive story line with lots of pathos and suspense    unpredictability  i was reminded a bit of the movie 9 the animated one with the stitchpunk creatures fantastic but creative clever  really good filmmaking in my mind careful attention to every detail  not at all a waste of a couple of hours  does not take itself completely seriously what with the carefully protected minion statues and in their hour of deprivation consuming 1000 year old twinkies  that was satisfying
Dec 26 2018,positive,dont believe the negative reviews  i loved it  great story and the visual spectacle really drew me in to the amazing world of this brilliant book  not as good as the book as it was less gritty and the explosive ending toned down but  i can only think of a couple of book adaptations that ever managed that feat
Dec 26 2018,negative,cue the epic music over the top slow motion and poor box office effort 15
Dec 26 2018,positive,the movies narative can be easily forgoten becouse it dustracts you with amzing special effects whitch i hate but at the same time love
Dec 26 2018,positive,not a great story and some main characters completely disappear part way through the movie  but outstanding visual effects and a funloud afternoon in which im not in the office  enjoyed that there was very little profane language and no sex scenes
Dec 26 2018,neutral,a for the cgi c for the plot predictable a little to busy at the end but worthy of one viewing 
Dec 25 2018,negative,great affects but terrible story music and acting 
Dec 25 2018,positive,under rated very entertaining and the special effects are awesome
Dec 25 2018,positive,i thought this movie was amazing cities on wheels cool idea i was actually intrigued the whole time no i never read the books and i think that helped actually i just know after watching this movie i still wonder why it got bad reviews the movie looked amazing the world that was created was amazing the story worked fine so what if it was a bit predictable but not bland i wouldnt say that the characters were good i dont know what the problem is just saying i enjoyed the hell out of this movie if people dont like this movie they are obviously over thinking it buts thats a critics job i guess rotton tomatos is full of shit anyways how the hell did the jurassic world get  a better score than mortal engines cuz i watched that movie obviously and it wasnt that great there are so many movies with bad rotton tomato scores that are actually good i used to take a peak at the reviews and scores on rotton tomatoes to help me decide what movie i was going to watch in theaters but not anymore ive been winging it going with my gut so far that routine is working out pretty well
Dec 25 2018,positive,americans wont get this movie i found it moved very quickly and it takes a lot to bring the books to the big screen christian has done a really good job when you read a book it is your mind that brings it to life and he has done it here if you want a bit of escape from the real world then go see this movie you will not be disapointed
Dec 25 2018,positive,personally i loved this movie and its made my top favorites list i loved the plot and think it was well thought through i loved the characters the story line and the general idea of this movie 1010 would recommend
Dec 25 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie which is based on a anime like the movie ghost in the shell cgi is amazing just needed a little more depth with the story i dont rely on rotten tomatoe critics hahaha so many movies they misjudged have to listen to your fellow neighborthe people movie is 3 12 stars but in my opinion 28 rotten tomatoes is beyond me but give avengers infinity war 80 like that movie is my favorite im a fan but is a clutter f of characters which has you intching for more mortal engines is a great movie overall worth seeing
Dec 25 2018,positive,fun not amazing but fun some interesting parts some cool characters and overall a fun distraction what its supposed to be 
Dec 25 2018,positive,creative story good effects
Dec 25 2018,negative,too much story elements from star wars mixed with a some frankenstein and dan simmons shrikemonster unoriginal story actors are okay it would be much more interesting to see more of this world instead to tell a too fast story
Dec 25 2018,positive,hello i have never written a movie review before but after reading the words of some critics saying that they fell asleep during this movie i went furious this movie has every little detail i fall in love with the big cities and cgi it was perfect i am not a critic but as someone who likes to watch movies i loved it and i would definitely watch it again the work that has put into this movie is enormous as the main audience of the movie this movie is hella good and if you fell asleep in this movie you on some hard ass drugs
Dec 24 2018,positive,way better than expected this is fun and interesting with beautiful special effects 
Dec 24 2018,positive,the movie was fun and entertaining not his best work but the scale cinematography and art design were all great good movie
Dec 24 2018,positive,one of the best movies i have seen this year it has reminded me of old good fairytales i watched in childhood mortal engines is an excellent way to spend time during christmas week my boyfriend and me even going to watch it for the second time this week it is such a movie which you can watch many times throughout your life strongly recommend
Dec 24 2018,positive,i thought it was an awesome movie lead character was a little weaker than i would of liked she needed to keep on being a baddass def recommend
Dec 24 2018,negative,words cant describe just how terrible a movie this is
Dec 24 2018,positive,excellent movie beautiful visuals solid story and great characters
Dec 24 2018,positive,i dont give much stock with the rotten tomatoes says with reviews but i was surprised to see the audience review was only at 58 but i took a chance and went to see this movie regardless and am glad i did see this movie it was fantastic if you like these types of movies great imagination and very good story line the ending was a little overdone meaning it was a little over played and could have had a simpler ending i think they overthought the ending to much but over all it is well worth seeing and i hope this will lead into a second movie
Dec 24 2018,positive,saw this at 130 christmas eve i was the only 1 in the theater  they ran the movie just for me felt guilty well watching it  this was a futuristic  unusual story that could of seem stupid without the amazing special effects that made it seem quite possible  believable  i felt the acting  over all storyline  3d special effects kept you on your toes so you could not take your sees off the screen  rooting for the good guys to overcome their demise that was about to happen  worth seeing this in 3d
Dec 24 2018,positive,great movie loved the characters loved the story loved the little bit of romance but that it was a friendship and family theme first great action well done effects good acting and a great soundtrack hardly any language and no bad scenes i figured out a couple things before it happened but that made it fun only negatives was one side character wasnt shown at the very end leaving us to wonder what happened to him and they could have explained their history in a little bit more detail but after a second watch i got everything a very enjoyable movie
Dec 24 2018,positive,gorgeous fairytale which consumes you and makes you forget about the outside world it effectively uses cgi to describe the steampunk style dystopian world this year mortal engines gorgeous steamengine machines and airships have replaced for my husband and me the star wars spaceships why on earth did they have that battle in solo on land instead of space it looked more like vietnam war movie rather than spaceship war movie other longawaited movies have disappointed me recently because they have spent all their energy on cool special effects but failed in making a cohesive storyline some of the last sequels on favorite movies turned out pathetic because they dont have good stories those movies look like they have adventures in the sake for adventures which have no meaning for the storyline unlike those plotlacking movies events in mortal engines make sense  people if you wanted to watch mortal engines please ignore negative reviews and dont feel discouraged mortal engines is an excellent adventure movie enjoyable every moment
Dec 24 2018,positive,this is hands down the best scifi movie i have watched in the last two years initially i didnt want to watch it due to all the other reviews but was so glad my girl friend that loved the book dragged me to the theater   the movie has a serious and more mature tone to it with almost no jokes which i find extremely refreshing in todays movie trend that all seem to have turned into comedy   the cgi was glorious and beautiful the storyline is reasonable and easy to follow the setup was straight forward but imaginative and the world building is creative and immersive  this movies pacing was perfect and shows peter jacksons superb mastery there was no part too slow nor any parts too fast that overwhelms you  i wish this movie had a better advertisement and opens world wide because this is a epic film that is the best movie i have seen in the last two years
Dec 24 2018,positive,this is an awesome movie the world design is breathtaking the story has original and familiar elements and the acting is good some back story on the state of the waring nations would have been better but it also left room for a sequel having read comments on youtube a bunch of neckbeards hated the movie without seeing it because a woman was the lead character thats embarrassing and makes a case against review aggregators
Dec 24 2018,negative,great visuals  mediocre story  boredom
Dec 24 2018,positive,we loved it all the outlandish special effects all greatwill go again
Dec 24 2018,positive,not agreed with all the bad reviews for once there is a rich univers maybe too rich for the screentime allowed beautiful fx and a very original story ok characters could have been deeper and some arch could be more detail but it a good show really
Dec 24 2018,positive,awesome movie pj can always pick a good story to bring to life the reviews are bs for this movie and i see alot of the top reviewers are auto posted it seems now that the bigger movie companies have been torpedoing others with bad reviews to get people to other movies its sick honestly i have no idea where people can get an authentic review for a movie these days unless its from word of mouth
Dec 24 2018,positive,a welcome change to the normal fair this time of yearyes there are a number of  chessy parts and nods to other franchises such as star wars nevertheless a solid enjoyable film that you can get lost in
Dec 24 2018,negative,i really wanted to like this movie because i loved the books however while the special effects looks great you can tell the price of these effects were a complete sacrifice of a cohesive plot even having read the books the movie was very confusing often actors would reveal secrets that the suddenly just knew i am very disappointed 
Dec 24 2018,positive,great movie with a cool plot it was like an video game for beginners
Dec 24 2018,positive,deserves a better rating than it has go watch the movie
Dec 24 2018,positive,this movie deserves a better rating that it has far better than a lot of the movies critics seem to give a high rating to i really enjoyed the movie very entertaining 
Dec 23 2018,positive,a very good movie enjoyable from start till the end i have been waiting for it for over a month since i watched the trailer but this morning when we decided to go to movie theater we discovered that it has low ratings and i almost refused going but we still went because of knowing that it has low rating first half of the movie i was expecting that any moment movie can go sideways and disappoint me but it never happened  i feared it may have terrible feminist propaganda  thanks gods it did not happen  super tired of lame feminist propaganda i also feared that the movie would have lots of special effects but have no story or the trailer would turn out to be a false advertisementlike it happened with downsizing when it never made a movie about a struggle off tiny people when they never showed that huge vodka bottle party this movie is beautiful has lots of special effect it shows you exactly what you expect after the trailer  the story about big city that consumes tiny cities in order to survive by taking their small cities resources and what do people even find confusing about moving cities have they never seen hauls moving castle  the movie has a perfect pace without burdening long boring scenes at the same time giving enough time to describe what is currently happening giving enough time to learn new characters and i am very happy that hester did not kiss tom at that moment and they did not have a long cheesy conversation i always hate when they do it in movies when characters have these conversations and kisses for like 10 minutes when they actually have to run and save the world closer to the end of the movie i started wondering why people disliked this movie  really  this movie is gorgeous and i should say i feel like recently hollywood is having a crises most of franchise sequels are disappointing the last jedi was a disappointmentwhy are they not fighting but dragging on on that ship are they rebels or impostors what a nonsense  solo was a great disappointment20 minutes from beginning it felt like a final scene and i dont understand what is happening and i dont care when somebody dies probably the actress was disgusted with the movie and decided to quit it the last pirates of the caribbean  o how i loved the first movie was a total disaster they destroyed jack sparrow jack sparrow was smart cunning and resourceful but in the last movie he is shown incompetent and how come that pirates do not know about navigating by stars that astronomy girl who was teaching pirates about it was super annoying as to numerous super hero movies come on i feel like they make the same movie but they change name and special powers of the super hero i am totally not watching any super hero movies any more fantastic beasts o i love harry potter but fantastic beasts is an attempt to make money on name of harry potter fantastic beasts feel like cheap ripoff i feel like movie industry has run out of good stories and imagination and they just try to survive on issuing franchises how about making new characters and new stories and mortal engines is a new story  and i am writing this review because i want to see movie after the second book of the series because i know what may happen they made the first movie after golden compass by philip pullman but since the first movie was not successful they never made 2nd and 3d movie and i am still waiting 10 years later i am waiting and waiting but they never made movies after the rest of the series   as to critics who negatively criticize mortal engines first of all all they say are very general words without any specific explanation why they dislike the movie which makes me think that they are  secondpaid by londoners who are offended with the movie that london city is the main villain in the movie   mortal engines deserve higher rating
Dec 23 2018,positive,it was really good visually and the story was entertaining even though i was able to predict every major character death and a lot of other stuff about the movie and all the relationships between characters
Dec 23 2018,positive,great movie actually fantastic visuals good cgi  acting was very good given there was only one actor name i recognized ie hugo weaving  jihae as anna fang looked like the part of a cool assassin even  hope others ignore the critic scores and see it for themselves
Dec 23 2018,negative,if i could give it zero stars i would even my kids hated it
Dec 23 2018,positive,a little too long but the reviews are harsh for what was action packed and interesting to watch i agree the narrative wasnt very strong though
Dec 23 2018,positive,awesome movie a must see
Dec 23 2018,positive,love the movie nice plot
Dec 23 2018,positive,movie was a mix of intense moments and great acting i loved it from start to finish capturing the story and playfulness of this movie was easily seen would love to see the other books come to the big screen
Dec 23 2018,positive,the mindboggling world building strong vibrant characters captivating storyline shocking brutality an amazing movie that blew my mind and i cannot wait to buy it
Dec 23 2018,positive,i am extremely tired of nonstop science fiction films inundating theaters these days but this movie im reviewing and recommending is actually based on something besides the story the plot is really pretty simple as you dont wana confuse the 17 to 25 year old crowd that has the the attention span of a cocker spaniel   but if your artistic in any way shape or form you want to go see this movie its visually stunning in its attention to minute detailset and backgound design   there are several pointless charactersand some overused but that is a common trademark of peter jackson films
Dec 23 2018,positive,great movie with an interesting story but today if you arent a marvel movie no one go to the cinema to watch youreally upset about the box office 
Dec 23 2018,positive,i was suprised how much i liked this film the classic elements and acting that make for a mostly compelling sci fi movie without being overly critical in this day and age of those things seemed to be present the world depicted was stunning visually with some incredible visuals at times i think in the end it was slighty too long a film and contained to much run of the mill good versus evil action weve come to expect but overall this was well done and i hope to see a continuation of this fascinating alternate world and its actors
Dec 23 2018,negative,0 stars very very boring and i had to leave early because it was that boring i tried to enjoy it and thought peter jackson makes good films but its really bad and it lacks everything bad characters talk too much action is boring and kids wont enjoy it either
Dec 23 2018,positive,typical underdog hero fighting evil industrialist warmonger story but still fun to watch great visuals lots of action
Dec 23 2018,positive,great movie from good plot good visual effects and good cast
Dec 23 2018,positive,great movie visually beautiful well executed and well told swift and efficient character establisment throughout adds to a good experience this is simply good storytelling we want more
Dec 22 2018,positive,reviews would have you believe this is worst movie ever made but i really enjoyed it it is a great visual escape and the world created in this movie is very enjoyable to watch unfold plot is predictable to some degree but the star of the movie is the stunning visuals 
Dec 22 2018,positive,i liked the unapologetic social commentary and hugo weaving is always great i didnt feel like i wasted my money which is always a good thing but i do think the film was disjointed and confusing overall
Dec 22 2018,positive,loved the visuals movie felt so much like a jrpg and had an amazing anime view felt like a live action miasaki film very well done and was worth the money for sure
Dec 22 2018,positive,a young adultscifidramaromance movie with a steampunk bent surprised me by being entertaining the writing was atrociously bad  calling it trite would be a compliment but the acting and direction was competent and workmanlike the coloring was perfect and set design and audio design topnotch
Dec 22 2018,positive,i dont care what people say i loved the film its visually stunning the acting is decent and may have some cliches but the moving cities and action scenes and intriguing characters and badass leads are enough to make it awesome after all you go to a movie to enjoy it instead of picking up on things
Dec 22 2018,neutral,special effects are great but thats the case for most movies today the story is just too thin they dont tell us what happened to the world why the world resorted to mobile cities or why mobile cities are even a benefit to begin with story is important with world building visually the makers executed the world building well elsewhere it was lacking by the end i found myself wanting to check my phone
Dec 22 2018,positive,youll need a major dose of suspension of disbeleive but its actually pretty good
Dec 22 2018,neutral,its an entertaining movie but lacks any real substance beneath its basic storyline 
Dec 22 2018,positive,the performance of hera hilmar is totally awsome and pontential she getting skilled to facing against mystery and conspiracy and her characther hesher shaw is a pontential to seek revenge against valiente on a mortal engines story
Dec 22 2018,neutral,ok but the story was kind of dull
Dec 22 2018,positive,expected more not horrible good visual effects story is ok 
Dec 22 2018,positive,not great but not bad enjoyable film especially if you read the book
Dec 21 2018,negative,what a complete train wreck  and not the cool movie train wreck where you wonder who will live and how  more like the taggart transcontinental going into the tunnel with the coal fired engine killing everyone and then the other train blasts into it blowing everything up and killing anyone left alive  this movie could have been great but they tried to put way too much into it and nothing developed
Dec 21 2018,neutral,visually its pretty enthralling and actually quite inspired in parts though it doesnt exactly bring anything new to the table it pulls off some of its visual storytelling quite effectively  the plot itself however is all over the place with too many ideas shoved into two hours  sadly like many pieces of steampunk fiction it also feels awfully contrived  this ones worth seeing for the set designs and pieces but youll probably get the most out of this one watching it muted
Dec 21 2018,negative,the world is intriguing and it makes me somewhat interested in the book series instead of building the world and anything resembling character development this film seemed to try and shoot for a straight up high octane action film sadly minus the octane lol
Dec 21 2018,positive,im not sure why people are ripping his movie a new one yeah ok there were some stupid bits but this futuristic world theyve built while a bit ridiculous technologically it pretty cool and its nice to see a future world that doesnt use the mad max premise the acting is pretty solid the characters are a bit intentionally overthetop and hyperreal in some cases but it matches what the movie seems to be trying to do its fantasy after all i liked it
Dec 21 2018,positive,well done  good start to what could be a franchise
Dec 21 2018,positive,mortal engines appears to be on its way to the dubious distinction of the top blockbuster bomb of 2018 which prompts one to wonder about the vagaries of movie buffs and their appreciation or the lack of it for postapocalyptic dystopian booksmovies  as a genre these kind of movies have their hits and misses it appears mortal engines may have missed the box office mark by a wide margin but it would be interesting to see if it gets any critical acclaim this movie which is based on a book series has to be seen and appreciated at different levels and the 150 million dollar question for the producers is whether or not the audience is that discerning   at the basic postapocalyptic dystopian movie level the audience is looking for a baseline storypremise with imaginative landscapes and spectacular special effects mortal engines does not disappoint at this level the basic premise like any dystopian theme is an apocalyptic event the 60 minute war which destroys earth as we know it and the nationscities that remain rebuildregroup as mobile cities on huge machines devouring other smaller cities also on wheels for survival this is just as good or bad a premise as any other found in the movies of this genre  the argument that it is a little farfetched is hypocritical to say the least given the fact that the setting by definition is postapocalyptic and the audience seems to have accepted far less convincing themes in this genre  the special effects can be classified as spectacular if not mindblowing the machines with cities on topparticularly london are well imagined and the postapocalyptic vistas and landscapes in the movie are impressive the world is shown as a desolate place with arid landscapes with huge machines moving across in the first half which is like most other movies in this genre but as the movie progresses we get to see another landscape in sharp contradistinction which is almost idyllic with cities in the foothills of snowy mountains ascending into vistas of heavenly clouds and aerial dwellings in the sky  at another level the audience will see the secondary plot of revenge which in a convoluted way leads to the prevention of another apocalyptic event just like the one that destroyed the world to begin with mortal engines does not offer anything new in terms of a revenge sub plot but this aspect of the movie gives some scope for the actors to demonstrate their histrionic abilities the fact that most audiences may remember the characters and not the actors in this movie may be a testament to their acting abilities  at a tertiary level what the audience may or may not see is the messagemessages contained within the movie the theme of western aggression runs as an undercurrent in the movie with some classic allusions like learning from history and what have we donea version of the quote from the pilot of the b29 that dropped the first atomic bomb the movie appears to draw parallels between the landscapes and cultures with london inhabiting the bleak and arid landscapes separated by a wall from the beautiful and heavenly eastern landscapes in the final scene after londons aggressive assault on the wall is foiled the eastern civilization extends the proverbial hand to welcome their western brethren while this may be the subtle message that can be perceived a subplot conveys the message of love conquering even the most evil of machines   at each individual level mortal engines seems to meet and even crosses the mark but comprehensively as a movie and particularly at the box office does it cater to most if not all of its audiences though it may not be as successful financially will it go on to become one of those cult classics only time can tell
Dec 21 2018,neutral,really wanted to like this the action and special effects were good but the characters were to empty that i felt no attachment to any of them if you dont connect with the characters the movie will fail it was also very very predictable
Dec 21 2018,negative,really poor movie didnt enjoy one bit the acting was average and watching up until the first quarter was actually very good however when they were thrown out of the london engine the acting got sloppy and the special effects were horrible too many subplots and the green evil guy strike i think his name was didnt even scare me or make me think he was evil towards the end of the movie it was just discount star wars as there was the big city of london the death star and there was a huge weapon that our favorite protagonist had to shut down by entering london rae and finn from star wars force awakens were pretty much tom and heath as there was one whose parents had died and had been raised by a weird robot person and the other that had only been raised inside london star destroyer basically just bad star wars     rating 110
Dec 21 2018,positive,very good movie kept the spirit of the books alive
Dec 21 2018,positive,the film trys to fit a lot of story and action into a shorter space of time it is one of the better book adaptations i have seen but im disappointed that they skimmed certain parts of the books such as the relationships and how they change are are built they also dont fully flesh out all the scenes such as the medusa explosion and the canabilistic society that the main character get put into its understandable why they didnt do it as there was a lot to fit in and the film was already close to 25 hours long but aside from that it was a really good film a good adaptation but i do recommend reading the books
Dec 21 2018,negative,good movie for the first 10 minutes
Dec 21 2018,positive,i absolutely loved this movie     it takes the war elements of many movies like the hobbit and star wars with steampunk vibes and an interesting dystopian plot where its survival of the fittest    the acting is amazing and the visuals are nerdgasm worthy     for all those who wont give this a try based solely on the fact they think moving cities are stupid youre missing out    those of you who dont watch it because they expect it to flop like the rest it is apparently according to figures but that is because you wont give it a chance since peter jacksons name is attached to it     it has some pretty interesting inspiration from greek mythology medusa pandoras box     and honestly i think this is my all time favourite movie in the world right now it encompasses all the books in the series from the mortal engines and the plot is pretty easy to follow
Dec 21 2018,positive,i thought it looked cool from the trailers and i was not dissapointed obviously it is not perfect but its visually spectacular and a lot of fun the plot never really slows down i think that some of the haters might not be able to keep track of everytging thats going on but i like it because there arent any really boring parts   there may be some similarities to a certain famous franchise but i think it takes a real party pooper to hate on one movie just because it resembles another that would be like hating on talor swifts look what you made me do for sampling im too sexy  i really enjoyed the film and im pretty dissapointed that more people arent giving it a chance i would like to see more
Dec 21 2018,positive,i love it visually wonderful totally preposterous and extravagant in a good way the story and characters served well in carrying the viewer through the movie there are not that many steam punk movies while the story is not surprising the movie as a whole is very original much prefer it to disney star wars ive only been once so far but will probably go again and will definitely get it when it comes out on dvd
Dec 21 2018,negative,okay if people enjoyed this im sorry but heres my opinion i left after 30 minutes of this movie mindlessly going nowhere and seemed to never really shape up it might have but all i know is i didnt see it its sad to say that i cant recommend this to anyone 
Dec 21 2018,negative,great special effects but thats were the buck stops story was very weak and flt no connection or even had any interests in the characters either really hard to believe this was a peter jackson movie usually he gives very full enrich stories but not here
Dec 21 2018,negative,they didnt kiss what a disappointmentª c
Dec 21 2018,neutral,fantastic visuals lacking a driving plot besides the cliche ridden one it currently espouses
Dec 21 2018,negative,this was a mortal flop  two stars for having three or four thrilling cgi explosionfests that were pretty to look at but this movie was not good  peter jackson is a flop
Dec 21 2018,neutral,im not familiar with the source material for the film  so there was no  emotional connection to the characters walking into the theatre that said  the archetypes are all there the leads are charming enough and the villian is solid  the dystopian world is visually interesting but i felt i would have liked to see more of the world mixed into the plot where are the animals the plot take over the world  revenge been there done that  which is fine there are no original stories just stories told in a different way mortal engines just doesnt seem different enough while at the same time unfamiliar  it may be a huge box office disappointment but it is far from the worst film ive seen
Dec 21 2018,negative,i just could not get into or understand at times where and what this movie was about or where it was going
Dec 21 2018,negative,i am a super huge peter jackson fan but iï 12tmm just not sure what happened here i realize people try their best to make good movies and produce good acting but this was neither   the plot never never really explains anything just jumps into scene after scene i feel like they tried to cram too much into one movie from a book   as well i only liked the main character lead and the acting did not do it for me   hopefully everyone can learn from it and improve for next time     graham
Dec 21 2018,positive,great graphics  visulaly impresive characters were well played lacked a little in devlopment original story line  with an intresting take on a alt universei dont know whats with the bad ratings i enjoyed it
Dec 21 2018,positive,brilliant movie full of action looking forward to seeing it again
Dec 21 2018,neutral,they said peter jackson is in it i said it should be as good as king kong mortal engines introduced a promising trailer and peaked my interest but probably wouldnt spare my time to see it on big screen however during this extremely cold snowy istanbul trip i had few hours to spend alone walking istiklal up and down i saw a movie theater and instead of freezing my bones outside i thought i could get in and see this movie i had no idea that movie was using a book as a source to be honest i thought that these guys created a freaking universe out of no where at first and after all that 2 hours experience only thing that remained in my mind is how cool that fallout synth looking dude was movie was entertaining of course and i really didnt have anything better to do at that moment so it saved me from freezing to death but then again it was like finding a rusty dirty and messy inn while travelling in the cold you are thankful that you can warm your bones and feast on popcorn and coke but still you consider finding a better place
Dec 21 2018,positive,mortal engines rise  the world of the traction cities     mortal engines is a different kind of movie one that brings you closer to the truth    everyone says dont believe the hype except of course if the hype is for something to fail the movie mortal engines will be a cult classic  guaranteed     the only question is did you experience it on the big screen when you had the chance     the critics tell us that there is just too much competition for mortal engines to succeed     can you even compare a big concept movie to a comic book movie depicting an underwater army of muscle bound fish men riding giant seahorses and sharks    if not for the cgi most movies on offer these days are just childrens cartoons marketed cynically to adults     another criticism levelled at mortal engines is that the source material for the movie is just too old and therefore outofdate  the first book mortal engines was penned in 2001 with the last in the series a darkling plain published in march 2006 over ten years ago     to put things in perspective superman first appeared in comic book form in 1938 batman in 39 aquaman in 41 the first star wars movie a new hope was released in may 1977  over 41 years ago transformers first aired as an animated kids programme in 1984  that is 34 years ago there isnt much playing on the big screens anymore that isnt a rebootrehash of an idea that was first conjured up almost half a century ago so stop telling me that due to the books being a paltry ten years old they are now irrelevant   that is absolute crap     the main criticism levelled at the movie is the story itself how can the narrative structure be at fault when it is the only big budget offering based on a book a highly acclaimed one at that if the narrative packed anymore punch it would have knocked me out as for utilising more hollywood star power havent we seen enough fantasy and scifi roles given to tom cruise no offense tom     to have some fresh new faces on screen was as refreshing as the movie itself we see tom natsworthy develop as a character from an abiding traction citydweller to a more hardened and resilient freedom fighter we also witness the transformation of hester shaws character from hardened outcast in pursuit of revenge to someone who learns to trust again to love we see the endgame in our technological pursuit to surpass nature in the robotised cadaver called shrike     what is the movie about     the real question is how far do you want to go    if we could literally see what our combined actions looked like as a species then it would look like something akin to mortal engines yes it is that kind of movie  even the name mortal engines signifies that nothing we create lasts forever if the whole concept of mobile predator cities seems outlandish then remember it was intentionally meant to be so  the mobile cities are a powerful metaphor for the ridiculousness of our human engineered systems and how far we will go to protect them this movie poses some of the most profound questions of our age     such as how far will we go as a species in the fight for limited resources    how far will we go to sustain the unsustainable    if you want more there is also the 60minute war between china and america that almost ended all human life the development of powerful weapons capable of not only taking out entire cities but entire continents the metaphors in this film are visceral you dont just understand the concepts but feel them    watch something new i dare you    if such a big concept movie can be dismissed so quickly then it sends a chilling message to every future filmmaker writer and artist hoping to pitch an exciting new idea     it tells us that hollywood is now closed for business and that the bean counters who effectively deal with risk management have won     but what have they won      when we stare out across a cultural wasteland populated only by remakes of movie remakes we will realise that this monopoly on ideas cannot last that it is as unsustainable as the predator cities themselves hunting down the last scraps of civilisation     when every comic book series has been adapted for the silver screen will they then let some new ideas through and will the public brought up on a steady diet of regurgitated ideas and repurposed cultural icons be able to even recognise a brand new concept when finally exposed to it     the opening narration to the movie is one of the best ever this harsh and crackling voice leads us straight into the most breath taking cgi action sequences ever created all accompanied by a heart pounding score composed by tom holkenborg aka junkie xl who also created the soundtrack to mad max fury road in this amazing cgi world which pushed weta digitals computers to the limit we have some great acting by robert sheehan and hera hilmarsdottir a fantastic icelandic actress     what more could you ask for       if creating a perfect film is not enough in this modern environment then what hope is there for the rest of us creators     if this movie doesnt succeed then the age of big concept movies is dead there i have said it    mortal engines  the truth is out there go and see it for yourselves
Dec 21 2018,positive,it was ok dont get the whole part of the asian shen guo
Dec 21 2018,positive,the is a entertaining movie just go see it if you like sifi special effects are awesome
Dec 20 2018,positive,a wonderful visual spectacle not without flaws but generally entertaining and new
Dec 20 2018,negative,retrofuturistic steam punk nonsense with major plot holes why not build a castlelike fortress city on a mountain or cliff where tractor cities cant go pretty dumb i walked out because i had a sock drawer at home that needed sorting and that would have been a better use of my time
Dec 20 2018,positive,far better than i expected after reading multiple reviews just goes to show that sometimes the rating system we use does not work funny how a movie on rotten tomatoes with a 58 is a spilt bucket of popcorn versus a movie with a 61 is a filled bucket i think they key issue this movie faced was that it was far too grandiose of a story to place within the parameters of a 2 hour movie that was operating on a budget far more things come into play in making a movie then just the actors and the director however i have seen movies that had far better scores on rotten tomatoes that i would consider far less entertaining than mortal engines i paid to see a science fiction movie with great visuals action sequences and an interesting plot i got exactly what i paid for 
Dec 20 2018,negative,make the hideously disfigured hester shaw beautiful ignore the brilliant story and character development dont write any dialogue fill the screen with cgi bullshit that looks as unreal as it is and result a very long trailer for a movie you dont know how to make how peter jackson allowed this to happen is beyond me surely he cares about story or once did what could have been a series of films to rival the potterverse has managed to shoot itself in the foot while in training camp read the books
Dec 20 2018,negative,it is the first time that i am excited by the trailer of a movie and i am bored when i watch the movie after the movie i felt like it was a waste of my time that i have gone to watch it not recommended it is for your own good however the work done with cgi and special effects was really impressive the story itself is useless and i think the director of this movie didnt use the right story for this movie even though it comes from a book
Dec 20 2018,negative,the story would have been good if more thought would have been put into it  acting is horrible off the wall nonsense
Dec 20 2018,positive,great movie should see for yourself and dont listen to critics or websites
Dec 20 2018,positive,enjoyed the series in 2011 when l heard weta was attached to the film project    hoping all the films will be made really visual world building great film
Dec 20 2018,positive,great special effects  the story is average but more full than nutcracker  it is predictable  the twists and turns are there in the plot but you see them coming  to see the special effects fully you need to see it in the theater but the story you can wait for the dvd
Dec 20 2018,positive,thoroughly entertaining and imaginative the fusion of past present  future innovations melded in a future that is trying desparately to catch up with itself tomatometer has got this movie wrong i think baby boomers can appreciate this movie more than the millennials
Dec 20 2018,neutral,had lots of potential but it included why too many different plots from the book in a crammed amount of time which made the movie seemed unorganized and cluttered
Dec 20 2018,positive,mortal engines  awesome rules insane bad ass and beats all the lame crap at the movies now i want a city on wheels   your confused looper spidercrap sucks what the mule   what are u talking about cartoons  crap movies hahahah not worth my time or money
Dec 20 2018,negative,what a beautiful terrible waste of an interesting deep universe i hate to go the books were better route but everything compelling about the stories were buried under an avalanche of special effects and loud explosions literally nothing special about the characters comes across so now you have the superficially odd universe trying to stand up on its own it doesnt work how does this guy keep getting funding for his movies
Dec 20 2018,positive,one of my absolute favorite films of the year great story characters action and effects
Dec 20 2018,positive,saw it  great fun good acting  the story line takes a bit to figure out but does come through brilliantly i thought
Dec 20 2018,positive,great creativity great sets wonderful imagining of a dystopian futuristic world and characters that can lead to more great movies
Dec 20 2018,positive,i have enjoyed the steam punk genre for a long time when it comes to movies steampunk genre seems to be forgotten i think this particular adaptations of books is great as a light fare to enjoy beautiful epic spectacle of cgi effects that i completely enjoyed in an imax theater this was a great afternoon getaway i hope that others can just enjoy the movie and i hate to see that it did so poorly as monetarily wise because it really is just something to enjoy a nice huge spectacle of steampunk ridiculousness i know some would like to compare to how the book is able to bring up these things over the long term but you dont have time for that and honestly if you need to be guided through every single little detail and explained every little thing about every little thing that happens in a movie why are you watching it to watch a documentary instead movies are for getting away and enjoying and watching this movie i think people really just need to enjoy it because it is that much fun if you just sit back and enjoy it
Dec 20 2018,positive,fun visual spectacle feels like they tried to cram too much story into it made me want to read the book
Dec 20 2018,positive,the pacing of this film is much slower than you would expect of a cinematic blockbuster of this type  this is not a bad thing  the plot reveals itself throughout the movie with limited explains used to bring the viewer up to speed  you must just accept that the cities have been mobilised  no idea why or how this would occur but hey  i may have missed the initial explain about there also being those who chose not to mobilise kinda key in the latter part and actually the whole driving force of the movie  i will say i have not read the books the movie has made me interested in reading the books  i think there is more here than has made it into this movie  seriously go see it  its better than aquaman my 14 year old son agrees with this  he said it first
Dec 20 2018,positive,it was a fun movie  ï 12  enjoyable and fantastic ideas
Dec 20 2018,negative,worst movie i have seen so far    the movie lacks story disgrace to science    in one scene some of the character were flying a plane while the window was shattered it seems like there is no wind flow in atmosphere if someone want to waste money he or she should throw away bills rather than buying movie ticket for this piece of shit
Dec 20 2018,neutral,horribly paced and not nearly as visually appealing as i would have expected
Dec 20 2018,positive,truly enjoyed this film didnt know what to expect and was very pleased really cool cg the story was good acting was good so really enjoyed the experience
Dec 20 2018,positive, as a fan of the books i loved it
Dec 20 2018,positive,so pretty good story not hard to understand so i dont know what the critics are on about it being crap  also it has no big names to draw people it has hugo weaving
Dec 20 2018,positive,i dont get all the hate this films receiving i actually enjoyed it id give it a 710 far from a perfect film but enjoyable nonetheless
Dec 20 2018,positive,great visual effects and story line
Dec 20 2018,negative,great visuals like the conceptbut storyline uneven acting was cheesy 
Dec 19 2018,negative,this was a tractionist wreck a film that needs an engine overhaul    reel dialogue even though the depictions in this film are lacking it does open the discussion on the value of fathers    
Dec 19 2018,positive,pretty good story and effects
Dec 19 2018,negative,pretty terrible poorly made on many levels felt very discombobulated so many scenes felt awkward like something was off it made me question so much of what happened the acting was bad i was bored and didnt care about the characters except for the metal one some good visuals and cool scenes but it felt like a combination of a bunch of other movies one of which is mad max fury road with some of its concepts and its musical score one of the songs sounds like it was straight up stolen from fury road i liked the score for the most part    so many cheesy moments so many cliches i couldnt wait until it finished pretty much a waste of time 1 viewing
Dec 19 2018,positive,i just got back from the movie and i loved it its takes a creative mind to enjoy these types of movies the visuals and actors were refreshing great story line is totally something different and i was very engaged though out the whole movie most of the movies takes place in present time same cars same cities same ol plots but if you have what it takes in your mind and want to take an adventure into a new world of possibilities go see this film
Dec 19 2018,positive,sure it may be loud and full of cgi but what marvel dc or disney movie like it isnt  i was thrilled to finally see a movie that wasnt about a comic book hero villain or side story and get on with something at least a bit more original  great adaptation of the source material book 1 and i hope they adapter the others  this is just the beginning of an overall greater story that ties up nice  pretty come the end  just watch and have fun in an otherwise oversaturated super herovillain disneyownseverything and remakes everything market  id see it again and highly recommend
Dec 19 2018,positive,i dont get all of the hate for this movie i went in with low expectations and enjoyed it its certainly as good as any of the formulaic marvel movies and a least tries to have some originality it is very impressive visually and certainly an enjoyable escape for a couple hours im not sure what people were expecting
Dec 19 2018,positive,do me a favor stop reading the critics and go watch the movie its awesome i really dont understand why the critics were so hard with it its a very original movie very well done id say it is a mix between mad max and star wars if you liked those movies go and watch it you wont appreciate the details if you watch it at home its a movie to be enjoy in the big screen
Dec 19 2018,neutral,ok it was watchable but only in the same way as the last airbender   yes i knew it was going to be like that but i have the amc alist membership and i wanted to see 3 movies that week
Dec 19 2018,positive,i really did enjoy this movie i took it for what it was i understand that the cgi was used in excess but thats kind of understandable and pretty much expected for the story and what it was i liked the casting i liked the story i enjoyed the world and ideas it was a beautiful looking movie but i expected that from peter jackson my only real complaint was that i wanted more of an understanding as to why valentine wanted to destroy the wall and what his motives were it was so lightly touched on and i felt like i needed more explanation however i didnt read the novel and im really not that bothered by this issue overall i enjoyed it quite a bit four stars from me
Dec 19 2018,negative,eh this movie could have done so well there was just something missing it was lacking cant put my finger on it
Dec 19 2018,positive,i enjoy the movie it had a few potholes but was a fun ride into this amazing world that they created i enjoy the soundtrack too 
Dec 19 2018,negative,i dont know about you guys but i had a good sleep  i just went back from the movie theater and would like to give some positive feedback about this movie i would say that people with insomnia should definitely watch this movie this is more than an entertainment but a cure
Dec 19 2018,positive,everyone is being way too hard on this movie its a fun stupid action movie stop expecting perfection
Dec 19 2018,positive,as a fan of the book series i was afraid id be let down by the movie but i was very pleasantly surprised the movie version is a grand adventure on par with its source material visually stunning and exciting with moments that made me tear up in ways the books never did naturally it was different from the book but i appreciated the adaptations that had to be made i wish it could have been longer ill definitely watch it again
Dec 19 2018,positive,great action great story a really fantastic movie
Dec 19 2018,positive,mortal engines  2018  12a  director christian rivers  starring hera hilmar robert sheehan hugo weaving and jihae    overall rating 74100    despite getting an overwhelming negative response from critics i want to talk about what makes mortal engines a surprisingly good and at times emotional action film that mostly works in a new non generic way    firstly lets talk about its incredible visuals there was so many visual elements added into this film that it surprised me when i read its budget was only 100m as it seems like a lot higher when watching and i have to admit the overall aesthetic of the film was incredible to watch and that stayed consistent throughout the whole film with new sets added from time to time to keep the audience excited and interested    next i would like to add the uniqueness of the whole plot i couldnï 12 12 12tmt compare it to any other film which is always a great box to tick when watching a film making  cities mechanical is something so surreal its just amazing to watch and hats off to the director for making this creative idea come to life in a big way and having flying cities as well it just really created a whole new world for people to enjoy    however one negative for this film was the at times cringey script this was the only part of the film that for me was slightly generic as some of the things the characters said especially the protagonists has been heard many times before in many other teen novel movies which was slightly annoying as nearly everything else from the film was unique    another aspect of the film that the director got right was the soundtrack which i was expecting to be good due to the film being made by the creators of lord of the ringsthe music fitted with every scene it needed to the action scenes and sad scenes and also the tense scenes the sound really helped with creating a better atmosphere for the audience    however one thing that they did do wrong with the first half of the film was that they tried to stuff to many narrative developments with loads of characters and the film itself that it got quite complicated to follow at the start if they had built up the backstory for the plot instead of jamming it all into 20 minutes it would of worked a lot betteras they added way to many layers to the film in such a small amount of time however things got explained more in detail through the second half of the film so this was much more better to understand and more enjoyable    next i want to go into detail about aspects of certain characters that i enjoyed watching firstly with hester  hera hilmar she was portrayed brilliantly she was very blunt and didnï 12 12 12tmt show to much emotion which was actually refreshing to see with the main character of a action film as she didnï 12 12 12tmt take no for an answer and she didnï 12 12 12tmt want the attention on her also the stereotypical kiss that always happens  between the boy and the girl actually didnï 12 12 12tmt happen which was nice to see as it was something new secondly  i liked the character of thaddeus who i thought was a very good villain as he played the role of saviour for the people very well and managed to disguise his true desires from everyone even his own daughter which showed narrative depth for him as he thought he knew what was right thirdly i also liked the character of anna fang who was the badass protagonist that we come to expect from action films but yet she was still exciting to watch as her way of disposing the villains was very unique with blades coming out of her shoes etc she was thoroughly entertaining to see    i would also like to add one of my favourite characters in the whole film was shrike despite looking very intimidating and nearly indestructible so making you think he will be a antagonist he was actually very misjudged and the use of flashbacks was done very well to show of how nice his character actually was when raising hester and  to learn about his backstory actually added a lot of emotional depth to the film as it was genuinely sad to see how he used to have a family but his memory was wiped clean and he was made to look like a monster so when he died the use of flashbacks was again used wonderfully as it showed him when he was with his son making that particular scene surprisingly emotional    however just ending on a few negatives for some of the characters firstly it took to long for the audience to actually be introduced to hester all she was doing for the first 30 minutes or so was just standing around saying nothing which effected her importance in the first half of the film secondly i found the character of tom quite irritating he was constantly making stupid remarks about people and not really using his brain when he needed to it was just frustrating to watch in parts and finally l think that in general the film was slightly to overstuffed with characters so there was so many different people to focus on it just got slightly difficult to follow everyones story in parts    despite mortal engines being far from perfect it is still a thoroughly entertaining and unique action film that adds a new layer to the action genre and no way deserves the amount of negativity it is getting
Dec 19 2018,positive,the usual predictive story line of  revenge enough action kept me entertained movie did not drag  liked it
Dec 19 2018,negative,what a disappointment  all kinds of plot holes but it looked good  most of the plot and characters actions made no sense  i dont know if it was just the theater i was in because i havent seen any other mention of this but the sound was horrible  it was like certains tracks were missing and it kept distracting me when action on the screen had no sound to go with some of it
Dec 19 2018,positive,it was a fun movie my 12 and 10 year old daughters really enjoyed i have to admit it was a little more violent than i was expecting but overall it was an enjoyable film with some really great cinematography
Dec 19 2018,positive,its a fun sci fi movie to watch probably will enter into a niche movie down the line     the storyconcept is interesting and appears more indepth then what the movie tells the biggest flaw is that there was to much ground to cover in story and not much time  so in many parts it feels rushed if done right this movie could of been 23 movies  i would have actually proffered that more
Dec 19 2018,positive,this movie was mad max beyond thunderdome and star wars on steroids graphics and animation has to be seen on the big screen very entertaining throughout
Dec 19 2018,positive,so much better than recent star wars
Dec 19 2018,negative,try as i might 45 minutes into the film found myself checking my emails as my attention slowly waned not sure why this movie was made  felt like id seen it before
Dec 19 2018,positive,a must watch action galore everlasting stories all connecting to each other better than some star war movies for sure please have a part ii
Dec 19 2018,positive,the first hour and a half is great a real fantastically realisedvisualised adventure film      but the film is a clunker character wise and narratively the script is full of age old cliched lines pinched from the hundred thousand that proceeds it it just is cringeworthy featuring a detrimental turgid end finale that felt like a mix between a new hopes final space battle against the death star fused with steam punk designs and every other aero based fight sequence      when it focuses on hester shaws relationship with her surrogate role model shrike an undead bounty hunter one of the last of a battalion known as stalker it excels on a thematic and story driven level real juice to the rustic cogs and pistons sadly a light dab isnï 12 12tmt enough     its sprawling its something weï 12 12tmve never seen but thats all it is visual lustre and thats all
Dec 19 2018,positive,stunning cgi and exciting till the end nearly feels to short
Dec 19 2018,positive,epic story great effects and a real focus on character and heart at its core an unexpected delight esp in light of the poor reviews
Dec 19 2018,negative,the visuals where impressive the story telling was not i would have liked to see more of a battle between the roaming citys
Dec 19 2018,negative,meh visually interesting but uninspiring 
Dec 19 2018,negative,strong start some unusual technical decisions
Dec 18 2018,positive,it was a movie which had high expectations but failed i liked the movie in general but it lacked in suspense
Dec 18 2018,negative,bad dialog worse directing poor editing epic special effects and world build the long stares that characters shared over and over were absurd one tense scene the hero stops to pick out a coat while the fate of the movie hangs in the balance just poor execution all around if you took it and edited this down to about half the content and reshot a few dialog scenes it could have been decent
Dec 18 2018,positive,do you love to hate london how about cities in general
Dec 18 2018,positive,i walked in to this movie totally blind had no idea what it was about and absolutely loved it it was action packed the story flowed smoothly they had the most interesting actors playing the parts wildflower for the win i literally thought to myself they certainly hired the right people the ones who really deserved the job this time the ones who could make this story believable albeit a little less star studded    be warneditâtms not the newest story but whatever     and there was a hot second there at the beginning where i was seriously worried it was going to be another mortal instruments or twilight or i am number four rip the movies that these could have been with cheesy graphics and terribly angstriddenwithouttruedepth delivery but it wasnâtmt     i shed a few tears giggled outloud was on the edge of my seat at times and overall thoroughly enjoyed myself with this flick definitely recommend no matter what the critics say
Dec 18 2018,positive,i had high hopes for this film seeing that it was coming from peter jackson its a very intriguing world but the movie feels a bit rushed i want more backstory on these characters theres no rationale for why cities like london would want to canibalize smaller structures to survive or how they could ever think that would be sustainable overall a nice b film though it was shooting for an a
Dec 18 2018,positive,spectacular visuals and worldbuilding its such an absurd premise but they manage to make it believable    the storys pretty standard genre fiction fare heros journey avenge my parents stop the death star its simple and fairly predictable but it worked well enough to keep my interest and move things along to the next imaginative location or setpiece    the writing sometimes fell a bit flat but the actors were good enough to make it work for the most part i liked the characters enough for their payoffs to work for me  though admittedly i dont know how much that might have been skewed by the fact that ive read the books so i was already familiar with these characters    my expectations were low going in due to the trailers reviews and general track record of movies based on ya genre fiction but i wound up enjoying it enough to see it twice its basically steampunk star wars and by that i mean the very first star wars episode iv simple story and iffy writing but overall enjoyable and establishes a fantastic and imaginative world for more interesting stories in the future except you know the part where we wont get those more interesting stories because it bombed but oh well at least it works fine as a standalone story and they didnt leave a bunch of loose ends or throw in sequel bait at the end    go see it in theaters so you can say you were a fan before it became a cult classic
Dec 18 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie the cgi is first rate from beginning to end the story is no worse than a lot of other movies given positive reviews and shows originality i havent read the book yet but after seeing this movie i certainly will
Dec 18 2018,positive,i was expecting a mad max twisted metal movie  i got a love story with a tesla gun  wasnt bad per say but wasnt what i expected
Dec 18 2018,positive,interesting unique and fun film the strongest parts of the film are the effects and world building its not the most expensive blockbuster but looks simnifically better than most the story thrusts you into a refreshing new world that hasnt been seen a thousand times already and builds a unique experience it is not perfect but definitely worth the watch
Dec 18 2018,positive,the movie was actually enjoyable and i am now reading the book because of it 
Dec 18 2018,positive,great premise let down by weak storytelling and likeable characters
Dec 18 2018,positive,dont know what the critics and negative audience snobs are talking about me is an excellent scifi fantasy action adventure the fx and visuals alone are well worth the price of admission also the story is great bit of a mystery love story and with a few powerful tangents and twists again not sure what the haters are complaining about the story is not weak and is excellent framework for a great scifi fx movie
Dec 18 2018,positive,as a peter jackson movie the visual affects were amazing in this film the characters were quite forgetible as i personally didnt remember most of there names i was hesitant to watch go and watch this movie after i looked at the reviews but im pleased i did
Dec 18 2018,negative,boring bad acting your worst movies file reference
Dec 18 2018,negative,its a good turkey serious as a heart attack and a strong musical score its not as bad as they say the movie looks good too
Dec 18 2018,neutral,amazing special effects but either the story or acting left me not caring about the protagonist
Dec 18 2018,positive,not without its issues mortal engines introduces a fresh new world and characters to care about during an unrelenting era of remakes sequels and spinoffs visually spectacular it is worth watching in cinemas before it drops off early
Dec 18 2018,positive,i found this movie to be an absolute blast well acted beautiful camerawork and a plot i found to be actually quite intriguing my only complaint is i wish the resistance had been given a bit more screen time so we could fully understand who they were as characters and what they represented but thats fairly minor for me i really enjoyed this movie and i fully plan to see it again
Dec 18 2018,negative,when did fx take the place of script and acting i can intuit how this film was made  the geeks created their nerdy junkyardfuture world did the story boarding then handed it off to the writers  give us something plausible to go with it  painfully derivative aliens star wars blade runner too long and ultimately boring  ptui
Dec 18 2018,positive,cant believe the negative reviews on this movie its simply one of the best movies of the past few years innovative fast paced good story line and characters and the best cgi yet simply stunning in imax 3d comparing watching this movie to the latest star wars or harry potter movie is like watching paint dry
Dec 18 2018,neutral,this movie had its moments mostly visually but not only did it not separate itself from the genre or add anything to it  it reduced itself to stealing a lot of ideas from a lot of far better movies this movie would up being clumsy and forgettable regardless of a few fun moments
Dec 18 2018,negative,disappointing to say the least  i had really high hopes after reading the books that this would be a movie on the scale of star wars or the hobbit or something new and grand  unfortunately the movie lacked the creative color that the boos were able to deliver  even the story took so many liberties that the next books really cannot be made because how in the world can they go where the story should go if they changed the ending so aggressively  i was excited for the movie ever since the trailers came out and i was very disappointed
Dec 18 2018,negative,might be the worst movie i have ever seen
Dec 18 2018,positive,loved every minute of it
Dec 18 2018,negative,unfortunately not even hugo weaving could save this dumpster fire of a movie sure the big moving cities looked cool but that is the extent of nice things i have to say about this movie one cgi character in particular looked like he was in a cartoon not a live action film the characters were hollow with lazy backstories and unclear motives unfortunately that is not where the problems end for the characters beyond hugo weaving i cannot think of anyone who had even a decent performance this felt like they wanted to start the next big franchise with this movie but ended up killing it before it got started
Dec 18 2018,positive,its a fun mindless movie not as bad as the reviews will have you believe 
Dec 18 2018,positive,incredible film not sure why it has got such dismal reviews the characters are fun the setting is crazy and the story even more so overall a great film that i will be recommending to everyone i know
Dec 18 2018,positive,great movie  dont believe the critics thoroughly entertaining 
Dec 18 2018,positive,it was surprisingly entertaining happy i saw it
Dec 17 2018,neutral,backrounds and sets were great spectacles to see but the plot was corny at each of the impact momemts of story it packed way to much stuff into the movie and would really only work for fans who read the books if anyone
Dec 17 2018,positive,it was a great ride really enjoyed it now i will read the book
Dec 17 2018,positive,ive read review from these socalled movie critics and still im confused on what they say is good or bad but who cares what they say because each has its own opinion   mortal engines is a movie based on fantasy not academy award acting or blah blah about filling some form of criteria to gain acceptance from some critic this film is based on watching seeing some visual effects and enjoy thats it fun movie different  new concept and watch because the visuals are too good to pass
Dec 17 2018,positive,if you dont look too closely under the hood this is an entertaining movie especially in the visual sense  but the screenplay really needed a couple of good rewrites to smooth out some clumsy plot devices and logical inconsistencies with the characters and progression of the plot
Dec 17 2018,positive,i saw this imax 3d at universal an excellent presentation the film was wonderful full of colors and imagination well directed it is not getting the credit it deserves
Dec 17 2018,positive,wow  saw it in 3d imax visually spectacular  amazing almost inconceivable fantasy  dont believe all the neg reviews
Dec 17 2018,positive,6510  mortal engines was weird and utterly bonkers and i liked it a visually stunning if not silly new steampunk world we havent seen before on film plot and characters were a bit generic and thin but the cast and music sell it hugo weaving and stephen lang are the mvps of this movie    im fine with or without a sequel if you like weird anime then youll really like this finally something new bold and risky from a hollywood blockbuster yes its based on a book see it if you want more bold risky original blockbusters    also btw the minions appear in this film yes the yellow ones im not kidding
Dec 17 2018,negative,while it is quite beautiful revealing the best cgi can do in our generation the story lacks intensively  original score 155
Dec 17 2018,negative,i went to this movie with the lowest of expectations in the hope that perhaps i would be pleasantly surprisedi left with the realization that if someone offered to pay me to watch it again i would not it was bloated cgi paired with a plotline that would be considered drivel by an idiot
Dec 17 2018,positive,great movie small details didnï 12tmt quite make sense here and there but this is obviously a massive world
Dec 17 2018,positive,im afraid im basically mimicking the general opinion on this but mortal engines is more style than substance    visually this one of those rare visual masterpieces director christian rivers was a storyboard artistvisual effects guy on the lord of the ringshobbit films and he knows how build a world the film contains a sort of cyberpunkish reality that combines the old and new everything from the technology to the clothing to even the natural environment feels completely distinctive the giant tanklike city of london is something to behold the opening where were introduced to the place is such a breathtaking scene    the film also has an impressively designed secondary antagonist in the form of the disturbing and relentless shrike a cyberzombie with a piercing voice    before i get into the plot understand that the story and actors are decent just not strong enough to sustain the 2 hour 8 minute run time the script is by peter jackson and his regular cowriters fran walsh and philippa boyens like king kong and the hobbit films they dont realize less is more dialogue and some action scenes just go on a little too long in fairness the length gives the writers ample time to explain how this busy world works even then there are a couple script holes a character figures out a plot point too quickly without enough plausible context and a supporting character just sort of vanishes once he served his purpose    the film unsuccessfully romantically pairs the two main characters hester shaw hera hilmar and tom natsworthy robert sheehan it does a wonderful job of building a friendship and why theyd trust each other but the love aspect is unbelievable it happens too quickly and they have no chemistry    plotwise the standout character is again shrike he has the most sympathetic storyline in the pantheon of good villains from weak films i hope shrike ends up being remembered like the darkness from legend and not forgotten like maximillian from the black hole    despite its clunkiness i highly recommend you see this just for this experience you just may want to watch it at home while your washing the dishes or working on a project
Dec 17 2018,positive,not the greatest film but it was enjoyable to watch the story line was kind of sillystupid but the action and the acting was great especially from hugo weaving hugo weaving stole the show 
Dec 17 2018,positive,really good movie actually  donï 12 12tmt go off anyone elseï 12 12tms review  this is a sleeper just like venom  starts off slow because of critics but the movie is good
Dec 17 2018,negative,i wanted to see this because of peter jackson now im not sure if i want to see another peter jackson movie cg great story silly and boring and the movie was far too long
Dec 17 2018,positive,great movie a few plot holes which is why i understand it received the rotten tomatoes score it did but if youre a genuine peter jackson fan then youll like this film 
Dec 17 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie
Dec 17 2018,positive,i was good a little to campy mix of action comedy romance but it moved and flowed well i will be watching it again on dvd scar removal technology and teeth whitening over a 1000 years in the future would have helped
Dec 17 2018,positive,great movie wasnt advertised enough for people to know it was coming
Dec 17 2018,negative,while mortal engines has potential as well as stunning visual effects its narrative is constructed from other much better scifi fantasies and doesnt offer much of a creative spark or interesting characters to power this blunt mess of an engine
Dec 17 2018,negative,omg were do i start movie should a just been released straight to dvd goes the story was pretty bad effects were good but omg god i was super bored threw the entire movie basically see at your own risk
Dec 17 2018,positive,like a lot other folks are saying the critics were harsh on this one also a lot of people seem to throw around the term derivative but thats not what this is this is just a movie that wears its influences on its sleeve where most films try to hide them the action is excellent there are things that are just left unexplained or poorly explained but you should just be able to roll with that  its not like you cant fill them in yourself fairly easily also the acting his taking a hard hit and that seems truly unfair hugo weaving is good in pretty much everything he does the two leads work well together and while not stellar are very good theres nothing glaring in supporting cast  they all do good jobs in short if you dig fantasy and didnt drop out of film school in the second year this is a fun movie
Dec 17 2018,positive,this film is heavily underrated  the story is great  the setup works  the cgi is excellent  to summarize this movie this is steampunk star wars written by someone who is at least competent
Dec 17 2018,positive,i  really liked the look of the trailer for this film so i was looking forward to seeing the finished product however i was left disappointed the graphics are stunning but given the beautiful visual feast it was a shame that the rest of the film came below par the acting was a bit dodgy the script lacklustre and it felt all very rushed  with  no time put aside to build up our characters or setting there were flashes of brilliance but nothing long lasting watchable but it could have been much better
Dec 17 2018,positive,i enjoyed the full immersion of the world created in at a future time
Dec 17 2018,positive,this movie in my opinion was amazing at the story line and characters its definitely a good movie for people who like the star wars series or ready player one
Dec 17 2018,positive,it was entertaining  while not the greatest masterpiece ive ever seen the cities were interesting and the plot infinitely better than say gi joe movies or most of the transformers  it was a little slow at times but overall it was an entertaining film to see   i am not sure why it is getting reviewed so poorly not epic but the are far worse films that everyone goes and sees and gets stupid excited about
Dec 17 2018,positive,decent movie story was a bit lacking and character development  felt extremely rushed the visuals were extremely well done and what make the movie
Dec 17 2018,negative,this is a real stinker of a movie spectacular over the top cgi but a stupid incoherent story and mediocre acting the premise is of course nonsense but it is science fiction so that can be forgiven what shouldnt be forgiven is the hamhanded slapdash attention to the story line even after the movie we could not figure out what some it was really all about normally when a movie confuses me that way i go again to figure it out but i have no desire to spend my time or money on this dog again dont say i didnt warn you
Dec 17 2018,positive,dont understand the negative reviews its a fantasy movies and as such delivers great special effects and some thought provoking ideas the plot resolved well enough at the end but it needs to be remembered this is only story one in the trilogy which is well worth reading whether you area child or not hera hilmer was convincing and certainly much better acted than the early harry potter movies   overall this is an adaptation of a childrens fantasy novel and as such delivers with a lot of entertaining special effects
Dec 17 2018,positive,this movie blew me away i went in with pretty low expectations it was much better than the recent star wars movies the storyline was fresh and moving my favorite aspect of the movie was that i didnt feel pandered to most recent big budget films have begun to feel calculated every joke or moment of levity carefully placed after many focus groups this movie just felt real as if it was simply telling a story it was a refreshing reminder of a time when storytelling was the point of a movie
Dec 17 2018,positive,i really like the world building in this movie the concept of mobile cities was really cool to see come to life however i sometimes found myself forgetting the actual scale of the cities themselves even in imax 3d but other than that its a very good movie i cant wait for it to come out on dvd
Dec 17 2018,positive,a good movie with amazing special effects that falls short in creating a believable reason why it all exists due to a paperthin story line it should have been great but the lack of proper storytelling sinks the movie
Dec 17 2018,positive,this movie was actually pretty good i wasnt sure whether to watch it or not but im glad i did i would recommend 
Dec 17 2018,negative,story line needs some help the death star and empire strikes back luke i am your father scene ruined it for me 
Dec 17 2018,positive,its important to reward studios for making movies that are not cookie cutter garbage that only appeal to the lowest common denominator   this movie gets high marks for originality but at times i felt like they robbed too many storylines from starwars franchise   go see this movie and take children no nudity no cursing
Dec 17 2018,positive,its a fun movie just sit back and enjoy i may go watch it again
Dec 17 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to critics  who are just looking for a negative movie to love this is an exciting and fun movie
Dec 17 2018,positive,it was a pretty good movie
Dec 17 2018,positive,great visual effects plot could be better shriek looked like a dumb version of a terminator kinda lowers down the level 
Dec 17 2018,neutral,first half dragged along at a really slow pace second half was a but better but it was so sloppy that i really didnt care what happened to anyone fell asleep for some parts in the middle cant recommend this one
Dec 16 2018,positive,the movie was a little cheesy at times and i did not love the story  however i did like the idea and the creativity in this movie  they couldve done a better job with the story but if you like scifi movies you may like this
Dec 16 2018,negative,1 guy walked out after an hour a couple walked out 30 minutes after that we stayed just to see it through to the end but i think the execution of the story was horrible
Dec 16 2018,positive,this is an enjoyable epic that gives a sizable adventure that highlights the fantasy subgenre of steampunk based on a series of novels with fantastic visual designs some engaging cgiinfused action with opening scene being the best and particular impressive in imax 3d and a very nifty nomadic resurrected warrior cyborg that makes it all the more watchable but its also a missed opportunity as its narrative is so derivative to the point of being severely predicable at nearly every turn and characters so generic that renders almost any decent performances here flat in this visually dazzling spectacle
Dec 16 2018,positive,very entertaining definitely worth seeing
Dec 16 2018,positive,very good movie exciting from beginning to end  do not believe critics  some people want to see politics everywhere  it was just a good old movie if you take it for what it is   better than most out now especially when you consider how some get 5 stars for lousy writing and repetitive scripts that just change sex or color
Dec 16 2018,positive,the trailers didnâtmt tell me that this would happen i did get a chuckle about the fact that one day after i  seeing spiderman into the spiderverse i see this movie that literally uses a gooberâ in the nonsnarky sense of course  amongst the movies with mainstream pop appeal this is my favorite of 2018 i had not encountered the source books so all i knew was the thankfully brief trailers there is an expectation for a wingnut production to be jaw dropping this world is so fleshed out it is incredible unfortunately for people who havenâtmt seen mortal engines yet it is understatement to point to this movieâtms lineage as part dune part star wars part terminator part hunger games and a century of the best of swash buckling action  like many creations mortal engines is derivative but this premise of moving cities that have eaten each other to the point where nearly no prey cities remains is fresh and beefeaters with pulse weapons câtmmon donâtmt get me wrong this is no michael bay all action no âmomentsâ fluffpiece but honestly it doesnâtmt dwell in those lovey or contemplative moments either the young man and woman are into each other we get it letâtms move on is this movieâtms mantra as is typical i find it refreshing to have the leads be relative unknowns so that i am not biased by previous work our star power here is our villain played by the stalwart wingnut alumnus hugo weaving his character has a purpose and is complex but still driven too far so he must be stopped it drives the movie and he is perfect but me works on so many levels there is an allegory about corporate consumption there is a treatment of western history vs eastern there is an intentionally and appropriately diverse cast for this purpose built international audience film how does jihae have only 3 acting credits in her imdb filmography she is intensely watchable and her character is a dozen kinds of badass     let me say that our lead actors hera hilmar and robert sheehan will not be taking home any major statuettes for acting in this movie these are not those kind of roles but they did make me not mind the obvious ya romance angle  the two young actors show promise engines also feature a cg creature so well crafted and enlivened by actor stephen lang that until i got home i would have sworn that it was an andy serkis creation  this is a directorâtms action flick  christian rivers and company cram a lot into the 2 hour runtime no it wasnâtmt directed by peter jackson it is so dense in many of the filmâtms frames that we are sure a lot was cut out to the point of not making sense it really does remind me of dune 1984 that tanked in the box office and many thought was confusing and unwatchable while i thought it was rich and thankfully short of drawn out laggy âmomentsâ that could be explored in depth later if necessary in rewatches  my mind is blown i want to see it 4 more times in a row imax if possible
Dec 16 2018,neutral,i always try to look at the positives of a film first and foremost even when i was disappointed overall for peter jacksons most recent screenplay mortal engines i had high hopes for an lotrstyle postapocalyptic epic unfortunately i was disappointed   of course in a film in which jackson is involved you can expect incredible visuals which were certainly present there was also an outstanding score from tom holkenborg junkie xl additionally there was great potential in the storyline adapted from philip reeves novels  however the execution of the plot was predictable clichéd and echoed there were only two compelling characters that i connected with and the main protagonist was not even included in this pair the dialogue was remarkably uncreative and drab like star wars prequellevel  i went in with expectations for a memorable event despite the negative early buzz but i walked out understanding why it is only projected to garner 8 million domestically for its opening weekend grade c
Dec 16 2018,negative,mortal engines is a perfect example of how viewers dont care how cool it looks if you give us forgettable characters and fill it with predictable and overused tropes the tropes were atrocious and the script was pure cringe i would say this movie is like a knockoff version of star wars rouge one at its best the premise is amazing and it would have made a fantastic tv show it reminds me of valerian amazing world building i would play an rpg in this setting for sure but the script was extremely weak i wanted to like it but it was an epic fail    spoilers the main protagonist was a weak version of catnis everdeen her backstory is badass raised by an evil adoptive parent and survived in the outlands at 8 years old but apparently shes weaker than a dweeby museum curator also conveniently a pilot who ends up protecting her like a lame han solo she of course falls in love with him there was no reason for this love and it was creepy and cringy af    the main villain was played by hugo weavings and he did amazing considering the trash script but it wasnt enough for me to care about the obnoxiously predictable i am your father moment or that relationship at all    the best character in the film was a terrifying undead cyborgman who raised the protagonist and wanted to turn her into an undead robot to save her from the burden of human emotions i would compare him to thanos in the emotional appeal his death was the only one i cared about but you could have cut the cybermanterminator from the film and it wouldnt have made a dent    i expected more battles between large cities what we got instead was a lot of airship vs city ala luke and the death star shut it down from the inside with a well placed shot to the core of the city the pilots of the other ships seemed like they would be really interesting characters but they decided to kill them all off like the throw away xwing pilotsthese pilots were cannon fodder and obviously checked off the diversity box the main cast was all white and they really wanted us to like the asian neo matrix badass with a cool gun but they didnt give us any chance to care before they killed her too it was just a string of misplaced tropes    the horrible tropes aside everything the story needed for us to care about the characters was either cut or left out of this film adaptation i expect that the extended version which i imagine is like four hours would help the story a lot it was basically a montage of shots connecting too many threads in a short period of time    you also gotta know that those poor actors have no idea what this world is like as 99 of everything is cg the only new experience you will get from the film is the impressive visuals done by weta digital if you dont care about that then there is no reason to see it
Dec 16 2018,negative,disappointing i just didnt really understand the characters motivations when you find out the narrative it comes out in this weird unnatural dialogue that could have been shown instead i wish i cared more about the main characters but i just dont nothing particularly likeable about them the visuals were great but i just didnt get the risks of the story until much later but by then i just didnt care the only acting that i enjoyed was hugos and even then i didnt understand why he was so evil im sad i was expecting this to be good
Dec 16 2018,positive,donâtmt believe the reviews this was a fresh and fun story compare it to the last two star wars and mortal engine packed more heart and fun in two hours then disney will ever be able to
Dec 16 2018,negative,nice visual effect but missing narrative
Dec 16 2018,negative,terrible sjw propaganda weak story bland forgettable characters awful film
Dec 16 2018,positive,not really sure why everyone is giving itsuch a low score yes the script is a little weak but that is always the case when translating a book to a movie it is impossible to pack in all the backstory that being said the movie has inspired me to read this book
Dec 16 2018,negative,it felt like a series of token themes smashed together with amazing graphics and cgi
Dec 16 2018,negative,probably one of the worst movies i have ever had the painful experience of sitting through the movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes of giant cities rolling across open landscapes without any storyline nor dialogue it is astonishing this movie was ever greenlit by a studio as it would have been more enjoyable to slowly stick needles through my eyes followed by intense salt rubbing
Dec 16 2018,positive,from beginning to end it was captivating and amazing great story
Dec 16 2018,negative,while suspension of disbelief is important for all entertainment lacking a coherent logic system from point a to b leaves many of the obvious plot conveniences to be somehow excused by a need to suspend disbelief
Dec 16 2018,positive,a great movie the books are better but i thought it was a great representation of the book the characters are spot on and the story is just as good as the book i really hope that they make more because the other books are even better the story just gets better and better 
Dec 16 2018,neutral,trailer looked really good for this unfortunately it would appear all the best bits were shown in the trailer weird parts of the storyline and a big shame this really had the potential to be good
Dec 16 2018,positive,i saw mortal engiines with my wife and we had a very similar experience  we of course gave the feasibility of the giant mobile cities not a first thought let alone a second  we expected an action movie and we got one plus more  good guys we care about and duplicitous bad guys that were fun to hate  what we hadnâtm expected was to be literally on the edge of our seats the last 30 minutes  and yes there were some what we referred to as âhomagesâ and i wonâtmt go into them to avoid spoiling anything    ignore the critics and just go ahead and have a good time
Dec 16 2018,positive,ive never read the book so based on what i get from the movie i think this movie is very well made i liked it 
Dec 16 2018,positive,one of the best steam punk movies recently the plot is not new but the story telling is sincere the art and design makes it worth to get an official art book if they have any
Dec 16 2018,neutral,looks good but very dull and confusing felt like it was supposed be the third installment of a trilogy but with no previous movies
Dec 16 2018,neutral,visuals were awesome story was very convoluted which made it drag 
Dec 16 2018,positive,well i think this film is my favorite this year far beyond eye catching this post apocalyptic storyline is a dynamic action thriller hugo weaving from the matrix and lord of the rings brings his phenomenal acting chops to a power grabbing leader of the largest mortal engine still in existence the entire cast is an international collection of fine and memorable characters as this emotionally charged film catapults forward in time
Dec 16 2018,negative,its beautiful but empty  not a moment that isnt cliched
Dec 16 2018,positive,awesome movie  critics got it wrong again
Dec 16 2018,positive,totally a fun ride a popcornflix for the holiday even though its a little bit predictable and it unshelves some themes and a character i know now why you cry from your other favorite genre pictures it still somehow keeps your attention and has you pulling for everything to work out between this fun and diverse cast youll be hoping for multiple couples and plans to come together in the end 
Dec 16 2018,positive,really good epic film the villains had deptheven more than the protagonists in many cases it felt like several things were mentioned but left hanging this may upset some people but whatever t felt like they had much more value in the book which is often the case
Dec 16 2018,positive,great action movie i was glued to my seat loved loved loved it 
Dec 16 2018,negative,i have no idea how this film ended itâtms only been a couple of days since i left the theatre and i seriously canâtmt recall something about big explosions lots of crying generic dialogue unearned character arcs a big chase through the sky and a noticeable lack of cities on wheels i donâtmt really care enough this film is bad oh so very bad but donâtmt worry thereâtms plenty of setup for a sequel characters such as katherine leila george and bevis ronan raftery surely must return or else their extensive and irrelevant screen time has absolutely no use in a film that already feels like its three hours long i guess weâtmll have to wait and find out in the sequel thatâtms never going to get made  kernel jack reviews this one  full review is now up on salty popcorn
Dec 16 2018,positive,mortal engines is a confusing movie i mean what does the title even mean i was all but certain somebody would explain what it meant during the twohourplus movie but nope my best guess is that it refers to the people operating the roaming cities of the future the tiny instruments of flesh and blood that have become the gears to these monstrous mobile cities thats only the start and its simply the title mortal engines is the latest in dystopian ya to make the leap to the big screen but this time with the guidance of oscarwinning blockbuster maestro peter jackson if anyone could elevate a ya novel into big screen eye candy it has to be jackson and company right    in the distant future the world we know it was decimated by a war that took all of 60 seconds in the ensuing years cities have taken on a new life they have become mobile and roam the land swallowing and attacking other smaller cities and the most notorious is london tom robert sheehan is living a blissfully ignorant existence on london until he runs into the scarred feisty hester shaw hera hilmer who attempts to kill valentine hugo weaving accusing the leader of london of killing her mother tom hears too much and valentine tries to dispose of both of them while he can also assemble a weapon from the old world to gain total supremacy    i think the good slightly outweighs the bad when it comes to mortal engines but this is definitely a scifi action blockbuster where the sum fails to weigh more than its moving parts the world building on display is more imaginative and intriguing than i was expecting i was expecting a pg13 steampunk mad max and i got a larger more developed weirder and wilder world early on the opening sequence gives a sense of the dangerous reality of predatory cities and its thrilling and largescale immediately you understand why jackson and company wanted to tell this movie on a big canvas from there we get a better sense of how the world has rebuilt itself in the ashes of our civilization and how others have adapted if london is the scourge of this new world others have taken to hiding eking out fragile lives on the fringes of this society that leads to smaller moving buildings designed to hide this leads to the skies being an escape from the earthbound cities this leads to outer reaches where slave auctions occur this also somehow includes zombie cyborgs which i dont quite follow how a world of giant cities that covets old tech somehow has conquered life and death but hey with each new location the world got a little bit bigger and it was already plenty big to begin with thats something that mortal engines has in spades  a sense of scale and scope the visual grandeur of the film is expansive and richly detailed pushing the outer boundaries just a little bit further theres a fun chase scene through a city as its sliced and diced into smaller parts by grinding gears and sparking saws the budget was only 100 million but it looks like it could have easily been double that even at its worst mortal engines is a visual treat that surprises with ingenuity and terrific special effects    the good is drowned out by the messy bombastic ridiculousness that takes flight this is a big dumb movie that readily announces itself as big and dumb the dialogue is often cheesy and occasionally painful with characters spouting selfparody lines like im not going to tell you my sad story and then 30 minutes later so thats my sad story its the kind of movie where every character seems to be angling for that movie quip one character says im not known for subtlety which could have been the message of the movie as a whole another character says her name relates to her desire to have her ashes scattered by the wind upon her death guess what doesnt happen at all my friend cat mcalpine wrote in her notes for the movie why is the dialogue so bad four separate times theres one moment late where a character with a bowler hat is shown and its meant to be played like some big moment of leverage or betrayal oh no not bowler hat man but i dont recall any scene establishing who this man was or his connection to the mayor of london its just like a man in a bowler hat appears and the movie treats it ludicrously seriously and i wanted to laugh uproariously it was not the only time i felt this impulse    its never boring even when its being patently ridiculous and dumb the main characters are powerfully bland and they also give way to bland supporting friend characters who serve no purpose other than to be the eyes needed to oversee certain villainous revelations the romance between hester and tom is nonexistent and painfully contrived much like the equally bonkers jupiter ascending the main characters and their story are the least interesting parts of the world sheehan tvs misfits seems a bit too old to be playing a 16yearold hilmar davincis demons has little to work with but is very leaden and flat theres no spark of charisma between the two of them hugo weaving the hobbit is clearly enjoying himself as the hammy villain bent on bringing back old imperialism into this brave new world the entire population of london is only seen cheering in reaction shots which makes it harder to believe when characters talk about innocents amongst this throng of happy imperialist cheerleaders i was happy to see frankie adams tvs the expanse as a donothing role as revolutionary fighter pilot 3    there is a massive plot hole in the second act that mortal engines cannot recover from minor spoilers the entire motivation for hester is her vengeance against valentine enough so that shes willing to risk her life by running out on her zombie terminator surrogate father shrike stephen lang in cgi mode to see this through but if hester has a zombie terminator surrogate father why doesnt she simply say hey new dad help me kill this one evil guy and ill happily do whatever you want after in flashbacks we see her open to the idea of transforming into some form of a robotic hybrid shedding her humanity and losing the ability to feel any pain it makes no sense why she wouldnt use this new asset to her advantage especially when the second act is mostly spent proving how formidable a threat he can be this plot turn is further evidence at how sloppily the storytelling can get with character choices shrike is introduced as another antagonist to chase our heroes but by introducing him at all it makes me wonder about the better version of this movie the leon the professional version where a young girl teams up with a zombie terminator father figure for vengeance dont you dear reader want to see that movie too it already sounds far more interesting and a better use of the unique story elements    heres another example of how confusing this movie is  the poster image go back to it in this review and study it then ask yourself why the marketing team decided to put the visual emphasis on a womans face covered by a bandanna its a movie about giant cities on wheels attacking each other and it also has a zombie terminator and the emphasis is on a bandana if all you saw about the movie was the title and that key poster image you would never suspect what kind of movie you were in store for which seems like the exact opposite purpose of advertising whats the hook of this image whats underneath that bandanna spoilers a second smaller bandanna what about the tagline which talks about her scar did the marketing team actively try and hide the buzzier genre elements    mortal engines feels assembled from the many scattered pieces of other better movies i wish we spent more time in this world and less time with the bland assembly of characters not played by hugo weaving i wish we saw more about the intricacies of life on the move and the working infrastructure of these new environments i wish we had more importance with the anna fang jihae character where she didnt feel like she just ported over from a matrix sequel i wish a lot of things were different about mortal engines and yet even when its bad even when its dumb and even when its insane the movie is always worth watching and fairly entertaining for a variety of reasons i could see a select group of audiences enjoying this for ironic and nonironic purposes its a big shambling mess of a movie but it puts on a solid show    nates grade c
Dec 16 2018,negative,terrible film save your money
Dec 16 2018,positive,loved it definitely had all the lotr vibes that i love
Dec 16 2018,positive,a hugely enjoyable rampage of a film and much better than man would want you to believe immerse yourself in this amazingly well realised world and roll with it the one big downside is that the film rushes past in a blur of story threads that are mostly neglected much to its detriment
Dec 16 2018,negative,starts off entertaining but quickly noses dives into mediocrity
Dec 16 2018,positive,we went to see this today and thought it was excellent the worldbuilding is truly phenomenal and there is real heart to the story yes there are some changes made from the book but none that cause problems i very much hope that the rest of this fantastic saga will find its way onto the big screen it does not deserve the low ranking it has got so far
Dec 16 2018,positive,not sure why critics are panning this movie but its actually really well done enjoyed the story and the acting critics tend to pan anything with imagination beyond standard storylines summaries that have been hashed and rehashed time and again leading to remakes of popular works this is an original story with a familiar basis but allnew landscape visually stunning and breathtaking action sequences make this a must see use your own judgment and dont skip it based on critic reception
Dec 16 2018,neutral,this movie attempts to be everything to everyone on the left but its messages and alegories counter most of their arguments white men are evil diversity is the only norm technology bad civilization al but destroys itself with a mega weapon and hundreds of years later absent most of that old tech that cannot be figured out they are able to assemble turbine driven mobile cities the female lead is a weak spot the sexual amorph asian ladyish plays the hero the young white males are bumbling albeit well meaning bafoons  the story for what it is acceptably told and the cgi is worth watching for the first half but as the movie ages even the cgi started to fall off it is entertaining but a morph of lotr star wars and a never told dystopian future
Dec 16 2018,positive,excellent movie from start to end
Dec 16 2018,positive,mashup of mad max  star wars but dark slow  too long
Dec 16 2018,positive,i am such a fan of a team that is able to put together a standalone story in a time where there are only sequels remakes and reimaginings this movie provides a full story within itself   it does not need to be said that the film is visually stimulating but it is also unique in its characters and settings the character development is pretty on and develops the main protagonist in a way that isnt the typical timeline   my recommendation is to stop reading reviews and go see the movie with an open mind make your own opinion because i think youll really enjoy it
Dec 16 2018,positive,this movie is simply awesome critics sucks
Dec 16 2018,negative,week narrative confusing story week characters surprising week female characters i didnt expect that in 2018 movies
Dec 16 2018,positive,absolutely loved the movie took my 10 and 12 year olds with me and they were in awe of the film great story great special effects score was awesome donâtmt listen to the critics
Dec 16 2018,positive,visually engaging and emotionally satisfying at times despite the very few interspersed shoddy dialogue the film never halts into boredom nor short of excitement theres plenty to be enjoyed here especially the well crafted wordbuilding its just a matter of personal taste if you are willing to be absorbed by its immersive jaws and yes i was truly into it
Dec 16 2018,positive,it was better than i expected the previews really didnt do it justice but it was also semigeneric and some of the story wasnt fleshed out enough
Dec 16 2018,positive,great action and special effects  as one who has read all the novels some years past i had no problem following the story line  someone who isnt familiar with the story might be confused by the resurrected man and his motivation even though jackson tries to explain it through flashbacks  im disappointed that kates storyline was drastically changed  im hoping the series continues
Dec 16 2018,positive,was it an amazing movie no was there a terrible fight scene yes were there some terrible lines yes but all in all the cgi was beautiful the amount of sets that were real pleasantly surprised me they did a great job showing scale the acting was great for the most part all in all it was a good movie sure they couldve done some more im excited to see where they go next with it
Dec 16 2018,negative,mortal engines starts off promising with a mad maxlike chase sequence that captures you into the movie however as the movie continues you start to realize the increasingly convoluted plot and lose sight of what direction the movie wants to take i know the movie wants to do the book justice but 2 hours aint enough for all the concepts to be fully developed not enough to have an impact on the audience at least chemistry between the actors are quite sloppy and towards the end of the movie it introduces more and more characters seems to serve no purpose to the overarching storyline overall the movie couldve been way more than what it is now
Dec 16 2018,positive,outstanding world building not great as a standalone but is clearly the first movie of a franchise that seems poised to succeed
Dec 16 2018,positive,its mad max meets the terminator with a sprinkling of star wars in a neat pg13 package with peter jackson his crew and convincing acting chops making it all look really good
Dec 16 2018,positive,great movie i dont get the bad reviews 5 of 5 people in our group loved it best movie of the year by 2 of them 
Dec 16 2018,positive,has a lot of potential would love to see more in terms of sequels and extended versions to develop on the characters who were interesting but didnt get enough time to be developed
Dec 16 2018,neutral,well i have to say the action was good i laughed out loud a few times at the story
Dec 16 2018,positive,well worth watching on the big screen i saw it in imax 3d and enjoyed every minute of it my only complaint is that you get the very long story crammed into a shorter single film feeling
Dec 16 2018,positive,this was not bad but it was not good so much potential to be amazing this should of been made into two movies really and it would of been awesome but go check it out and its worth watching in imax
Dec 16 2018,positive,great visuals nonstop action and futuristic storyline made this an entertaining movie from beginning to end dont let others reviews keep you from seeing this one
Dec 16 2018,positive,was very fresh and something new i liked it a lot
Dec 16 2018,positive,i wanted it to be good but alas it was just ok the design and action pieces were phenomenal the inbetween stuff not so much also there was some pretty cringy dialogue here and there     for the popcorn spectacle it is worth a go in a good theater it is like nothing you have ever seen live action but it just falls way short of what i had hoped it could have been  possibly the best part of the movie was a character that was given less than 15mins of screen time shrike was probably my favorite part of the movie and they gave him the darthmaul treatment you could remove him completely and the story doesnt change very sad waste of a super interesting and cool character i feel this and many other moments suffer from trying to shove too much narration into too short a format this movie would have done well in a long series ala battlestar galactica type stuff
Dec 16 2018,positive,fun and exciting adventure do not trust the critics reviews the film was not for them go see it do not think too much just enjoy it
Dec 16 2018,neutral,opted to watch this movie having not read any of the books it has a mad maxwaterworld theme to it postapocalyptic world run by lawless system of governance the characters storyline and the special effects are interesting to start with but fall short of leaving much of an impression england attempting to invade and pillage the rest of the world once again a thousand years later in a history repeats it self moment is quite comical
Dec 16 2018,positive,not sure why it got bad reviews this film was everything ive come to expect from jackson it is visually stunning and thoroughly entertaining
Dec 16 2018,positive,great acting check great cgi check great plot check forgot about real life for a bit and had fun being immersed in another reality check
Dec 16 2018,positive,85 about what you expect from a movie like his had some creative aspects that i liked a few slow moments where i could have nodded off worth a look 
Dec 15 2018,positive,5 stars for the first half 2 stars for the 2nd half still overall worth watching 
Dec 15 2018,negative,a  2 part book suffers by huge changes in the story to be fit into 1 movie character development is stunted and made unbelievable even for those who have never read the book will notice
Dec 15 2018,positive,while there are some cliches in both story and dialogue and the third act pales in comparison to the book the visuals acting and music make up for it itâtms not the best film in the world nor the best adaptation but it is a fun and enjoyable film that i personally recommend and it does not deserve this much negativity
Dec 15 2018,positive,loved it started slow but the  secenes adn action were terrifficngood fun
Dec 15 2018,negative,possibly the worst movie i ever paid to see  it is literally pointless and random  there is no cohesive story line plot holes big enough to steer an aircraft carrier thru   maybe if you read the books and understood the story line the movie made sense but as its own body of work horrible   the first thing i did after seeing this movie was google the list of biggest box office failures  i think this is a true contender based upon the money spent and the finished product   mortal engines made green lantern look like a masterpiece
Dec 15 2018,positive,i havent enjoyed a theater movie in years but this one we are buying as soon as it hits the stores great acting great visuals and a great plot though youll have to read the books if you want a more immersive explanation to some things no swear words no gore no nudity yup the prets get to see this one with hollywood abusing the remake button it was really nice to see a fresh stand alone movie thats in a genre all its own  after reading the critics reviews and comparing them to the movie im of the rather firm belief that a good review comes at a price and that theyre just angry jackson didnt pay them to give a great movie the review it deserved
Dec 15 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie the storyline was very intriguing the images were fascinating and hugo weaving was great as usual loved it in imax 3d
Dec 15 2018,positive,great potential for a series of movies but sadly they seem to have rushed and pushed all the books together to make one movie in short cool visual effects loved how everything moves but leaves a feeling of somethings missing with the storytelling
Dec 15 2018,positive,wasnt expecting much but was pleseantly surprised i enjoyed the mechanical them which for its genre didnt feel over the top had a consistent theme to the movie the twist at the end wasnt a huge amazing reveal but the story didnt depend on it i dont know if there are books but i certainly enjoyed the movie as it was the cgi wasnt cringy either
Dec 15 2018,positive,i enjoyed it the story line combined vigilante vengance live and strong focus on friendship and how important it is to be honest in all that you do in this day and age where morals seem to not exist this movie had all of it combined with suspenseful action scenes and a good ending id not only recommend it but would probably go see it again
Dec 15 2018,positive,wow this movie delivers so imaginative and exciting  my eleven year old was enthralled and i was never bored   forget the critics go see this now on the big screen while you can this is exactly the style of movie imax was made for
Dec 15 2018,positive,a lush and rich fantasy world of imaginative postapocalyptic steam punk  the two strongest leads in the film are young females    a cinematic ride filled to the brim with propulsive episodic hijinx that keep you on the edge of your seat to whats around the corner in this new world and its struggles  mortal engines is a dashing holiday season cinema adventure  a guaranteed hit for audiences of all ages except the very young if that is what you are looking for in a trip to the movies    if they do get to make a second film set in this new fantastic world what about a big romance on a floating balloon megametropolis way more advanced than the rest of the world perhaps run by robots or something mysterious like that with the rest of the plot shoehorned into the other 30 of movie yep the mortal engines world is one of those sort of movies where the vistas are wide open
Dec 15 2018,negative,waste of money and time to see this low b grade movie
Dec 15 2018,negative,there obviously wasnt enough in the budget for someone to actually read the book its like they made a movie after hearing about the book from someone that had a dream about reading it cast choices were great but thats where it stopped valentine was flat in this movie tom was flat and used for one liners katherine and bevis were literally useless the ending made no sense no possibility of a sequel that would make sense in this universe with how they ended the movie
Dec 15 2018,positive,loved the aesthetic of this movie  i dont really care what the critics say about it peter jackson and hugo weaving should be enough said  eventually there will be a cult following for this one
Dec 15 2018,positive,peter jackson has absolutely outdone himself  mortal engines is beyond description beautiful exciting fantastic a completely steampunky thrill ride from beginning to end i absolutely loved it
Dec 15 2018,positive,loved this movie it was fun from beginning to end if you want to see a movie that is just enjoyable then it is definitely recommended
Dec 15 2018,positive,this movie was a good b movie the best thing about this movie was the world building it was very detailed i enjoyed the story line perhaps with stronger leads it would have been a bigger hit with audiences the robot had more emotions depth than the two main leads unfortunately
Dec 15 2018,positive,sooo great i had a blast
Dec 15 2018,positive,it way better than the critics say who cares what a bunch of liberal trump hating movie critics think anyway the movie is pretty cool and the effects are awesome
Dec 15 2018,negative,i didnt think it was good but i have to admit it was fun to watch 
Dec 15 2018,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen a terrible plot less than compelling acting totally predictable ending and of course throw in some hollywood western society hate to pacify the india and china audience they are courting recently not worth your time or money
Dec 15 2018,positive,best movie of the year in my opinion literally cant understand why people rated it so low my husband and i absolutely loved it i hope they make another one
Dec 15 2018,negative,mortal engines in my view at least never looked like anything interesting from the very first teaser i disliked the overblown overusedcgi masking as a grandiose vision of a seemingly unique world that becomes more and more generic as it goes on there are some genuine moments of inspiration sprinkled here and there but not where it counts and not enough to make any impact beyond boredom from the filmmakers behind the lord of the rings comes this bloated messy mediocre uninteresting movie that feels made for noone in particular called mortal engines
Dec 15 2018,positive,good movie for scifi fans
Dec 15 2018,positive,i absolutly loved the story line the special effects were astounding and very  realistic i would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone
Dec 15 2018,positive,this is  great steampunk scifi take a chance on a  movie that is not dc star wars star trek or marvel you will not be disappointed five stars
Dec 15 2018,neutral,this might be a little bit of a guilty pleasure for me having read the book this is the first bookbased movie ive seen in a while that i can truly say goes to the fans also the visual effects are amazing and maybe even the sole purpose to see the movie but no surprise the way the story is organized kind of ruins the whole movie i have to say i kind of saw that one coming after the lovely bones
Dec 15 2018,positive,favorite movie in the year 2018
Dec 15 2018,positive,this movie is wonderfully written and highly entertaining
Dec 15 2018,positive,fantastic for a  futuristic movie easy to follow story line good characters and special effects throughout  want to see more like it
Dec 15 2018,positive,pick up the dvd this was a great movie  a real fun time with new actors and a original idea
Dec 15 2018,positive,one of the best scifi movies of the decade definitely would recommend to anyone
Dec 15 2018,negative,i must say that mortal engines is visually stunning but thats where it ends for me the cgi is off the charts spectacular from a technical point of view and the acting left a lot to be desired i was onboard when i saw that peter jackson was involved because i love the lord of the rings trilogy  and the hobbit films were entertaining but mortal engines has that been there done that feel it takes an excruciatingly long time to get to the central characters kinda sorta backstories why hester shaw hera hilmar is so focused on destroying this city why london is so destructive and basically to figure out who all of these characters are and why theyre important if youve never read philip reeves novel of the same name that this steampunk film is based upon then you will be lost by the time you arrive at understanding the storyline if ever youre fatigued and then you realize theres another almost hour and a half left in the film which irritates you even further    mortal engines had so much potential to be a fantastic blockbuster which could have spawned another mustsee trilogy however somewhere between the idea and the execution everyone from the writers on through to the director got lost in their own reverence forgot about what story they were trying to tell and relied way too heavily on cliches and cgi thus by the time the audience got to the supposed payoff most of us just didnt care you would be wellserved to wait until mortal engines gets to netflix amazon hulu or cable that way you can move past some of the most boring and trite dialogue and anticlimactic ending in mes sideeye giving dystopian world
Dec 15 2018,negative,the movie is a polished turd of a story inside a breathtaking visual box sitting on an absolute mountain of tropes so many tropes hester shaw used my one good nerve for a trampoline how are you going to be the daughter of a badass woman and raised by a cyborg and still stand around in more than one instance in the movie like  really bad mary sue fanfic as viscerally as i loathed a lot of the story the weta digital effects were arrestingly gorgeous and anna fang played by jihae saved it for me she and the other airship fighter pilots were really done dirty by this movie if it had been done from their point of view searching for hester and staving off an attack by london that would have be a much more interesting movie if you love seeing weta digital do their thing on the big screen matinee it if you like a bad ass heroine hold on anna fang is coming otherwise holler at this flick on netflix or the cheapest matinee you can find
Dec 15 2018,positive,it was good if you like steampunknot sure why people would not like basic sci fi fun good story good acting great effects and moved along i looked i never read the books
Dec 15 2018,positive,very enjoyable movie  i didnt read the books i dont go to the movies to see a book played out page for page  critics are wrong on this one par for the course  guess there wasnt enough social pc junk throw in    grab some popcorn and sit back and enjoy a good story with great visuals and characters
Dec 15 2018,negative,i am a fan of peter jackson but this movie tries to do too much and achieves too little in the process the characters become one dimensional one feels little to no connection to any of them this is not helped by an uninspiring indeed cringeworthy performance by robert sheehan as tom the only thing worse than this film would be if jackson decided to adapt the remaining three books in the series a big thumbs down and annoyed mainly because the concept has so much promise and themes of colonisation and dispossession and cultural intolerance and slavery and exploitation the utter devastation of nagasaki and hiroshima after the bombs were dropped and and could all be woven into a grand saga stretching over three or four films but this clumsy bubblegum and candy floss flick has blown it right out of the starting gates not impressed
Dec 15 2018,negative,a well made boring film with a dull story 
Dec 15 2018,positive,dont listen to the review its still a decent movie despite its flaws on characters the world is just too attractive
Dec 15 2018,neutral,well at least the kamikaze gliderballoons are bitchin missing most of the charm of the books
Dec 15 2018,neutral,i cant believe im saying this that movie was way too short they needed to expand the world not condense it should have been just the first installment
Dec 15 2018,positive,ignore the critics this movie is good better than i expected mad max combine with star war a lot more exciting than solo
Dec 15 2018,positive,i dont understand the ratings seriously for the creativity and sgi besides its a groundbreaking film maybe not the acting but its so interesting as a world of steampunk future of detailed effects on a story of a world different point of view i couldnt give this movie less than 5stars considering the story the cgi and keeping the budget under 100 million i was extremely impressed with the movie from the very beginning totally different then the trailers said about the film the movie is so different they how the trailers were made its so baffling that the critic reviews are awful towards this film who else could script this movie any better i would recommend this movie in the tale of the story along with the excellent sgi with the design of the whole film put together besides the acting people dont see following s like this for the acting they go for the action and creativity of the cgi etc so your critics out there i point 5stars for this film to say shame on you guys what are you thinking to give it 1 or 2stars doesnt make a darn of cents people anybody wondering if the movie stinks dont read the negative reviews to get you to see something else because those dam reviews had me wondering it maybe a waste of time but so wrong they war compared to the other cgi films i saw this year that stunk they got higher reviews and were just as bad but not mortal engines i applaud the director and writers for making this film it was darn good oxford productions san luis obispo california
Dec 15 2018,positive,absolutely amazing concepts ive never seen before and executed so well definitely recommend this movie
Dec 15 2018,positive,an orignal concept in a time where spin offs reboots and super hero films are churned out with no substance dont be put off by negative reviews and just give it a chance personally i loved it and i think should it do well enough for a sequel it would just get better and better go see it
Dec 15 2018,positive,loved this movie and really want to see more of this universe
Dec 15 2018,positive,i went to see mortal engines because the trailer looked really good and it got me exited i was not disappointed i highly enjoyed this movie and i cannot wait until i get my hands on the books the story was one of the more original stories i have experienced and the world was just so interesting the visuals were stunning but it was the story that stole my heart i loved the action and the themes that this story explored and the way it explored them the story is a perfect mix between the dystopian and the steampunk genre it reminds me a lot of old school ya books which are my favorite type of ya books and book to movie adaptations the characters were also really great and i hope this movie does well enough to get a sequel
Dec 15 2018,negative,i hate the cgi saturation
Dec 15 2018,positive,excellent if youve read the book which you all should
Dec 15 2018,positive,i thought that this was way better than the 27 the critics dubbed it at the time of writing this if they can find something like the latest star wars good but rate this bad i question their judgment i enjoyed the characters story and scenery they dont explain why they decided to build moving cities much but they dont explain preexisting situations a lot in movies if you can look over the why here i think you can really enjoy this movie there was no sex no swearing that i remember and didnt seem to push any agenda perhaps this is the reason why the critics didnt like it i would highly recommend this film if you like scifi steampunk or just fun adventure
Dec 15 2018,positive,steampunk combination of star wars and lord of the rings  interesting characters and fantastic visual effects  could use more character development but entirely engrossing
Dec 15 2018,positive,great visuals and action unusual concept since its a back to the future technology wise which does require a good ability to suspend disbelief but other franchises have done great with worse so i would definitely see the sequel
Dec 15 2018,positive,not lotr but was never going to be an engaging scifisteampunk worldsetting with likable characters great action and a fun time at the movies definitely needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible much better than tlj lol
Dec 15 2018,positive,forget these reviews are you kidding me the movie was brilliant your seriously gonna rate this low dude i hope they make the whole book series why not let them make movies and new worlds your gonna leave a shitty review cause you so great at judging a 100 million doller movie this movie and every other should have 100 every time help and let these guys make movie
Dec 15 2018,positive,a lot better than the feedback this moive is getting it has some issues but not enough for me to dislike the film if you have not id recommend reading the novels as they give you more details about this wonderful world
Dec 15 2018,positive,very good adaptation of the book but im not sure if i would have enjoyed it as much if i hadnt read it beforehand
Dec 15 2018,positive,surprisingly amusing while this movie suffers from a few script flubs here and there its action packed and seems to never let go making it a strongly enjoyable holiday movie also the score is something quite amazing and the theme will be stuck in your head forever
Dec 15 2018,positive,good story great scenery predictable i enjoyed they movie no expectations to what it was supposed to be
Dec 15 2018,negative,worst editing of the year no doubt about it the action is incomprehensible and unless its a sweeping cg shot the movie cant stand to sit on a shot for more than 3 seconds it felt so slow and meandering yet fast and choppy having some decent visuals dont redeem this thing theres a whole lot wrong with it the romance is less established than anything twilight crapped out theres an entire subplot thats uninteresting and should have been written out there actually came a moment in the movie where i realized i didnt know anyones name well i knew tom but its just because i made a joke about him when he was first introduced just awful
Dec 15 2018,positive,much better than experts using that term loosely suggest
Dec 15 2018,positive,not as good as the book but they did a good job making mortal engines come alive on the big screen
Dec 15 2018,positive,this movie is brilliant and beautifully done i hate when you actually see a separation between actors and their green screen background there was none of that here its like youve entered their world and are walking around in it ive seen nonstop comparisons from those who havent seen the movie to howls moving castle its not remotely the same thing stop judging movies based on what others may think possibly happensgo see a movie for yourself if you find it interesting we get very few steampunk style films and this one was great
Dec 15 2018,positive,great movie i didnt even mind that it was 2 hours long the movie is action packed and intriguing from start to finish 
Dec 15 2018,positive,mortal engines 5 out of 5 stars mortal engines is an awesome post apocalyptic adventure film that is action packed visually stunning and an epic probably one of the better young adult novel adaptations into a movie from the producers and writers with peter jackson and his writing partners taking the adaptation into his own hands there is a lot going on with the plot an apocalyptic story about mobile cities demolishing the weak and a powerful weapon being in the wrong hands and an intense chase sequences the plot takes place in a post apocalyptic future when after the world has ended in according to the brief introduction called the sixty minute war everywhere around the globe is demolished landscapes become unpredictable with an unstable earths crust so cities are built to be mobile even then the wasteland is a fight for survival when bigger cities like londoner which has thaddeus hugo weaving looking for more power and are taking down smaller mobile cities for their resources hester shaw hera hilmar and her mining city was demolished and old parts were taken for artifacts or crushed hester has unfinished business with thaddeus and fails to assassinate him she escapes and an historian tom robert sheehan tries to stop her realizes thaddeus may not be the person he says he is with an hidden agenda of building an ultimate weapon to take over other colonies hester and tom will have to fight through the wasteland and escape from other scavengers a cyborg bounty hunter shrike stephen lang and thaddeus mobile city i am not sure how close the novel is to the movie but the plot was great sure there are moments when it felt like mad max fury road or star wars maybe elements were borrowed from other apocalyptic films or sci fi movies the story was epic i was kind of wanting to know more about the sixty minute war it was briefly discussed also learn a little about hesters childhood past about her mother and thaddeus a sub plot of shrike and his motivation to go after hester the film has a lot of big loud and action packed moments the opening sequence has an intense chase with londoner going after a small mining city and it does not stop from there the visual effects are amazing set designs costumes and the concept scenery is just stunning the showdown in the climax when londoner reaches the big wall to a protected colony was spectacular junkie xl music score was awesome some music score felt a little similar to their previous films like mad max fury road but it worked with the films tone and direction hera wilmar is a beautiful stunning actress hugo weaving was good as the villain robert sheehan was also good playing an historian more as a city boy than a survivalists outside of the city walls overall mortal engines is a great film the cast ensemble was great the script delivered an epic plot of an apocalyptic story for first time director christian rivers he delivered on an epic visual fest action sequences that never slows down and it kept you on the edge of your seat until the end
Dec 15 2018,positive,great movie full of action 
Dec 15 2018,positive,a lot of action interesting storyline really enjoyed this movie
Dec 15 2018,positive,yes amazing movie great story great acting great special effects girl power best movie of the holiday season 
Dec 15 2018,positive,cinema worthy good graphics  futuristic with a story line  
Dec 15 2018,positive,wife 65 me 75 a fun ride without a whole lot of character development a mashup scene stealer of star wars terminator water world avatar and did i say star wars 
Dec 15 2018,negative,the plot is a mess of character motivations that flick back and forth from scene to scene in service of the next action movie cliche with only the occasional citywide explosion to attempt to just barely keep my attention if you have to go and see this make sure you do it with someone who read the books their tortured expression is ample entertainment through this drivel although by that logic you could just stream eragon for free
Dec 15 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it was something original it felt like a young scifi movie with similarities of star wars type format i wish more time was spent on character development 
Dec 15 2018,positive,we read the book and then watched the movie it all made total sense and was a pretty good adaptation after all the book was 18 hours of reading and they condensed that into 2 hours some things had to be different none the less we loved it 
Dec 15 2018,positive,great movie gotta see on the big screen a must if you want to have a good time 
Dec 14 2018,positive,the characters are complex the universe is rich and deep the special effects are flawless and the visuals are dare i say beautiful i can remember a time when the star wars universe was this magnificent but that was a long long time ago  
Dec 14 2018,positive,awesome film ignore the critics
Dec 14 2018,positive,pace was great film was engaging characters relatable and story was very original had a great time watching this and really hope it gets a sequel
Dec 14 2018,positive,ummm it was cgi pretty solid effort im still not exactly sure why people have to live on machines it seems super impractical the frankenstein terminator was cool its a 5 tuesday movie     on a side note can we have one movie where the villain isnt a racest white dude
Dec 14 2018,negative,about as rotten as you can get every scene and idea in this movie came from another movie the idea of building a city from old pieces of history seemed interesting did not know the movie itself was based on the same premise should be in the cheapo theatres pretty quick or just right to rental phase save a few bucks and see it then if you really feel like you need to watch this
Dec 14 2018,positive,only 4 cause the bad guy doesnt die amazing
Dec 14 2018,positive,this movie is much much better then the movie critics give it credit for the story is well constructed and has everything you could want out of a movie when you go in with no expectations
Dec 14 2018,positive,had a great concept and visuals were good and amazing the actors casting was very bad the acting bad a lot boring sluggish moments 
Dec 14 2018,neutral,mostly entertaining maybe 30 minutes too long a couple of times the movie was painfully drawn out undoing the suspension of disbelief and leaving me annoyed a little bit of all the movies in this one the matrix star wars crouching tiger lord of the rings serenity mad max avatar
Dec 14 2018,positive,if you like cinematography this movie is for you the sound design is on point and that plus the cg blends to make an epicly scaled movie the big things feel big the scope is collosas you can almost feel the ground shake when the mackines roll by sure there were a few corny lines and the end went a tad cliche but for sheer awe factor this movie is great
Dec 14 2018,positive,are there the teething issues of a first time filmmaker yes is 80 of the dialogue stiff or cliche yes but ill be damned if i dont give 35 stars because despite those issues mortal engines is one hell of an adventure the visuals alone are worth the price of admission and the action sequences are ripped right from an avid readers imagination shrike was also sheer perfection i would have gladly watch a feature film of him stalking the outlands and raising young hester movie goers shouldnt take for granted the world building detail and spectacle delivered you can see the passion in this passion project
Dec 14 2018,positive,just finished watching awesome movie dont listen to the pro critics they only like slow artsy crap
Dec 14 2018,positive,watched it twice already
Dec 14 2018,negative,ripoff ad campaign led us to believe this was a peter jackson film instead it was directed by one of his underlings i think ill skip it
Dec 14 2018,positive,super entertaining loved the word and the characters
Dec 14 2018,positive,this movie was epic see it in dolby cinema edge of your seat amazing action and effects
Dec 14 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was not a perfect adaptation of the book but still a great movie
Dec 14 2018,positive,has the young adult fantasy genre jumped the shark yet cause i cant tell at this point    mortal engines    at a little over 2 hours it was surprisingly engaging despite my complete ignorance of the source material this was a solidly if slightly paintbynumbers epic fantasy it did feel a bit too long but it never felt slow    the cast was definitely running on all cylinders hugo weaving plays a good hero but he never fails to give us an entertaining  grounded villain our heroes played by add names were pretty standard but were never the less an enjoyable sight i didnt just watch them i wanted to watch them the rest of the cast really sold the realness of the world the class divides both outside london  within the tenuous structure of everything  the humanity on display it was very organic    the effects were awesome i know the cities in this movie cant really exist but their movements  inner workings gave you just enough reality to believe the fantasy the same goes for vehicles other stuff we see props to the props  set designers i couldnt tell what was practical  what was cgi it was pretty seamless a lot of care went into all the subtle details that helped worldbuild this place a good bit of show dont tell plus the references to greek myth werent lost on me    the music was equal parts epic fantasy  british pride which makes me think this story started out as an idea for dr who cause it woulda fit great in that franchise    i went into mortal engines with kinda low expectations  they have been happily shattered some folks might not like how cutpaste this film might seem at first but ill take a cutpast thats entertaining over something new but boring any day  mortal engines could never be called boring 4 stars outta 5 roll on
Dec 14 2018,positive,great special effects on urban housing not much of a story
Dec 14 2018,positive,not bad another 20 min would have helped the minor characters get some development and get deeper into the back story cool idea great visuals just felt rushed but pretty entertaining 
Dec 14 2018,positive,great movie with stunning visual effects takes you to future inspired by past another peter jackson hit
Dec 14 2018,positive,i thought it was an entertaining movie with reallygreat special effects
Dec 14 2018,positive,besides prematurely killing off strike it was an amazing movie a bit reminiscent of star wars but i still thought it was wonderfully done and staid true to the book actress that played hester was amazing 
Dec 14 2018,positive,good movie with great story line heartfelt journey for main character 
Dec 14 2018,positive,never thought id see these wonderful books by philip reeve turned in to a big budget movie yet thanks to peter jackson and co here is the first instalment and its just as wonderful as the books albeit with a few changes that help drive the screenplay absolutely loved it
Dec 14 2018,positive,very entertaining and different the lead female could have been stronger but overall better than i thought it would be
Dec 14 2018,positive,great film some of the storyline was cut from book but it fits well maybe lacking some context of you didnt read the book first but that is your own fault read the book first golden rule of films    the special effects were amazing and compelling go watch it it is great
Dec 14 2018,negative,the screen writers fked this up when i heard that peter jackson was taking on the challenge of mortal engines i was exstatic what everyone seems to be missing out mentioning here is that this story was written by phillip reeve and it comes in four books four so make four movies     after waiting 15 years after reading this series there is literally so much story no wonder this movie bombs when youve tried to put it in one the title mortal engines is just book one so why put all the other three in as well i think it takes less than 20 minutes on screen before youve moved past the time frame of the first book    you dont understand how angry this makes me the jobs of these people are to make movies for the people you wanted people to like your movie its not your movie its phillip reeves but if i were him id die from watching this     if you are going to buy movies by adapting books and bringing them to the big screen just copy the books are you forgetting about all the sales of those books and not understanding which people are going to be first in line to watch this the people who read it as kids and teenagers who are now adults if you dont impress them which you havent then you gets scores like 20 on review websites     also i realize that i hardly mention anything about the movie because its so sht i never want to remember it im spending my weekend re reading the books and putting the right facts with great detail and understandable plots
Dec 14 2018,positive,very interesting world and characters
Dec 14 2018,positive,it was so refreshing to see not just one but three female leads in an action movie the visuals are absolutely incredible and they do a great job of carrying the viewer away into the postwar universe the emotional connection between the characters makes mortal engines more than just a visually dazzling actionpacked ya film because of the time restraint 2hrs though the movie doesnt go into all the complexities from the book looking forward to seeing the characters be developed further in the sequels hopefully this gets made into a series it definitely has the potential highly recommend to anyone looking for a good story with great female representation
Dec 14 2018,negative,i loved the books very indepth characters great storyline etc and i was really looking forward to this movie it ended up being a movie that i wanted to walk out on the story is so twisted and changed that it doesnt flow at all and even destroys and subsequent plots btw i never left a movie review ever
Dec 14 2018,neutral,mortal engines  a soulless vehicle  if youve seen the trailer then youve seen the best parts of this overlong derivative bore of a film despite an intriguing premise and legitimately breathtaking visuals at points the movie hasnt got a single interesting idea to offer up and its plot and cardboard cutout characters feel like every other young adult film adaptation rolled into one paired with a narrative structure that follows the force awakens almost beat for beat in places and youll be rolling your eyes by the end of the first hour dont waste your time or your money on this one 510 mediocre    the city chase scene is really cool though
Dec 14 2018,negative,a predictable cheesy movie that would be better served giving its scenes time to breathe we dont care about the characters because there is a lot of tell but not show the effects are great but that wont save a movie maybe if this were split into 3 parts with better acting
Dec 14 2018,positive,decent film in my opinion people didnt give it a chance if you had read the books you would be very excited to see this story brought to life on screen great special effects and good actors
Dec 14 2018,negative,the idea of the movie is cool the acting is terrible for most of the movie i didnt care about the characters on screen some of the story didnt make since with a different cast this could have been a really good movie 
Dec 14 2018,positive,it does get out of hand but the visuals are worth the price of admission  it is a spectacular never before seen effort and that ranks high in my book  ambition and a gigantic movie is just sometimes too much for the director to wield aroundbut still fun and eye popping
Dec 14 2018,positive,i actually really enjoyed this film its got to be one of the few films in recent years that didnt actively annoy me at one point either with burdonsome plot annoying characters or unbearable modern slang but i did have to take a few points off anyway to be fair because even though i really liked it and plan on buying a copy for my shelf i do still need to acknowledge that there are a few characters and subplots that could have been cut rather than glossed over i mean thank heaven they were glossed over at all it would have been awful if theyd actually tried to devote time to those subplots the movies actively annoying me thing i mentioned earlier so i think 4 stars is about right for this filmenjoyment wise i would say i got 5 stars out of it but plotwise its about a 3 and a half or 4    the focus of the film is where it should be on the two main characters and on the visuals of the giant city monster machine we all know the film was made basically for the mad maxstyle chase of a giant city crushing up smaller onesthats kind of what were paying the ticket for but fortunately the film does also care about its main two characters and what theyre going through it devotes an appropriate amount of time towards them and the various scenarios they end up in and i did end up actually believing in their chemistry and what risks they ended up taking to save one another that was surprisingly sweet in a film about a giant city eating things and its little surprises like that that made me enjoy this film the color choices the look of the tech and worldbuilding the mercifully few pop culture jokes ended up being actually funny rather than annoying etc    i think my main complaint for the film would be the human action scenes the city ones were greatpretty much anything on a large scale was fantastic but when you got to human on human combat the camera was a bit too shaky cam to follow what was going on it wasnt detracting from my overall enjoyment because again the focus of the film is on those large scale shots and the two main characters but i do wish that those fight scenes had been good as well because it would have elevated the overall film
Dec 14 2018,neutral,had great potential if it was directed by someone else the ending saved me from giving this 2 stars
Dec 14 2018,positive,3 and a half stars    entertaining film the beginning of the film is one of the best set ups to a film i can remember in recent times very engaging film good visuals and acting and hugo weaving as a bad guy is intetesting good concept and action scenes throughout
Dec 14 2018,positive,its funny how the writer didnt see irony of how this  movie went full predator city on the story from the book   great visuals  robert  sheenan was good   hera hilmarsdã³ttir was bland  writing may have killed a franchise with a lot of potential
Dec 14 2018,negative,mortal engines is based on philip reeves 2001 novel and comes to audiences via producer peter jackson as directed by his protã cgã c christian rivers who served as a visual effects supervisor and storyboard artist on both of jacksons tolkien trilogies as well as king kong and other projects this is all to say that despite all of this mortal engines is somehow an ugly filmone that matches the grandeur of its story with its visuals only in fleeting moments but is otherwise a bevy of good ideas executed without style and in a muddled fashion where the special effects render a picture as clear as a found footage film this thing is fuzzy as f    i especially like the idea that after modern societyor the ancient world as it is referred towas decimated in less than a minute by some kind of super weapon that society essentially revived itself and started over and a thousand years later we are back in this very victorianlike setting except for the fact london is on wheels and barreling through the wastelands that remain of earths land masses looking for energy sources to sustain itself its bonkers for sure but not a particularly fun kind of bonkers    robert sheehan looks like the lovechild of justin long and jimmy fallon
Dec 14 2018,positive,i wanted to see a fantastical cgi spectacular and mortal engines delivered a fantastical cgi spectacular for what it is and weve seen and heard it all before its not that bad at one point i thought hugo weavings character was going to say i am your father but since thats been immortalized in another movie it was implied differently the imagery in this film reminded me of the artwork of patrick woodroffe sexist alert the hot blonde is vincent hi joker donofrios daughter the actress who plays anna fang is a korean named jihae kim who sadly is not very hot indeed at first i thought she was a man maybe the role called for this i dont know i would have cast a smoking hot asianoriental model for this part
Dec 14 2018,positive,is this going to win any academy awards probably not however the cinematography is beautiful the acting is decent who doesnt love hugo weaving as a bad guy and as a worldbuilding film the details weaponry costumes vehicles are really neat this is not the next lord of the rings but it is an interesting film with great action sequences and characterization
Dec 14 2018,negative,itd be unfair to fault the film for the scores of young adult tropes already put to the screen before 2018 but im going to do it anyway none of the films characters really rise above their prescribed ya archetypes especially since there are so many of them with all the time and space its creator needs through the medium mortal engines probably shines as a novel unfortunately jackson rivers and crew couldnt translate reeves crazy concepts to film with a boring unengaging narrative and direction only made worse by a repetitive and intrusive musical score
Dec 14 2018,negative,feature film adaptation of phillip reeves 2001 novel of the same name part of a ya series of books this is the directorial debut of christian rivers however rivers has worked closely with lotrs peter jackson who also happens to be attached to this project      me is set in a dystopian postapocalyptic distant future in which entire cities are now tracked and are mobile predator cities feed on the smaller poorer cities and consume their resources something called municipal darwinism the earth is cut and scarred with massive track lines it is this set up this concept and the 100m budget that gives us some amazing set pieces the likes of which youve never seen before in a film the opening chase sequence bears elements of the black pearl bearing down on a wounded galleon ship since were drawing comparisons this steampunk faire evokes mad maxs barter town shrike is a t1000 style monster played by hugo weaving also from lotr the antitraction league looks like an xwing squad and we get elements of peter jacksons own battle of helms deep  mix all that in with something like howls moving castle and you have an idea of what this film is about  that is great company to keep however this movie after the opening chase scene is never quite able to reach the heights quality and excitement of those movies it wants to be among despite decent even pacing it is drawn out  i actually looked at my watch a couple of time that said i do like the performances of and chemistry between icelandic breakout actress hera hilmar as hester and robert sheehans tom but even these and most characters for that matter are grossly misused      the film tries to be too many things at once and falls short on all the best things about this movie for me are the worldbuilding the set pieces and the concept itself this movie i think will ultimately befall the same fate as another beautifully rendered movie the golden compass  for my video review visit   rating 4  10 stars
Dec 14 2018,positive,was it exactly like the book absolutely not but it was still an amazing movie and deserves a fair chance the actors were amazing the cgi was flawless shrike alone was breathtaking a really solid movie and worth the view
Dec 14 2018,negative,easily the worst film of 2018 tonally jarring full of lackluster attempts at characterization and humor when they try to squeeze it in and with poor cgi work avoid at all costs
Dec 14 2018,positive,dont understand the poor reviews  this was a beautiful and well imagined post apocalyptic romp of pure entertainment with some very good young actors
Dec 14 2018,positive,awesome action decent story not so great script 
Dec 14 2018,negative,the visual effects in this are terrific the story however is a bit of a standard issue postdystopian sci fi thriller in the veign of maze runner or divergent only without the moody teenagers still the film has enough action and stuff going on that you dont worry too much about the ridiculous stuff going on  worth watching for the effects and the action including the ending battle sequence which is fairly impressive
Dec 14 2018,positive,again yet another masterpiece by the man who brought tolkienï 12 12 12tms brilliant imagination to life jacksonï 12 12 12tms ï 12 12 12mortal enginesï 12 12 12tm is a truly must see film for all the family young and old
Dec 14 2018,negative,i dont watch film for wahmen i love strong female characters but i dont see wahmen films as i support equality not white brunette superior everyone else inferior im going to enjoy watching this film burn 
Dec 14 2018,negative,i hate hate hate this sort of cgi overload   everything that jackson did right in lotr hes now doing the opposite
Dec 14 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this film the special effects and cgi are really good really enjoyed the costume designing gave me great ideas for my next steampunk festival 
Dec 14 2018,positive,great storyline incredible effects great acting 5 stars
Dec 14 2018,negative,the film has some awesome visuals and scenes but thats where it stops  the dialogue is painful key book plot points are left out i can understand its a film   but they changed a lot it barely follows the book if you see the film without knowledge   of the book then it seems very fast paced no character development and full of stereotypical film cliches making it difficult to watch
Dec 14 2018,neutral,visuals were great the script wasnt 
Dec 14 2018,negative,visually stunning barely followed the book dialouge was shit no exposition and generally left the viewer lost
Dec 14 2018,negative,some cool scenes but all in all pretty boring  never feel vested in any of the characters except for maybe one
Dec 14 2018,negative,visuals are creative and amazing for 10 minutes of the film  this rest is pretty awful  didnt read the books but wanted to see the movie  wish i hadnt  its pretty lame
Dec 13 2018,neutral,while carrying amazing visual effects mortal engines suffers from terrible written characters and storystructure which makes the clichés all more obvious to the viewers and attracts the heart from its plot
Dec 13 2018,positive,i enjoyed it i thought it was a solidly entertaining movie with lots of action at a good pace and great visuals i thought of it as a steam punkish star wars  yes the story was kind of basic and not all that original but that didnt stop me from enjoying it
Dec 13 2018,negative,while it was a visual pleasing film its narrative was unoriginal if youve seen the original star wars trilogy you have basically seen this film
Dec 13 2018,positive,read the book after the movie or you will be rather confused although the movie has its own gaps too stunning visuals and relatively faithful to the world of mortal engines the movie is a slightly different story shrike was perfectly imagined for the screen and for readers of the original quartet to the last lines of a darkling plain the opening narration was a fantastic easter egg
Dec 13 2018,negative,aside from the enormity of the special effects there was absolutely nothing in this movie for me  i had trouble making sense of some of the decisions and motivations of characters from one scene to the next with no exposition at times it would have been useful yet including scenes that seemed irrelevant in the end  the narrative and dialogue were also excruciatingly unoriginal and created little if any interest in the outcome for me      amc a list 47
Dec 13 2018,negative,its not fair having mortal in the title when nothing in this movie has a pulse being 5 years late to the postapocalyptic party was not enough for this to find any structure at least the visuals dazzle
Dec 13 2018,positive,really liked it its hard to enjoy movies now with people rating everything terribly as long as they have a snarky remark the feel they have done the job they have been paid for   the story is pretty cool and different from the every day that we see the acting is pretty solid and the storyline is good the character development was a little shallow but thats how many action films are the cgi was great this is visually entertaining and thats why we go to movies in the theaters it world building was interesting and different from anything in years the steampunk styles and mix of technology was cool they could have made it slightly better as everything can always be inproved this is an excellent movie and i hope they continue the series
Dec 13 2018,positive,it is refreshing to see something new  totally new and different it is epic  almost too big at times and overbearing  but is is a journey to another world like i have never seen in live action  worth seeing on the big screen  i crave more movies in this universe
Dec 13 2018,positive,the visuals in this movie deserves far over the maximum is the story is not that interesting then avoid the latest star wars and avengers saga since are far more boring  what you see here are two hours of pure fun some unbelievable spectacular scenes and an unconcealed critic to the british that can easily apply to other countries and people
Dec 13 2018,negative, terrible i wouldnt see this movie again if you paid me 1000
Dec 13 2018,positive,that was a very creative fun adventurous original movie  the critics are nuts  27  please what a bunch of liars  sure it did not have a lot of known actors but they all did a phenomenal job  my husband my friend and myself all enjoyed it very much  very cool steampunk adventure  loved hugo weaving he did a very good bad guy  awesome fun  no bad words and other than some fighting and guns and odd things i could have brought the older kids
Dec 13 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics who have never read the books nor never enjoyed a movie because of the sheer delight of seeing a movie full of wonder and pain and love and adventure and grit this movie is worth dragging your butt to the theatre its worth being talked about for years after its worth it all around and i wish that hollywood would make more movies like this and ignore the critics who honestly know nothing about their audience base
Dec 13 2018,positive,an exciting romp with extraordinary visuals and i like the ending call me a simpleton
Dec 13 2018,negative,aweful think borderlands video game but more cheesy and dumb story donâtmt waste your money
Dec 13 2018,positive,i have not read the book so i dont know how it compares but the concept is very fascinating i loved the unique cities though a little disappointed they were destroyed i look forward to the sequel if they follow the books
Dec 13 2018,positive,not sure why the low ratings i loved the machinery and special effects 
Dec 13 2018,positive,theres nothing really wrong with the movie its just not very memorable visually its stunning to look at
Dec 13 2018,negative,ambitious massive cgi projects like this want to wow you with the visual spectacle as if to distract you from the paper thin plot it wants to be perceived as a dystopian future without fulling engrossing the audience and when it does just be ready for a barrage of shots of people pushing and pulling levers and knobs with lots of shouting it is not for fans of the original source material or newcomers i didnt read the books so i felt alienated when characters appeared or died and the camera lingered on them like you should care about this guy i was more like who the fck is this now also when a character reacted to something another character said or did like remember thats from page whatever of the novel or something that we mentioned earlier in the movie i was more like wait what he did what now i never read the harry potter books but the story was coherent on its own to make it easier to follow this feels like three movies in one it feels like waterworld  something is happening and youre supposed to care all the action set pieces are cut to shit and shot in barely lit settings the movie does succeed in making it quite apparent  that this is one of the grimiest settings put to film its amazing no one is shown with festering wounds cysts and gangrenous gashes it drags its feet trying to make any sort of social commentary if colours were supposed to denote some sense of hierarchy social class well good fcking luck with all cgi movies there seems to be a prerequisite for all of them to have muted colours shot through a murky water filter reds arent reds blues arent blues its an allegory for something its symbolic of something     go fck yourself this will not be a timeless classic with a timeless message if its made like a film from 50 or 60 years ago this film had zero intent on clueing the audience in on what it wants to say if the intent is to hunt these small cities on wheels and harvest their resources does that mean the people become slaves are they treated like the people from snowpiercer or soylen green is the disparity between the rich and poor if those distinctions still exist andor matter in this universe akin to the hunger games minus all the child murder if thats the case then there is a gem of a story there to be mined not as a future dystopia but as an alternate course that human history took in an alternate universe or a different timeline say in the steampunk universe this films concept feels more at home as an anime think howls moving castle better yet as an alternate storyline or continuation of that one story hugo weaving will always play a character who is either borderline evil or sympathetically evil though typecasted he gives this movie a sense of urgency or gravitas as he plays the villain the rest of the cast falls to the wayside with the usual hammy ya acting  love is tragic so lets kindamaybesorta hint at whether we are or arent in love or will or wont fck fathermother archetypes or adults are untrustworthy or dont understand whatevers going in your life are dead or died tragically or living and are essentially one plot twist away from being empire strikes backs i am your father bit or just have the characters rebel until they get their way then walk off into an even more uncertain future one thing is clear china has to be pleased as that is the only box office that matters this is the equivalent of the great wall movie from 2016 hope this does not get a sequel
Dec 13 2018,positive,i feel like the ratings are rigged from the start it hasnt even come out yet this looks hype and yet this comming friday their are only 2 times available at the local theater wtf 
Dec 12 2018,positive,as a fan of the books i loved it i loved seeing the world come to life all the details the cities and all that also some of my favorite characters ever on screen although there were some changes more than i thought thereï 12tmd be and hesterï 12tms scar wasnï 12tmt qhat we wanted it was enjoyable very enjoyable and thatï 12tms not something you usually hear from the fans of a book series when they adapted to film i think they could have worked on the script a little better like stick to the original lines at some point like the very end but i loved it  donï 12tmt listen to the critics theyï 12tmre paid to hate everything thatï 12tms literally their job go see it for yourself have fun at the movies and at least itï 12tmll hopefully make you read the books
Dec 12 2018,neutral,ok movie not really my cup of tea 
Dec 12 2018,positive,from the trailers it doesnt seem to be a great movie but once you see it youll understand when i say great movie definitely worth a trip to the theaters to see
Dec 12 2018,positive,a comprehensive graphical insight into a potential future for us but the plot was too predictable and weak
Dec 12 2018,positive,unique concept its perfectly executed with a beautiful landscape and the cast played very well if you really like fantasy movies then this one is perfect for you
Dec 12 2018,positive,i was pleasantly surprised upon seeing this film given the amount of critic hate a good steampunk outing i enjoyed the main protagonists and the cgi was stylish and convincing was hampered a bit by a forgettable score
Dec 12 2018,positive,brilliant movie i dont understand why its getting bad reviews i smell a conspiracy rotten tomatoes is a part of for it to be at 28 if every marvel movie can hit around or above 60 theres something seriously wrong here support this movie and small film makers obviously being hustled out of the industry by the frightened hollywood studios with more hush money than ideas if you need more convincing this movie is like mad max fury road v for vendetta avatar sky captain and the world of tomorrow waterworld all rolled into one movie it has deep messages that dont go the standard pro america way and i think this is where this movie is upsetting hollywood i am from this point forward taking all rotten tomatoes ratings as biased and not reflecting the quality but more the financial involvement of mass media control
Dec 12 2018,positive,critics miss the point again very good entertaining movie lots of action and great visuals if you like science fiction action you will enjoy this movie
Dec 12 2018,positive,is this movie really worth 5 stars no probably not but it get 5 stars for effort  and it really is a family fun adventure i was entertained i was not bored at any time and would happily watch another movie  ill say this i enjoyed this movie waaaay better than the so called family adventure star wars movie solo which i felt bored in and had to check my watch and my reaction was oh my god im only half way through this crap  i also think the timing of when this movie came out was very bad  it had to compete with the likes of acquaman bummble bee etc  i actually only watched 2 movies at christmas  mortal engine was one of them i loved the books this movie was based on and acquaman  i will happily buy mortal engine on dvd and i feel the urge to reread the books as well  honestly worth a watch of the movie and also worth a read of the books this movie is based on  enjoy
Dec 12 2018,positive,it was nice to finally see a movie in which both male and female lead had an equal opportunity to contribute to the plot in meaningful ways some of the characters from the novel were given more depth than in the source material which was a welcome addition sadly the movie didnt have the guts to follow through with the heartbreaking ending from the novel it was based on this by far was its weakest point what was its strongest one the design of all the engines moving cities and airships id say they were simply beautiful even grander than i imagined while reading the book
Dec 11 2018,positive,awesome funny how critics and disneys box office mojo all critics paid off lol heaven forbid something outside of hollywood gets bad ratings lol 
Dec 11 2018,positive,itï 12 12 12tms amazing
Dec 11 2018,negative,this movie is a mix of hunger games mad maxfury road and star wars in the worst way possible the movie was so overly dramatized with unnecessary character moments and pauses and it was way too overly predictable especially with the girls origin story like it just couldnt be anymore obviously too many subplots that just were stupid it was so bad that it just became too comical and nothing but a laughing stock i just couldnt stop laughing at how bad this movie is as they add in more dramatized music like adding more dramatized music made it even harder for me to keep a straight face add to the fact that a guy starts clapping in the theater and says wow this movie is terrible and a whole crowd starts laughing in agreement so happy that i didnt pay a single dime for this movie a movie that had potential in the beginning ended up being laughably terrible a 36 on rt is just way too generous more like 5
Dec 11 2018,positive,spectacular visuals its really something new not many steampunk got this kind of treatment storywise is not stellar but sufficient emotional highlight on shrike overall very enjoyable i would say a solid start which i hope can open a new franchise really hope they will continue with darkling plan
Dec 11 2018,positive,really enjoyed the film  two hours of escapism
Dec 11 2018,positive,critics need to get their heads out of their arses this movie was fantastic
Dec 11 2018,positive,as a fan of the books i really enjoyed the movie the filmmakers captured the essence of the first book very well notwithstanding a couple of plot changes which did not hurt the story the dystopian future world looked very much as i had envisioned it while reading the book and the moving city of london was quite amazing the only thing i found disappointing was hesters appearance i had envisioned her scar as being much more of a disfigurement otherwise i recommend it to fans of postapocalyptic storytelling especially if youve philip reeves series
Dec 11 2018,positive,ill say this and then ill leave rotten tomatoes forever when ultimate shit like aquaman gets 64 end of the year 2018 but a great fantasy movie like mortal engines only gets 28 rotten tomatoes cant be a valid indicator for me anymore so let it be average baboons
Dec 11 2018,negative, no thanks 
Dec 10 2018,negative,mortal engines is an incredibly bland ya film the cast is not that great hugo weaving is entertainingly over the top but the rest of the cast is just bland they are stilted no doubt helped by the fact that the script sucks the dialogue is very poor the action is standard for the genre some of the visuals were cool but that cannot save terrible characters and a boring story overall this is a pretty bad film the characters and the script were terrible some cool visuals cant help this film from being bad 
Dec 10 2018,positive,very good special effects  perhaps this could have been made in two parts as there is so much to focus on
Dec 10 2018,positive,sfx are top notch and spectacular story soso and dialogue a bit cringy at times enjoyed it for the spectacle but could have been so much better
Dec 9 2018,positive,i just saw it because i had been studying the score and it was a pretty good movie dont know why people were so down on it
Dec 9 2018,positive,such an amazing movie its great to see something original in cinemas 
Dec 9 2018,negative,great affects  but for a peter jackson i was disappointed the story lacked sole  wouldnt watch it again x
Dec 9 2018,negative,a lacklustre attempt to create a new franchise without any originality ambition or creativity that suffers from being relentlessly generic as it meanders slowly through an unrewarding undeveloped story 
Dec 9 2018,positive,i must say this was a much better movie than i expected it to be it gripped our whole family throughout the film even though the critics will probably spot lots of plot holes it doesnt matter as the film is entertaining and fun to watch without any danger of boredom
Dec 9 2018,negative,the script of this film  is a disaster or this film just for kids 
Dec 9 2018,positive,absolutely loved this film it did a great job of condensing the book and although a few of my favourite small moments from the book were cut the heart remained hester and shrike were given a good amount of depth but katherine was underserviced music visuals and sound design were excellent
Dec 9 2018,negative,okay that was not good lacked something overall lackluster tried to hit points from the novel but yeah a pale shadow of the source material please dont make a sequel
Dec 9 2018,positive,fans of the novels will love this visually stunning and a great romp
Dec 8 2018,negative,yet another movie based on a franchise thats almost a decade oldhmmm also im all for fantasy but i feel like theres a certain point that shouldnt be crossed without it looking stupid and lazy still looks interesting but i think ill pass
Dec 8 2018,negative,first look at the movie it bombarded me with many cgi effects and beauty of its own world that when the time for the characters to interact came i fell asleep on my seat just because of how boring and contrasting both of these elements are
Dec 8 2018,positive,brilliant world building story is a bit naff albeit faithful to the book  and actually better in one or two ways but ultimately i wont remember much about it six months from now
Dec 8 2018,negative,just seen this movie what a waist of time 
Dec 7 2018,neutral,okay so i saw this movie on a free pass before it was even released and let me tell you i couldnt make it 30 minutes sorry to say but i cant recommend that you see this movie its slow and boring go see into the spiderverse instead
Dec 7 2018,negative,wasted 2 hours of my precious time 
Dec 7 2018,positive,wow the spectacle and wonder was something i havent experienced in a while for an adventure film i will be going back to see this again
Dec 7 2018,positive,visually stunning and a very creative steampunk style world
Dec 7 2018,negative,probably one of the worst movies ive ever seen lazy story boring characters its like they had no personality at all id rather have remakes than a movie with no imagination this felt like post apocalyptic star wars without personality 110
Dec 7 2018,positive,worth a watch despite its rating
Dec 7 2018,positive,the family thought it was a key good story 
Dec 6 2018,positive,i went into mortal engines with high expectations on what i would see in terms of visual effects and needless to say i was not disappointed while the characters felt like they needed more time to properly develop and the romance between the main two protagonists felt a little rushed and forced the overall storyline and the stunning world building did not suffer as casualties of that honestly that world building was what i was wanting most out of the movie i left the theatre craving more i hope the movie gains enough traction pun intended to warrent a sequel as i can see another movie in this universe with a slightly different pacing and more focus on character development doing very well and lets be real i could easily watch predatory city chases on the big screen for days
Dec 6 2018,positive,i did not know about the book but it was very fresh story and ideas feels like watching star wars in a different settings i enjoy it a lot
Dec 6 2018,negative,horrible movie poor pacing stock characters messy story threads generic cgi action etc and a cameo from the minions from despicable me just to top it all off
Dec 5 2018,negative,just stupid incredibly stupid
Dec 5 2018,positive,loved it  hugo weaving was great as expected  some of the other actors didnt seem real  robert sheehan as tom was a very nice surprise  see it in imax if you can  i did and it was well worth it  one last thingif you like scifi and fantasy films then you probably will enjoy it
Dec 5 2018,negative,an oportunity passed in my opinion rushed through the story and not enough of the actual cities shown pitty
Dec 4 2018,negative,not a good movie pretty weak plot
Dec 4 2018,positive,enjoyable movie with a fresh and original look away from todays bombardment of superhero movies unfortunately the movie doesnt fill the experience entirely at the end you are left wanting more however the effects action and theme of the movie will keep you entertained enough 
Dec 3 2018,positive,one of the visually stunning films i have ever seen but drawback is predictable story and absolute zero chemistry between the leads but still hooked me till the last frame
Dec 2 2018,positive,im giving it a 5 because although i have no idea if its a faithful adaptation for all i know it could be a horrible one by the film itself i thoroughly enjoyed it yes it felt cheesy in parts but presentationwise i think its at least a heck of a lot better than ya films out there with similar themes i dont think its perfect but its definitely a lot better than the current average ratings comparing to other films nowadays
Dec 2 2018,negative,it seems like everything that peter jackson did right in the lord of the rings hes now doing the opposite each one of his films has fallen more and more since lotr such a shame 
Dec 2 2018,positive,keep the engine running
Dec 1 2018,negative,one of the biggest flops of all time is one of the worst movies ive ever seen what was this even about laughable effects and acting cant believe hugo weaving was involved this avoid at all costs 
Nov 30 2018,positive,ok i read all the bad reviews and i get some of the critiques but i mostly liked the film the world building was pretty fantastic a few holes and questions but overall it created something ive never seen before in the predator cities some folks have criticized the film because of elements we have seen before but its still a postapocalyptic film so of course there are also going to be scavengers limited resources and a wide divide between the haves and havenots the revenge plot was sufficient and did a nice job of teasing that narrative the biggest problem was the love story it was definitely too rushed for the storyline you knew it was coming but the story didnt develop it well enough for me that said the movie isnt about a love story or a revenge story its about creating a whole new world out of the old world its a struggle between the past and the future and what kind of people we want to be it succeeded on those fronts 
Nov 28 2018,positive,mortal engines not since 2015 has the postapocalypse looked this gritty and felt as nuanced as it does in mortal engines based on the novel by phillip reeve mortal engines is set in a dystopian future where the phrase meals on wheels conveys a whole new meaning as humanity has evolved to turn their ground based cities and civilizations into rumbling vehicular steampunk behemoths with a penchant for devouring other mechanical towns this movie combines some of my favorite aspects from modern scifi action into one flawed spectacle its basically star wars meets mad max with a touch of miyazaki and disneys treasure planet but with that description alone you cant go wrong by giving this movie at least the benefit of the doubt i havent had this much fun watching a ya adaptation since the hunger games ended this movie starts off with one of the most memorable opening action sequences of the year and the rest of the film for the most part follows through at a brisk pace until its jaw dropping climax during that time there is a lot of world building and exposition interspliced with thrilling action sequences that range from spectacular to noticeably cgi it does help that director christian rivers presents us with characters worth caring about no doubt with a little help from peter jackson speaking of the characters the acting is quite good all around i especially liked newcomer hera millars layered performance as the films heroine hester shaw i hope to see more of this unique actress in the future hugo weaving delivers quite a performance as the films main villain thaddeus valentine i found this character to be far more nuanced than he was in the book however as the film grows closer to its climax he begins to descend into typical mustachetwirling villainy which i would have had more of a problem with had it not been for weavings capability as an actor where this movie tends to falter is in the writing the overall world building is really fascinating and should even keep nonreaders engaged at whats going on however sometimes the dialogue and character actions feel ripped straight from other movies and tv shows with the same target audience rest assured this is a ya fantasy adaptation so expect to see a lot of moments where our two leads in this case robert sheehans tom natsworthy and hera millars hester shaw bicker with each other and then the next moment they are looking longingly in each others eyes its not entirely unexpected from the territory this movie is coming from and thankfully this film doesnt rely on moments like these just enough to get us to care about these characters and their overall journey i find it unfortunate that this movie is unlikely to make back its budget before the year is done i would very much like to see more of this world on film in the future all i can say is that you should go see this movie and support it its a fun film with a steampunk aesthetic that i think is missing from a lot of movies lately on top of that it is also an engaging ride with eyepopping visuals an engaging premise as well as story and characters and a damn good soundtrack to boot is mortal engines original no but is it a clever and enthralling take on a familiar concept a resounding yes b  out of 5
Nov 10 2018,negative,part lord of the rings part hunger games part star wars part harry potter but sadly all the bad parts and none of the good so long so slow so predictable and the most interesting character shrike is woefully underused theres an interesting idea in here somewhere but it just got lost in all the noise maybe the books are better
Nov 9 2018,negative,wowthis just looks beyond awful a true great american dumpster fire rt score dropping like a lead balloon what a pos
Nov 7 2018,negative,probably one of the worst movies ive ever seen lazy story boring characters its like they had no personality at all id rather have remakes than a movie with no imagination this felt like post apocalyptic rewrite of star wars without personality
Nov 6 2018,negative,boring and lifeless and bad 3d
Nov 2 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie but wasnt familiar with the novels so i didnt get the story as much
Oct 31 2018,positive,mortal engines is amazing ill give mortal engines two thumbs up way and ill give mortal engines their full budget
Oct 25 2018,positive,i enjoyed mortal engines sure its overstuffed with content and barely develops any of the characters besides its main protagonist but the production design and steampunk setting makes me want to watch sequels bigtime its so cool and interesting and i want more 
Oct 23 2018,positive,it was different something to think about 
Oct 22 2018,positive,very romantic  nice to see a new story line would definitely watch it a few more times 
Oct 14 2018,neutral,the film had far too many cliches it was trying far too hard to be a franchisable film i thought it had real potential as the concept is pretty cool but it didnt really meet the mark
Jul 18 2018,negative,i was desperate to like this had potential but too many missed opportunities and pointless plot twists to forgive 
Feb 5 2018,positive,i hope this movie is good peter jackson is back producing
Jan 9 2018,negative,the concept was good but the actual movie was kinda boring and not what i was hoping for the story was kinda blah so i wasnt impressed
